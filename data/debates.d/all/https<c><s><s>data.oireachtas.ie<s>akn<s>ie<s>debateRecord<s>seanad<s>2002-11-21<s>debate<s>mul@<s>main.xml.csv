#RoryKiely	unknown-#RoryKiely-party	unknown-#RoryKiely-dob	unknown-#RoryKiely-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-21 00:00:00	Prelude	0	I have received notice from Senator Finucane that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:The need for the Minister for Health and Children to clarify when a radiotherapy service will be provided at Limerick Regional Hospital and if he has received the expert review group report on cancer services.I have also received notice from Senator Leyden of the following matter:The need for the Minister for Health and Children to approve the contract submitted in June 2002 for refurbishment of St. Coman's Medical Ward at Roscommon County Hospital.I regard the matters raised by the Senators as suitable for discussion and they will be taken at the conclusion of business.
#MaryORourke	unknown-#MaryORourke-party	unknown-#MaryORourke-dob	unknown-#MaryORourke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-21 00:00:00	Prelude	1	The Order of Business today is No. 1, motion referring the subject matter of No. 6 on today's Order Paper to the Joint Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women's Rights, and providing for the joint committee to report back by 28 November 2002; No. 2, Fisheries (Amendment) Bill, 2002 – Order for Second Stage and Second Stage with the contributions of spokespersons not to exceed 15 minutes and those of all other Senators not to exceed ten minutes and on which Members may share time; No. 3, statements on the Book of Estimates, 2003, to be taken at 1.30 p.m. with the contributions of spokespersons not to exceed 15 minutes and those of all other Senators not to exceed ten minutes and on which Members may share time. It is hoped to conclude statements at 3.30 p.m.
#MichaelFinucane	unknown-#MichaelFinucane-party	unknown-#MichaelFinucane-dob	unknown-#MichaelFinucane-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-21 00:00:00	Prelude	2	I ask the Leader of the House to raise the following issues, as appropriate. In view of the proposed escalation of the postmasters union strike and the reduction of further services, the impact of which has already been felt in rural areas, will she ask the appropriate Minister to come into the House to give an overview of what is happening in An Post? It is creating an unnecessary divide between postmen and postmasters.Most Members have been elected by local authority representatives. While much of the debate is focused on the first-time buyer's grant, which the House debated yesterday, there are many elements of the Estimate which will impact on councils. I would like the Minister for the Environment and Local Government – no one else – to come and give us his analysis of the drastic reductions in many aspects of the Estimate. These reductions will create many problems for councils in the process of preparing estimates in the near future.
#JoeOToole	unknown-#JoeOToole-party	unknown-#JoeOToole-dob	unknown-#JoeOToole-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-21 00:00:00	Prelude	3	In regard to No. 1 and the Leader's reference that the joint committee must report back no later than 28 November 2002, is that how it is to be dealt with? Perhaps the Chair can give me some guidance on the matter. The device of assigning and referring motions to a joint committee was meant to be an efficient way of doing business. Traditionally, it has been done without debate. The understanding was that when a matter had been dealt with in committee it would report back and its report would then be open for discussion. I am not clear if this is a Standing Order device simply to say we have referred the matter, or does it mean it will come back for debate?
#RoryKiely	unknown-#RoryKiely-party	unknown-#RoryKiely-dob	unknown-#RoryKiely-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-21 00:00:00	Prelude	4	On a point of clarification, the joint committee will send a message to the House that it has completed its consideration of the motion. This will be announced in the House.
#JoeOToole	unknown-#JoeOToole-party	unknown-#JoeOToole-dob	unknown-#JoeOToole-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-21 00:00:00	Prelude	5	There is another issue the House should consider and on which I ask the Leader to arrange a debate. I am well aware the Government is at the stage of beginning to approve a Bill on the establishment of a police authority of some description in the South. Nonetheless, in the report of the Garda Complaints Board phrases such as members of the force were more loyal to each other than to the force were used. That is bad enough and can perhaps be dealt with down the line. However, it said that people who may be guilty or who were responsible for the law being broken would not be investigated.These are issues which cannot be allowed to lie because no new legislation will deal with them. I would like to know how the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform intends approaching that issue. I know he intends to bring in legislation to make people co-operate. However, it seems extraordinary that in the opinion of the Garda Complaints Board a wrong has been done somewhere along the way and nobody will be brought to justice on the issue. That is wrong and, if necessary, we should be brave enough to ask a group from outside of the Garda Síochána to carry out the investigation in such situations.
#BrendanRyan	unknown-#BrendanRyan-party	unknown-#BrendanRyan-dob	unknown-#BrendanRyan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-21 00:00:00	Prelude	6	On the Order of Business, can the Leader tell me when the Report Stage of the Digital Hub Development Agency Bill will be taken or is it still uncertain? It is ordered for next Tuesday, but I understand—
#MaryORourke	unknown-#MaryORourke-party	unknown-#MaryORourke-dob	unknown-#MaryORourke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-21 00:00:00	Prelude	7	I think it is next Tuesday.
#BrendanRyan	unknown-#BrendanRyan-party	unknown-#BrendanRyan-dob	unknown-#BrendanRyan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-21 00:00:00	Prelude	8	It is ordered for next Tuesday. That does not matter. The Leader can let me know some other time. An bhfuil aon scéal faoi Bhille na dteangacha oifigiúla atá ar an gclár le sé seachtain anois agus nár luadh fós? Tá an Bille um inimirce ar an gclár le tamall fada chomh maith agus gan aon dul chun cinn déanta air. An bhféadfadh an Ceannaire eolas a thabhairt don Teach mar gheall ar an dá rud sin?I asked in the past for a debate on standards in the building industry, particularly in house construction. There was considerable eloquence on both sides of the House, but particularly on the Government side, as to the nature of the building industry last night during the debate on the first-time buyer's grant, which I had not picked up before from that side of the House. In a climate where we have recognised that builders are inclined to rip people off, could we have a debate on standards in the building and house construction industry and some information on the Government's proposals to ensure minimum standards are observed, particularly in house construction?
#TerryLeyden	unknown-#TerryLeyden-party	unknown-#TerryLeyden-dob	unknown-#TerryLeyden-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-21 00:00:00	Prelude	9	I support Senator Finucane's call in relation to the current dispute in An Post. Will the Leader of the House arrange for the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, Deputy Dermot Ahern, to come before the House next week to explain this ongoing dispute which is causing untold damage to the postal service? The most damaging aspect is the division between the postmen and women and the Irish Postmasters Union. Postmen are being allowed to sort letters at home and there has been a delay in the delivery of post. This is putting An Post in jeopardy.
#RoryKiely	unknown-#RoryKiely-party	unknown-#RoryKiely-dob	unknown-#RoryKiely-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-21 00:00:00	Prelude	10	Would the Senator get to the point?
#TerryLeyden	unknown-#TerryLeyden-party	unknown-#TerryLeyden-dob	unknown-#TerryLeyden-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-21 00:00:00	Prelude	11	I am aware that Mr. Philip Flynn will be arbitrating in this dispute. However, I call on the Minister to outline to the House next week what the situation is and to try to resolve it before it escalates into a strike affecting the Christmas mail, which would be a disaster.
#JimHiggins	unknown-#JimHiggins-party	unknown-#JimHiggins-dob	unknown-#JimHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-21 00:00:00	Prelude	12	I support Senators Finucane and Leyden. It would be a disaster if we did not get our Christmas cards out.I wish to raise two important matters. Last Tuesday, the McBrearty family walked out of the Morris tribunal because of a refusal to change its terms of reference. Yesterday in the Dáil, in reply to a question from the Leader of the Fine Gael Party, the Taoiseach said that the House would be open to changing the terms of reference provided a request came from the tribunal. The tribunal, on the other hand, says it is open to changing its terms of reference provided a request comes from the Oireachtas. There is a game of ping-pong going on that needs to be resolved. We need to debate in this House as a matter of urgency who exactly is responsible for changing the terms of reference and to do so, because a tribunal without the McBrearty family would be the equivalent of Hamlet without the prince. We do not have a tribunal if we do not have the McBrearty family there.The second issue we need to debate relates to a request from Amnesty International to the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to carry out a study on the degree of racism, if any, within Irish prisons, which has been turned down by the Minister. That puts us firmly in the company of China, Russia, Egypt and Israel. The United Kingdom and the United States have agreed. About 11 other civilised democracies have agreed to allow such a study. As a country which preaches human rights so eloquently, we need to know, as a matter of urgency, the logic of the Minister's response to Amnesty International, and we need a debate in this House.
#DrMauriceHayes	unknown-#DrMauriceHayes-party	unknown-#DrMauriceHayes-dob	unknown-#DrMauriceHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-21 00:00:00	Prelude	13	I thank Members for their good wishes yesterday in relation to the Forum for Peace and Reconciliation. If there is a Seanad tee-shirt I would be glad to wear it.I have some sympathy with the point made by Senator O'Toole in relation to the Garda Complaints Board. It is shameful that any group of people who set out to encourage other people to report breaches of the law would remain silent when they see some of their colleagues breaking the law. If it happened in Northern Ireland there would be a queue from here to Strasbourg in an effort to have the matter brought before the European Court.On a more serious point, could the Leader of the House ask the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform whether he would, at his convenience, come to House to discuss the proposals for the Garda complaints mechanism? I view this as a means of improving the methodology of the House as well. It would be helpful if some means could be found for us to have a discussion with the Minister at the formative stage of the preparation of legislation rather than having to deal with it as a Bill when it is rather hard to change. It would be preferable if we were able to do that on the basis of some sort of statement here rather than having to read about it in newspapers, although I am not against people reading newspapers.
#KathleenOMeara	unknown-#KathleenOMeara-party	unknown-#KathleenOMeara-dob	unknown-#KathleenOMeara-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-21 00:00:00	Prelude	14	I support the request of Senator Maurice Hayes in relation to the legislation on Garda reform. He echoes the point I raised yesterday on the Order of Business. I would remind the Leader of the House that when the freedom of information legislation was being published it came to the Seanad for discussion purely on the heads of the Bill and on the principles contained in the legislation because the Minister of the day wanted to hear the views of the Seanad before the final legislation was drafted. There is, therefore, a model and a precedent for involving the Upper House in the preparation of legislation. It is a suggestion well worth pursuing and to which I imagine the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform would be open.In light of last week's Supreme Court decision when a woman took a case against Dr. Neary of Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital, and considering the number of cases being pursued – and a number of cases which it may not be possible to pursue – and also the seriousness of the matter, I asks the Leader to ask the Government whether there are plans to establish a compensation tribunal and to report back to the House. The Stardust compensation tribunal would be a perfect model. This is a very serious issue on which I hope the Leader will be able to respond.
#PaulCoghlan	unknown-#PaulCoghlan-party	unknown-#PaulCoghlan-dob	unknown-#PaulCoghlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-21 00:00:00	Prelude	15	Members will have seen on page 3—

#RoryKiely	unknown-#RoryKiely-party	unknown-#RoryKiely-dob	unknown-#RoryKiely-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-21 00:00:00	Prelude	17	What do you wish to raise?
#PaulCoghlan	unknown-#PaulCoghlan-party	unknown-#PaulCoghlan-dob	unknown-#PaulCoghlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-21 00:00:00	Prelude	18	The Minister for Transport, Deputy Brennan, would be better off if he would guard against this type of grotesque advertising and spend the money on accident black spots and poor roads, which would have a more immediate impact on saving lives.The Leader recently responded to us briefly when we raised the Government's proposals regarding gateway towns and development hubs.
#MaryORourke	unknown-#MaryORourke-party	unknown-#MaryORourke-dob	unknown-#MaryORourke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-21 00:00:00	Prelude	19	The spatial plan.
#PaulCoghlan	unknown-#PaulCoghlan-party	unknown-#PaulCoghlan-dob	unknown-#PaulCoghlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-21 00:00:00	Prelude	20	Exactly. It is something which the Leader knew a lot about in her former position. She seems to indicate that the leaks were broadly correct – perhaps I have misunderstood her response. It would be nice if we could have a definitive Government overview. The Leader should arrange to have the Minister come to the House to spell this out because it is very uneven.I fully support Senator Higgins in his call regarding the Morris tribunal. As I understand it, the precedent is well established that the judge—
#RoryKiely	unknown-#RoryKiely-party	unknown-#RoryKiely-dob	unknown-#RoryKiely-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-21 00:00:00	Prelude	21	As I understand it, the Senator is supporting the call.
#PaulCoghlan	unknown-#PaulCoghlan-party	unknown-#PaulCoghlan-dob	unknown-#PaulCoghlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-21 00:00:00	Prelude	22	I very much support what Senator Higgins has said. I hope that it will happen sooner rather than later.
#JamesBannon	unknown-#JamesBannon-party	unknown-#JamesBannon-dob	unknown-#JamesBannon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-21 00:00:00	Prelude	23	The availability of good quality water supplies is essential in any society and is fundamental to the maintenance of public health. There has been a scare in County Wicklow with regard to the level of uranium in the public water supply and some 13 other counties are also at risk. It is important that we have a debate on this issue to allay public fears. The Environmental Protection Agency discovered that 13 other counties were at high risk, which is half the counties in the State. The World Health Organisation discovered uranium levels 65 times above its limits in samples from County Wicklow.
#DavidNorris	unknown-#DavidNorris-party	unknown-#DavidNorris-dob	unknown-#DavidNorris-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-21 00:00:00	Prelude	24	Considering the current unrest among taxi personnel, the fact that 1,500 taxi drivers have criminal convictions and one has 30 criminal convictions, repeated complaints – especially from women – the fact that this is very unfair to decent taxi people, the fact that Garda consistently object to taxi licences and then see District Courts arbitrarily overturn decisions, the fact that District Courts consistently give licences to pubs that should not have them, and to gaming dens and lap-dancing clubs, will the Leader of the House suggest to Government that there be an independent inquiry into the operation of the District Courts, especially since we have Ms Nell McCafferty writing—
#RoryKiely	unknown-#RoryKiely-party	unknown-#RoryKiely-dob	unknown-#RoryKiely-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-21 00:00:00	Prelude	25	Is the Senator looking for a debate? We are not discussing decisions of District Courts.
#DavidNorris	unknown-#DavidNorris-party	unknown-#DavidNorris-dob	unknown-#DavidNorris-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-21 00:00:00	Prelude	26	I understand your wise ruling, a Chathaoirligh. That is why I am asking the Leader to take this matter directly to Government to ask for an independent investigation into the disgraceful operation of the District Courts.On a more positive note, in the light of what I said yesterday about the room downstairs, the Superintendent of the Houses very graciously met with me. He explained the situation in a most courteous manner and I am grateful to him. I discussed it with my representative, Senator O'Toole.
#MaryORourke	unknown-#MaryORourke-party	unknown-#MaryORourke-dob	unknown-#MaryORourke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-21 00:00:00	Prelude	27	The shop steward.

#JoeOToole	unknown-#JoeOToole-party	unknown-#JoeOToole-dob	unknown-#JoeOToole-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-21 00:00:00	Prelude	29	I certainly will.
#RoryKiely	unknown-#RoryKiely-party	unknown-#RoryKiely-dob	unknown-#RoryKiely-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-21 00:00:00	Prelude	30	Thank you, Senator Norris. I ask that the Senator respect the separation of powers in his contributions.
#FeargalBrowne	unknown-#FeargalBrowne-party	unknown-#FeargalBrowne-dob	unknown-#FeargalBrowne-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-21 00:00:00	Prelude	31	I welcome the decision by the Minister for Transport regarding the appointment of a national regulator of the taxi industry. Deregulation was a good idea in concept but did not work in practice. As Senator Norris pointed out, it has led to a situation where 1,500 current taxi drivers have a criminal record. The decision by the Minister is welcome but the matter should be debated properly in the House before he rushes into it. He plans to appoint the regulator in February and it would be beneficial if that were debated. Deregulation was rushed into by the last Government and we have paid a price for that.It is a disgrace that taxi drivers are planning a dispute today despite meeting the Minister at 10.30 a.m. Considering the discomfort and chaos the citizens of Dublin suffered last week during the floods, the House should condemn taxi drivers for their action.
#RoryKiely	unknown-#RoryKiely-party	unknown-#RoryKiely-dob	unknown-#RoryKiely-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-21 00:00:00	Prelude	32	We cannot discuss such activities.
#DavidNorris	unknown-#DavidNorris-party	unknown-#DavidNorris-dob	unknown-#DavidNorris-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-21 00:00:00	Prelude	33	The House should condemn the District Courts.

#JoannaTuffy	unknown-#JoannaTuffy-party	unknown-#JoannaTuffy-dob	unknown-#JoannaTuffy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-21 00:00:00	Prelude	35	I support the call by Senator Finucane for the Leader to invite the Minister for the Environment and Local Government to the House to discuss how cutbacks will affect local authority budgets next year, and how the consequences of that may include increases in the unfair double tax of waste charges and less accountability of local public services.
#PaddyBurke	unknown-#PaddyBurke-party	unknown-#PaddyBurke-dob	unknown-#PaddyBurke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-21 00:00:00	Prelude	36	I support Senator Higgins in his call for the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to state why he has refused a request by Amnesty International to inspect prisons.Considering the 70% cut in funding to the western investment fund, I call on the Leader to arrange an immediate debate on the BMW region.
#TimDooley	unknown-#TimDooley-party	unknown-#TimDooley-dob	unknown-#TimDooley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-21 00:00:00	Prelude	37	I join Senator Burke in calling for a debate on the cut in funding to the western development region. Some interesting facts would come out of such a debate which might surprise many Members of the House.
#MaryORourke	unknown-#MaryORourke-party	unknown-#MaryORourke-dob	unknown-#MaryORourke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-21 00:00:00	Prelude	38	Senator Finucane referred to the postal dispute and today's vote. I agree that the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources should come to the House to discuss the matter. Senator Leyden also referred to this matter and, leaving aside the issue of Christmas cards, there is huge disruption to postal deliveries, particularly in rural Ireland. It is often the case that something that happens in Dublin is top news but if it happens in the country it is relegated to page nine. I do not hold anything against Dublin people but it is a serious matter.Senator Finucane also wanted the Minister for the Environment and Local Government to come to the House to discuss the Estimates and their implication for local authorities. I will be glad to ask the Minister and will see if he can come next week.Senator O'Toole asked when the framework directive on child pornography will go to committee. The Cathaoirleach kindly told the House that it comes back via a message from the committee to both Dáil and Seanad. The Senator also asked about the Garda Complaints Board. I expect that was with regard to the debate on "Morning Ireland" some days ago in which board chairman, Mr. Gordon Holmes, spoke on the recent report and there was a counter-argument by a Garda representative – I think it was Mr. P. J. Stone. As I understand the argument that developed, Mr. Stone said that the report had not yet been published and he alleged that it was wrong of the chairman to make policy statements. I also want to know where the report is and believe it will follow shortly.Senator Ryan asked about the Digital Hub Development Agency Bill, 2002. It is down for Tuesday but I think it will be taken on Wednesday. That can be changed today. The Senator also asked about the Official Languages (Equality) Bill, 2002. There is constant telephone communication with the Department about that Bill. The Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs is having great difficulty with various amendments to it but is trying valiantly to bring it to the House.Senator Ryan called for a debate on standards in the building industry. That would tie in with the earlier call to have the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Cullen, come to the House on other matters.Senator Jim Higgins spoke about An Post and also the McBrearty family. I listened to the Taoiseach yesterday when he gave the clear impression that a message was awaited from Mr. Justice Morris, and that there would be an appropriate response when he sent that message. Senator Higgins claims Mr. Justice Morris has said that he is awaiting a message from the Oireachtas. The Taoiseach was definite yesterday and made an open call to the judge to express his opinion on the matter. We must watch that to see what develops.I will write to the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy McDowell, about the fact highlighted by Senator Higgins that we have refused Amnesty International access to our prisons to report on racism there.I thank Senator Maurice Hayes for his comments. He asked whether the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform would discuss with the House the formulation of his legislation for a Garda complaints mechanism, a query also raised by Senator O'Meara. She cited the case of the former Minister of State, Eithne Fitzgerald, although she did not name her, who came to the House with the heads of the Freedom of Information Bill to obtain the views of Senators. I am in favour of the Freedom of Information Act, but it does not appear to have benefited ordinary people. I thought the ordinary man or woman in the street would use it to find out about matters important to him or her. It does not appear to have worked out the way Eithne Fitzgerald anticipated.Senator O'Meara also asked about the surgeon, Dr. Neary, who some women believe removed their wombs without their consent and at too early a stage in their lives. I understand the Medical Council is conducting an inquiry into Dr. Neary's practice and methods. I hope that will be concluded soon. The Senator asked if a compensation tribunal would be established for these women. I do not know what the Minister for Health and Children intends but I will take up the matter. What happened to many of those women was very sad.Senator Coghlan asked about the spatial plan and if the leaks were correct. They are.

#MaryORourke	unknown-#MaryORourke-party	unknown-#MaryORourke-dob	unknown-#MaryORourke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-21 00:00:00	Prelude	40	The report has not been issued. As soon as it is published, we will have a debate on it.Senator Bannon raised the issue of water supply. While there was confirmation of excess uranium in the water supply in Wicklow, the other counties to which he referred are being investigated and have not yet been confirmed as having an excess of uranium or other harmful contents in their water supplies. It is a matter which should be debated but it will probably be part of an overall debate on the environment which will cover all the issues raised.Senator Norris raised the matter of taxi drivers and the action being taken by them, an issue also raised by Senator Browne. I am not in a position to comment on the actions of the District Court in this regard. Senator Browne also welcomed the statement on the taxi regulator. I do not know if legislation will be necessary to introduce it, but it was necessary for other industries. I will inquire, but I imagine there would be a need for either regulations or legislation.Senator Tuffy raised the issue of the Estimates and the effects they will have on local authorities. I regret and apologise that I did not reply to the point made yesterday by Senator Paddy Burke.
#PaddyBurke	unknown-#PaddyBurke-party	unknown-#PaddyBurke-dob	unknown-#PaddyBurke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-21 00:00:00	Prelude	41	I thought the reason was the Leader's reluctance to comment on the serious cutbacks.
#MaryORourke	unknown-#MaryORourke-party	unknown-#MaryORourke-dob	unknown-#MaryORourke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-21 00:00:00	Prelude	42	No, it was because I forgot about it. I apologise for it. Like Senator Higgins, Senator Burke raised the issue of the refusal of Amnesty International's request to investigate racism in our prisons. We must have that clarified.Senator Burke asked for a debate on the Border, midlands and western region, a point also made by Senator Dooley who appeared to indicate that he had important news in this regard. We should have a debate on the matter but perhaps it should be included in an overall debate with the Minister for the Environment and Local Government.

It provides for the establishment of an independent statutory appeals process for sea-fishing boat licensing to give effect to a commitment in the programme for Government. Part 2 and Schedule 1 contain the detailed provisions in the matter.It enables Ireland to give effect to the 1995 United Nations agreement concerning the conservation and management of straddling and highly migratory fish stocks, which are generally in the high seas, are vulnerable to over-fishing and require concerted international efforts to protect them properly. Part 3 contains the detailed implementation provisions required. For ease of reference Schedule 2 sets out the text of the agreement and Schedule 3 lists the highly migratory fish species requiring protection.The opportunity is being taken to strengthen some existing sea fisheries enforcement legislation, notably by including additional Naval Service ranks, from sergeant and petty officer down to and including corporal and leading rating, and Air Corps ranks down to and including the rank of corporal, among sea fisheries protection officers in the interests of greater efficiency and effectiveness of enforcement effort – this is dealt with in section 21(1) – and increasing out-of-date penalties for certain serious offences, which is dealt with in sections 24 and 25.Other penalties will be comprehensively reviewed early next year in the Sea Fisheries (Consolidation) Bill which is being prepared to consolidate and update in a convenient accessible form sea fisheries legislation spread over many Acts starting with the Fisheries (Consolidation) Act, 1959, which has been amended many times.I draw attention to the detailed explanatory and financial memorandum published with the Bill, especially the appendix to the memorandum which sets out in a convenient consolidated form the current legislation for sea-fishing boat licensing. I will now deal with the background to the Bill and related policy issues.The programme for Government contains a commitment to establish an independent appeals process for sea-fishing boat licensing. An interim non-statutory appeals process is being established with effect from 25 November by the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, and those arrangements will be superseded in due course by the comprehensive statutory appeals process provided for in the Bill when enacted.In essence, the non-statutory appeals arrangements will allow appeals, made by licence applicants against proposed licensing decisions notified on or after 25 November 2002, to be considered by an independent lawyer nominated by the Attorney General. Details of how to make an appeal will be notified to licence applicants with each proposed decision. If the licence applicant confirms in writing that he or she does not wish to appeal, or if no appeal is made within one month after such notification, the proposed decision will automatically become final. If an appeal is made within one month after such notification, the licensing authority will have regard to the outcome of the appeals process when making a final decision on the application in question, in accordance with the law as it stands.Under Part 2 of the Bill, when enacted, applicants for sea-fishing boat licences, licensees and third parties will be entitled to appeal licensing decisions and the final decision on such licensing will be made by the independent appeals officer, who will be a suitably qualified and experienced lawyer with a minimum of five years practice. He or she will determine the appeal, subject only to determination being in conformity with the law then in force, including the legal obligations of the State arising under any EU or other international instruments; such policy directives in relation to sea-fishing boat licensing as the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources may give in writing from time to time – the Minister cannot intervene in any particular appeals case as section 3(4) specifically provides; and judicial review by the High Court if application is made thereto within three months after that determination is made in accordance with section 14 of Bill.As part and parcel of the transparent independent statutory appeals process being provided in Part 2 of the Bill for sea-fishing boat licensing applications made to the licensing authority for sea-fishing boat licences from the operative date, decisions on those applications by the licensing authority, appeals duly made against those decisions to the appeals officer, and decisions by the appeals officer on those appeals, and an explanation of those decisions, will all be publicly available electronically to the public, on an appropriate website.The current programme for Government also promised a fundamental review of sea-fishing boat licensing policy which has been under way for some months. The review group's remit extends to a review of the current licensing law referred to. The review group, comprising experts from the Department, the Office of the Attorney General, Bord Iascaigh Mhara, the Marine Institute and the sea-fishing industry, aims to report to the Minister early next year. A key factor concerning the group's deliberations and the basis of its report will be the outcome of the renegotiation of the EU Common Fisheries Policy, now at a crucial stage. I am sure all Senators will join with me in supporting the Minister in his difficult task to achieve a proper outcome for Ireland.The review group has already made an interim recommendation to the Minister which he accepted, namely, that polyvalent fishing boats which do not fish for herring and or mackerel in 2002, principally for stock conservation reasons, will not be considered to have broken their required "active pelagic" track record of at least 16 weeks in each of four successive years. The review group will examine the "active pelagic" requirement, along with all other pelagic related issues and will revert to the Minister with its considered recommendations in due course. The review group may decide to report earlier on further separate issues on which it may consider that urgent decisions are required of the Minister.The modalities for detailed implementation of the United Nations agreement referred to are a matter for the party states and other parties to the agreement to decide from time to time, in light of conservation and management imperatives and best use of available surveillance and enforcement resources. Concerted international action in implementing the agreement should serve as a strong deterrent to over-fishing and so help minimise enforcement costs for Ireland. Enactment of this Bill is a prerequisite to enabling Ireland to ratify the agreement and become a party state thereto.The EU is anxious to secure complete ratification of the agreement by the EU and all 15 member states en bloc as early as possible so as to signal its commitment to sustainable fishing on the high seas and elsewhere. It has requested Ireland to make the necessary arrangements to progress the legislation and other measures required to enable it to ratify the agreement. The Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources has advised EU Commissioner Fischler of his intention to seek the assistance of this House and Dáil Éireann for enactment of the necessary legislation in 2002. Only two other EU member states, apart from Ireland, now have to complete the necessary steps for ratification of the agreement and they are expected to do so shortly. We are therefore most grateful to this House for agreeing to early consideration of the Bill.In the expectation of early enactment of the Bill, it is proposed to amend section 1(3) of the Bill on Committee Stage, to dispense with the need for the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources to commence provisions of the Bill by order or orders. Thus, the provisions of the Bill would be automatically operable immediately on its enactment, that is, on its signature into law by the President after being passed by this House and Dáil Éireann, without the need for any commencement order to be made by the Minister.
#MichaelFinucane	unknown-#MichaelFinucane-party	unknown-#MichaelFinucane-dob	unknown-#MichaelFinucane-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-21 00:00:00	Prelude	50	I welcome this Bill which has had a long gestation. Some years ago I asked the Minister in the Dáil to introduce a system of this nature in the interests of openness and transparency. For many years there have been question marks with regard to the dispensing of licences. We remember from the past a situation where some were classified as "Dingle licences" as a result of a previous Taoiseach, Mr. C.J. Haughey, dispensing licences to people around Dingle. It took a few years for that situation to be resolved and for further areas where these people could fish to be opened up. I welcome this being taken from the hands of the Department and politicians and the setting up of this independent appeals type system.The Minister's visit to the House is timely. Yesterday many of us participated in an interesting discussion with the various fishing organisations and Bord Iascaigh Mhara. We discussed in particular the implications of the forthcoming review of the Common Fisheries Policy and the December discussions. December is the traditional time of the year for our almost ritual annual review. Ministers go to Brussels, declining fish stocks are flagged in advance, cuts in projected allowances are magnified and then the Ministers return and claim a victory because things are not as bad as anticipated. This happens every year.There has been no coherent strategy with regard to long-term use of this resource. An example I gave yesterday illustrates this. In the previous medium term and common fisheries review, under the able stewardship of Dr. Whitaker, he maintained that the greatest problem for the fishing industry was the high level of discards or juvenile fish caught. He made that statement in 1991, yet ten years later we heard at the discussion yesterday that the level of discards is as high as 70%. On the other hand we have all the leading scientific experts say that fish stocks are declining on an ongoing basis and that there is a lack of conservation.I applaud Ireland's limited attempts at conservation to preserve our fishing stocks. Our greatest difficulty is that there is a lack of uniformity in conservation at EU level. Although we have 18% of the territorial waters we have only a small percentage of the overall fish catch in contrast to some of our European neighbours, Spain in particular. In the context of the forthcoming talks I am concerned that pressure will be exerted, particularly by other countries, to retain quotas despite declining stocks.A further worry arises now in the context of the Prestige which has gone down off the coast of Spain. Television reports have informed us that fish stocks and the shellfish industry will be decimated in the area. In that context I am sure that in December the Spanish will make impassioned pleas, not alone to retain their quotas but to extend them. That means we will have an extra difficult fight on our hands. I wish the Minister well, as always, when he goes into these talks.I was surprised to hear yesterday that about 40% of the Irish fleet has been targeted to be taken out of circulation, although there seems to be no definitive information to prove it. If that is true, the Minister need not worry about any vessel licensing because the fleet would be totally depleted. I assume that is an exaggeration, but it is likely that Ireland along with its other European Union counterparts will be asked to reduce its fleet. Where is the coherent strategy for the fishing industry? We appear to have an ad hoc approach. A person has specifically said that 40% of the Irish fleet are targeted. However, a few years ago the then Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources, Deputy Woods, had a defined brief, confined exclusively to the marine and natural resources. Over a period of years there were progressive improvements in the white fish fishing fleet. Every week there seemed to be launches of vessels in Killybegs, Dingle or Galway. At that time we were upgrading our fishing vessels, which was most desirable and the then Minister, Deputy Woods, rightly got considerable kudos from the fishing industry. The Marine Times, which is circulated out of Killybegs, called him “our hero”. This emphasises my point about the lack of a coherent policy. Having upgraded our fishing vessels with the support of European funding, we are now talking about reducing by 40%. It does not make sense.I wonder how serious we are about conservation. The most vital area around the Irish coastline for Irish fisherman is the one classified as Area 7. Some 91% of our naval vessel activity is confined to that area. Following inspections, how often have we seen Irish fishermen brought ashore and treated almost as criminals? Yet over many years there has been an abuse of European Union fishing policy which has been tolerated. I am talking about the ships sailing under flags of different countries. Because of the high quota levels given to France, people from Spain are buying French vessels and fish under the French flag in order to absorb that quota, but in reality they are Spanish vessels. According to European Union legislation, this issue cannot be confronted.Much of yesterday's debate focused on the threat to the Irish Box, which is an important area about 50 miles off our coastline that is vital to Ireland. It is also vital to conservation because it is a very effective spawning ground. The fears are justified. The Minister has legal advice indicating the Spanish and Portuguese, despite what was agreed on their accession, do not have automatic rights to this fishing ground in 2003. That is likely to be hotly disputed by the Spanish and Portuguese. Some 40 Spanish vessels along with Irish and British vessels already have access to the Irish Box. If that is opened up extensively, there will be a rape of the Irish fishery just as happened off the African coast where there has been irresponsible fishing by many countries with minimal compensation to African states resulting in the elimination of fish life from those areas. Where there is a threatened species and a high number of vessels, inevitably the fish stocks will decline.A Chathaoirligh, you and I along with others had a very interesting trip some time ago in another capacity to Norway. Both of us were impressed by the commitment shown there to the fishing industry. Norway stayed out of the European Union because of its sovereignty. It also wanted to protect its fishing rights and its oil and gas gave it the financial independence that allowed it to stay out. That country's attempts at conservation are impressive.At European Union level, we only pay lip service to the idea of conservation. If we tolerate a level of discard of 70% that is tangible proof that we merely pay lip service. Why do we not confront the issue by changing mesh sizes or carrying out trials to ensure that what are classified as juvenile fish are not caught in the nets? In many cases, ghost nets are set out over nearly 100 miles and left there. Fishermen later come along and claim whatever is in those nets. What hope do we have if those activities continue? Is it any wonder our fishing vessels are pressured into fishing further away for what are classed as deep sea fish, which are not well known to the Irish consumer, such as orange roughy, scabbard and grenadier, but are now being tried in Irish restaurants. That is the type of pressure our fishing fleet is experiencing.The ports out of which our fishing fleet operates, places like Killybegs, Castletownbere, Dingle or villages in Galway, are areas with high levels of unemployment and in many cases would be classified as economically disadvantaged. The fishing and related industries form a vital component of the economy of those areas. We must express concerns in the context of the common fisheries talks that will take place in December. The Minister has a major challenge. When he left our meeting last night he was going to Norway. While he is there, I hope he will look at what they do in the research centre at Bergen and look that country's attitude to conservation. Maybe we in the European Union can learn from that.I do not decry the inspection role of the Naval Service. However if 91% of its activity is confined to Area 7 of the south coast and Haulbowline is on that coast, could it not extend its remit further out in order to board many more vessels and ensure illegal fishing is not happening? There are six fisheries inspectors based in Castletownbere. Although I stand to be corrected on this, in Spain there are ten fisheries inspectors based in Madrid. Fishing is vital to the Spanish coastline and everybody is involved. I am sure a blind eye is often turned to what is happening. Undersized fish are landed at fishing ports on a regular basis along with ordinary sized fish. Some undersize fish are regarded as a delicacy in Spain. Why are there not more inspectors to give a level playing pitch? If we are extra vigilant in this country with small resources, why is the same not true in Spain where fishing is an important component of its economy, which it guards and protects?It is a small element to our overall economy but it is vital to the areas I mentioned and has a right to the same kind of protection. I would like to know the level to which the inspectoral system operates in other countries. Is it fair that France has such an artificially high level of quotas for different fish species, which the French never catch? Is it fair for them to preserve those fish quotas when it comes to subsequent talks? They then trade them off to other countries when they cannot absorb their own fish.I wish the Minister of State luck in December. We must not be blinded by the issue of the Irish Box. It is important, but we must not merely conclude the meeting by declaring a triumph in retaining it. There are other important results the Minister of State must achieve at the talks regarding our total tonnage capacity and the preservation of quotas. I will watch closely to see what happens.
#BrendanKenneally	unknown-#BrendanKenneally-party	unknown-#BrendanKenneally-dob	unknown-#BrendanKenneally-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-21 00:00:00	Prelude	51	I welcome my good friend and colleague from the south east, Deputy John Browne, Minister of State at the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, to the Seanad as well as the introduction of this Bill which is timely. I look forward to a constructive debate on the measures proposed.This Bill is intended to give statutory effect to the implementation of the provisions of the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea relating to conservation and management matters. Most of my contribution will be in relation to conservation measures, particularly in the light of recent proposals to eliminate the 50 mile box, which is so important to Irish fisheries.The new appeal procedures in relation to the issuing of sea fishing boat licences are an area in which I have some experience and expertise having been a witness in a High Court case concerning the issuing of such a licence. At best, the Department's handling of the issuing of licences in the past has been haphazard with no consistency visible in what they it previously. I particularly welcome section 3 and subsequent sections which provide for the appointment of an independent appeals officer to review decisions made by the Department. Unfortunately, this will arrive too late for some.It seems that certain areas have been treated better and more generously than others in the issuing of licences. Unfortunately, the fishing ports in County Waterford were not beneficiaries. At one stage licences were issued with the promise of extra tonnage replacement which was never given. This is where tonnage is taken out of the fleet in order to provide for a new boat, but, unfortunately, commitments given and promises made were never delivered upon. I am particularly pleased with the appeals provisions for refusals, but is a third party appeal mechanism provided for? I am thinking particularly of a person who is a multiple licence holder and applies for and gets a further licence at the expense of the small operator. It is only right that that individual should have the right of appeal against what would be properly perceived as an injustice. This could easily happen in a case where perhaps a quota of 50 tonnes would be available, which could not sustain an individual in full-time employment and would be passed on to a current licence holder. It could, however, be the start of a livelihood for a potential fisherman or a member of the next generation who might like to follow in a parent's footsteps. The appeals procedure could be of major benefit if it is properly provided for and operated judiciously when introduced. I hope it will be transparent and that any decisions made by the new appeals officer will be explained to all.Conservation of fish stocks is particularly relevant. My knowledge is based on my experience of talking to fishermen in the south east in general and the port of Dunmore East in particular. This is also relevant to the rest of the coastal fisheries. I carried out research in the run-up to the introduction of this measure and have spoken to fishermen about it. I was pleasantly surprised at their very positive views on conservation. They have taken the view that the fishermen of today have to provide for the fishermen of tomorrow, many of whom will be members of their own families. If we do not conserve stocks, they say, their sons and daughters cannot have a future on the sea. This is a healthy attitude and perhaps a change of thinking on the subject in respect of at least some. I hope that, when it comes to the application of any new conservation measures introduced, they will be applied fairly and equitably across the board. International co-operation is also vital because Ireland cannot implement a realistic programme of conservation in isolation. That co-operation and realism do not appear to be widespread in Europe and the policing of our waters leaves a lot to be desired.This is not intended to be a reflection on the Naval Service which is doing a fine job with the resources and ships it has available. The problem lies more in our failure to implement a proper recording system for catches – one which will bear scrutiny and audit – because the present system is scrappy, haphazard and wide open to abuse. If we knew what was landed at every port and the whole procedure was above board and properly regulated, everything would be fine, but it is not. The truth is that no one knows who is catching what species, in what amounts and where it is being landed. This is as a result of a failure on our part to properly resource the inspectorate and have it available at the proper times and places.I have no difficulty in our implementing the law and suitably punishing those who transgress, but that will happen in isolation. Other countries will not be as committed to conservation, nor will they implement it with the same vigour as Ireland. This is not a situation which arose yesterday or last week – for decades we have seen fishermen from other European countries openly flout the law by fishing where they should not, catching prohibited species and invariably exceeding their quotas. Do these Europeans know what a quota is or if it exists at all? Anyone involved in the business knows that boats are landing illegally sized fish in Spanish ports, to which a blind eye is being turned.Does the Minister of State know what the proposals are in regard to the 50 mile box? Will it apply to the whole of our coast or just part of it? It has been suggested to me that foreign boats should have to stay west of the 8º longitude line. If the entire fishery is opened up, particularly to the Spaniards – who seem to be the villains of the piece – then we can forget about conservation. There does not seem to be a word equivalent to "conservation" in the Spanish dictionary. Our waters could be fished out within a year, in the same way the waters around Morocco and Mauritania and other parts of North Africa were. As they cannot fish in the North Sea or the English Channel, where else are they to go other than to Irish waters? Even if we do open up our waters – I urge the Minister of State to resist this suggestion – will they be properly policed and patrolled? While there have been assurances that they will be, the past would suggest otherwise. Any promise of change will not be believed because every fisherman will recount the current abuses.Why have there been so few arrests of foreign boats in the recent past? The circumstances have not changed, nor have the abuses, but there have been far fewer prosecutions and arrests in 2002 than heretofore and fewer than necessary. Foreign fishermen are shooting unmarked nets into the water with dire consequences for other ocean users, particularly our fishermen. Without buoys, these nets are virtually invisible in the water and can be tens of miles long. Not alone is this greedy and illegal, it is also dangerous for others working the area. The nets are left for days before being checked and recovered with the result that Irish fishermen have to either trawl around them or risk having their own gear fouled by them. They are both plundering our stocks indiscriminately and without any thought for legality let alone conservation and at the same time depriving Irish boats of a livelihood for at least some of the time.The Spanish particularly are guilty and seem to be amenable to no law. It is impossible to monitor how many are fishing here illegally, what their catch is and what species they are landing. They are buying up British and French boats and a small number of Irish boats and operating them under flags of convenience. These boats are supposed to be in a port of their flag state for a certain number of days each year, but no one is monitoring the situation. The arrangement on policing is very loose with no apparent will or desire to tackle it, which seems to suit the bigger states. The overall situation is set to become much worse unless there is a concerted effort on the part of our law enforcement services and the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources to change it.I suggest that we look more closely at the Norwegian model. They operate a quota system which is logical and beneficial to stocks and conservation. Unlike us, when the Norwegians catch fish for which they do not have a current quota, they do not dump it uselessly back into the sea. Instead, they set the excess catch against a different species for which there is quota remaining. The value of each fish species is different, but there is a weighting system which indicates the relative value of the catches. In our case, catch without a quota is dumped uselessly in the sea and is of no value to anyone. That may be in accordance with some obscure economic law, but it makes no sense to me, nor could I justify it.Until the fishing organisations came to speak to the marine committee yesterday, I did not realise how bad the situation is. The Norwegians had difficulties in regard to conservation but they brought in tough measures, implemented them and restored their fisheries. They patrolled, recorded and monitored and have reaped the benefits accordingly. It would appear that our fishermen would be willing to accept the same but would have to be assured that any new measures would be applied equally and fairly across the board.Our monitoring onshore is equally inefficient. A catch of cod can be reported as whatever species is acceptable at any given time and there is no one to inspect it or dispute the claim. This is packed on a lorry and leaves the country without any realistic check. This will have to stop and realistic measures must be introduced and applied to ensure our stocks are not being plundered and that we are not party to such flouting of regulations. The only way to fully monitor catches is to ban all foreign landings at weekends. The Department claims it cannot afford to pay officers to work weekends to carry out the necessary inspections. In that case, it may be necessary to ban landings outside of normal office hours as well, but that may be extreme. I understand this is happening in Scotland and we already have a situation where herrings cannot be landed at weekends. Therefore, what I am proposing is only a logical extension of this.It is also suggested that Irish boats are monitored more than Spanish boats. Is this a fact and if so, why? Is there pressure coming from somewhere to go easy on the Spanish and, if so, from where? In relation to our 12 mile territorial waters, only Irish fishermen and those foreign boats with historical rights are allowed in at the moment. That situation should be phased out over a period of time and even if we have to forego some rights that we have elsewhere, it would be worth it to protect our own waters. This is not a narrow minded view but an absolute requirement of our own fishing industry. Huge boats, grant aided for deep sea fishing, are plundering our waters. There should be a limit of 450 kilowatts or 600 horsepower applied within the 12 mile limit.There is an internal difficulty, however, in that the Irish Fishermen's' Organisation has become an ineffectual body, though I know it would dispute that. The Killybegs Fishermen's Association and the South and West Fishermen's Organisation are recognised by the Department and are looking after the interests of fishermen in their respective areas. A new body, the Irish Fishermen's South and East Organisation, caters for fishermen from Mine Head to Clogher Head. That is a huge stretch of coastline where fishermen claim they have had no representation and that this new organisation is being set up to look to their needs. The Department, however, has not recognised this organisation, even though it is proving to be a very responsible body and is even recommending a closed area to assist conservation. It quite rightly points out, however, that there is no point in Irish fishermen staying out if foreign boats have free rein in an area. There is no point in our conserving stocks only to have our EU neighbours come in and clean us out. I hope the Department will give the new organisation due recognition sooner rather than later. I ask the Minister to look closely at this.I also ask the Minister to look at the port of Dunmore East, one of the premier fishing ports in the country, with a view to generating development there. Dunmore East has been left behind in terms of development grants and that must be redressed. In doing this, he need only act on the directive which his predecessor, the then Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources, Deputy Frank Fahey, gave to the Department to the effect that Dunmore East should be developed.A ludicrous situation arose last year when the South and West Fishermen's Organisation forced the closure of the fishing grounds off the south east coast. The Department confirmed to me that the recommendation came from that organisation. The worst consequence was that the south and east coast fishermen had to land their catch at Cobh and not at their home port of Dunmore. This was crazy given that they had caught their herring legally in an open area and it put a large and unnecessary burden on them. I suggest that, in future, there should not be a total closure of any fishery. That has never worked in the past but limited and controlled fishing is the answer. If a fishery is closed there is no supply and markets are lost, perhaps never to be regained.I wish the Minister well in what is a difficult portfolio. I know he will strive for the best deal possible for our fishermen and I believe he will have the full support of the Seanad in his task.
#KathleenOMeara	unknown-#KathleenOMeara-party	unknown-#KathleenOMeara-dob	unknown-#KathleenOMeara-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-21 00:00:00	Prelude	52	I welcome the Minister of State to the House. I also welcome this Bill which my party supports in principle and I look forward to its expeditious passage through the House. It contains some very important provisions which need to be up and running as soon as possible as I believe the Department intends. It is incumbent on us to give all possible support in that regard.In my new capacity as party spokesperson on the fisheries area, I attended the first full session yesterday of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Communications and the Marine at which there was a series of submissions on the review of the EU Common Fisheries Policy. This Bill has emerged at a critical stage in the evolution of the CFP. In reviewing the past 20 years of the CFP, one cannot avoid the conclusion that it has been an abject failure in relation to the Irish fishing industry. One would hope that the current talks at EU level will yield a better result but that is not the impression which comes across at the moment. There is little indication of any significantly better outcome for the Irish fishing industry and that is most regrettable.When Ireland's entry to the EU was originally negotiated, the fishing industry was the poor relation. An excellent deal was negotiated for the farming sector, to the extent that the former farm leader, the late T.J. Maher, described it as a "bonzana". It did indeed bring extraordinarily beneficial effects for Irish agriculture and farm incomes. It allowed the development of our agriculture industry to enable it to compete at European level to its own great benefit and that of the national economy. In relation to our fisheries, however, considering our island status and our coastline, one must ask why there has been such abject failure to develop the potential of our fishing industry and whether any change for the better can be expected. I see little indication of hope in that direction. Perhaps, as a matter of public policy, we should have a far more in-depth review of our own management of this issue.One of the many points made to the joint committee yesterday was that, in fisheries sectors six and seven off the Irish coast, although Ireland has 42% of the marine area, we only have 6% of the quota. While those figures have their origins in the situation of the 1970s, we appear to have cut off our noses to spite our faces. I am prepared to defer to colleagues, such as Senator Kenneally who is far more knowledgeable than I on this matter. However, on the basis of his speech just now, one would have to express concerns about the current and future state of Irish fisheries. That situation requires serious consideration by the joint committee and this House.I wish the Minister and the Irish negotiating team in the review of the Common Fisheries Policy the best of good luck and our full support will go with them. The protection of the Irish Box is of national interest and should be treated and negotiated as such. The state of health, or otherwise, of some of our fishing organisations should also be looked at in terms of public policy and the support which State agencies can give to make sure that they are fully representative and able to carry out the work which their members and the State require.This is the background to the legislation. I specifically welcome the establishment of the independent statutory appeals process. In a conversation about the legislation earlier this week with one of the fishing organisations I was told that it mirrors the agricultural appeals process. I am very familiar with that legislation because it was initiated and passed through this House. It had a very good airing and we made some valuable amendments. I hope the same broad-minded attitude will be taken to this appeals process as was taken by the Minister for Agriculture and Food to the agricultural appeals process. It should be independent as far as possible and have the confidence of the sector. It should seen by someone with a grievance as somewhere to go for an objective and independent hearing. They should be able to have full confidence in the outcome of the hearing, whether or not it goes their way.It is no longer tolerated or acceptable that the Minister, although he is an elected representative and represents the Department, has the power to make these decisions. We have gone beyond the thinking which gave rise to that kind of measure and we see the importance of transparency. We also see that there should also be an independent appeals mechanism separate from the Department, which is caught up in the day to day operation of policy and decision making. The Department is effectively one of the major players in the policy and decision-making areas. In this context an independent appeals mechanism is extremely important and I welcome it. We may have some minor amendments to its operation. I hope that the Minister of State will take them in the spirit in which they are intended, which is a positive one.The giving effect to the United Nations Agreement on the conservation and management of certain fish stocks is also to be welcomed. I hope the Minister of State will see my welcome in the context of my earlier remarks on the current state of the Irish fishing industry and the deep sense of unfairness and inequality about its operation, particularly in the wider European context.I wish the Government well in the negotiations which will take place in the coming weeks. The Minister of State might clarify the legal underpinning of the policy which originally established the Irish Box. What is our position on that and our proposals concerning it? I am also interested to know the Government's specific proposals, in so far as the Minister of State can say, about targets for our share of the quota. May we have an indication of what the Government considers desirable or achievable?The issue of enforcement and of Spanish vessels operating in our waters is adding to the sense of unfairness and victimisation felt by the Irish industry. While we are very good at regulating our end of the situation, the Spanish are not. They turn a blind eye to regulation. Are we undermining our industry? Are we cutting off our nose to spite our face? What will we do to change this?

There is no doubt that agriculture and marine resources have been an important part of the economy over many decades. In particular, they have been vitally important to our coastal communities and responsible for no less than 20,000 jobs nationwide. We need a debate on the current developments within the Irish and European fisheries sector.I welcome the Fisheries (Amendment) Bill, 2002 . I am especially pleased with the rationale behind the Bill and believe that the instruments in it will ensure a more fair and equitable fishing environment and a more sustainable industry.The Bill fulfils a number of important functions. One of the most important aspects is the establishment of an independent statutory appeals process for the licensing of sea fishing boats. Previous legislation in this area includes the Fisheries (Amendment) Act, 1997, which provided comprehensive new licensing procedure for aquaculture activities and the Fisheries (Amendment) Act, 1999, which brought significant changes to the structure, management and organisation of the Irish fishing industry. The provisions of the Bill are a welcome addition as they represent a streamlined and more accessible version of these Acts.The Minister has introduced genuine improvements in licensing procedures. Proper licensing is essential in any industry and this Bill ensures that the system remains fair to all. People with genuine cases which might have been rejected now have an opportunity to appeal such decisions. This is a welcome development and one which is consistent with the wishes of the industry and the promises made in the programme for Government.The appeals system is modelled on the Refugee Appeals Tribunal. In this way the fishing industry is provided with an example from which it can learn, but one hopes that it will operate more effectively and efficiently than the Refugee Appeals Tribunal, with adequate representation of the various fishing organisations. The Bill sets out the principles of the provisions for making appeals, including the co-ordination of written submissions and oral hearings and an advanced system of public notification, including electronic publication. Overall, I am certain that such a system will benefit all involved as it ensures the efficient and cost effective management of a fair appeals process.Another very important function of the Bill is to give effect to the provisions of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, to which Ireland became a party in 1996. The objective of this convention is to ensure the long-term cultivation of sustainable fishing stocks. It establishes national sovereignty over marine resources lying within coastal waters in the hope that by establishing such property rights countries will be encouraged and even obligated to protect and preserve the surrounding marine environment and regulate national fishing industries. This agreement is noted for its comprehensive coverage of marine resource issues, especially for its binding procedures for settling disputes over national resources lying outside sovereign waters.Sustainable fish stocks are essential if the Irish fishing industry is to have any future. I welcome the Bill as it aims to conserve our fish stocks, while at the same time establishing a fair enforcement system. This Bill aims to grant to the relevant authorities the powers to board and search all fishing boats, both Irish and international. Nobody can deny that, given the number of non-Irish sea fishing boats in our waters, such powers would be invaluable in ensuring that catch levels are not exceeding European quotas. The penalties proposed for breaches of regulations are justified and fair. Fines, forfeitures of boats and fishing gear and even convictions are warranted. These penalties are necessary to guarantee that such breaches will no longer occur.The major challenge facing the global fisheries sector today is the conservation and management of the rapidly depleting marine resources. The key test for any fisheries policy is whether it aims to strike a balance between available marine resource and the means employed to fish them. This Bill attempts to do exactly that. The combination of bolstering a sea fishing boat licence procedure with an efficient appeals procedure and extra legislation for the preservation of fish stocks makes for excellent legislation which will help to ensure the sustainablity of the industry.Much still needs to be done within the industry if everyone involved is to be satisfied. I say this now because I know that within the next year much reform is planned for our fisheries policy, especially within the context of the EU Common Fisheries Policy. The next six weeks will be the most important in the history of the fishing industry. The present Common Fisheries Policy is not working and badly in need of reform. Although there is general agreement that changes are needed, disputes continue to arise as to the type of reform that should be enacted. I understand the Minister, Deputy Dermot Ahern, is fighting Ireland's cause in these disputes and I fully support him in his endeavours. I am certain that his recent meeting with the Agriculture and Fisheries Commissioner, Mr. Franz Fischler, was invaluable for Ireland's case. The areas where Ireland could and should benefit were specifically highlighted during the meeting.As negotiations for the new CFP commence in the coming days, a number of matters of critical importance will have to be monitored. The extension and protection of the existing controls in the Irish Box are fundamental for many reasons. The Irish Box is a biologically sensitive and highly productive area, in which some very important spawning grounds are found, as well as three important recovery programmes. Above all, it is vital for the sustainability of our coastal communities and the 25,000 who work in the fishing and related industries.The allocation of resources is of huge importance in the context of the CFP reforms. The criteria for the allocation of quotas are fundamentally flawed, in that they do not take into account the marginalised state of the fishing industry in terms of infrastructure. The Hague preferences were critical in this regard, in that they provided for additional allocations in certain quotas. It is imperative that they are maintained. Similarly, I ask the Minister of State, Deputy Browne, and the Minister, Deputy Dermot Ahern, to seek to build alliances with our EU partners to ensure future quota allocations reflect Ireland's proximity to stock resources, take cognisance of the socio-economic dependency of certain areas on those resources and, most importantly, respect the needs of the communities on the basis of relative potential rather than historic activity levels. Furthermore, it is crucial that Ireland is allowed to maintain the size of its fishing fleet. The proposal that there should be cuts of up to 40% in the whitefish fleet is unacceptable. I appeal to the Minister of State to ensure everything is done to maintain the size of the fleet.The three issues I have mentioned are of serious importance for Ireland in the context of the reform of the Common Fisheries Policy. The forthcoming negotiations represent Ireland's last chance to right the previous wrong as regards resource allocation criteria in particular, as well as preserve the Hague preferences and the restrictions in the Irish Box. I advise the Minister of State to be cautious during the negotiations; it is vitally important that we do not allow any one of the three matters I have outlined to be used as currency, or for one to played off against another. The three concerns are of equal importance and we must seek to gain ground on each of them. CFP reforms must safeguard the future of fragile and remote coastal communities which depend on fishing.I welcome the Fisheries (Amendment) Bill for which I express my full support. I wish the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources well, with the Minister of State, Deputy Browne, in their endeavours to secure the best possible deal for Ireland in the CFP negotiations.
#DavidNorris	unknown-#DavidNorris-party	unknown-#DavidNorris-dob	unknown-#DavidNorris-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-21 00:00:00	Prelude	54	I also welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Browne, and wish him strength in the negotiations that he and his colleague, the Minister, Deputy Dermot Ahern, will have to undertake on our behalf. It is very important that we safeguard the vital national resource of our fish stocks. I must put my hands up and admit that I do not speak as an expert on this matter, as I have no great knowledge of the fishing industry. For that reason, I greatly regret the absence from the House of our distinguished colleague, former Senator Tom Fitzgerald. I am glad, however, to have listened to the excellent speeches from both sides of the House, particularly from the Government side, especially from Senator Kenneally. If I may say so, Senators are lucky to have as a colleague someone with such a clear and developed knowledge of the fishing industry. I learned a great deal from Senator Kenneally.I also extend my compliments to Senator MacSharry for his clearly researched speech on this Bill. My contribution will not be informed by such an expert knowledge, but nonetheless I feel very strongly about the matter. It is important that city boys should make it clear that we are also concerned about our natural resources and that we will not stand idly by and allow those who engage in fishing to be left stranded. It is clear that a disaster in our fishing industry has been in the making for a long time. I am not very impressed by Mr. Fischler, despite the apparent appropriateness of his name. He seems to be subject to dithering and ambiguity; he says one thing here and something else somewhere else. The situation in the industry is so clear that even someone like myself can understand it. I have raised this issue on the Order of Business on a number of occasions.Traditionally, Irish people have not been enthusiastic about fish. It is an extraordinary irony that although we are surrounded by wonderfully rich fishing grounds, for cultural and historic reasons an interest in fishing has been shown by only certain small communities. Perhaps the lack of enthusiasm to which I refer results from the religious tradition of eating fish on Fridays as a form of penance. People did not really bother with fish on other days of the week. It remains a mystery to me that people living in coastal towns during the famine did not go to the seas en masse to harvest their resources. Irish people have been traditionally reluctant to eat fish despite the fact that we have had the most wonderful resources. Equally, we have lacked the capacity to prepare fish properly. Many of the immense advances in Irish cuisine during the last 20 or 30 years can be attributed to the marvellous work of the college at Cathal Brugha Street. Our superb restaurants can withstand comparison with those anywhere else in Europe or the world.We have the raw materials in the form of fish and the capacity and skill to prepare, cook and present seafood dishes. This is a vital element in the fortunes of our tourism industry. Casual observers like me have seen species of fish disappear from menus; they are not available in chip shops or cordon bleu restaurants. The scarcity of particular species of fish, including that most wonderful of all fish, the cod, is clearly noticeable. This has had a detrimental impact on tourism.There have been considerable increases in the level of employment in the fishing industry in recent years. I recently read a well researched article by Ed Power in The Irish Times and would like to quote some of the statistics mentioned in it, although they may already be on the record of the House:Direct employment in fishing increased from 15,470 to 15,832 between 1993 and 1997, while exports rose by 23 per cent from €236 million to €289 million. With a further 10,000 working in spin-off industries such as fish processing, the importance of the sector to coastal communities otherwise devoid of investment cannot be understated.The increases mentioned have had a very particular impact in certain disadvantaged areas. I know Senator Kenneally comes from County Waterford, but the fishing industry is particularly important along the west coast, in places like County Donegal. The industry is under threat despite the traditional resourcefulness and bravery of our fishermen.We have to accept that, as politicians, we are responsible for the problems in the sector as we agreed a political trade-off at EU level. We gave away our fish in return for concessions in areas like the Common Agricultural Policy. We did not value or have any meas on our fish stocks, but instead found it convenient to trade them. We sold our birthright for a mess of potage by tolerating the activities of Spanish fishermen. I hope I do not sound racist when I say that I make no apologies for pointing out that it is perfectly clear that Spanish fishermen have been brigands. The reports of problems off our coast I have heard over many years have invariably mentioned Spanish trawlers, or trawlers from other countries with Spanish crews. There is a voracious appetite for fish in Spain, a country which has wonderful seafood recipes. Spanish fishermen do not give a damn about what they have to do to get fish. When our seas were closed to them, they constantly moved into our waters anyway.I am worried as a result of today's confirmation that we do not have sufficient offshore personnel. Perhaps this Bill will go some way to amending that situation, although I doubt it. I do not think we have anything like the naval resources needed to police our seas. May I make a suggestion to the Minister of State? It may seem naive, but naive ideas sometimes work. Now that we have joined the idiotic nonsense that is the Partnership for Peace, why should there not be an equivalent arrangement in the naval sphere? If the European Union claims that it can protect our fishing stocks and guarantee that certain regulations and stipulations will be obeyed, perhaps it should be responsible for ensuring vessels and other services are provided. The European Union should ensure its laws are upheld, or at least directly fund the expansion of the Naval Service. If we have to suffer the intrusions of marauding groups of Spanish fishermen, the European Union should pay us to help protect our resources.The editorial in the Irish Examiner of Tuesday, 12 November, stated:Giving Spanish fishermen unrestricted access to Irish waters would have disastrous repercussions, not only upon rapidly dwindling fish stocks but primarily on the livelihoods of thousands of people in maritime communities around Ireland's coastline.The deeply held fears of Irish fishermen, evidenced in protest blockades at several ports, are well founded given the intense pressure being applied by Spain for unfettered access for all foreign trawlers to the so-called Irish Box.Having lost their traditional fishing grounds off Africa, the Spaniards are fighting to gain a bigger slice of Ireland's resources.We all know the Irish Box was established to keep the Spanish out because they never behaved themselves, and we are now opening it up to them. We are not blameless in this and we must accept some of the pain. It is absolutely daft to argue to exclude the Spanish, on the one hand, while on the other hand we want to expand our catches. If we are serious we must become involved in conservation. The irony is redoubled here because if we go for conservation and then let the Spanish in, having suffered ourselves, it will be complete madness.I am sure the Minister will recall that I was one of the people who supported the Canadians some years ago when they got into legal difficulties trying to exclude these people. They excluded them, using their naval vessels, from the Newfoundland banks where they were protecting their cod resources. In my opinion they were perfectly correct to do so and Ireland should take similar action.The Spanish have successfully fished out Mauritania and Morocco. They will be kicked out of these waters when the agreements terminate, and rightly so. I would like to point out one aspect to the Minister of State. We helped to fund and build one of these super trawlers, Mr. McHugh's boat, the Atlantic Dawn, which is an ecological disaster. It hoovers up fish indiscriminately off the bed of the ocean, much of which is used as fish meal and so on. Why did we do this? When the boat was not allowed fish in European waters it fished off the coast of Africa, putting the tribal coastal fishermen out of business. When these unfortunate villagers come here we get snotty with them and call them economic migrants. We helped to make them economic migrants.The redoubled irony is that we have recently been arguing, I understand successfully, to get a derogation of the protocol so that this boat can fish in our waters and do more damage. Let us have a bit of consistency. We must understand that if we want the fishing industry to survive and to protect fish stocks, we must accept some pain in the hope of long-term gain and then fight to protect the resources that exist. There is no point having a mixed and ambiguous response like Mr. Fischler.Pressure from the Spaniards will be absolutely redoubled in its intensity after the sinking of the Prestige, which will wreak havoc on the existing Spanish fishing waters. I feel very sorry for these courageous shoreline shell fisherman in Spain. My heart goes out to them but they should go for their own Government. The Spanish and Portuguese, and perhaps other Governments, were grossly irresponsible in refusing to allow the Prestige to be brought in towards the shore where the damage would have been less. They insisted in a mean spirited, not in my back yard, attitude in having the tanker dragged further and further out into Atlantic waters where it will do enormous damage. This was utterly stupid. I would like the Minister to fight for international regulations in this issue so that there will be some degree of compulsion. I heard a wonderful Dutch salvage expert speaking on radio yesterday who said it was a disgrace that the incident was not handled as a salvage or fishing operation but as a political problem. The political leaders kicked it around from country to country until the disaster was multiplied. We must learn to avoid this happening. The Spaniards will redouble their efforts in the wake of this incident, and one cannot blame them.What are we doing about these leaky old tubs which are floating around the place with 70,000 tonnes or 200 million gallons of heavy crude oil in single hull vessels, travelling through some of the most storm tossed waters in this part of the world and registered in some banana republic? We should require vessels travelling through our waters to be properly registered and properly insured. I understand insurance cover in this instance might be in the region of €1 million. That will do a lot of good. There is an international insurance fund amounting to approximately €1 billion. When that is cleaned out there will be no more money left when the next incident occurs. No doubt there will be another incident because of the blatant idiocy and blindness of saying we will not rule out these tankers until 2017. That means another 13 years for these types of accidents to occur. Thirteen is an unlucky number for some and it is likely to be unlucky for us.Mr. Fischler spoke about the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea. Does he care about it? He does not seem to take its advice. He will call for reports until the cows come home but it has proposed a complete moratorium on catching cod in the Irish Sea, the Eastern Channel, Skagerrak, the North Sea and the west of Scotland. This is the scientific advice Mr. Fischler has yet he dithers. Afterwards he called for a zero attack on cod and then changed his mind again.I have great admiration and sympathy for fishermen who risk their lives to provide this wonderful resource which is significant both culturally and economically. However, we are threatened by the Spanish, in particular, since the Prestige disaster. While we must do something about this issue, we must be coherent, consistent and be prepared to accept a little pain. I will quote a decent man from the Aran Islands, Mr. Fitzpatrick. Since my mother was Fitzpatrick, I take pride and joy in his good sense and clarity of thought. He said, “They must think we are right idiots. They talk to us about conservation but these deals are just about votes and politics, nothing more and nothing less.” He is one of a handful of people who stayed on the Aran Islands. The rest of the fishing community have moved to Rossaveal. It is being put up to us as politicians by people like Mr. Fitzpatrick to have a coherent policy.I welcome the Bill but I think we have a long voyage to travel in choppy waters. We must be absolutely resolute if there is to be any fish in fish and chip shops and good restaurants for people to enjoy. It can be done but only if we are prudent, abandon narrow political interests and fight the Spanish brigands to the death.
#BrendanDaly	unknown-#BrendanDaly-party	unknown-#BrendanDaly-dob	unknown-#BrendanDaly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-21 00:00:00	Prelude	55	I welcome the Bill and the Minister of State. The Bill, which is very important for the industry, will afford us an opportunity to comment on the current issues which are of concern to the fishing industry. There is one aspect of the Bill which needs to be dealt with but we might have more time to deal with it on Committee Stage. A matter of concern to many fishermen, in particular young fisherman, who want to get into the business is that of tonnage, including the availability and cost. I am not certain that this is dealt with in the Bill. The licensing appeals system is welcome, although it is long overdue.There is widespread concern within the industry about the availability of fish. The previous speaker mentioned stock pressures, especially on the whitefish species that have traditionally been commercially fished – cod, haddock, plaice, whiting, mackerel and so on. Contrary to what Senator Norris – who admitted he was not familiar with the industry – may feel, the reality is that unless serious measures are taken to conserve stocks, there will be no stocks for anybody.Our involvement in the EEC has been strongly criticised, but when we joined in 1973 we had no fishing industry. We had a very small inshore fleet with bad boats and no management of fisheries. The value of seafish landings when we joined the Community was about £5 million. The mackerel fishery had almost collapsed and we were depending on sales to Africa, where the people could not pay. The herring fishery in the Celtic Sea had collapsed totally and had been closed for a number of years before we joined because the stocks had been fished out of existence, not by Spanish or Danish boats but by Irish boats. In 1973 we had no real, historic fishing industry. We had small, inshore boats fishing mostly for mackerel and herring, which constituted 80% of the total catch at that time. We had no mackerel market and the herring fishery was in a state of collapse.Fishermen, because of the increase in inflation and interest rates, could not pay their way. Most fishermen were bankrupt at the time. Soon after we joined the Community, a rescue package was brought in to try to save the industry from extinction. The people who say we sold out to the EEC should know that this is the reality. We got derogations for ten years because of the policies operated by the Community at the time we joined. In addition, the Irish quotas were based on the traditional pattern of fishing. Under the Hague agreement, mentioned by Senator MacSharry, we got an acknowledgment from the Community of the need to take special measures to double the Irish catch. The EEC put £50 million into the Irish fishing industry within the first ten years. Those people who glibly criticise the EU should study the history of Irish fishing and see the contribution made by the EEC in management, conservation, protection of stocks and funding for development of harbours and piers.As I mentioned recently, I was in the fisheries Department in 1982 when most of the piers and harbours had fallen into the sea. There was no pier in Dingle, in Rossaveal, in Clare. The piers and harbours we had were built under famine relief schemes and had not been funded by any Governments for 20 or 30 years. The history is there for anyone who wants to read it. There was a small, inshore fleet operating on a shoestring, depending mainly on mackerel and herring, both of which species were under threat. What happened when we joined the EEC? There was a transformation. Protection was given, including the Irish Box and the 12 mile limit around the coast, which enabled our fleet to consolidate, develop and prosper. The catch in 2000, the last year for which I have numbers, had a value of nearly €200 million compared to a catch worth less than £5 million in 1972.I am not saying that the EEC has solved all our problems, but it has operated a policy designed specifically to be of benefit to the fishing industry and especially fishermen. Funding was received for harbour investment, training, management and processing, which I will not go into because it is a whole new development. Thousands of people – a total of 25,000 was mentioned earlier – are involved in an industry which employed very few and was bankrupt when we joined the EEC. People who make glib comments in the House about selling out our resources to the EU, the Spaniards or anyone else ought to keep in mind the traditional pattern of fishing we had here, based on the old London Convention. I was involved in the final negotiations on the Common Fisheries Policy in 1982. It had not been completed when I left but it was finalised by Mr. Paddy O'Toole, who succeeded me as Minister for Fisheries and Forestry. The CFP is being reviewed this year.As spelled out the other night by people from the industry, it is critically important that we have very strict management and conservation regime because if we do not, we will regress very quickly to how we were in 1972 when our fisheries had to be closed. In fact, although the herring fishery had to be closed, it did replenish in a very short time allowing Irish boats to fish there again very lucratively. This is because it had the opportunity of replenishing. The same applies to cod, plaice and haddock in the Irish Sea. If the fisheries get the chance to replenish themselves they will do so, but they must be managed in an effective way. That management must come, not from the Minister for Communications, the Marine and Natural Resources, the Government or the EU, but from the industry itself. After all, it is the fishermen who have the most to lose if they do not take these initiatives that are so important to the survival and development of their own industry.The traditional species we have been fishing over the last 20 to 40 years are now all under pressure from stock depletion. Unless serious action is taken by the EU and by ourselves, especially our fishermen, the industry will return to the state it was in when we joined the EEC in 1972 – the industry devastated, people unable to pay their loans and boats being seized every day by Bord Iascaigh Mhara. It is worth while for people who are interested in this business to consider the contrast between what we have now and what we had in 1972. There is no easy solution to the current problems.Unless the industry itself recognises the necessity for urgent conservation measures to protect its members livelihoods in the long term, it is heading into a cul de sac and will not recover. I do not believe that fishermen are that shortsighted. The fears we have at present include changes in the rules regarding the Irish Box, which must be protected during the renegotiations of the CFP. We must protect stocks as a conservation measure, as Senator MacSharry said. Conservation measures are essential at a time when stocks are threatened. Management and development of the industry must come from within the industry or it will pay the price later.
#MauriceCummins	unknown-#MauriceCummins-party	unknown-#MauriceCummins-dob	unknown-#MauriceCummins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-21 00:00:00	Prelude	56	I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Browne, a friend and colleague from the south east. We have soldiered together for many a year attending to the needs of the south east and I wish him well in his current position. The debate so far has been worthwhile and contributions from speakers have been enlightening. I learned much about the fishing industry from Senator Daly.This Bill is welcome, particularly the provision for reform of the Naval Service and Air Corps, the unsung heroes of fishery protection and conservation. It is easy to criticise them as they carry out their duties, with people saying they should be in one place, not another and that they should be out catching the Spanish when they bring in an Irish boat. They are doing their duty and it is all too easy to oppose the protection they ensure. They need resources because all they are doing is upholding Irish and EU law.I agree with the updating of the penalties and welcome the fact that the Sea Fisheries (Consolidation) Bill is being prepared to gather together and update all legislation relating to fisheries. The licensing of boats has been a bone of contention for many years and the appeals system envisaged in the Bill is important. A transparent and independent statutory appeals process should be seen to be in operation.If the Irish Box is opened up to other countries, there will be severe implications for Irish fisheries. Fishermen from all over the country have told me that it will spell disaster for communities from Dunmore East to Killybegs, Ros a' Mhíl to Howth. It would be a disaster for them.I agree with Senator Kenneally about the plans that have been in place for the development of Dunmore East Harbour for many years. I ask the Minister of State to act on these plans because Dunmore East has long been one of the country's major fishery ports and it is of paramount importance that it is developed to its maximum potential as soon as possible.Irish fishermen agree that conservation measures are necessary. I hope fishermen in other EU countries have similar views on conservation, although I have my doubts. The Spanish have been rightly castigated because of their record in fisheries. There has been more lip service than action when it comes to conservation from many countries. Our stocks have been plundered for decades by boats operating under flags of convenience. This cannot be allowed to continue.The resources for fishery protection should be increased and I hope the book of Estimates will not lead to cut-backs. There is no point in saying stocks should be conserved and that fishery vessels should be enforcing the legislation if we do not provide the resources for them to do so. The cut-backs in the Estimates should not expand to fishery protection.I wish the Minister of State well in the negotiations. It is always a difficult area and we support his efforts to protect the livelihood of those involved in fisheries.
#JoeOToole	unknown-#JoeOToole-party	unknown-#JoeOToole-dob	unknown-#JoeOToole-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-21 00:00:00	Prelude	57	I congratulate the Minister of State and the Department on introducing this Bill. It is appropriate in this debate to look back at the history of the fishing industry. The whole community, including the trade union movement and the political parties, should take responsibility for ignoring the industry and treating it as a low level employer. It is the only area of Irish industry which was not dealt with in any of the economic plans put together by Whitaker and Lemass in the 1950s and 1960s. That is where the mistake was originally made. When I discussed this with Dr. Whitaker many years later, he immediately conceded that this was a mistake. He said that while considering development at the time, it was disregarded.I was born and raised in a fishing town and saw the devastation that happened as a result of the lack of planning for fisheries. Half of my class in school were from fishermen's families and they were all poor. There was no market for or interest in their product. Fish was seen as a penance to be eaten on Friday in the community, and it would be mad to eat it at any other time. My image of the Dingle fishing industry then was seeing fishermen coming back in from the sea for days in all weathers and dealing with a very poor market.There is a great contrast between the market then and now. I can remember the fishermen bringing home the fish they could not sell and those fish are at the top of the menu of sea food restaurants now. Back then no one would buy john dory or red gurnard. At the time rock salmon, as it now called, were called dog fish and they were not even landed, they were dumped overboard. It is hard to believe now that it was impossible then to sell monkfish. The only people who ate monkfish were fishermen's families and the only reason they ate them was because they could not sell them.I admire Bord Iascaigh Mhara and do not want to criticise it, but I have few childhood memories as poignant as seeing fishermen's boats being repossessed. The children of those employed in the industry left school at 13, not because they were not bright, but because they could not afford to stay there. They did not have the experience of learning beyond that age. A few years later they were given responsibility for a boat costing hundreds of thousands of pounds with huge bank repayments in an industry which was totally weather dependent. They had never learned how to budget. They were still working on the basis of the old co-operative method of fishing where there were ten shares – one share for the boat, two shares for the skipper, and so on. They tried to run modern boats in exactly the same way. It was completely wrong. Many of the decent, hard working men were devastated and never recovered from the shame of being unable to make the necessary repayments and their boats being taken from them by a sheriff. When it came to paying back the loans nobody explained to them the importance budgeting over a period of a year. That is a difficult thing to do.It is hard to convince fishermen on the issue of conservation. They agree with it but when there is a choice between getting paid this month or not fishing because of some decision in Brussels, it is hard for them to be disciplined enough to accept that. It is hard for people who, for generations, have lived from hand to mouth on the basis of whether the fish are running this week or the weather is good enough to go out. There is a list of conditions over which they have no control and they have always had to make hay while the sun shone. Fishermen need support and they have never got it. The points made in regard to the piers, infrastructure and the fleet are relevant. We have not invested in them.The threat to the Irish Box by the intrusion of the Spanish fishing industry is outrageous. Given that the fishing industry was underdeveloped in 1973 when we joined Europe it is true to say that that was when it took off. Unfortunately, the industry was so small that on day one our bargaining position, the platform on which we based our negotiations for a deal, was far too low. That is the way it was and that is what was inherited. This is not a criticism of successive Ministers for the Marine because I have watched all shades go out and do their best. Consequently Irish fishermen have never had available to them fishing rights in proportion to the amount of coastline or fishing area which would be described as "Irish". That is the problem.The Minister of State could argue that if we want to proceed in a proportional manner the funds received in the past were in the other direction. That is why this will never be properly resolved. What needs to be done is to put the boot in hard in terms of those who break European law in this area. We need to be merciless. We need to create an international image that it is dangerous to go into the Irish Box, to over-fish, not to comply with EU law and so on.Just before the election I spoke here on a related matter – flags of convenience and unsafe ships. We saw what happened this week with the break-up of the Prestige on the Iberian coastline. Those of us who know people living around the coast will say it is almost impossible to find out who owns a boat. It is bought in one place, registered in another, fishing elsewhere and the crew could be from anywhere. People talk about the fishing industry they knew in Kilmore, Killybegs, Dingle or wherever where they knew who owned the boat. The Rossbawn was Paddy Bawn's, the Elsie Mabel was somebody else's and so on. We knew all the boats and all the families. The boats and their names went from family to family. That day is gone and there is not the same control any more. This is a European industry and there is a need for European legislation. In the main we need to be supportive of European rules because their approach is correct.The legislation before the House is directly in line with what is required in Europe. Nobody who has a commitment to or is supportive of the fishing industry could oppose it. There may be a line here or there with which one would have a difficulty but the thrust of the Bill has to be supported. We need it. The requirement that things have to be landed in a certain port makes sense if one is sitting in Brussels. If you are the skipper of a fishing boat off the west coast of Ireland and your registered landing place is Dingle and you are suddenly hit by a gale force north western and you hit into Fenit to land, that should not be a problem but it is a huge problem. People have been brought to court on such issues. There is a need for flexibility in its exact meaning and flexibility in its implementation to make sure we are getting to the spirit of what was intended and to recognise the pressures imposed on people.I will tell a little story to lighten the debate. I listened carefully to Senator Daly speak about the need to invest in infrastructure and piers here and there and how little was done. He is correct. It was like the drainage of the Shannon; every Government said it would do it. There was a famous Minister of State, whose name I will not mention except to say that his two sons are prominent in Galway football, and he told me when he was moved forcibly from one side of his county to another and was elected for Galway West, the big issue in the fishing area was the pier at Rossaveal. He spent all his time as Minister of State endeavouring to have it built. He said that having gone in there as a rookie from east Galway not knowing anyone, having got a few votes in Rossaveal the previous time, the box would be overflowing with Donnellan votes the next time round. He was looking forward to the opening of the box. He turned to me and said, "Joe, do you know what? I will tell you the difference it made when I got the pier – my vote halved."
#PaddyBurke	unknown-#PaddyBurke-party	unknown-#PaddyBurke-dob	unknown-#PaddyBurke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-21 00:00:00	Prelude	58	I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Browne, and wish him well in his portfolio. In his contribution the Minister of State said we are one of three countries which has not ratified this agreement. Is this agreement being rushed or is there some reason the other countries have agreed it? Do they consider they are getting more from it than we are?As most speakers have said, conservation measures are necessary. Senator Kenneally said it is clear when conservation measures are adopted and one stops fishing, the stocks return fairly rapidly. Most Senators would agree with that. I support the Bill and wish it a quick passage through the House.It is important to maintain the size of the Irish fleet. Senator Norris referred to the massive ships which act like hoovers, taking up fish stocks which are processed on the boat. Do we need that type of fishing in the European market? Would we not be better off, as Senator Norris said, with smaller fishing fleets where there would be more jobs, more boats and more employed? He posed a good question. While it is important to maintain the size of the Irish fishing fleet, it will not be easy because some of it is uneconomic.Senator Daly made a very important point about tonnage. The Minister of State should explain to Members, although perhaps not today, the issues relating to tonnage, which are a bone of contention among the majority of fishermen. Perhaps he will elaborate on this when summing up. Every Senator agrees that it is essential to maintain the Irish Box. I agree with Senator Daly that when we entered the Common Market, fishing was a very small industry here. Senator O'Toole alluded to the fact – it has always mystified me – that during the Famine so many people died right around the coastline when the sea was full of fish. In Achill and all along the west coast there are deserted villages which date from Famine times, and it amazes me that they could not or did not fish to save themselves from starvation.Our entry into the European Union resulted in a lot of money being pumped into the fishing business with the building of harbours and piers, which it is essential to maintain. We need more funding for this. EU membership has provided the necessary funding to provide quite a number of facilities the length and breadth of our coastline which have helped fishermen enormously. Some ports, such as Rossaveal and Killybegs, are difficult to access because of the condition of the roads, about which something should be done. While much has been done, there is more to do, to use the Fianna Fáil slogan.I welcome the Bill. However, I would like to know from the Minister of State when he intends to tell us about the availability of tonnage because many fishermen are waiting for this to be done.
#JohnBrowne2	unknown-#JohnBrowne2-party	unknown-#JohnBrowne2-dob	unknown-#JohnBrowne2-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-21 00:00:00	Prelude	59	I thank Senators for their contributions to the debate and also their good wishes to me.This is an important Bill. However, we have had a very wide-ranging debate on the fishing industry in Ireland, its importance to fishermen and the economy, which is to be welcomed. The Bill is needed to implement the current programme for Government commitment to establish an independent statutory appeals process for sea fishing boat licensing to enable Ireland to ratify and take part in the EU international implementation of the 1995 United Nations agreement and strengthen some existing fishery enforcement legislation in the interests of better enforcement and deterrents against illegal fishing.The non-statutory appeals officer is Mr. Niall Beirne, barrister at law, c/o the Law Library. He is in situ and will operate in that position until it is put on a statutory basis. The appeals process will not apply to past decisions which have review mechanisms which include the courts. If everything goes well and the legislation is passed through both Houses of the Oireachtas, the appeals process will apply to decisions from 1 January 2003.Senator Kenneally raised the issue of the right of appeal by a third party. The Bill allows for such a right. The Senator pointed out that there are people who want the chance to get involved in sea fishing but who cannot if limited opportunities are confined to a few. All licence applications for sea fishing boats will be publicly available for observation and there will be a right of appeal thereafter for any third party.All of the Senators involved today, Senators Finucane, Cummins, O'Toole, Daly, Meara and MacSharry, who was making his maiden speech – I wish him all the best in the future – raised the key issues of the Irish Box and the CFP negotiations. The Minister, Deputy Dermot Ahern, coming from a coastal county, is very much aware of concerns in this area. He has visited a number of EU states in recent weeks meeting fishery Ministers to express concern about what Commissioner Fischler might have in mind and the concerns of the industry about the implications of tampering with the Irish Box, impressing upon like-minded Ministers the need for support in December when the Council of Ministers meets.Some Senators referred to legal interpretations. We have our own legal view which states Ireland's position on the Irish Box. The European Union and Commissioner Fischler have a different legal interpretation, but that does not surprise anyone. Legal jargon can have different interpretations depending on where one is coming from. We have our own legal advice, to which we will be sticking in the negotiations.The issue of enforcement was mentioned. Every time I visit fishermen in the south east, including Wexford, they tell me that enforcement works against Irish fishermen. However, experience in the Department does not bear this out. Statistics show that more than half of the boardings conducted by Naval Service inspection vessels relate to nationalities other than Irish. We must have enforcement. The European Union and a number of individuals, including Senator Norris and others, are asking for more EU involvement in enforcement. The European Union is giving particular attention to the enforcement of sea fishery rules throughout the Union and targeting weaknesses in its findings. It may also become involved in surveillance and enforcement operations with the services of member states in joint actions. It is looking very seriously at this issue. The enforcement regulations might be strict, but the European Union is looking at other member states and targeting weaknesses and considering how it can have very much stricter enforcement regulations in the future.Senator Finucane mentioned that naval vessels were spending too much time in particular areas of sea fishing. However, there would be no point in having scarce resources in areas where no fishing is taking place. We cannot just send them off on a wild goose chase. We can take it, therefore, that they will be operating. We are looking at a proposed increased service in conjunction with the Department of Defence and for additional enforcement activity in 2003. Enforcement is very high on our agenda and that of the European Union. There will be no lessening of enforcement in the months and years ahead.Senators Cummins and Kenneally mentioned Dunmore East. I jokingly asked Senator Kenneally about Kilmore Quay. Both harbours are very important to the south east. There has been significant expenditure in Kilmore Quay in recent times and there are plans to develop it further. An engineering report commissioned in 2001 in relation to Kilmore Quay and Dunmore East on development for the future is almost complete. It is not yet clear that it will present a definitive answer in terms of development at one port rather than the other. Development costs approaching £20 million at each port will be needed for the future. I will keep the House posted when the report is finalised and take on board the issues that have been raised and the importance of Dunmore East. I am sure Senators Cummins and Kenneally will continue to fly the flag of Dunmore East and Waterford in the House.The question of the number of licences issued in any one year was raised. An average year would see the issue of approximately 125 licences following detailed consideration of applications from owners, and about 25 to 30 licences are renewed each year. There will be plenty of work for the new appeals board.It is important that the appeals board operates publicly and that will be the case. The board will have to fully explain its decisions. Too often when boards like this were set up decisions were made without the public, applicants or licensees being aware of the reasons for them. It is important that all decisions with regard to appeals are made in public and fully explained.On the question of fees for appeals, €390 will payable by the applicant for a licence or a licensee, and €152.37 will be payable by any other applicant. An additional €76.18 will be payable if an oral hearing is requested. These charges are reasonable and will allow people to participate.I thank Senators for their contributions. I will pass on to the Minister the issues raised with regard to the Irish Box. The Minister is in Norway today and will meet Ministers from other EU states in the coming weeks to explain the Irish position. I will convey to the Minister the strong support of the House for his activities and for Irish fishing. I hope he will take on board all the matters raised.

#CharlieMcCreevy	unknown-#CharlieMcCreevy-party	unknown-#CharlieMcCreevy-dob	unknown-#CharlieMcCreevy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-21 00:00:00	Prelude	61	I am happy to have the opportunity to debate the 2003 abridged Estimates volume in the Upper House.Ireland may be an island geographically but it is certainly not an economic island. We live in a small open economy and cannot avoid the effects of the slow-down in worldwide economic growth. The pace of international economic activity is disappointing with continuing uncertainty about the timing of any upturn. The fiscal position in the euro area, the United Kingdom and the United States has deteriorated. The same factors are at work in Ireland. As economic and revenue growth moderates, we must face reality.I assure the House that the Government did not embark on a strict approach to public spending in 2003 simply because we wanted to balance the books. The European Union Stability and Growth Pact requires us to keep general Government finances close to balance or in surplus, and to take corrective action when there is an actual or expected divergence from this objective. We made it clear in An Agreed Programme for Government that we would respect this sovereign commitment.We also have responsibilities to the people. We have a responsibility to protect the economy and to foster conditions which will maintain high levels of employment and generate the resources which we need to keep improving our public services. If this requires difficult decisions in the short term, we are willing to take them. The lessons of the past have shown us that high taxation rates and high levels of borrowing will deliver the opposite. We cannot repeat the mistakes of the past.Certain headline figures about spending this year and next have featured prominently in much of the commentary on the Estimates. The media refer to a planned increase in spending next year of 2% compared to a 20% increase this year. Neither figure is correct.True, last week's abridged volume provides for a 2% increase in spending. However, I made it clear last week that the abridged Estimates volume (AEV) does not include any provision for social welfare rate increases, benchmarking or any other pay increases. I will deal with these issues on budget day.True, the end-October Exchequer returns showed that spending at that point was nearly 20% above spending in the corresponding period last year. However, my aim and expectation remain that spending this year will come in on, or close to, the target increase of 14.5%. The forecast outturn figures for 2002 which were included in last week's AEV show that, at this stage, the forecast outturn for net voted expenditure is only slightly above the revised Estimates volume (REV) provision.Some of those who argue for higher public spending claim that Ireland's share of spending relative to national income is much lower than that of other EU countries. The implication is that our level of public service provision is therefore correspondingly lower. This suggestion is based on cross-country comparisons which indicate, for example, that general Government spending in Ireland is budgeted at about 35.5% of GDP for 2002 compared with an EU average of 47%. However, this comparison is misleading.Ireland's taxable capacity, which delivers the resources for public service provision, is essentially related to GNP, not GDP. Our GDP is about 20% higher than our GNP whereas there is no real difference between GDP and GNP in other EU member states. In addition, a lot of expenditure is age related – pensions in particular. Other EU member states currently have a far less favourable demographic position than us. On average 16% of other member states' populations are aged 65 plus whereas only 11% of our population is in this age group. This means, for example, that other EU member states have to spend much more to provide the same level of pensions and health services as us. If one takes account of these factors, our spending ratio is much closer to the EU average. Because I have managed our budgetary affairs prudently over the years, we now spend far less on debt service than others – about €1,000 less per household per annum.There has been much talk of cutbacks and curtailment. I want once again to remind this House of the scale of investment in our public services in recent years. I am proud that our growth rates since 1997 have allowed us to spend more on public services than has ever been possible before. In fact, we have had the highest rate of increase in public spending of all EU member states over that period. Spending on day-to-day public services here rose three times as fast as in the average EU member state between 1997 and 2002.Inevitably, at Estimates time, many figures are quoted and the scale of overall spending can be lost in the detail. It bears repeating therefore that the abridged Estimates provide for total gross expenditure next year of €36.7 billion. This is nearly double the amount spent in 1997. Current spending will be over €31 billion compared to €17 billion in 1997. Since I became Minister for Finance, funding for the health service has increased by €5.3 billion, education spending has increased by €2.4 billion and social welfare spending has increased by €4 billion. Capital investment next year will be over €5 billion compared with only €2 billion in 1997.Taking account of the Estimates figures just published and before any budget day allocations, public expenditure will have increased at an average of about 13 % per annum over the period 2001 to 2003. We are now operating from a high spending base which will allow us to continue to deliver high levels of public services.This Government's philosophy is to share our economic success with the Irish people. We have used resources wisely to reform our tax system, invest in our public services, reduce our debt and establish the national pensions reserve fund to safeguard the pensions of this and future generations.I have said many times since the publication of the Estimates that spending must be prioritised. It is not possible to afford the same priority to each sector. The debate in the Lower House was characterised by long lists of high priority programmes which Deputies believed should be granted more resources. Constructive opposition might be expected to signal what areas of expenditure are of a lower priority. Yet no one seems prepared to propose reductions in even one specific spending programme. This Government has the courage to make difficult choices. We have decided to continue to provide substantial funding in 2003 for health, social welfare, education and transport infrastructure. Inevitably this has required a tighter approach in other areas.One thing I have learned from my time as Minister for Finance is that money alone is not the answer to delivering top quality public services. If it were, we would have solved all our problems by now. The funding which this Government has provided since 1997 has produced substantial benefits for the people of this country. However, we all agree that there is scope for securing better value for money through more effective control and management of public expenditure.In my speech to the Dáil on Tuesday, I outlined a number of improvements to the financial management systems which I will introduce from the beginning of next year. Briefly, I expect Ministers and their management advisory committees to manage within the allocations given to them. I intend to publish the yearly spending profiles which are submitted to my Department at the start of the year to facilitate a more informed assessment of emerging spending trends. I will continue to submit monthly expenditure management reports to Government, reporting on overall spending and revenue trends.I want to see improvements in risk assessment measures and the introduction of contingency planning to cater for unforeseen pressures which may emerge as the year progresses. I want spending on demand led schemes to be managed effectively, just like other spending programmes. I am introducing revised arrangements for managing capital spending which will provide details of all capital projects being initiated during 2003 and planned for the following four years. I also want to provide incentives for Departments to improve efficiency and cost effectiveness. For example, where Departments secure savings as a result of efficiency measures or steps they have taken to curtail a programme, these savings should, as a general rule, be available for other high priority programmes within the same Department.While these control measures are very important in their own right they are also designed to encourage public service managers to seek out and exploit greater efficiencies. A number of initiatives are already in place which will help put the spotlight on value for money issues, including the management information framework, the expenditure review process and the forthcoming mid-term evaluation of the national development plan. I am aware, however, that more needs to be done.For a number of years now a three year planning horizon has been in place for public expenditure. I want to develop this further to give greater certainty to Departments in relation to planned allocations over the medium term. I have already introduced a five year financial envelope in the public transport sector to facilitate greater planning and more effective management of expenditure. My Department is currently considering whether a similar approach can be applied in other large capital spending areas. Ministers and Secretaries General are responsible for managing spending within their area and I want to give them the maximum flexibility to do so effectively. Greater delegation must be coupled with greater accountability. The public has a right to see whether it is getting value for money. I want to see a greater focus on results and outputs achieved.Many points have been raised about specific aspects of the Estimates but I would like to comment on three particular issues – infrastructural investment, health spending and housing. There has been a lot of loose talk to the effect that the Government has abandoned the national development plan. Nothing could be further from the truth. Investment in NDP economic and social infrastructure will exceed €12 billion over the period 2000 to 2003. This is €700 million above what was promised under the plan even after taking account of actual inflation in the construction industry over that period.The evidence of this is visible throughout the country as infrastructural projects, especially in the transport and environment areas, of a scale never before seen in Ireland, are either under construction or at various stages of planning. In 2003 alone the Government will invest almost €3.4 billion in the NDP economic and social infrastructural programme. I would like to have been able to provide more, but investment, too, must be subject to overall budgetary policy.I have commented before on the high level of construction inflation in recent years. I am disappointed that this has eroded the output being delivered in return for this massive level of investment. The taxpayer cannot be expected to write a blank cheque to meet cost increases generated within the construction sector. The rate of inflation in the sector is now reducing to more acceptable levels and I expect to see greater value for money and improved output from the capital investment in 2003 than has been the case in recent years.Another misconception being peddled is that the 6% increase in health spending next year will not match an alleged 10% health service inflation rate. This is a fundamentally flawed view and the conclusion drawn is incorrect. I will not bore Senators with the details, but the 10% rate of inflation being cited refers to part of the consumer price index. A simplistic comparison of this CPI based data with the rate of increase in the Vote for the Department of Health and Children is both inappropriate and misleading. Some 70% of health spending is pay or pay related. It is not driven by the CPI measurement of health inflation. The 2003 abridged Estimates include adequate provision for the carryover costs from 2002 of the PPF pay terms. As I indicated, I will be dealing with the pay implications of any further increases on budget day. The remaining 30% or so of health spending covers a myriad of different elements ranging from food, light and heat to high technology, drugs and equipment. The increased abridged Estimates volume provision is intended to ensure the existing level of health services is broadly maintained in 2003 and allows for some limited expansion of high priority areas such as cancer treatment.The new house grants scheme was introduced in its present form in 1977. The main purpose of the grant was to encourage new house building. For this reason first-time purchasers who bought an existing house did not qualify for the grant. In 1977 only 17,000 or so new private houses were being built. Last year private housing output amounted to over 47,000 units. The level of home ownership in Ireland is about 80%, the highest in Europe by some margin. First-time buyers now account for about 40% of all purchases. The abolition of the grant is not intended simply to generate savings for the Exchequer. The intention is that the funding devoted to the grant will in future be allocated to the local authority and social housing programme. Over the lifetime of the Government this could involve up to €200 million.In recent years a range of better targeted schemes to assist low income purchasers and those with social housing needs have been put in place. Between 1998 and 2001 the provision of social and affordable housing has grown by 35% to 11,385 units and a further increase to almost 13,000 units is forecast in 2002. In addition to an Exchequer investment of over €1 billion in housing in 2003, a further €680 million will also be available from local authorities' own resources and advances by the Housing Financing Agency. In total, over €1.6 billion will be available for social housing compared with €1.5 billion in 2002.I recognise the impact which the abolition of the new house grant will have on individuals planning to buy a new house. However, in current circumstances, it is essential to look carefully at every expenditure programme to see whether the costs are still justified in the light of changes in circumstances during the years. Most commentators recognise that the new house grant has outlived any usefulness it had as an economic incentive. We, as politicians, are very fond of talking about the need to establish clear criteria for spending programmes and the need to introduce better evaluation of those spending programmes. If we are really honest with ourselves, the new house grant is a classic example of a scheme which was introduced for a specific purpose at a particular time and which has since been overtaken by changing circumstances.The economy is in good shape and a good position to deal with the current slowdown. The Government did not take decisions on the 2003 Estimates lightly. This is not some form of technical accounting exercise to balance the books. It is a necessary step to ensure our continued prosperity. We want to continue to foster the economic conditions to create wealth and jobs. We cannot do so through high taxation or high borrowing. The only way forward is to have an ongoing sustainable match between revenue and expenditure. The 2003 Estimates will set us on that path.
#JimHiggins	unknown-#JimHiggins-party	unknown-#JimHiggins-dob	unknown-#JimHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-21 00:00:00	Prelude	62	In spite of what the Minister said, the contents of the Book of Estimates have little, if anything, to do with the slowdown in world economic growth. Last May the Minister and his Government colleagues perpetrated the biggest con job on the electorate since 1977. In that year the Minister's Fianna Fáil predecessors and their infamous manifesto wrecked an economy, which then took 15 years to repair. It abolished rates on domestic dwellings and motor taxation in one fell swoop. The buzz-word at the time was "pump-priming" the economy. Instead of pump-priming the economy, it wrecked it. The then so-called Minister for Economic Planning and Development, Mr. Martin O'Donoghue, went down in annals of history as the architect of this catastrophe.History will be equally damning in relation to the economic performance of the Minister for Finance. The last general election was a replica of the one in 1977, possibly even worse. It was preceded by a splurge of spending that has left the coffers empty, married to a plethora of promises, each of which has now been shamelessly discarded, abandoned and thrown on the scrap heap leaving the economy in tatters. To an extent, I am delighted the chickens have come home to roost and the people who once again blindly voted for the promises of Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrat have now been left to rue the day. They now realise they were duped. The chickens have well and truly come home to roost, but instead of laying any golden eggs, they are leaving behind glugger after glugger.The Minister for Finance will go down in history as the Minister who brought the much envied Celtic tiger to its knees. If somebody in the private sector perpetrated the fraud that the Minister for Finance perpetrated and wasted billions of money that was not his own, he or she would be charged, hauled before the courts and convicted of reckless trading and possibly even end up in jail.Having fooled the electorate in order to win the general election and get back into power the Minister devised a clear political strategy – two or possibly three bad years of drastic economic cut-backs followed by two more years of splurge and give-away before the next general election based on the premise that people would forgive and forget. However, the people will not forgive and forget because public anger and revulsion at the manner in which they were conned is such that those who trusted him and bought into his policies are likely to be anything but forgiving come the next general election.In 1977 people bought into the Fianna Fáil manifesto and gave Fianna Fáil a 20 seat majority. The electorate waited for four years from 1977 to 1981 and dumped the party unceremoniously out of office. It never forgave the Labour Party for jumping into bed with Fianna Fáil in 1992, despite its semi-redemption by participating in the three part rainbow Government, and in 1997 exacted a devastating revenge. On this occasion it will wait patiently and menacing in the long grass for 2005 or 2006 in order to exact the same revenge.The Minister probably does not have time to listen to radio chat shows, but if he tuned into "Today with Pat Kenny," he would hear the daily legion of callers, many of them traditional Fianna Fáil supporters palpably angry and vowing that never again will they support that party or the Progressive Democrats. They have every right to be angry when they consider what was promised so clearly and unequivocally last May. There were no ifs, buts or maybes. Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats in government were going to deliver even better times ahead.The Progressive Democrats Party stated in regard to education that it would do the following:– ensure that every primary school reaches and is maintained at an acceptable, explicit national standard within three years. The primary school building capital programme will increase to over €200 million within three years. The budget for second level school building will increase to more than €250 million within the lifetime of the Government.Not to be outdone, Fianna Fáil promised it would do the following:–continue our policy of implementing significant increases in direct school funding. We will build on the unprecedented investment which we have made in school buildings, to ensure that every school attains modern standards within the next five years. We will continue our unprecedented programme to modernise third level buildings throughout the country.What has happened? Last Thursday, the Minister for Finance cut capital investment in primary education by 4%, in secondary education by 10% and in third level education by 29%. Third level fees have also been introduced by way of a huge hike in registration fees. All the promises made by Ministers and Government Deputies to individual communities regarding the elimination of sub-standard school buildings, many of them unhygienic and on a par with the worst in the Third World, have come to naught. Is it any wonder that teachers, parents and students are angry?On the jobs front, both Government parties were again explicit. In its election programme, the Progressive Democrats Party promised:to maintain full employment throughout our flexible labour market by providing additional support through FÁS for measures to help the long-term unemployed, older workers and women returning to paid employment. We will treble the FÁS budget for employment opportunities for people with disabilities.Again, on jobs, Fianna Fáil was not to be outdone. It promised:to establish a training fund of up to €2,500 per person for unemployed people facing very serious barriers to employment. We will extend, on a permanent basis, the employment action plan to all persons on the live register for longer than six months and to other marginalized and disadvantaged groups. FÁS will continue to provide training and employment, especially for unemployed people and for people entering the jobs market.Can one doubt the frustration and disillusionment of the jobless, older workers, women workers and the marginalised when last Thursday, instead of all the enhancement and promotional programmes, the Minister announced that IDA grants had been cut by 44%, Enterprise Ireland grants by 38%, FÁS supports by 41%, community enterprise schemes by 5,000 places and the back to work scheme by 31%?On public transport, the Progressive Democrats Party promised that the two Luas lines would be on schedule to open for service by the end of 2003 and the network would be expanded so that three additional sections would be operational by 2006. There was also a clear commitment to the provision of a national waterways system. Fianna Fáil, for its part, was strong on the idea of lower pricing for public transport around peak travel times. Dublin light rail would be introduced between Tallaght and Connolly Stations and between Sandyford and St. Stephen's Green on schedule by October 2003. The party was fully committed to implementing the national roads programme provided for in the national development plan.These are all noble aspirations – if only they were genuine. What has happened to Luas? It has been deferred for another year and the cuts in infrastructural investment mean there will be no new road starts in 2003. Instead of cheaper fares, the Minister for Transport announced a 9% increase in CIE fares to compensate for the Minister for Finance's cut in Exchequer funding for the company.Tourism has taken a terrible hit over the past two years. In its manifesto, the Progressive Democrats Party promised further funding for tourism, particularly in marketing. The Fianna Fáil programme went even further: "Fianna Fail will restore Irish tourism to a planned annual growth path of 5% per annum by continued investment." Conversely, the Minister for Finance has cut Bord Fáilte's grant by 20% in the Estimates and the Tourism Ireland administration budget has been cut by 3%. Funding for the National Gallery, cultural projects, heritage and the National Museum – all major tourism attractions – has been cut by between 4% and 26%.One of the biggest areas of social concern has been the huge increase in violent crime. On average, two people die in violent circumstances each week. Street violence has spiralled out of control. All political parties recognise that crucial to combating violence and protecting the security of the ordinary citizen is an increase in garda numbers. Both Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats gave a clear unequivocal commitment that they would increase the strength of the Garda Síochána by 2,000 personnel. Last Thursday, the Minister for Finance announced that there would be no funding allocation for increased garda numbers, so the spiral of violence is set not alone to continue but to get considerably worse. More people will die on our streets and end up in hospital, the victims of unprovoked attacks. This is yet another broken Government promise.One of the frightening developments in the modern, so-called progressive Ireland has been the increase in racism and xenophobia. All parties recognise the need to put in place anti-racism measures. According to the Progressive Democrats Party, it is "determined to prevent the rise of racism in this country and we will continue to implement anti-racism awareness programmes." One of the truly frightening developments on election night was the fact that a Fianna Fáil TD, who openly tried to stir up public emotions with a series of blatantly racist comments, headed the poll in his constituency. Perhaps prompted by the embarrassment of having such a Deputy on its team, Fianna Fáil promised to review the campaigns designed to promote tolerance and understanding between the settled and Traveller communities and maintain multi-annual funding for targeted programmes. However, last Thursday, the Minister reviewed the campaigns by going in – not with a scalpel but a slash hook – and slashing the racism awareness campaign budget by a whopping 63% and cutting funding to the national consultative committee on racism and inter-culturalism by 5%. All of this following the scrapping of the Citizen Traveller programme.The inability of low income or medium income couples to obtain housing accommodation was one of the most damning indictments of the performance of Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats during their five years in government. To belatedly address the problem, the Progressive Democrats Party promised it would increase social housing output by increasing the local authority housing programme through funding for 40,000 new start-ups, front-loaded to meet existing demand more quickly. There would be an increase in the subsidy levels on an annual basis for the shared ownership and affordable and voluntary housing schemes. Fianna Fáil likewise committed itself to a further expansion of the various social housing programmes, setting a target of meeting the housing needs of 15,000 households per annum.Instead of more money being pumped into the various local authority social housing programmes as promised, the Minister for Finance cut the local authority programmes by 5%, but the big bombshell was the abolition of the €3,510 first-time buyer's grant. I was amused by the Minister's comment that it had outlived its usefulness. It is a move the Minister and the two Government parties will rue – and all for a mere saving of €39 million. In one fell swoop, the Minister shattered the dreams of many young couples. The sum of €3,510 might be small change in the pocket of the Minister and his colleagues but to people struggling to get their toe on the first rung of the housing ladder it is a devastating blow for which the Minister and his colleagues will never be forgiven.Likewise in health, the Minister and his colleagues have totally reneged on their promises. According to Fianna Fáil, they would implement the national health strategy through a co-ordinated multi-annual programme of service development and would permanently end hospital waiting lists within two years. The Progressive Democrats would review medical card eligibility for people with long-term illnesses to assess whether the needs of all people with long-term illnesses were being met and extend medical card eligibility to over 200,000 extra people. What has happened? Medical card eligibility is not to be extended and the expectations of 200,000 potential beneficiaries have been shattered. Private beds in public hospitals will now cost 10% more and twice within a matter of months the drugs payment scheme charges have been increased.The Minister for Finance stands indicted of delivering a kick in the groin to the economy – a kick which has left election promises in shreds. What we have had is not the delivery of Governnment programmes but a litany of broken promises.
#DrMartinMansergh	unknown-#DrMartinMansergh-party	unknown-#DrMartinMansergh-dob	unknown-#DrMartinMansergh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-21 00:00:00	Prelude	63	One judges the implementation of a programme after five years rather than five months. All political programmes are, as it were, best case scenarios of what one intends to fulfil as and when circumstances allow. In the last five years, in many ways, many pledges were over-fulfilled. Sometimes, one has to take one step back in order to take two steps forward.Today, we are dealing with the abridged Book of Estimates which is the first in five stages to be followed by the budget and the revised Book of Estimates. After that comes what the Minister, Deputy McCreevy, referred to in his letter to Deputy Michael Noonan on 13 May as mid-summer adjustments because of underspending in some areas and overspending in others – a passage which, of course, is never quoted. Then, in late autumn, there is a further issue of the Book of Estimates with an estimated outturn and, possibly, Supplementary Estimates and, finally, the actual outturn. Clearly, it is a long process. At this stage, pending the outturn for this year, we do not know if the increase in expenditure is 2%. In particular, the social welfare spending and what arises from the pay round are not yet dealt with.The Minister has created space for pay negotiations and benchmarking discussions with the social partners. I welcome that. Social partnership has worked exceptionally well over the last 15 years and has been one of the main ingredients of the most spectacular catch-up to have taken place in any OECD country over the past 40 years, only exceeded by Japan and Germany in the immediate post-war years. Coming from the public service – and I suppose Oireachtas Members are also public servants in a sense – I believe in a well remunerated public service. A very good example of that is to be found in the education budget which includes reasonably well paid teachers who are the most important element in the system. The Government has not got a monopoly of wisdom. The input of the social partners, as well as that of Europe, means that we have a governed country and a broad consensus on what needs to be done.Steering an economy, like steering a boat, cannot ignore weather conditions. Much of the debate on the Estimates simply disregards economic circumstances which have worsened considerably over the past two years. There has been a downturn in the world economy and, during last spring and early summer – which also happened to be the time of the general election – there were hopes of a lift this year. However, the international gloom has set in again and, possibly, the uncertainty as to what will happen in relation to Iraq is part of that. Another aspect left out of account is the fact that the economy is still running fairly close to full capacity with virtually full employment, taking the country as a whole, although, of course, there are still pockets of serious unemployment. That is reflected in the inflation rate which, at about 4%, is currently the highest in the European Union. Arguments for higher Government spending against the background of a huge increase in public spending over the last five years, tends to overlook the fact that we are operating at nearly full capacity.It can be argued that trying to do too much at once in the national development programme contributed to driving up inflation, giving us less bang for our buck. Compared to the past, we have a very healthy economy, with positive growth, near full employment, the second lowest public debt in the EU compared to the second highest 15 years ago and a tax system which does not place a huge burden on anyone. We have the conditions for a dynamic economy. The overriding need is to keep the economy on the rails and hold on, as far as we can, to the huge gains of the last five years in what will clearly be much more difficult conditions. It is not a big demand on any one Department, given the huge increases of the last five years, to have to hasten slowly. The maxim of less haste, more speed also applies to economic management.Vastly more is being done in most areas than even two or three years ago, accepting that, for the moment, some ambitions have to be put on hold. The public capital programme, at €8.6 billion, is still double the 1998 level. For example, compared to the 1997 level, capital spending has increased threefold on roads and transport, fourfold on housing and more than threefold on hospital building and education. Those who now say we should have spent less were previously urging us to spend even more. Now that we are in more normal times, economic management will need to take more account of the cycle, which may have seemed to be more or less suspended for a period. Nevertheless, given the choice, I believe most of us would have opted for the very exciting and exhilarating period of the last five years rather than, say, the very cautious, prudent and almost dour style of management of the Chancellor of the Exchequer across the water.People complain that they cannot see the results of Government spending. In some cases, that is a fair point but if one takes transport infrastructure, there is a huge number of important projects under way and we will see the real fruits of that over the next two or three years, such as the Dublin port tunnel, the Luas, the motorway to the Border, the Kildare bypass and so on. With regard to current spending, the increase in old age pensions and child benefit were deeply appreciated, as evidenced by our experience on the doorsteps last May. To have reached near full employment is a major achievement.Expenditure control is important. I am firmly convinced that quality of expenditure is not solely a function of ever increasing budgets. From time to time, it is healthy to have a pause for more efficient operation. Ministers who accept and work within their budgets and who can operate with only small increases do not always get enough credit for that. In some areas, one can operate with a smaller budget. At a relatively minuscule level, my former role in the Department of the Taoiseach included co-administering a small commemoration fund which was cut from £300,000 to about £50,000 but was, nonetheless, adequate for the purpose and still gave very beneficial support to projects on one sixth of the original budget. No doubt we could have spent more but not necessarily with proportionate benefit.  I urge the Minister not to fall into the trap of employing more administrators to supervise budget expenditure. For example, in third level education in Britain there is a vast amount of form filling, cross-checking and reviews which do not necessarily produce a better education system but end up costing more.I believe the Government will do all in its power to minimise hardship to those most affected by changes in the Estimates. In particular, in the context of the budget and in relation to first-time buyers who should be the priority of housing policy, I hope steps will be taken to ensure there is a level playing field as between those purchasing their own homes and investors.In the last five years, we have had the biggest increase in public spending in the history of the State. There was money for many things not possible in the past. There is no doubt that a sound economy is the best passport to improved services in the future. There is no virtue in getting into hock to bankers. Good and caring government is not just a function of those who can sound most caring in a soulful sense but those who can make the right decisions. It is not just a question of redistributing wealth, although that is important and is taken as a given, but creating it. Socialist instincts, which I admit I have, can lead one astray.The strategic management initiative, introduced by Albert Reynolds as Taoiseach, was inspired by the New Zealand model. I fear that what has happened to it is straight out of "Yes Minister". It may have produced some useful reforms but savings on costs and numbers in the public service are not among them. I do not believe that the top pay in the public service should be the same as in industry. If people want to make money they should go into business. There is an ethos of public service which should not be denigrated. Disproportionate increases at or near the top, and I must admit that I benefited from those when I was in the public service, are demoralising to people lower down the scale. I am not in favour of elitism. I think that Ministers, and indeed the Taoiseach, should be paid more than top civil servants rather than the other way around. Otherwise there may be a misleading impression as to who is really in charge.A good Minister for Finance should be impervious to public and political abuse but not to reasoned argument. This Minister will go down in history as one of the great Ministers for Finance. In terms of political longevity he has some way to go to outpace Doctor Jim Ryan, Sean McEntee and Ernest Blythe. To paraphrase Kipling's famous poem, If, if ministerial colleagues are grumbling, if the Taoiseach is shaking his head, if advisers are looking worried, if members of the parliamentary party are mutinous, if there are tirades by columnists and ideological brickbats from political opponents who want to advance the argument that only the rich benefit from economic progress, if there is censure from an EU Commissioner and all the untoward developments that markets can throw up must be coped with, then indeed you have an effective Minister for Finance.The abridged Estimates are a strong start to a new Administration, showing that it intends to keep a firm grip on the economy and steer it through difficult times. That was the fundamental mandate given to Fianna Fail in this election. I have every confidence that the Celtic Tiger will not go the way of the Asian tigers. The belief in our ability to manage the economy was the principal reason that we were re-elected, the first Government in 30 years to be re-elected.
#FergalQuinn	unknown-#FergalQuinn-party	unknown-#FergalQuinn-dob	unknown-#FergalQuinn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-21 00:00:00	Prelude	64	I wish to share my time with Senators Norris and Ross. I welcome the Minister of State. The Minister for Finance's paper and his speech were very interesting. I agree with much of it, particularly when he said that the Government has the courage to make difficult choices. I will concentrate on the areas where I disagree with the Minister. Margaret Thatcher said that there was no alternative in the ‘80s . I believe there are alternatives.The Minister mentioned value for money. There is a tradition in the Department of Finance which does not look at value for money in the way that others look at it. Value for money, in the case of a business or an individual, means asking whether if we put an amount of money into something we will get value out of it. In business we would use key performance indicators to measure whether money spent resulted in the waiting lists actually reducing. If we can measure them we can we see if we are getting value for money. The Department of Finance say that if they provide a budget of €X , value for money is sticking to the budget and not going beyond it. I do not get a sense that they measure value on the basis of key performance indicators, such as hospital waiting lists. I read and listened to the Minister. He gave instances of seven different items of value for money, all of which involved staying within a budget and being encouraged to do so rather than looking for value for money. We have a difference of opinion as to what value for money is.There are other ways of looking at it. One of the areas is the decision to take 1% of GNP for the national pension fund every year no matter how well the economy is doing. I supported that at the time but I now realise that it was too inflexible. In good years we should invest more than 1%. In other years we should put in less than that because we need to get better value for money. This is one of the years when we should not invest in the fund. This is not easy to do, but a firm, determined, committed Government can make the changes, even if it means making tough decisions. The Minister said that he has the courage to make the decisions and that is one step. We are paying €1 billion per year into the fund. That is the correct thing to do in the good years that Senator Mansergh talked about. We could make a dramatic change in this area.Another area is the special savings incentive scheme. I supported it and was taking credit for being one of those who said two years ago that we should encourage people to spend less because there is inflation and encourage them to save more. The Minister responded with what I thought was a very good scheme, perhaps generous. It now seems incorrect. We should have the courage to admit mistakes. I think we should scrap it and say that we are sorry we got it wrong.I come from a business in which a special offer is expected to sell a certain amount. If you realise that you have misjudged how much you will sell, you save while stocks last. In this case the stocks have not lasted, they will not last. We should admit to making a mistake, apologise and cancel the scheme. This takes legislation and the Government will be accused of letting people down, having coaxed them into it. The signs say that it is the wealthy who are putting money into it and that child benefit payments are being invested in it because the recipients are well enough off.It is incorrect to give equal child benefit to everyone. The very wealthy get the same amount as those who are not well off. The Government should face up to this and do something about it, whether by a means test or tax.This area alone, without touching on the value for money aspect, will save €2 billion this year and provide this amount to do other things. I hope this would take account of what the Minister said about courage and would emphasise the investment structure. We would then look for value for money when making decisions. The Minister has time, not much time, to consider this. We should consider it now and do some of the things that we want to do. We cannot do them all. I agree with the Minister that the Opposition will always criticise without saying what it would do. These are areas where we could act. The other one, value for money, hangs over all of them. If the Minster grabs hold of that opportunity he will go down, as Senator Mansergh said, as one of the great Ministers for Finance.
#ShaneRoss	unknown-#ShaneRoss-party	unknown-#ShaneRoss-dob	unknown-#ShaneRoss-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-21 00:00:00	Prelude	65	I congratulate Senator Quinn on having done two U-turns out of three. It is a time for U-turns because the economy has turned. I was not among those who welcomed the national pensions reserve fund as I believed it would be the first fund that people would suggest should be raided when times got tough. That is exactly what is happening. Everybody else supported the scheme at the time and told me not to worry about the fund being raided because it was to be sacrosanct. Now is the time to raid it. It does not make sense to continue to put money into a fund that has lost almost one third of its value, while borrowing money and sustaining the national debt. What sort of economic nonsense was behind the idea in the first place? We are now completely exposed because Opposition spokespersons are asking the Minister to raid the fund.If there is any criticism to be made in relation to the Estimates, like Senator Quinn, I suggest that it is the Opposition that should be criticised, not the Government. The Government's approach to our problems is absolutely right. Each of us may face problems on the micro-level, as a result of the abolition of the first-time buyer's grant or the fact that Trinity College is to be hit, which is a particular concern of mine. We can quarrel with such micro-issues, but the Minister for Finance is right on the macro-issues. Senator Quinn is correct when he says Deputy McCreevy has the ability and the capacity to be a great Minister in bad times and in good. It is likely that he will be seen as a great Minister if he continues on this road. His attitude is correct because he is recognising the realities and facing political difficulties head on. He is trying to balance the budget and it may come right for him over three or four years.I do not agree with some of the cuts that have been made. The real problem is being caused by benchmarking, the unspoken word. Everybody seems to think it is right to spend €1.1 billion on those who have safe jobs while others suffer, even though it makes no ethical or economic sense. The benchmarking committee was established to report on 30 June this year. What a coincidence that the report was scheduled to appear after the general election. It kept the trade unions, trade union leaders and trade union members happy for long enough to carry the Government beyond the general election.The Government cannot pay for the benchmarking explosion and will not do so. It will disguise the failure to pay in all sorts of language which will eventually result in another pay deal. ICTU will demand this, that and the other and walk out of the talks a couple of times before Christmas. There will be drama in Government Buildings, but another national pay deal will emerge. ICTU will say benchmarking is being met and others will say it is not. There will be a pay pause of some sort and all concerned will be happy with whatever eventually comes out of the pot. The public finances will suffer, however, because too much money is being paid to public servants. Everybody knows that this is the real problem, but politicians do not have the guts to stand up to vested interest groups because they yield too many votes. That is a shame because other areas of the public service have to suffer unnecessarily.I do not understand one or two things. I do not understand the reason one or two areas are sacrosanct and FÁS has a budget of €2 billion per year. I always thought that it was established to solve the unemployment problem when about 300,000 were out of work. Unemployment is now very low, but the numbers on FÁS programmes are increasing all the time. I do not understand the reason its budget is going up as the number of unemployed persons decreases. Nobody will examine or challenge this phenomenon.Enterprise Ireland is another example of an agency which is not analysed to see if it is providing value for money. How much money are we getting back from the firms and companies subsidised by Enterprise Ireland? What is the return on our investment, in the form of subsidies, in CIE, FÁS, Bord Bia and Bord Glas? Is there a case for retaining these State bodies anymore? This area should have been tackled in the Estimates.
#DavidNorris	unknown-#DavidNorris-party	unknown-#DavidNorris-dob	unknown-#DavidNorris-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-21 00:00:00	Prelude	66	I am grateful to my colleagues for sharing time with me. I am at a disadvantage when I find myself agreeing with Senators Quinn and Ross, as I like to disagree with them to make things more exciting. I particularly agree with the Senators' support for the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, and their criticism of the Opposition. I admire my great friend, Senator Higgins, as a superb speaker, but I was rather taken aback when I heard him say he was delighted that the Government's chickens were coming home to roost. I do not think I would like to adopt such an attitude in terms of the national interest. If chickens are coming home to roost, I greatly regret it. We should make sure, as far as possible, that it does not happen. We should stick together and abandon the auction politics that was prevalent across the political spectrum during the last general election campaign.The Government is not the only element of the State's political life that was involved. I listened to "Tonight with Vincent Browne" last night. The presenter could not extract a single public acknowledgement of a cut from any contributor to the programme, including representatives of Fine Gael and Sinn Féin.
#ShaneRoss	unknown-#ShaneRoss-party	unknown-#ShaneRoss-dob	unknown-#ShaneRoss-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-21 00:00:00	Prelude	67	Hear, hear.
#DavidNorris	unknown-#DavidNorris-party	unknown-#DavidNorris-dob	unknown-#DavidNorris-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-21 00:00:00	Prelude	68	As I said last night, I met the Minister for Finance in the corridor after this year's general election. I told him that he had been a good Minister for Finance and that he had an opportunity to be a great one by breaking every single election promise. I want to modify that statement a little by saying there is one promise that should not be broken. The Government should keep its promise to extend medical cards to children, as such a measure is necessary. I would also like a commitment from the Minister that we will meet our obligations in terms of overseas development aid. We made an honourable vow to meet the UN target of 0.7% of GNP and were on target before this year's blip. A commitment that the shortfall will be met is necessary. I accept that 18 months of punishment is planned to get the country's finances back on track and think the Minister is capable of doing it.While I agree with Senator Ross in relation to benchmarking, I would also like to defend my colleague, Senator O'Toole. He was much pilloried for comparing benchmarking to an ATM, but it was a valid comparison. An ATM gobbled up my card some time ago and when no light went on, I went into the bank to make a complaint. I was thrown unceremoniously onto the street. I cannot think of anything which more exactly resembles what I would like to see happening to benchmarking. In his colourful way, Senator O'Toole has once more hit the nail smack on its head. I agree with Senator Mansergh about the importance of social partnership. Our remarkably successful economy has resulted from the degree of agreement and consensus we enjoy and I hope this can be maintained in the interests of society.Two central principles which are simple to understand, even for someone who is not an economic guru like Senators Ross and Quinn, should be borne in mind. We have to cut the flab while continuing to invest in infrastructure. I do not think the Luas is going to do very much to ease the problems in Dublin and the port tunnel seems to have certain technical difficulties. The initial procedures for the construction of an underground railway must be commenced as soon as possible. Traffic in this city is always in a state of gridlock and it is only going to get worse. As surface methods of public transport cannot and will not be able to deal with the traffic problems, we have to "think big" and proceed with large projects. Unfortunately, certain prestige projects like what has been called, in a slightly cheap shot, the Bertie bowl will have to be scrapped. I wish we had the opportunity to promote such ventures, but we do not. We have to invest in projects that will improve the overall standard of our infrastructure.I agree with Senator Ross, in part, about pensions. The Minister is obviously preparing us for a cessation of investment in long-term pensions. He said, "a lot of expenditure is age related – pensions in particular" and mentioned that "16% of other member states' populations are aged 65 plus whereas only 11% of our population is in this age group." It seems that he has sent a clear signal that he is going to stop investing in pensions for the time being. This is the time to do so, based on a judgment of the market.I am in several pension schemes, including one in Trinity College. I put in accelerated voluntary contributions which were worth £16,000 last year. However, when I received a statement the other day the figure had decreased to £12,000, thanks to the glorious investment policy. As Senator Ross said, it is absolutely mad to invest when one could take the cash and shove it in where it would do good.We should get rid of the health boards because they are an absolute disgrace. They exist only for political patronage purposes. They are utterly unnecessary and a complete waste of time. We are wasting money on administration while we are not putting it into direct treatment and drugs for patients.
#TomMorrissey	unknown-#TomMorrissey-party	unknown-#TomMorrissey-dob	unknown-#TomMorrissey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-21 00:00:00	Prelude	69	Having listened to the previous contributions we can now see how difficult it is to manage the problems we are facing. I suppose one could say the problems we are trying to solve have been created by ourselves. One could possibly argue the last Government was beginning to lose its grip by spending money in areas where it should not have done. For example, we were going to have a £1 billion stadium and an underground metro leading to it but no one said where the money would come from.What has been done in the area of health in the past few years? As Senator Norris said, we set up several health boards in Dublin, filled them with councillors from throughout Dublin and the country and we are now afraid to abolish them. What did these health boards do to deliver a service? The special savings scheme was introduced. Wealthy people are transferring the children's allowance into that account in order to get 25% extra in a couple of years' time to pay off their mortgages. I know of several people who are doing this and are laughing at the system.There is the question of benchmarking. I and others in this House operate in the private sector. I wish people in the private sector had pension entitlements for life and letters of comfort. However, those of us who operate in the private sector know we are benchmarked from here to Malaysia on an hourly and daily basis. Unfortunately, this is not the case in the public service.A Member spoke earlier about FÁS which was established to look after the long-term unemployed. The LES scheme was introduced in Dublin in the mid-1990s to look after the long-term unemployed. There are four LES offices in Blanchardstown where the unemployment rate has fallen drastically. As a business person who operates in Blanchardstown and who has gone to FÁS each year, I have failed to get an applicant through LES or FÁS. I get phone calls from recruitment agencies in Lithuania where people see the same jobs advertised by FÁS in Dublin. When one rings the LES offices in Dublin, the first question one is asked is whether the job on offer is full-time and permanent. That is the philosophy under which these public service offices operate.I would like the Government to look again at reform in all these areas, including reform of the health service by abolishing health boards. I welcome the Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children, Deputy Callely, to the House. I would like to see reform of the public transport system by the dismantling of CIE, reform of the education system and reform of the public services in general.In 1997, it cost the Government less than €17 billion to run the country. Today it is costing €32 billion, an increase of almost 100%. We must look at value for money, including the margin of return on every euro spent from now on. There appear to be two views among media commentators and Opposition politicians in regard to the state of the public finances: one view is that the rate of growth in public expenditure has been far too high and should be brought under control and the other is that the rate of growth in public spending is too low and should currently be much greater. The first criticism has been levelled constantly at the Government since the general election, and even prior to that. The second criticism has been levelled at it since the publication of the Book of Estimates. Both positions cannot be correct.It is my view that the Government has delivered generous increases in public spending over the past five years. It did so for two reasons, first, because there were major deficiencies in the whole system of public provision and, second, the resources became available as a result of economic growth and sound fiscal management. For those of us who operate in the private sector, if the resources are not in place one cannot spend the money. One does not borrow willy nilly without considering the margin of return. Therefore, I welcome the Government's decision to keep borrowing under control.The House will recall in 1997 that the old age pension for a single person was less than £100 per week. Funding for the health service was approximately one third of what it is now and funding for people with disabilities was a fraction of its current level. Are we to continue spending at that rate? Those of us who operate in the private sector know the economy cannot continue to grow at 10% without capacity constraints. There is full employment but there will be other issues.The Government has put improved resources into public services and into boosting public provision and I believe it has no apology to make for the increases in pensions or child benefit. It would be useful for those who say that public spending is too high to indicate where it is too high and where cuts should be made. It appears that people now want higher levels of spending in each area of Government activity, including health, education and transport, but they also want the overall level of Government spending to be reduced. This is clearly an unsustainable argument. People should recognise that great social progress has been made over the past five years. Some 380,000 extra people have been employed and the long-term rate of unemployment has been reduced to approximately 4%. It should be recognised also that we must cut our cloth according to our measure. That means moderating the rate of growth in public expenditure at a time when the rate of growth in the economy is also moderating.Senator Higgins seems to be in denial that this is a small trading nation. He does not accept that the difficulties have been created because the level of taxation from large multinationals has fallen because their level of output has been reduced in the global market. In the current economic circumstances we must cut our cloth according to our measure. The Government is spending a lot of money running the country. However, there is a legitimate question as to whether taxpayers are getting value for money. This is why I am calling for reform of the health and transport services.I thank the Minister of State for coming to the House today.
#DerekMcDowell	unknown-#DerekMcDowell-party	unknown-#DerekMcDowell-dob	unknown-#DerekMcDowell-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-21 00:00:00	Prelude	70	It is a pleasure to have an opportunity to contribute to this debate and an even greater pleasure because of the presence of the Minister of State, Deputy Callely, a former constituency colleague of mine whom I am pleased to see perched on the high stool. It gives me an opportunity to refine what I was going to say and to include a few constituency jibes at the end.I was interested in what Senator Morrissey said because it reflects in large measure the view of the Minister for Finance, that when one has the money one should spend it and when one does not have the money one should not spend it. This may be very well in the private sector but it is not the way to run an economy. It is, in fact, a procyclical policy and I do not believe in procyclical economics. Clearly the Minister takes him at face value. He clearly believes, for example, that when the economy is doing well, one should stoke it, even though the obvious and inevitable result is that it produces inflation, including the sort of inflation in the construction sector which will inevitably mean less value for money. He clearly believes that in the current circumstances one should take money out of the economy, thereby exacerbating any depression in which we may find ourselves. This is classic procyclical economics which does not make sense.The first thing that should be done in the current circumstances is to stop digging. There is no doubt that taking money out of the economy will inevitably depress further the economy and prolong any depression. I use the word "depression" in a very loose fashion because the Minister would say that since there is no negative growth we are not in a depression, but we are clearly in a slowdown that is drastic compared to recent years. The turnaround in the economy, particularly the public finances, in the last two years must be seen a number of times to be believed. It is only two years since we had a budget surplus of €3,178 million. This year we are on target for a deficit of €1 billion, a turnabout of €4.25 billion in just two years. It is difficult to understand how this has happened and the Government has fallen far short of a sensible explanation.Today the Opposition has been challenged to say whether the Government is spending too much and where it would spend less. It is a reasonable question. For the first three to three and a half years of the last Government I would happily have spent more and for the last two years I would have spent less, in order to end up with a more balanced path of economic development over the period of five years. While I have accused the Minister of being procyclical in his economic thinking, the economic cycle has been precisely determined by the political cycle. The Minister cut slowly, as is his instinct, in the early years and splurged at the last minute, possibly against his instincts, because of electoral demands and he was being pushed to do so by spending Ministers. He has allowed the economy to be run, not by economic considerations, but by considerations of party politics. On these grounds alone he will be judged a failure as Minister for Finance.I am sorry the Minister is not present, but I am sure his officials will pass this on. He said most spectacularly today and in the Dáil earlier this week that he still expects to come in with a 14% increase in current spending this year, notwithstanding the fact that at the end of October the figure stood at 20%. I tried to do a few sums this morning using the end of October Exchequer returns which showed that at that stage we had spent some €26.2 billion in terms of net supply of services. The overall annual budget is €29 billion, which suggests that somehow the Government will manage to get by on €2.8 billion, give or take, in the last two months of the year. Obviously, this is totally out of sync with the pattern of spending over the previous ten months, but it defies belief that he could manage to spend in a half sensible way in the last two months of the year. The Minister has been confidently saying in a number of different forums this week that he will manage it. I would like to know how, because it is not clear to me on reading the figures.This is of far more than academic interest because it determines the base for next year. We could end up spending more than €1 billion more than the €29 billion forecast for this year, by which the Minister still stands, and if we do, it means that the 2% increase projected last week will amount to a quite considerable real decrease in terms of the amount being provided for next year. The base with which we end up this year is important in determining the relationship between that figure and the amount provided for next year. I would like to know how the Minister does this.The single greatest failure in this year's Estimates is the very short-sighted cutback in capital spending. I have always taken the view, as would any sensible person looking at the development of the economy, that capital spending is critically important, not just because of the social services provided and the individual projects such as roads, but also in terms of economic development into the future. If we slow down now on roads and public transport development, we will inevitably slow economic development and hence our capacity to pay for these projects in the future. It is a self-defeating cut-back. I would not have thought that the Minister needed to be persuaded of this because he has made this argument a number of times. When cuts in health and so on were offered, with obvious immediate and painful effects, he decided to take the easier option of cutting back on and postponing investment for the future. We will come to count the cost very soon.The cuts in the roads programme are particularly to be regretted. As the Minister knows, it has taken a number of years to get it up and running. The planning phase, which we under-financed for so many years, had just been completed, with a whole range of projects through the planning stage. The route selection process took longer than we thought it would and in some cases proved to be quite controversial. In a number of cases there were tolling schemes that had to be settled with public inquiries and so on. It has taken two and a half to three years to get to where we are now and it is remarkable that having got through the whole process, in order that we are in a position to get a few projects started, the money has suddenly dried up and we cannot do it. If we could postpone the projects for a year or two, that would be fine, but I am not convinced we can.The process has been painful. In the last couple of years we managed to attract interest from contractors who bid for larger chunks of motorway than was traditionally the case. Some of them are in situ working on projects. If, come the third quarter of next year, the projects are simply not there for the people concerned to become involved in, they will lose interest and go away. This will disrupt the whole process of delivery. If there was ever a case for multi-annual budgeting, which the Minister mentioned, this is clearly it. The process of delivering a road project is long and painful: it requires changes in a development plan, a tolling scheme, planning, route selection, putting out to tender, actually building the road and then delivery. If this is interrupted at any stage, as has happened plenty of times, including in our constituency, as the Minister of State knows, the whole process becomes elongated, with the result that something is delivered ten or 15 years later which is not capable of delivering demand because demand has increased in the meantime. This is the reason the cutback in the roads programme is so short-sighted.Deputy Callely is a Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children. Before the last general election, as spokesperson on finance for my party, I had a careful look at the health strategy published by the Government about 18 months ago. It was clear that the key part of it, which needed to be delivered in an organised way over a period of years, was the capital spend. There is clearly a need for additional beds, both in the major hospitals and step-down facilities. The health strategy, in fairness to the Department of Health and Children, spelled out in considerable detail the number of beds and the facilities needed. As Minister of State with responsibility for older people, Deputy Callely will know about the requirements in step-down facilities spelled out in the document. Perhaps he can help me with this. That part of the programme, which is not the sexiest by any stretch of the imagination, is the one most likely to get cut. As we all know, having no step-down facilities results in critical beds being blocked for lengthy periods in acute hospitals with the result that they are unavailable to those who need them urgently. The problem is then backed up through the system.I do not believe the capital programme is on target. It clearly has not survived these Estimates. I hope it can be rescued between now and budget day. There was some additional money last year on budget day and I hope there will be more this year. As of now, the health strategy, particularly as it relates to the additional capacity in the capital programme, is dead. It is going nowhere. One does not have to listen to the Minister for very long to realise that he will not shed many tears over this, because he has clearly never been a fan of the health strategy.Senator Ross mentioned the pension fund. One should be slow to react to the Senator, but not only were his comments about the Opposition unfair, they were also inaccurate. He implied that the Opposition was only now suggesting that we raid the fund, never having made any comment about it earlier. I made it clear before the fund was even set up that the Labour Party did not feel that this was to be the priority in spending for the next 25 years and that we would not be bound by this. We always reserved our position. In addition, we have never suggested raiding the fund. What we suggested was that some of the annual contribution could be used in a different way. To be specific, at the last general election we suggested that it be directed towards the health capital budget. We have never suggested touching the capital within the fund.This fund will take in about €1 billion this year. It took in slightly less last year. Of the €900 million that was taken in last year, roughly half has been lost on the Stock Exchange. There was a lengthy controversy this year, with disputes between the two Government parties, over the construction of a national stadium, which would have cost about €500 or €600 million over three or four years. With the money that has been lost on the Stock Exchange by virtue of the pension reserve fund this year alone, it would be possible to build the stadium in one year. With the money it is costing us to fund the SSIAs this year and for the next five years, it would be possible to build a stadium a year. That is an enormous waste of money and it is spectacular that there has been so little debate about it. Last week the Minister announced a cut that will save €40 million but the fact that we are spending billions of euro in a fashion that attracts so little debate is dispiriting.The contribution to the pension fund should be reduced and the amount of the reduction should be used for other purposes. The amounts paid into SSIAs should be capped and people should be allowed to leave the scheme early. I do not want to make a speech apologising pro vita sua but we made those criticisms of the SSIAs when they were introduced.I welcome the Minister's remarks on value for money and the Estimates process. I have been critical of the process for some years. The fundamental difficulty is that it is entirely secret and the Estimates campaign that has been going on since the summer was conducted behind closed doors by senior civil servants and, in the latter stages, by Ministers. None of us has a notion what went on; we do not know how priorities were decided, except that we were told the committee of wise men were those who made the ultimate recommendations to the Minister for Finance. It is not acceptable that we make decisions on priorities entirely in private. There should at least be a requirement on Ministers to appear before the Dáil or a committee with his initial Estimates at an early stage so there can be an objective analysis of spending plans and, subsequently, as to how the money has been spent.These Estimates provide for a very slight increase in spending. My guess is that by the time budget day comes around it will be around 8%. In normal circumstances I would not object to an increase of that size. We are, however, entitled to say that this is completely at odds with the suggestion of the Minister for Finance, Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats before 17 May. Obviously this Government feels that in time people will forget and, if everything comes good by the next election, they will be fine. The Government is wrong. When people are betrayed and deceived to the extent they have been by this Government, the bad taste lasts for a very long time. It may be that things done next year or the year after will be forgotten by the next election but the deception of the 2002 election will linger for a long time and the people will find a way to pay the Government back.

Following its decision in 1992, the public waited in the long grass and gave them a clear, unambiguous message in 1997. That message is potent for the Labour Party today. It is nice to be able to divert attention from the dilemma the party found itself in and still has to deal with.

Let the Senator bluster away, I have no problem with that.Since the publication of the Estimates, the public has been overwhelmed with analyses of the rights and wrongs of the Minister's approach to the management of the economy and commentators are parading panaceas for our short-term fiscal difficulties. Media commentators with certain agendas are hell bent on depicting the Minister as all the things he is not. They are in an unseemly rush to surpass each other in being derogatory about the Minister. Their analysis of the current economic situation, however, and how we should deal with it defies all logic.The re-election of the Government was a clear vote of confidence in its economic management over the past five years. The Minister for Finance managed our finances extremely well and he translated that management into spectacular success in all sectors of the economy and Government. He was more than up to the challenge in the good times. Anyone who deludes themselves that it is easier to manage success than failure should consult world renowned independent analysts. He was more than up to the challenge and I have no doubt that he is the right man in the right place. He is widely regarded by those we depend on to spend money to generate wealth, create employment and provide tax revenue as the best placed to confront our present difficulties and manage our changed economic circumstances in the next five years.If an independent analyst was asked to describe this Minister's record in terms of the state of the economy right now, irrespective of the illogical assertions of the Opposition, he would have to use the words, "safe, sound, secure". That is where we are now. For the few doubting Thomases—

#LiamFitzgerald	unknown-#LiamFitzgerald-party	unknown-#LiamFitzgerald-dob	unknown-#LiamFitzgerald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-21 00:00:00	Prelude	75	—among us, we should sketch the track record of the Minister for Finance over the last five years. There is irrefutable evidence of his sound economic judgment and management. Although Ireland is suffering the effects of a global economic slow down, as are all other economies, it is performing on a par with the very best in Europe. The approach to the economy that was appropriate during five years of boom of necessity must now change in the short term. I am satisfied, as are many others, that the principal changes in the fiscal strategy that the Minister is adopting in the short term will prove to right in the long term.There will be temporary pain but there will be long-term gain. The approach to rapidly changed global economic circumstances, reflected in the downturn in domestic tax revenue, is to slow down an expanded programme throughout Government for a short time. In reassessing we will move forward. The cooling down period is necessary in any cyclical economy and our economy is cyclical because it is subject to so many variables at any one time.Since 1997 public expenditure has almost doubled. Everyone accepts that money had to be spent because significant under-investment in vital public services had to be addressed. In this context, there is a curious logic to Opposition howls of condemnation of the Minister's Estimates. They were very audible when they denigrated the Minister in the last few years as a spendthrift. The same Opposition parties produced manifestos that were not costed but were based on cloud cuckoo land—

The facts are there, unpalatable as they may be. I have heard spokesmen in unseemly haste to top the spin doctor league perpetuate the view that the public finances are in total disarray. I have heard them on radio and television and read articles in the newspapers. This is nothing but abject nonsense because on a day to day basis the country continues to enjoy a significant budget surplus. The three most sensitive spending Departments are Health and Children, represented here by the Minister of State, Education and Science and Social and Family Affairs which have received the lion's share of the increases. In each case expenditure has almost doubled but in the Department of Health and Children it has more than doubled.The question of the effectiveness of that spending is one that has to be addressed. I was most heartened to find it addressed today by the Minister in his opening speech. The question of accountability and good management within each Department has been addressed. He has sent a clear signal to the public and to all his Cabinet colleagues that that management process will have to step up quickly.I wish to comment on the pension fund because some of our commentators have rushed to print to say we should rob the pension fund. That is an abominable and an appalling indictment of the mentality of some people—

It is putting money away for the rainy day. I have no doubt it is one of the many sound initiatives undertaken by the Minister over the past 12 years.

I know it was not always an exact science and many commentators would still believe it is not an exact science. In his contribution Senator Mansergh mentioned the lead up to the last general election and referred specifically to the economic cycle as being suspended. I have never heard of an economic cycle being suspended. Perhaps he is spending too much time in the Assembly in Northern Ireland. The Assembly is suspended. Economic cycles are not suspended. The Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, has proven that economics is an exact science because if one overspends foolishly and lavishly in the good times naturally as a follow on there will be bad times.In 1992 there was a conference in Rio de Janeiro at which there was a definition of "sustainable development". That definition said that if we meet the needs of the present generation we cannot compromise the needs of future generations. In the past five years we have heard from various conferences, the media, different commentators, journalists and professors that we need sustainable development. I accuse the Minister, Deputy McCreevy, of completely ignoring the principles of sustainable development. I agree with Senator Fitzgerald that in the past five years there was spending, overspending and overkill. It met the needs of that voting generation in the last general election but it does not meet the needs of the incoming Government and the people under the present Government. That is a disgrace of the last Government. I am disappointed with the three Independents who stood up here and congratulated the Minister, Deputy McCreevy. Of course, there have to be cutbacks but, as Senator McDowell said, they should have been made two years ago. There should have been a pull back in the economy. The Minister did not do that and should stand corrected on that. I accuse him of deliberating misleading the people in the lead up to the general election.The local government development fund will be reduced in 2003 to 96%. I can only empathise with over 1,000 local authority members who have to deal with the cutbacks in their local authorities and specifically Donegal County Council which has opened three new decentralised offices. How will it manage the funds if there are cutbacks in the allocations to local authorities? We have learned that the Downings harbour development project will not go ahead after promises prior to the general election. The Letterkenny leisure centre which was promised prior to the election is in limbo. The capital project, the N2 from Dublin to Donegal, was not even included in the National Development Programme 2000-2006. What hope have those who work in Dublin and live in Donegal in terms of quality of life when it takes six hours on a Friday evening to get from Dublin to Donegal whereas when I was in college here in 1993 it took me five hours?Let us talk about progress and where we have come from. Money has been spent but it has not been spent in a sustainable way and not in terms of value for money. That applies to affordable housing throughout Donegal and the country. That was not promoted enough by the last Government.We are in trouble when it comes to the Estimates because we have spent lavish amounts of money on feasibility studies, environmental impact studies and, as Senator McDowell mentioned, studies for road projects, tendering and so on. A sum of €1.6 million was spent on a feasibility study and on an environmental impact study for a bridge across Mulroy Bay in County Donegal that will never be built.Let us talk about value for money and the overspend in the last election. We are in a precarious position. There have to be cutbacks but I do not agree with all of them. As I said, the cutbacks should have been introduced two years prior to the last election. I accuse the Minister of completely ignoring the public when it came to this issue.
#FeargalBrowne	unknown-#FeargalBrowne-party	unknown-#FeargalBrowne-dob	unknown-#FeargalBrowne-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-21 00:00:00	Prelude	85	This book should be renamed "Aspirations" as opposed to "Estimates" because it is purely aspirational. The Government seems to be in turmoil. The Tánaiste said public spending was out of control. A few days later she praised the Minister for Finance as the best ever. I cannot reconcile these two comments.We could become bogged down in smaller projects such as the first-time buyer's grant, which is what Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats want us to do. However, the main issue is public sector pay, to which half the expenditure relates. A report published today shows that if we continue as we are, we will by next year be 14% more expensive in terms of wages than the European standard, making us less competitive, which will not be good for the economy. Recently, over 4,000 personnel who had not been sanctioned were employed by health boards. We are, therefore, seeing wastage of money.One area that concerns me is the cut-back in consultants' reports. I might be asked the reason. The Jeanie Johnston project in Tralee is a case where proper consultants were not engaged. It went way over budget and we had a fiasco. It would be easy to cut back on consultancies and consultants' reports across every Department, including the Taoiseach's, but it might come back to haunt us. I hope it is done in a good manner.Senator Fitzgerald mentioned the costing of manifestos before the last general election. Fine Gael produced a manifesto which was costed by the Department of Finance. However, the so-called independence of the Department of Finance has been questioned. I certainly would not trust it as far as I could throw it. It costed all the political parties' manifestos, including that of the Labour Party, as far as I am aware. Now it has emerged that the figures it gave us, on which we based our manifesto, are false. There are serious questions to answer. The Secretary General of the Department of Finance should be brought before the House to answer questions. It is not good enough. I understood the Civil Service was independent. It obviously is not and certainly cannot be depended upon.Let me mention transport which is part of my brief. I am concerned about cut-backs in transport. When construction inflation is taken into account, there are cut-backs. There is no question about this. I urge the Minister to consider the introduction of fixed cost contracts because project costs are escalating way beyond control. We must be realistic. We need to award fixed cost contracts in order that we know exactly how much a road or other infrastructural project will cost. Otherwise we will get into awful difficulty. I urge the Minister also, instead of wasting time commissioning reports on projects that will never be done, to set reasonable and realistic targets.This is a very disappointing report. These are the first Estimates on which I have contributed. They are not worth the paper on which they are written, which means we will be back here again in a few months. They fail to look at public pay, a key issue. I resent the accusations of some Members opposite about the Fine Gael manifesto which we costed it in our way. The Department of Finance has serious questions to answer.

The fundamental debate taking place here – I note it is taking place inside Fianna Fáil with considerable vigour – is about the position on the political spectrum where the people want our country to end up. There is an articulated fear in Fianna Fáil that the minority party in the Government, aided by the Minister for Finance whose ideology is that of the minority party, has dragged what was a party of the centre left in a rightward direction, to the detriment of the well-being of many of those who vote for Fianna Fáil.The real quality of the past four or five years of Government was the contradiction posed by the Government trying to have two different ideologies. In terms of taxation, it espoused George Bush's view. In particular, the touchstone of George Bush's economic philosophy was and is a reduction in capital gains tax. The essential point of divergence between his economic philosophy and that of Al Gore was the view of capital gains tax. Capital gains tax is, by definition, a tax on the wealthy. Ordinary people, unless they inherit shares or something similar, do not end up with the privilege of paying capital gains tax. As an instrument of public policy, capital gains tax can and should be used in times of difficulty to stimulate the economy. Cutting capital gains tax at a time when property, share and land prices were booming was both socially unjust and economically very foolish. It simply stimulated and provoked an overheated property market. It was the wrong thing to do.The competing ideology is the political necessity to at least appear to match the quality of public services with which most people are now familiar in the rest of Europe beyond the fairly devastated United Kingdom that was left after Mrs. Thatcher's reign in which public services were severely damaged. All over the rest of northern Europe, France, Germany, The Netherlands, Sweden, Norway, Denmark, Austria – not Switzerland because it is unique – have similar views. The first is that a country must manage its economy with great efficiency. The second is that it must, through a broadly-based fair taxation system, use the resources of that economy to deliver services that make people feel that the efficiencies of the economy serve a purpose.The problem is that the Government is trying to do the two things at once and that cannot be done. It is a bit like a number of great quotes attributed to Irish politicians that they deny ever having said. The late Jack Lynch said he never said he would not stand idly by; the Tánaiste said she never said Ireland was closer to Boston than to Berlin. It is a pity that all the best quotes are apocryphal, but perhaps that is the nature of good quotes. However, the Boston-Berlin dilemma is precisely the Government's problem. It was determined on a route of tax cutting. We should remember that the reduction in betting tax that the Government introduced was larger than the amount being spent on the first-time buyer's grant. What was the economic necessity or the urgency about this? It was done because of a determination to cut taxes across the spectrum.I am not talking about the excessive burden of income tax loaded on middle income earners, but about other taxes cut in other areas, including the unnecessary cutting of the top rate of income tax. That is the problem we now have. The Government could have followed the logic of George Bush and Margaret Thatcher and cut public expenditure to the measure of the tax regime in which it believed, or it could have ensured the expenditure regime was matched by the level of taxation and, therefore, avoided some of the wilder aspects of its tax cutting frenzy. It had a choice and chose to do both. Hence our crisis.In 1997 when it came to office, the first Labour Party Minister for Finance in the history of the State delivered the first surplus in about 30 years. He delivered that because in the previous two years he had been excessively prudent about public expenditure, in Gordon Brown's immortal words. He did not allow public expenditure to run away because he, I and most people on the social democratic left in Europe believed that the best way to deliver good public services was by steady growth in their delivery, not by an election driven frenzy of wasteful expenditure.I reiterate what Senator McDowell has said. There is something close to insanity in the diversion of €1.5 million to €2 billion per year into SSIAs and provision for pensions while proper services for old people in our communities cannot be provided. What is the point of using an instrument like that to make provision for 25 years ahead if the major sacrifice is made now? The Labour Party did not propose to raid the fund. The only fund raided was the social insurance fund which was raided by the Minister for Finance. He did not divert money from revenue; he took it from the fund to pretend to balance his books last December when he intended to have a surplus, as we all remember.As Senator McDowell said, the Labour Party criticised the SSIAs when they were introduced. We said that they were a State subsidy to those who were already well off and that remains the case. The contract cannot be broken but it would be sensible to create conditions in which people are encouraged to get out of the scheme early. It is particularly now, when people are a little tight for money, that we should consider letting investors out of the scheme. Whatever the cost up so far, it would be lessened if that was done.There has been a failure by the Government to realise the choices it was making. It has tried to win both sides of the argument at the same time and that is the cause of the mess we are in, not any economic crisis. We have a crisis caused by a Government that never made up its mind which side it was on regarding very basic arguments. It tried to be on both sides and failed miserably.

#JohnPaulPhelan	unknown-#JohnPaulPhelan-party	unknown-#JohnPaulPhelan-dob	unknown-#JohnPaulPhelan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-21 00:00:00	Prelude	93	I might race ahead like Government expenditure in the past few years; there might be an overrun. That time should allow me to address the topical issue of the Book of Estimates.I am surprised by the back slapping and other antics of Government Senators and Deputies with the Minister for Finance after the publication of the Book of Estimates. It is a damning indictment of the Minister that we have had such economic success over recent years, and still have strong economic growth, yet the public finances are in such a mess. As Senator Ryan said, it is a political mess that the Minister has created, primarily with the intention of seeking re-election in May 2002. The Minister achieved that goal but at a high cost.There is a lack of interest in and a cynical view of politics and politicians at this time. That is because politicians do not do what they say they will. It is also because there are Government Deputies who, when in their constituencies, criticise the Government and the Minister and say he is wrong to do certain things, then come to Dublin and vote in the opposite direction by supporting the Government they criticise. This leads to cynicism among the electorate.I want to focus on arts, sport and tourism with which I am concerned. There have been significant cutbacks in certain areas and a controversial one that will affect many communities is that of swimming pool grants. The Book of Estimates contains a proposal to cut grants next year by 41%. The outgoing Government – in the person of then Minister of State, Mr. Bobby Molloy, before his political demise – had the stated ambition to give all children access to swimming pool facilities. It is difficult to square that ambition with a 41% cut in the grant for the building of new swimming pools and the renovation of existing pools.There is also a reduction in the capital grant to the Irish Film Board. This is particularly significant, especially in my area, County Kilkenny, where a number of films have been made in recent years and where there is a film industry. A recent survey carried out by Bord Fáilte regarding American visitors to Ireland said that 14% came because they had seen an Irish film and became interested in visiting. Cutting this grant by 12% is a double-edged sword and should not have been done. It did not save much money and is another example of a soft target.I saw the Arts Plan 2002-2004 for the first time today. It is a good document and cost a lot of money to draw up. It contains specific costings which detail funding over the five year period of the plan. Last year, the Government spent €48 million on the arts; it is proposed in the Book of Estimates to spend €44 million this year, a significant reduction of €4 million. It is all the more significant when it is considered that the arts plan projected that €54 million was needed for this year to keep the plan going. Is this another Government report that will be shelved in the context of the cutbacks the Minister for Finance proposes?Forestry is another area that has seen drastic cuts. There is a 22% reduction in the fund for forestry and this will have a major impact throughout the country. Up to 1,000 full and part-time jobs are believed to be under threat. That is worth €20 million to the rural economy and €3 million in funding from the European Union is definitely being put at risk. This is another soft target which should not have been singled out.

#MauriceCummins	unknown-#MauriceCummins-party	unknown-#MauriceCummins-dob	unknown-#MauriceCummins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-21 00:00:00	Prelude	95	I am always brief, a Chathaoirligh. I never say in ten words what I can say in two. It amazed me when I heard Senator Norris stating that he advised the Minister for Finance to tear up all his election promises. The Minister obviously listened to Senator Norris because the election manifesto has been torn to shreds and no promises have been honoured. I was also amazed to hear ill-informed attacks on the Opposition from Senators Ross and Quinn while they preached financial rectitude. It is the current Government who has been in office for the past five years, squandered €4.8 billion of a surplus created by the efforts of all sections of this economy and mismanaged the economy to such an extent that we are faced with cutbacks that will affect every citizen, especially the vulnerable, disadvantaged and young couples trying to put a roof over their heads. The Minister may feel that €3,800 is an insignificant amount but many young couples who have budgeted for it now have the ground swept from under them.Regarding the economic and social infrastructure programme to which the Minister referred, the National Roads Authority has stated that the money is not available to complete the inter-urban routes or motorways between the gateway cities and Dublin. In 1997 the Minister inherited a sound financial platform any Minister would be delighted to have. Five years later and after a period of unprecedented growth in the economy, we are in a much poorer state than when the Minister came to office.

#MichaelFinucane	unknown-#MichaelFinucane-party	unknown-#MichaelFinucane-dob	unknown-#MichaelFinucane-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-21 00:00:00	Prelude	102	In July 2000 the Mid-Western Health Board made a submission to the expert review group on cancer services on the necessity for a radiotherapy service in its area. About 1,500 patients in the board's area are diagnosed each year with cancer, of which 170 need radiotherapy. These are referred to hospitals in Galway, Cork and primarily St. Luke's in Dublin.I will give the following examples of case histories in the mid-western region to illustrate how essential the radiotherapy facility is. A 69 year old housewife, following a right sided mastectomy on 18 April 2001 was referred for radiotherapy. She received her first treatment on 13 August 2001, almost four months later. Another example is a 21 year old student with Hodgkin's disease who, on completion of chemotherapy in April 2001, was referred for radiotherapy which commenced at the end of August 2001, a duration of five months.Many ladies with breast cancer are given the option of lumpectomy and radiotherapy or a mastectomy. Many opt for a mastectomy rather than travel to Dublin for radiotherapy treatment. Travelling imposes extra strain not only on those suffering from cancer but also on their families and completely contradicts the philosophy of palliative training.We are fortunate in the Mid-Western Health Board region to have the Mid-Western Hospitals Development Trust, a charitable trust which is prepared to fund the capital cost. It requires the Minister for Health and Children to provide funding for this radiotherapy facility.I am aware the expert group has finished its investigation. Has the report been presented to the Minister? I hope the recommendations include the provision of a radiotherapy facility for the mid-west.A statement in Cancer in Ireland 1994-1998 reads as follows:With one or two [notable] exceptions, differences in treatment patterns between the various health boards were not statistically significant . The most notable exception is the lower percentage of lung, breast and lymphoma patients receiving radiotherapy in the Western and Mid Western Health Board [areas].The objective of the Mid-Western Health Board is to have a centre of excellence in the region. Major developments have taken place in breast, colo-rectal and urology services in the board area. These services cannot be fully developed without full and ready access to radiotherapy.According to the Caiman-Hine report produced in 1995, a population of 280,000 to 300,000 justifies a two machine radiotherapy centre. The population in the mid-west justifies the provision of a radiotherapy facility. I implore the Minister, Deputy Martin, to give a commitment to provide such a facility for the Mid-Western Health Board region. I will continue my crusade for this facility until he and the Department of Health and Children provide this essential service for the area I represent.
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-21 00:00:00	Prelude	103	I thank the Senator for raising this matter on the Adjournment and for giving me this opportunity on behalf of my colleague, the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Martin, to set out the current position on the development of radiotherapy services nationally and in the Mid-Western Health Board specifically.As the Senator is aware, the Minister established an expert working group on radiotherapy services to examine the appropriate further development of radiotherapy services in this country. The provision of additional services for radiotherapy treatment will be considered in the context of the report of the expert working group. I understand that all health boards, including the Mid-Western Health Board, have been afforded an opportunity to meet and make submissions to the group. The work of the expert group is at an advanced stage and it is anticipated that it will be completed shortly. Until such time as the Minister has received and considered the expert report, he is not in. a position to indicate any specific developments for radiotherapy services.The Minister is fully committed to the development of quality services to achieve best health outcomes. Regarding the development of cancer services generally, this commitment can be seen in the level of funding provided. Since the implementation of the national cancer strategy commenced in 1997, more than €103 million has been invested in the development of appropriate treatment and care services for people with cancer. Cancer services throughout the country have benefited from this investment which far exceeds the £25 million requirement initially envisaged under the national cancer strategy.Among a range of other initiatives, this investment has enabled the funding of 80 additional consultant posts in key areas such as medical oncology, radiology, symptomatic breast disease, palliative care, histopathology, haematology and radiation oncology, together with the associated support staff.This year, a total of €27.3 million was provided for the maintenance and development of cancer services, €23.55 million of which was allocated between health boards. Since the commencement of the implementation of the national cancer strategy, €8.25 million of dedicated funding has been allocated to the Mid-Western Health Board specifically for the development of oncology and related services.An additional sum of €29 million is being allocated in 2003 for cancer services. This investment will ensure that next year we continue to address increasing demands in cancer services throughout the country in such areas as oncology/haematology services, oncology drug treatments and symptomatic breast disease services.I realise that, while much has been achieved in recent years in the development of the health services, much remains to be done. In recognition of the need to develop cancer services further, the national health strategy has identified the need for the preparation of a new national cancer strategy.The National Cancer Strategy 2003 is being prepared by the national cancer forum under the chairmanship of Professor Paul Redmond of Cork University Hospital in conjunction with the Department of Health and Children. The new strategy will set out the key areas to be targeted for the development of cancer services over the coming years and will make recommendations on the organisation and structure of cancer services nationally. This will have regard to existing policies in the areas of symptomatic breast disease and palliative care and the forthcoming recommendations of the expert group on radiotherapy services.The forum is consulting with the Eastern Regional Health Authority and health boards, as well as professional bodies, voluntary agencies, patient groups and members of the public on the future development of cancer services, including how best to organise these services.

#TerryLeyden	unknown-#TerryLeyden-party	unknown-#TerryLeyden-dob	unknown-#TerryLeyden-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-21 00:00:00	Prelude	113	I thank the Cathaoirleach for allowing this matter on the Adjournment and welcome the Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children, Deputy Brian Lenihan, who has a special responsibility for children.I raise the issue of the condition of St. Coman's ward in Roscommon county hospital. This is a 30 bed medical ward which is in a deplorable condition and requires major investment urgently for its refurbishment. In 1998 the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Cowen, then Minister for Health and Children, gave commitments to the hospital and the Western Health Board which have been honoured. The Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Martin, reiterated those commitments in 2001.As chairman of the Western Health Board, I had the pleasure of signing a contract for a new accident and emergency department on 16 May 2002 at a cost of over €5 million. On 27 June I signed a contract worth €1.1 million for refurbished theatres. We have provided new screening rooms and other facilities at Roscommon County Hospital which will guarantee its continuity and provide an excellent service for the people of Roscommon and surrounding areas.The position is that St. Coman's Ward is in a state of disrepair. It is not up to agreed standards for hospital care. The staff work under extremely difficult conditions to provide facilities and services for the patients who frequent this medical ward. It would be in keeping with the upgrading of the hospital that funds would be provided to allow the €500,000 contract, submitted in June this year, for major refurbishment of the ward to proceed. This work would continue in conjunction with the work under way on the new accident and emergency unit and the theatres.I call on the Minister and the Minister of State to ask the Department to give the Western Health Board the authority to proceed to sign the contract to allow this project proceed. It is vital the work goes ahead. If this is not agreed, the Health and Safety Authority will have to take action with regard to the conditions prevailing in the ward. As a last resort, it will have to be closed down pending the allocation of funds from the Department which I urge to provide the necessary approval to proceed with the contract.I thank the Minister, the Taoiseach and the Government for their support and commitment to the development of Roscommon County Hospital as an acute general hospital. We are fortunate that it now has two surgeons, two anaesthetists, two radiologists and excellent facilities. We now require St. Coman's Ward to be upgraded to ensure the continuity of the hospital as an acute general hospital. I call on the Department to provide the necessary funding for the contract.
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-21 00:00:00	Prelude	114	I am dealing with this matter on behalf of my colleague the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Martin, who is fully aware and appreciative of the services Roscommon County Hospital provides for the population in its catchment area. Throughout the years the hospital has served the community well in areas such as surgery, medicine, geriatric assessment and psychiatry, as well as providing casualty and outpatient services. Its budget has increased to almost €13 million this year which is more than a doubling of the allocation since 1997. This has enabled it to provide a high level of service.The hospital has benefited from a number of developments during the 1990s and into the new century. In December 1991 St. Teresa's Ward was opened, providing 16 additional medical beds. Services were expanded with the appointment of a consultant physician with an interest in the elderly, who took up duty in 1993. A new acute psychiatric unit was opened in February 1992. In 1994, 24 rehabilitation beds with linkages to the hospital were commissioned at the Sacred Heart Home in Roscommon. In 1997 educational, seminar and conference facilities for all Roscommon health services were provided with the refurbishment and renovation of the training centre at Roscommon County Hospital.In December 1998 new surgical facilities at the hospital were opened at a capital cost of €760,000. This provided for five additional day beds, hospice accommodation, renovation of the surgical ward and an increase in single room accommodation. A second consultant surgeon took up duty at the hospital at the beginning of 1999. In May 2000 approval was given to upgrade the hospital's drainage system at a capital cost of €246,000. In May 2001 approval was given for the refurbishment of the doctors' residences at a capital cost of €57,138.In June 2001 when the Minister visited the hospital he provided a sum of €1.65 million to carry out additional capital works, including replacing the screening room equipment, refurbishment of the theatre, refurbishment of St. Coman's Ward and upgrading the supplies warehouse. The screening room equipment has been replaced and the theatre department is being upgraded. In April this year the Minister issued approval to accept the tender for the development of a new accident and emergency department, a nine bed admissions unit, a medical records department, radiology film storage, staff changing facilities and an ultrasound room at an estimated capital cost of over €7.8 million. Construction is under way with an estimated completion date of late 2003.These developments have facilitated the hospital in developing the range and quality of the services it provides. In particular, the development of surgical services has enabled the hospital to increase its day surgery work. The emphasis in acute hospital care is on the overall volume of activity delivered, be it on an in-patient, day-case or out-patient basis. Modern advances in medicine and technology now mean that previously complicated procedures which would have necessitated a lengthy stay in hospital can be done much more simply and very often without the need for admission on an in-patient basis.With regard to the specific issue raised by the Deputy, the Minister is aware that St. Coman's Ward is in need of upgrading. Plans have been agreed with the Western Health Board design team, local management and the technical services department. However, I understand the board is unable to provide the funding for this project from within the funding of €1.65 million announced by the Minister last year. The funding provided has been exhausted in purchasing new X-ray equipment and refurbishing the operating theatre. The question of the refurbishment of St Coman's Ward will be considered by the board in conjunction with the Department having regard to the funding available and priority attached to the developments by the board. The Department will be in touch with it shortly regarding the issue.

I hope the Department will be in touch with the Western Health Board and that the issue can be resolved. I know the Department has committed to providing funding and I am confident this essential work will proceed.The Seanad adjourned at 4.10 p.m. until 10.30 a.m on Wednesday, 27 November 2002.
