#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-25 00:00:00	Prelude	0	The House will be aware of the tragic incident in County Wicklow yesterday evening when Garda Ciaran Jones was swept away at Ballysmuttan Bridge.  The recovery of his remains today in Wicklow is dreadful news.  My heart goes out to his parents and family members.  I offer my condolences to Garda Jones's colleagues and friends.  The Garda Síochána, and all of us, have lost a brave man who put his life at risk in helping the public at a time of great danger.  The Stepaside community has lost a dedicated member of its Garda Force.  Garda Jones's courageous actions were in the finest traditions of the Garda Síochána.I thank all of those involved in the rescue efforts, including Garda Jones's colleagues, the local Glen of Imaal Mountain Rescue team, the Defence Forces, Civil Defence, coastguard and members of the public.  Their commitment and dedication in such hazardous conditions are deeply appreciated.  The extraordinary, dreadful sacrifice, in seeking to save the lives of others in appalling conditions, made by Garda Ciaran Jones will be remembered by all of us in this House.

I endorse all that the Minister said.That Garda Jones was off duty when he undertook to protect his neighbours is an indication of his bravery.  Our thoughts are with his family, including his parents who are travelling back from abroad — one can only imagine what they are going through — his brother and sister who were with him at the time of the accident, his colleagues and all those who in the most extraordinary of conditions last night searched throughout the night for him.It is at times like this that we are reminded of the bravery of our gardaí, on and off duty, in trying to save others in all circumstances.  Ar dheis Dé go raibh a anam dílis.

I went to Blessington this morning and asked the chief superintendent if there was anything more people could do or if he needed assistance mobilising volunteers.  It is an extraordinary measure of the young man that the chief superintendent told me that such was the response from Garda Jones's community they could not handle any more volunteers.

I recall thinking to myself when watching television footage of the earthquake in Turkey that we are lucky not to have experienced that type of devastating loss of life in Ireland.  I then heard that a young off-duty garda had lost his life while trying to help others.  This is a sad day for him, his family and his colleagues.
#MichaelKitt	unknown-#MichaelKitt-party	unknown-#MichaelKitt-dob	unknown-#MichaelKitt-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-25 00:00:00	Prelude	4	I thank the Minister and Deputies for their contributions.
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-25 00:00:00	Prelude	5	I have previously provided the House with details of the Garda costs that have arisen from the State visits of Queen Elizabeth and President Obama in May of this year.  In that regard, Deputies will be aware that the relevant expenditure is approximately €36 million.  I appreciate that this figure is substantial but I believe the visits provided this country with substantial benefits, which far outweigh the financial element involved.  Additionally, unprecedented security measures had to be put in place and the safety of our visitors had to be the top priority.Funding for the State visits was not provided for in the Garda Vote for 2011 because the visits had not been planned when the current Garda Estimates were finalised.  As a result a significant unanticipated body of expenditure has arisen.  I am currently engaging with my colleague, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, in regard to the financial arrangements to be made in respect of the visits.  These contacts are ongoing and I expect they will conclude shortly.  I can assure the Deputy that an important part of the discussion is to ensure that frontline Garda services will not be adversely affected when it comes to meeting the cost of the visits.
#DaraCalleary	unknown-#DaraCalleary-party	unknown-#DaraCalleary-dob	unknown-#DaraCalleary-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-25 00:00:00	Prelude	6	I thank the Minister for his reply.  On 19 July 2011, some three months ago, we received from the Minister an answer in regard to the breakdown of costs.  It is our duty to support the Minister in his work.    There is no doubt of the benefits which accrued from the visits and that the expenditure was necessary in the circumstances.  It is three months on from when the Minister provided the House with a detailed breakdown.  How many meetings has the Minister had with the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Howlin, since then?  Is he placing any specific demands on the Minister to make up the overspend from within existing Garda resources?  In view of the benefit the visits had for the country, is he in a position to get an extra allocation from other Departments given the collective gain for the country?
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-25 00:00:00	Prelude	7	The reason the funding for the visits has not yet been settled is that, ultimately, it will depend on the overall position in the Garda Vote in 2011.  That context is necessary to take into account all the expenditure and savings on the Vote during the year.  This is a process where the relevant figures do not fully emerge until late in the year.  We have now reached the stage where the final Garda Vote expenditure figures for 2011 are being established.  It is obviously the right time to settle the issue, once the exact position becomes clear.As I indicated, I expect that my discussions with the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform will finalise the arrangements shortly.  I hope that within a short few weeks the position will be absolutely clear.It is my obligation, of course, to ensure that we deal with the matter in as financially efficient a manner as possible.  If there are some savings in some part of the Garda Vote, that will, to some extent, offset some small part of the additional expenditure incurred.
#DaraCalleary	unknown-#DaraCalleary-party	unknown-#DaraCalleary-dob	unknown-#DaraCalleary-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-25 00:00:00	Prelude	8	I am supportive of the Minister in his efforts with the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform but Garda Síochána directive 109/11, which was issued to stations in the past few weeks, will considerably reduce the amount of Garda overtime involved in serving District and Circuit Courts and may have the impact of delaying cases because of the reduction in that overtime.  Is that an indication of the kind of measure being taken or is that separate from the need to make up the overspend on the visits?
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-25 00:00:00	Prelude	9	It has no relevance to the visits.  It is a question of ensuring that, generally speaking, the Department tries to comply with the overall financial envelope provided in circumstances where the Deputy's colleagues in government substantially underfunded a number of the Votes within the Department of Justice and Equality thus giving rise to particular difficulties.  We are trying to ensure resources are used as carefully and as efficiently as is possible as we go through the year.
#MichaelKitt	unknown-#MichaelKitt-party	unknown-#MichaelKitt-dob	unknown-#MichaelKitt-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-25 00:00:00	Prelude	10	The Ceann Comhairle has allowed Deputy Aengus Ó Snodaigh to substitute for Deputy Jonathan O'Brien in regard to Question No. 39.
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2011-10-25 00:00:00	Prelude	11	I propose to take Questions Nos. 39 and 41 together.Members of the Garda Síochána who have reached 50 years of age and have at least 30 years service are eligible to retire on full pension.  There are some 900 members of the force currently in this category.It is estimated that the total number of departures from the force in 2011 will be approximately 500 but we do not yet know how many Garda members will retire before 29 February next year.  So far, approximately 40 members have indicated to the Commissioner that they intend to retire between the beginning of January and the end of February next but members have until the end of November to give the required three months notice of an intention to retire by then.These figures must be seen in the context of plans agreed by the previous Government as part of its compliance with the terms of the EU-IMF agreement to reduce Garda numbers to 13,500 by the end of this year and to 13,000 by 2014.  However, what will ultimately determine the sustainable level of Garda numbers is the level of budgetary provision that can be made for the force and the House will be conscious that difficult decisions will have to be made right across the public sector in order to bring our public finances back into balance.As with every other public sector organisation, therefore, the reality is that the Garda Síochána will have to manage with reduced resources.  The Garda Commissioner is, therefore, quite properly reviewing all aspects of the Garda Síochána's policing model so as to ensure that Garda resources are managed and deployed in the most appropriate manner to meet existing and emerging policing requirements.The Garda Commissioner's review will examine all aspects of current policing, including the deployment of personnel, the utilisation of modern technologies and the operation of Garda stations.  While no decision has been taken, a reduction in public opening hours in some Garda stations and the closure of other Garda stations will be issues that the Garda Commissioner will need to address as part of the review.  He may well need to consider whether, in appropriate cases, a better policing service could be delivered to a local community by having gardaí out on patrol rather than in a station.I will carefully consider the outcome of the review and the Commissioner's policing plan for next year with the objective of ensuring that priority is given to the maintenance of front line services.  I will also continue to discuss with my colleague, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, the budgetary provision to be made for the Garda Síochána for 2012 and beyond.

Tá a fhios agam gur luadh a bhás níos luaithe.The Minister is aware of a major concern about the closure of Garda stations, particularly in rural areas.  Predatory gangs are increasingly targeting some isolated communities and the elderly in particular.  What additional resources will be focused on these communities if their Garda stations close?  Will the Minister guarantee that savings made from the closure of stations will be spent on enhancing Garda activities in the areas affected?  Otherwise, this cutback will affect areas that have already seen an increase in predatory attacks.
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-25 00:00:00	Prelude	13	It is important that the Deputy realise that, if savings are to be affected, they will be necessary.  We must reduce public expenditure in 2012 by a minimum of €3.6 billion to meet our EU-IMF requirements.  In the context of my Department, I must identify savings that can result.  The Garda Commissioner, as the person in charge of the Garda and making operational decisions, must identify appropriate savings.  Having said this, we are anxious to ensure that front line services are maintained and that local communities are properly protected.The substantial review that is under way is considering how to recalibrate the manner in which the Garda operates to provide the protections necessary to local communities and to ensure that those who seek to engage in unlawful behaviour and those who prey on the elderly in rural communities are given no quarter.  These issues are part and parcel of the consideration of the approach to be taken.  This is one of the reasons I mentioned that, in circumstances in which it may prove necessary to close some small local rural Garda stations, it is essential that appropriate Garda patrols are available to provide the necessary protections.  Unfortunately, we no longer live in an environment where if savings are affected in one area, the money saved can be spent in another area.
#DaraCalleary	unknown-#DaraCalleary-party	unknown-#DaraCalleary-dob	unknown-#DaraCalleary-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-25 00:00:00	Prelude	14	On 20 September, the Minister told the House that he was due to receive the Commissioner's proposals on this matter.  Has he received them or when does he expect to receive the Commissioner's policing plan?  Given that some closures may be necessary, does the Minister envisage discussing the plan with, for example, joint policing committees or people who have on-the-ground experience as opposed to just with the Commissioner, who is slightly removed from what is occurring on the ground, to ensure an effective community response in the event of a change in the delivery of services?
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-25 00:00:00	Prelude	15	I expect to receive the Commissioner's draft plan by the end of October — if not by the end of this week, then next Monday.  It is a draft plan to which detailed consideration must be given.  I am conscious that the Commissioner is the correct person to make operational decisions and I should not interfere with his operational judgment, but I will give careful consideration to the draft plan when it is submitted to my Department.  Shortly thereafter, I would expect appropriate decisions to be made.

Is it intended to sell them off or to put them to some other State use?
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-25 00:00:00	Prelude	17	I remind the Deputy that this State is effectively in receivership and that under the EU-IMF agreement we have an obligation by the end of this year to reduce Garda numbers from 14,500 to 13,500.  The previous Government signed up to that commitment but there was no prospect of that reduction being achieved.  At best, the Garda force numbers in the context of that agreement will reduce to 14,000 by the end of this year.  The obligation we have is to reduce expenditure.  It must be reduced across all the different areas of the justice spend, including the Garda.  We are examining how we can use reduced resources more efficiently to properly maintain front-line services and to facilitate the Garda Síochána, as the excellent force that it is, to continue to meet all its obligations, provide to the community the protection it requires, continue the effective investigation of crime and ensure the prosecution of those who have broken the law.
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-25 00:00:00	Prelude	18	In line with a commitment in the programme for Government the personal insolvency Bill is in the course of being developed in my Department to provide for a new framework for settlement and enforcement of debt and for personal insolvency.  The commitment under the EU-IMF Programme of Financial Support for Ireland is to publish the Bill in the first quarter of 2012.  It is my objective to publish the measure ahead of the EU-IMF deadline, if possible.  Moreover, it is intended that the heads of the Bill, which are expected to be finalised in the near future, will be forwarded to the Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality for its consideration.The Deputy will be aware that in developing the Bill, account is being taken of the recommendations of the Law Reform Commission in its recent Report on Personal Debt Management and Debt Enforcement. That report provided an in-depth review of the personal debt regime. The economic and financial effects of certain of the new arrangements that are in contemplation are being carefully assessed to ensure that all relevant issues are addressed and their impact is fully anticipated and understood.The Deputy will also be aware that, following the publication of recommendations in an interim report of the Law Reform Commission, I provided in the Civil Law (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2011 for the reduction of the period to apply to the court for discharge from bankruptcy from 12 years to five years, subject to the same conditions that currently exist and, for the first time in Irish law, for the automatic discharge of bankruptcies on the 12th anniversary of the bankruptcy adjudication order.  Those provisions were commenced with effect from 10 October 2011.  A number of other mainly technical improvements to bankruptcy law contained in the Act of 2011 are already in force since 2 August 2011.The question of a further reduction in the period for automatic discharge of a bankrupt and the period for application to the court for discharge from bankruptcy are being considered in the context of finalisation of my proposals on the personal insolvency Bill.  The decision will be made having regard to the Keane report as well as the very focused discussion that continues between my Department and key stakeholders to identify the optimum new structures, at minimal cost, to bring about the reform.  This necessary consultation, particularly in the context of the totally exceptional developing economic situation, is greatly assisting the development of detailed legislative proposals.Additional information not given on the floor of the HouseAs I have said in the House previously, reform of our personal insolvency regime is not a simple task.  It is a very complex area of the law and one where the consequences and implications of new policies need to be very carefully assessed.  There is a delicate balance to be struck between the various legal rights of the parties involved.  We must design a system which is fair to both creditors and debtors alike.  Not to do so would make worse a situation that is already difficult for the parties concerned.The reform of bankruptcy law will invariably focus on the length of the discharge period that will apply to the person adjudicated bankrupt.  We debated this point in the House during the passage of the Civil Law (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2011 in July.  Opinions varied as to the appropriate period.  There was consensus that the one-year period that applies in the UK and Northern Ireland is too short, but anything beyond five years is too long, particularly if the bankrupt person has been fully compliant and not behaved fraudulently in any way.  No final decision has been taken by the Government in this regard.The quantum of debt that might be discharged in any new bankruptcy or personal insolvency arrangements has also yet to be decided.  In bankruptcy, the debtor's assets are fully realised for the benefit of creditors and that responsibility falls to the official assignee or a private trustee in bankruptcy.  It is not, in my view, realistic to, at this stage, attempt to set down the quantum of debt that might be agreed to be discharged in the context of a non-judicial debt settlement.  That would be a matter for the parties concerned.  We must be mindful that in any debt arrangement, the debtor or bankrupt must be left with sufficient income to meet reasonable living expenses.  Given the complexity of the personal over-indebtedness issue generally and the economic and financial implications of any changes to the personal insolvency system, these are matters which will require careful consideration by the Government.

Specifically with regard to mortgages, the ideal situation would be that the bankruptcy conditions contained in the new legislation would be such that it could be used as a credible threat and, therefore, the person concerned would not necessarily have to go through bankruptcy but could say to the bank that if pushed too hard the person would be declared bankrupt and that the bank should, therefore, reach a settlement.
#MichaelKitt	unknown-#MichaelKitt-party	unknown-#MichaelKitt-dob	unknown-#MichaelKitt-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-25 00:00:00	Prelude	20	A question please, Deputy.
#StephenDonnelly	unknown-#StephenDonnelly-party	unknown-#StephenDonnelly-dob	unknown-#StephenDonnelly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-25 00:00:00	Prelude	21	The Minister mentioned five years in this context.  As Minister for Justice and Equality what is his view on five years versus three years, one year or two years?  When the Minister publishes the legislation and gives a recommendation on the number of years, will he also publish a comparative analysis that shows what works in other systems and why he has reached the recommendations that he has?
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-25 00:00:00	Prelude	22	There are difficult decisions to be made in this particular area with regard to the number of years.  It is not a matter of my personal preference.  It is a decision that the Government must make.The period for bankruptcy and extricating from bankruptcy, for example, in England was reduced to a period of one year.  In other states there are different periods of years.  There are a number of issues that must be considered in this context.  We must ensure that bankruptcy is not used by individuals to evade debts fraudulently.  There are those who owe money and those to whom money is owed and the position of both debtors and creditors, and the impact on their lives of the structure we put in place, must be considered.We are giving careful consideration to how to proceed, both in the context of what I would describe as non-judicial means and also the judicial means of dealing with insolvency.  There is a range of different options with regard to arrangements that may be entered into voluntarily with creditors and arrangements that may ultimately require adjudication in a bankruptcy context.I do not want to pre-empt the decisions to be made by Cabinet other than to say we are moving ahead carefully in this, but we also must be aware of unintended consequences that could arise that could have a detrimental impact on taxpayers in the State generally.  This is a particularly complex area in the context of the unprecedented fiscal difficulties confronting the State and the banking difficulties with which Deputy Donnelly is intimately familiar.
#StephenDonnelly	unknown-#StephenDonnelly-party	unknown-#StephenDonnelly-dob	unknown-#StephenDonnelly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-25 00:00:00	Prelude	23	Will the Minister publish a comparative analysis and the rationale for whatever he does agree?On the second piece to which he referred in his reply, when the discharge period is ended, is it the Minister's position that the full quantum of debt owed at that stage will essentially be written off?
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-25 00:00:00	Prelude	24	The reason for publishing heads of Bills once the Government has given detailed consideration to the applicable principles is to afford Members of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality, and also Members of the House who wish to attend a meeting of that committee, time to consider them and to give their own input also into the substantive provisions that we ultimately adopt, bearing in mind not only the Keane report and the Law Reform Commission's recommendations, but the comparative approaches taken in other jurisdictions.  Deputy Donnelly will have every opportunity to engage in that way and I hope that a positive contribution is made by that committee.  There is no monopoly of wisdom in this area but there is an urgent need for change.Question No. 41 answered with Question No. 39.
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-25 00:00:00	Prelude	25	The Deputy will be aware that the Government considered the circumstances of women and girls who resided in the laundries at its meeting on 14 June 2011.  As a first step, the Government decided that it was essential to establish fully the true facts and circumstances relating to the Magdalene laundries and a number of actions were agreed.This included the setting up of an inter-departmental committee to establish the facts of State involvement with the laundries, to clarify any State interaction and to produce a narrative detailing such interaction.  I am pleased to say that the committee, under the independent chairmanship of Senator McAleese, has submitted an interim progress report which was considered by Cabinet this morning and arrangements are being made for its publication this afternoon.  I welcome the progress that is being made and, in particular, I am pleased to tell the House that the committee is receiving full co-operation from all concerned, including the religious orders and representative groups of women who were formerly resident in the laundries and those who have been campaigning on their behalf.The Government decision also charged both myself, as the Minister for Justice and Equality, and the Minister of State with responsibility for disability, equality, mental health and older people, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, with meeting the religious congregations and the groups representing former residents of the laundries.  One of the purposes of these meetings was to discuss the putting in place of a restorative and reconciliation process as well as the structure that might be utilised to facilitate such process.  All of these meetings have taken place, including with representatives from the Justice for Magdalenes group.  My Department recently received from them the document referred to by the Deputy and it is currently being considered.  I might also add that the views of other representative groups and the religious orders are also being considered.  It is important, therefore, to emphasise that we are engaged in a process which is seeking to fully establish the facts and it is too early at this stage to predict what the outcomes might be.I am pleased with the work being undertaken and the full co-operation which has been received by the group led by Senator Martin McAleese.  The dialogue in which we have engaged directly has been very constructive and I wish to commend Senator McAleese for the Trojan work of both him and his group in a very short period of time.

They have taken up a cause that nobody else wanted to deal with for a very long time.During the recent theatre festival I attended a play which was based in the Magdalene laundry in Seán MacDermott Street.  This was an interactive production so I was there as part of the congregation.  I was there for approximately one hour and I thought I would never get out of the place.  I can only imagine what the women, the ladies, went through.I acknowledge the Minister's reply to my question but it seems that many of the issues raised are at the stage of being considered rather than action being taken.  These ladies have waited long enough.  I do not wish to be cynical and query if the Minister is waiting until they have all died but there is that element about it.
#MichaelKitt	unknown-#MichaelKitt-party	unknown-#MichaelKitt-dob	unknown-#MichaelKitt-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-25 00:00:00	Prelude	27	A question, please.

I ask what is being done in the meantime.  I do not believe there has been any advance with regard to the apology or the legal advice being sought by the Minister.  When does the Minister expect the final report and is he committed to implementing any recommendations?
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-25 00:00:00	Prelude	29	When the Deputy sees the interim report which is being published this afternoon she will note that Senator McAleese describes in great detail the progress that has been made.  All of the religious congregations have co-operated with him to the extent that all of their records going back over 90 years have been made available to him and to his interdepartmental group.  Substantial work is ongoing within each Department which can provide any information from its files of any description with regard to the State's contact with the Magdalene laundries going back to 1922.  All this information is being compiled.  This is very important work because the background, the story of the events that occurred over those years, is perhaps a little more complex when it is put in the context of the different eras and decades, than has been portrayed to date.I very much welcome the constructive progress that has been made.  The Government will not pre-empt the work of Senator McAleese's group in dealing with the religious orders, the Justice for Magdalenes group and the other groups.  When that work is complete, other issues will then be addressed.  In the meantime a question does not arise and I ask the Deputy to withdraw the suggestion that anyone is waiting for people to die.This is the first Government to make specific decisions to address the very genuine worries and concerns that have been expressed by those who lived in the Magdalene laundries.  We have put in place a process in which we are also moving forward on other fronts.  The possibility of a restorative justice scheme operating is under active consideration between the religious congregations and the former residents.  We are looking at the possibility of a repository in which all the records of the laundries are retained.  In the meantime, significant progress has been made in a very short period of time by Senator McAleese's group.

However, an important point needs to be made about the timeframe.  Many of these ladies are very elderly and it is being said in certain quarters that there seems to have been a delaying tactic.  I look forward to reading the report this afternoon and no doubt there will be a need for a further priority question.

#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-25 00:00:00	Prelude	33	The function of An Garda Síochána is set out in the Garda Síochána Act 2005 and includes regulating and controlling road traffic and improving road safety.  I am informed by the Garda authorities that Garda management, to the greatest extent possible, ensures that the deployment of Garda traffic corps personnel reflects and coincides with identified peak periods of commuter traffic to facilitate the smooth flow of traffic during these times.  Within the Dublin region, city and county, a specific traffic management plan — Operation Artery — is in place which allocates traffic corps resources to managing morning and evening peak traffic.  Operation Artery operates as an inter-agency response to traffic management involving the four relevant local authorities and the public transport providers.While one of the primary responsibilities of the Garda traffic corps is traffic management, all Garda resources respond to and deal with traffic management issues.  Local Garda management has contingency plans in the event of a major road traffic incident on motorways, major arteries and other thoroughfares, with a major emergency plan in place specifically for an incident on the M50.  The primary purpose of such plans is to ensure that such incidents are dealt with as expeditiously as possible to minimise disruption to traffic, to ensure that such incidents are subject to thorough investigation, and to ensure, as far as possible, the smooth flow of traffic by way of early notification to road users, through road-side and overhead notice-boards and the media, of the occurrence of a major incident and rolling traffic diversions.I am informed that the incident to which the Deputy refers, and in which, tragically, a person was fatally injured, occurred at Steeven's Lane and involved a Luas tram.  Steeven's Lane, which is not open to through traffic, was immediately closed to allow for the proper investigation of this serious incident, including a technical examination of the scene.  An Garda Síochána has agreed protocols in place with Luas senior management when such incidents occur.  Every effort is made in such circumstances to ensure continued access to and egress from locations and that road closures and stoppages of rail and tram services are kept to a minimum, while at all times ensuring that all available evidence is collected to allow such incidents to be thoroughly investigated.
#DerekKeating	unknown-#DerekKeating-party	unknown-#DerekKeating-dob	unknown-#DerekKeating-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-25 00:00:00	Prelude	34	I thank the Minister for his considered and comprehensive reply to my question.  The Government's main focus since its election some months ago has been on our national recovery.  Difficulties with the movement of traffic to and from the workplace only delay our national recovery and do not help the economy.  Like me, I am sure other Members have experienced considerable logjams following a simple breakdown or accident and this is the motivation behind my question.  A co-ordinated response is required and it should involve some of the activities mentioned by the Minister.  It should also involve local authorities and, where appropriate, the emergency services.There is no better example of where the emergency services needed to be involved than yesterday and the experience we all had returning home from work.  When I eventually arrived home from the House, I was struck by the comments made by a number of people that but for the support of 98FM, they would not have had much direction on what route to take.  Considering the horrendous flooding along the quays, including at the Guinness premises, there was an absence of personnel to assist.  I agree that the circumstances were unprecedented, but I would like to see a more co-ordinated response.
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-25 00:00:00	Prelude	35	As someone who was in the city centre yesterday, I can say the weather conditions were exceptional.  There was flooding in all sorts of locations.  I would like to praise all of those working in the employment of the city council, the Garda Síochána and the fire service for the extraordinary work they did yesterday in very difficult circumstances.  They dealt not only with traffic jams but with the exceptional and unusual flooding that took place at a variety of locations across the city, north and south.  Certainly, there were traffic delays, but the traffic moved to a better degree than might have been anticipated.  One of the difficulties that sometimes arises in extreme weather conditions of this nature is that traffic delays occur, not as a result of accidents, but as a result of dysfunctional traffic lights, which seem to be affected by extreme weather conditions.  This is a matter for the city council, but too frequently at times of extreme wet weather, we see traffic lights ceasing to function and a traffic jam developing for no particular reason other than that.The Garda traffic control centre, which is based at the Garda communication centre in Harcourt Street, co-ordinates the Garda response to traffic management issues in the Dublin region.  At the control centre, there is direct access to an extensive range of CCTV facilities, including Garda, Dublin City Council, Dublin Port and Luas cameras.  There is a considerable degree of co-ordination between the agencies when a major difficulty arises, which occurred yesterday evening.
#DerekKeating	unknown-#DerekKeating-party	unknown-#DerekKeating-dob	unknown-#DerekKeating-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-25 00:00:00	Prelude	36	Given the exceptional circumstances to which the Minister referred in some detail, perhaps he can assist me at a suitable occasion in getting a considered report from the Garda Commissioner detailing reports from the emergency services, the Garda Síochána and the local authorities in the greater Dublin region.  This would be of assistance in planning for the future.
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-25 00:00:00	Prelude	37	The Garda Síochána traffic control centre liaises directly with the control rooms of the national traffic control centre, Dublin City Council traffic control, South Dublin County Council traffic rooms, the Dublin Fire Brigade, Luas, Dublin Bus, Dublin Port Tunnel, the M50 concession and, in partnership with these agencies, it directs responses to incidents when they occur.  There is substantial arranged co-ordination and information exchange at all times.
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2011-10-25 00:00:00	Prelude	38	I propose to take Questions Nos. 44, 66, 72 and 78 together.In the Programme for National Recovery 2011-16, the Government made a commitment to "establish independent regulation of the legal professions to improve access and competition, make legal costs more transparent and ensure adequate procedures for addressing consumer complaints".  The Legal Services Regulation Bill 2011, published on 12 October, provides the statutory framework for meeting all of these commitments.  By the same token, the Bill supports the urgent objectives of structural reform, national competitiveness and economic recovery contained in the EU-IMF-ECB memorandum of understanding, while taking account of the recommendations for reform made by the legal costs working group and by the Competition Authority.  I had the opportunity to brief the EU-IMF-ECB Troika on the provisions of the new Bill on Monday, 17 October.  The troika considered the Bill to have met both the spirit and the letter of the Government's relevant undertakings.The Bill provides three levers of sustainable reform.  There will be a new and independent legal services regulatory authority with responsibility for oversight of both solicitors and barristers, an office of the legal costs adjudicator to assume the role of the existing Office of the Taxing Master, which is being conferred with enhanced transparency in its functions.  The legal costs regime will be brought into the open with better public awareness and entitlement to legal costs information.  There will be an independent complaints mechanism within the new regulatory authority to deal with complaints about professional misconduct and this will be supported by a new independent legal professions disciplinary tribunal.  These three levers of change are mutually reinforcing in terms of oversight, standard-setting, enforcement and redress.  For example, as well as providing a modernised framework for the adjudication of disputed legal costs, the Bill makes the issue of an excessive bill of costs one of those matters which may be considered as misconduct when a complaint is made to the new regulatory authority.Part 9 of the Bill sets out, for the first time in statute, a set of legal costs principles that are to guide the assessment of legal costs, the key principle being that of reasonable costs for appropriate work done.  Lawyers will be required to notify clients in a more detailed and intelligible way about legal costs.  Key changes include the fact that both solicitors and barristers will now have to provide proper costs information.  A client has to be issued with a notice of costs as soon as he or she has given instruction to a lawyer and the notice must also specify a cooling-off period allowing the client to consider whether or not to continue with the case.The process of notification of costs to clients is ongoing and responsive to any developments in the conduct of a case and is not just an initial, once-off exercise.  When legal work is completed a detailed bill of costs has to be issued, which also explains that the options of negotiation, mediation or adjudication are available to resolve any disputed aspects of the bill.  Contravention of the notification requirements is misconduct and may be taken into account to disallow costs in a costs adjudication.Arbitrary costs practices, such as imposing the two thirds of senior counsel rule in charging for the services of a junior counsel, are abolished.  Recruitment to the role of legal costs adjudicator, previously confined to solicitors of ten years standing only, is now extended to people with a wider skill-set, that is, to similarly qualified barristers and legal-costs accountants.  The office of the legal costs adjudicator — currently the Office of the Taxing Master — will be made subject to the governance and accountability practices, such as annual reporting, applied to public bodies generally.  The office will be able to issue legal costs guidelines and will, for the first time, maintain a register of decisions on adjudications.  This will publicise both the reasoning and outcomes of legal costs adjudications.It will be possible to publish decisions made by the office of the legal costs adjudicator in regard to family law cases.  Provision is made in section 82, subsections (3) and (4), to publish such a decision and the reasoning for it.  Only certain information will be withheld, for example, the name of the party to a decision, the name of a child where one is involved and such other information as is protected by rule of law, including, for instance, the in camera rule.  This means that the basis of cost adjudication decisions arising from family law cases will become transparent in a way that has not been possible up to now, while the in camera rule and other relevant privacy provisions continue to be observed.  A case progression initiative has been operating in recent years in the Circuit Court for family proceedings and such case management has been mandatory for family law cases since October 2008.  Under this system cases are listed before a county registrar for a hearing to determine whether they are ready to proceed.  I participated in the launch of the Dolphin House initiative last May involving the Courts Service, the Legal Aid Board and the family mediation service of the Family Support Agency.  This initiative encourages parties into an alternative mediation process with a special focus on cases involving the welfare of children.The principles relating to legal costs, which are contained in Schedule 1 to the Legal Services Regulation Bill, include "the time and labour that the legal practitioner has reasonably expended on the matter" concerned.  The legal costs adjudicator is obliged, under subsection 95(5) of the Bill, to ascertain reasonably the time taken to carry out the work concerned as part of his or her determination of the appropriateness of work done and the reasonableness of its cost.  While solicitors and barristers alike will have to inform clients of any time-based rates that may apply to their work, they will also have to satisfy the other principles relating to legal costs that have been set out.  This is considered the best way to achieve a balance between time and the other factors that relate to legal costs, for example, the complexity, urgency and priority of a case.  The intention is to avoid creating a situation where over-emphasis of time as the determinant of legal costs could incentivise inefficiency in the handling of cases or be unfairly exploited as a "plodder's charter".Additional information not given on the floor of the HouseThe interests of client consumers and legal practitioners will be balanced under this Bill better than ever before, to the mutual benefit of both.  Under the provisions of the Bill everyone will be clearer about what should be happening when legal services are being sought or provided, how much these services will cost and where they can go to for independent adjudication if they have a complaint or wish to settle a dispute about legal costs.  These measures, combined with the proposed new business structures for legal practitioners set out in the Bill, will provide a basis for enhanced competition and efficiencies in the legal sector and will lead to a reduction in legal costs.  The Bill represents a package of reforms that will be of long-term benefit to the legal professions, consumers and the national economy.

Shedding light on the issue of legal costs is a particularly welcome amendment, although whether they will be reduced is another argument.  I do not want to anticipate the Second Stage debate, but will the Minister indicate when it is intended to bring it forward?
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-25 00:00:00	Prelude	40	I am conscious that this is a detailed and complex Bill.  As such, I wish to afford time to Members opposite and to those affected by the Bill, including consumers of legal services and the legal professions, to consider its provisions.  It is anticipated that Second Stage will not be taken until after the second week in November, at the earliest, to afford an opportunity for the fullest possible consideration to be given to the Bill before proceeding to detailed debate on it in this House.
#JonathanOBrien	unknown-#JonathanOBrien-party	unknown-#JonathanOBrien-dob	unknown-#JonathanOBrien-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-25 00:00:00	Prelude	41	We were under the impression that this legislation would run to some 300 pages.  While the Bill we have been presented with is comprehensive, it comprises just over 100 pages.  I am not complaining about this——
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-25 00:00:00	Prelude	42	The Bill was 300 pages in typed print, but when it was printed by Cahill Printers it turned out at approximately 100 pages.
#JonathanOBrien	unknown-#JonathanOBrien-party	unknown-#JonathanOBrien-dob	unknown-#JonathanOBrien-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-25 00:00:00	Prelude	43	Will the Minister confirm that nothing was removed from the Bill at the last minute which he wished to include?
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-25 00:00:00	Prelude	44	Yes.  I will be pleased to show the Deputy my very thick folder of typed content.  To be specific, there were originally 298 pages of content in typeface, but the printing process reduced that substantially.
#BernardJDurkan	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-party	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-dob	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-25 00:00:00	Prelude	45	I thank the Minister for his comprehensive reply.  Will he indicate whether an assessment has been done of the extent to which legal fees are likely to be reduced arising from this legislation?  I have raised this question many times in the past.  It concerns the extent to which legal fees are likely to be reduced arising from the proposed legislation, particularly in respect of the costs of tribunals and the level of legal fees identified by the troika as being a serious impediment to competition.  The Minister might indicate in quantifiable times the extent to which the benefit will accrue to the taxpayer arising from that as opposed to a rejigging of the structures which might mean we will end up in the same position we were in when we started.
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-25 00:00:00	Prelude	46	A broad range of issues must be addressed to bring about a reduction in legal fees.  Legal fees will be reduced as a consequence of this Bill, first, because of the new transparency that will apply to the charging of legal fees; second, the adjudicative process will cease to be a mystery both to some members of the legal profession as well as to the entire general public by the publication of decisions which should provide for a greater uniformity in the charging of legal fees; and, third, as a consequence of the new structures that will be available that will reduce costs.  For example, under the provisions of the Bill it will be possible to directly consult a barrister to obtain advice without having to first consult with solicitors.  The Bill envisages the provision of legal advice through alternative structures as well as the current form of solicitors practice and barrister practice being able to continue out of the Bar Library with barristers operating as sole contractors.  Those alternative structures will create the possibility for barrister partnerships, multi-disciplinary firms and the possibility of solicitors and barristers jointly representing clients as advocates in court proceedings.All of those measures will contribute to cost reduction but the Legal Services Bill is not a magic bullet in affecting cost reduction because a broad range of other things must be done, some of which we are engaged in dealing with.  First, we must try to ensure that people use alternative dispute resolution methods as opposed to litigation when disputes arise and I am happy to tell the House that a mediation and conciliation Bill which I hope to bring before the House is at a reasonably advanced stage of preparation.  Second, there is a need to provide for greater efficiencies within the court services to ensure our courts operate in a manner which does not unnecessarily give rise to legal costs.In the context of tribunals, the Deputy is right in saying that tribunals have proved particularly costly.  I do not believe there is a way of guaranteeing to the House that if a tribunal in the future is investigating the issue the substantial costs will not be incurred.  That is the reason we need new accountability mechanisms and why there is a referendum taking place to facilitate committees of this House investigating matters of substantial public importance and holding hearings with a view to ensuring not only that this House does its duty, but issues that need to be inquired into can be inquired into without the enormous costs that have been incurred in the past through the use of the mechanism of tribunals.
#CatherineMurphy	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-party	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-dob	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-25 00:00:00	Prelude	47	I have not mastered the art of bilocation yet.  I was in a committee meeting and missed much of the response the Minister gave.  There are a number of components to my questions, the first of which is the requirement to keep records.  It is very difficult for the Taxing Master to adjudicate on something if there is no requirement to keep records.  I do not know if the Minister indicated in his reply that he intends to make changes but I presume it is open to him to make those type of provisions by way of an amendment to a piece of legislation.The second component concerns people who are persistently complained to and found to have been offenders in regard to the Taxing Master.  Most of those would concern family law cases.  The lack of that information does not act as a warning to people when they take on someone to prosecute a case.  Those are the areas on which I would like to hear the Minister's response.
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-25 00:00:00	Prelude	48	The Deputy may have missed hearing me say that an important element of the new reform is that the legal costs adjudication office will have to maintain a record of decisions delivered by it and that they will be published.  In the context of the way the legislation is drafted, I hope there will be a facility, for example, for those decisions to be on a website.In the context of the family law area, while the anonymity of estranged spouses in a family dispute, for example, or the names of their children will be preserved because of the in camera rule, if there is a dispute over legal costs in a family law matter it will be adjudicated upon and the outcome of the adjudication can be published while preserving the privacy of the individuals concerned.  The lawyers will not have anonymity in the context of publication.  The anonymity applies to the parties, that is, the husband, the wife or the cohabitees in a family dispute or, if it involved an adoption issue, the adopters and perhaps the biological parent but the anonymity will not apply to the law firm under the provisions of the Bill.  The fact that these decisions will be published, whether we are dealing with family litigation, civil litigation or any other litigation, will also act as a spotlight on costs that are charged.As I mentioned in my initial response, where a complaint of excessive charging is adjudicated upon it is an issue that can fall within the context of misconduct as it arises under the Bill, which may result in that matter being dealt with from a disciplinary perspective.  There is a range of what I would describe as connected reforms which should not only shed a spotlight in this area but disincentivise persons who overcharge.  In fairness to members of the legal profession, not every allegation of overcharging against members of the legal profession is true.  Some are true but some are not.
#BernardJDurkan	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-party	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-dob	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-25 00:00:00	Prelude	49	To what extent have comparisons in respect of legal fees been made between this jurisdiction and adjoining jurisdictions, for instance, Northern Ireland, the United Kingdom and France, having particular regard to the recognition by the troika of various aspects of our financial services and various structures, legal and otherwise, as being a deterrent in terms of competition and costs?  If he has not done so already would it be possible for the Minster to produce a graph illustrating the comparisons between the fees for similar activities here and in the other jurisdictions?
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-25 00:00:00	Prelude	50	I do not have a graph I can produce for the Deputy but I refer him to the initial report and the final report of the Competition Authority published towards the end of 2006 which regarded a range of difficulties within the legal professions as restrictive practices which unduly added to the legal costs for the consumers of the legal profession.  I see the legislation to be published as being of substantial benefit to consumers in particular and I hope that when members of the legal profession, both solicitors and barristers, have had an opportunity to reflect on the detailed contents of the Bill they will see it is also modernising the structures through which legal services can be provided, bringing the legal professions out of the 19th into the 21st century and, in sweeping the cobwebs out of the legal corridors, is giving an opportunity to those who wish to be competitive and provide legal services to consumers to do so through new structures which will be to the benefit of both the legal profession and consumers and which I believe will reduce costs because of increased competitiveness.The view of the troika is that, on average, legal costs in this jurisdiction are something in excess of 20% of what they would be in our neighbouring jurisdiction in England.  I am not sure how they have calculated that sum because often it is difficult to do the comparisons.The issue of legal costs is not simply about what lawyers charge.  A range of reforms are necessary to incentivise people to use mediation instead of litigation in resolving disputes and to incentivise lawyers to encourage clients to resolve disputes by agreement where mediation is not necessary.  There are substantial reforms needed within our court structures, which ensure that those who have to litigate areas of difficulty in their lives know lawyers are kept waiting around courts from one day to the next with court hearings lasting an hour or a couple of hours while other matters intervene.  Court cases end up costing clients of the legal profession for three or four days in court when, if the courts were better organised, the matter might have been dealt with within a single day.These are specific issues and I have urged the Courts Service to address them in the interests of consumers and also in the interest of the State, in the context of the substantial legal costs the State must meet in dealing with litigation taken against the State.
#DaraCalleary	unknown-#DaraCalleary-party	unknown-#DaraCalleary-dob	unknown-#DaraCalleary-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-25 00:00:00	Prelude	51	Has the Minister a figure in mind for what people can expect legal costs to be reduced by over, for example, a two year period as a result of full implementation of the Legal Services Bill and addressing the other issues?
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-25 00:00:00	Prelude	52	I cannot give the Deputy an answer to that.  Every legal issue is different and every type of legal work that must be undertaken, be it by solicitors or solicitors and barristers and, hopefully also in the future, by barristers alone, can vary.  It can depend on not only the issue that must be addressed but also the personality of the client with whom the lawyer is dealing.  The Deputy knows that well enough.  One cannot prescribe a specific fee that is payable in a range of litigation areas; in other areas it is a great deal simpler.  In the making of what I describe as simple wills or the conveyance of a property there are set fees that can be readily identifiable and that people should know they will incur in advance of legal work being undertaken.
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-25 00:00:00	Prelude	53	As the Deputy should be aware, the provisions of the Courts Service Act 1998 conferred sole responsibility on the Courts Service for management of courts and, as Minister, I have no role in the matter.  Section 4(3) of the 1998 Act provides that the service is independent in the performance of its functions, which includes the provision, maintenance and management of court buildings and provision of facilities for court users.I have, however, had inquiries made and the Courts Service has informed me that in the current financial climate all court venues are kept under continuing review.  A number of qualitative criteria are applied to each venue, including case count, condition of the building, proximity of local gardaí, number of sittings per annum and so forth.  The service endeavours to ensure, in so far as possible, that venues have cell accommodation available in order to reduce Prison Service escort costs as well as meeting the standard that court users are entitled to expect while also considering the efficiency of the particular court.The Courts Service board decided at its meeting on 17 October last to approve the closing of the following district courthouses: Ballymote which will be amalgamated with Sligo; Boyle which will be amalgamated with Carrick-on-Shannon — the Circuit Court also sits from time to time in Boyle and these sittings will now take place in Roscommon; Templemore which will be amalgamated with Thurles; Kiltimagh and Claremorris in County Mayo which will be amalgamated with Castlebar.  I understand the District Court has not sat in Claremorris since 2009 and that its business has been heard in Kiltimagh.  I am informed that the business of all three venues will in future be heard in Castlebar.While there are no courthouses in Castleisland and Athenry, the Courts Service has informed me that those District Courts sit in very unsuitable premises and will also be relocated.  With the exception of Castleisland, which is due to close on 1 December, it is intended that the other closures will take effect early in 2012.  In this context it should be noted that the board, over the past 12 years, has amalgamated 140 District Court areas.Additional information not given on the floor of the HouseThe Courts Service has informed me that decisions to close a particular venue are generally taken due to its poor conditions, some of which present a health and safety risk which would cost a great deal to rectify.  The absence of holding cells in a number of cases is also a factor.  However, achieving greater efficiencies, particularly with regard to freeing up judicial staff and Garda time currently spent travelling between venues, is also a consideration.  I am informed that this rationalisation policy has gained operational efficiencies, saves time and improves speed of access to justice.
#DaraCalleary	unknown-#DaraCalleary-party	unknown-#DaraCalleary-dob	unknown-#DaraCalleary-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-25 00:00:00	Prelude	54	The Minister does not have direct responsibility for the Courts Service, but the service is responsible to the Minister and this House for its budget.  I wish to raise a number of concerns that have been expressed about the specific closures outlined by the Minister.  First, the users were not consulted.  Even though they are represented on the board of the Courts Service the day-to-day users of the courts concerned, that is, the solicitors and judges who work in the courts, were not consulted in advance.  Second, when they were consulted they were told, particularly regarding the closure of Kiltimagh, that it was being done for efficiency reasons, not cost saving reasons.  When Deputy O'Mahony raised this issue with the Minister last week, the Minister undertook to find out if a cost-benefit analysis for the closure of Kiltimagh had been prepared to measure the extra costs that would be incurred.  This would equally apply to Ballymote, Boyle, Templemore and the other venues.  There are the extra costs for gardaí travelling, prison issues and extra subsistence costs.  Has the Minister found out if those analyses were prepared and will they be published or put before the Oireachtas committee on justice?
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-25 00:00:00	Prelude	55	The Courts Service has informed me that decisions to close a venue are generally taken due to its poor conditions, some of which present a health and safety risk which would cost a great deal to rectify.  The absence of holding cells is a factor in a number of cases.  However, achieving greater efficiencies, particularly in freeing up judicial staff and Garda time currently spent travelling between venues, is also a consideration.  I am informed that this rationalisation policy has gained operational efficiencies, saves time and improves speed of access to justice.  The same matters have informed the consideration given to the closures I mentioned.  By achieving efficiencies, one effects savings and one ensures, at a time when there are limited resources, that those resources are used to the best extent in the interests of taxpayers.
#DaraCalleary	unknown-#DaraCalleary-party	unknown-#DaraCalleary-dob	unknown-#DaraCalleary-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-25 00:00:00	Prelude	56	One of the concerns expressed is that there is no rural representation on the building sub-committee of the Courts Service.  The venues that are being closed, as outlined by the Minister, are all in rural areas.  This will put an extra mileage burden on people to get access to justice.  Can the Minister bring the concern about the lack of rural representation on the building sub-committee of the Courts Service to the notice of the Courts Service and ask it to address it?
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-25 00:00:00	Prelude	57	If there is no rural representation on the building sub-committee of the Courts Service, it was calibrated during the term of my predecessor when the Fianna Fáil and Green Party Government was in office.  I will certainly inquire into that issue.  The Deputy was correct when he said earlier that the Courts Service is independent but that it must report to me.  It falls within the envelope of the Department of Justice and Equality in the context of the funding available to the Courts Service.  The Courts Service, like all other bodies, is under an obligation to effect efficiencies, ensure that resources are used wisely and, in so far as possible, to achieve savings.  The Courts Service cannot be exempt from the savings that must be achieved across the broad range of justice expenditure.  That obligation applied to the service in 2011 as a consequence of the funding allocated in the 2010 budget for the service and it will continue to apply in 2012.  It is likely that the Courts Service will continue to make decisions to operate with greater efficiency and effectiveness and it is likely that there will be further court closures in 2012.
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-25 00:00:00	Prelude	58	The functions and powers of joint policing committees, JPCs, are set out in the Garda Síochána Act 2005, which provides for a committee in each local authority area.  The Act provides that JPCs operate under guidelines issued by the Minister for Justice and Equality after consultation with the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government.  The current guidelines were issued in September 2008.The Act also provides for the establishment of local policing fora at neighbourhood level under guidelines.  These fora are intended to operate in a more informal way than the JPCs and deepen the engagement between gardaí, the local authority and neighbourhood communities.  Guidelines for the establishment and operation of fora were issued by the then Minister in July 2009, following consultation with the Ministers for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government and Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs and other stakeholders.  These guidelines restrict the establishment of fora to the 14 areas where local drug task forces operate.  It was decided to prioritise the establishment of local policing fora in these areas, in the context of the resources available and in accordance with the national drugs strategy, because their need is greatest.  This process is currently under way.With regard to the JPCs generally, I am aware that some are working better than others, depending on the local authority.  As I have already informed the House, I intend shortly to communicate with local authorities to get an overview of how the JPCs are operating and the extent to which their activities are constructive and beneficial to the community and the Garda.  My Department, the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government and An Garda Síochána have commenced work on reviewing the operation of the committees.  My intention is that a document will be prepared on the basis of which consultations will take place with the local authorities on how the operation of the committees might be improved, with a view to updating the guidelines.  I envisage that this process will be substantially complete in the early part of next year.  The role and extent of local policing fora will be examined as part of this process.
#JonathanOBrien	unknown-#JonathanOBrien-party	unknown-#JonathanOBrien-dob	unknown-#JonathanOBrien-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-25 00:00:00	Prelude	59	I thank the Minister for his reply.  He touched on one of the critical issues, that some of the joint policing committees are working better than others.  I welcome the timeline outlined for the review process.  I am aware from experience that it works very well in Cork.  However, that is due not to the guidelines but to the individuals who sit on the committee, including members of the Garda who are open to the idea.  In other areas where I have discussed the issue with councillors there is not the buy-in from some elements, not just the Garda. but the community and local authorities.  That is one area on which we need to tighten up.  In Cork, where the system works well and the Garda buy in to the process, it is having an effect on the ground and improves confidence in the Garda.  If that could be replicated across the State we would be doing well.  That is an area where we need to look at the guidelines.
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-25 00:00:00	Prelude	60	I agree with what the Deputy has said.  It is my experience, having sat briefly on one of these committees, that it depends on the Garda and the councillors.  The councillors may have choices in the context of how these committees work.  They can constructively engage with the Garda and come forward with suggestions in regard to policing in local communities that are generally beneficial and, on the Garda side, if there is openness they will engage.  Alternatively, councillors can just use the committees to table a motion or a question to get a written reply, not engage particularly, and send the reply out to their constituents.The first type of engagement, where there is a dialogue between councillors representing local communities and the local gardaí working on the ground and where there is a degree of openness between the two in problem solving, is most valuable.  I hope the review being conducted will provide a greater insight into this and might assist the workings of the committees, where there is a perception that some are not working particularly well, and will feed into the need for any changes that may be made to the guidelines.
#JonathanOBrien	unknown-#JonathanOBrien-party	unknown-#JonathanOBrien-dob	unknown-#JonathanOBrien-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-25 00:00:00	Prelude	61	Does that include giving additional powers, if necessary, to the committees?  In the North there is greater participation in regard to the operational process.  While the committees are good, additional powers are needed to make them more effective in some areas.  Will that review contain recommendations and, if so, is that something on which the Minister is willing to act?
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-25 00:00:00	Prelude	62	As the Deputy is aware, the functions and powers of joint policing committees are set out in the Garda Síochána Act 2005.  In the context of the review it would be interesting to get an insight across the country as to the extent to which the provisions contained in that Act are being utilised and applied and whether some committees are more constrained than others.  Should the review show that some beneficial changes could be made to the legislation, I am open to looking at that issue.  Given the Deputy's knowledge, he is welcome to feed into the process.  I would hope, when the review is complete, to publish it and to discuss it in the House or in the Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality before conclusions are reached from what is learned through the review.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-25 00:00:00	Prelude	63	I wish to express my sincere sympathy to the family of Garda Ciaran Jones who, though off duty, was trying to assist others in the very sudden flooding which occurred yesterday.  His last act was one of great bravery and courage and our sympathies go to his family and friends and also to the young woman who also died.  She was found dead this morning as a result of the flooding.  I pay tribute to all the emergency personnel for the work they did.From the little that has been revealed so far, it is hoped there will be sign-off this week on a package of measures which will see the eurozone out of crisis mode.  Unlike the governments of other countries, the Taoiseach has not told the House or the people about either his negotiating position or what has been proposed.  The Bundestag is receiving a very detailed presentation on exactly what is being discussed, yet all we have heard from the Taoiseach and members of the Government is vague generalities that he expects everything to be all right on the night.  Separate to this, his Ministers had been accepting praise for a budget which they voted against.Will the Taoiseach tell the House exactly what is Ireland's position in regard to these negotiations?  Are we supporting a Greek restructuring of up to 60% in terms of a debt write-down?  If Greek sovereign bondholders are being burned widespread recapitalisation of banks will have to be undertaken.  This represents the first and probably only opportunity we will get to force bondholders to share the burden in Ireland.  That is hugely important for us as a country because the two consistent road blocks to burning bondholders in the Irish banks will be removed.  A sovereign default and bank recapitalisation are what we were told would be risked by unilateral action.Has the Taoiseach put this issue on the summit agenda for discussion?  Will he insist there will be no deal unless our concerns are addressed?  To miss this first and probably only opportunity to burn senior bank bondholders would be an opportunity lost.  Will he confirm if he discussed the specific issue of not restructuring Ireland's bank debt with Chancellor Merkel on Sunday last?
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-25 00:00:00	Prelude	64	I join with the Minister for Justice and Equality and Deputy Martin in respect of the tragic incident in which Garda Ciaran Jones lost his life.  I am aware of the general circumstances that Garda Jones, who was off duty, was attempting to help persons in distress when this tragic accident occurred.  I am also aware of the death of a Filipino national.  We extend our sympathies to the two families on what is a tragedy for them arising from the excessive rainfall yesterday and the consequent flooding.In response to Deputy Martin's question on the euro, this is a serious matter.  The German Chancellor must have the authorisation of the Bundestag for any agreement beyond what was already approved in September.  That is why she is addressing her Parliament in respect of that approval.A broad range of issues was discussed at the meeting of the 27 member states of the European Union.  It was not strictly related to the eurozone crisis but that was a central part of the discussion in the latter part of the meeting.  The fundamental questions to be answered were raised by a number of speakers.  On behalf of this country I made the point strongly, which received support from other countries, that the decisions which it is hoped will be taken on Wednesday, cannot be taken in isolation.  They are all interlinked and connected.  The fundamental questions being asked were whether we can afford to let Greece default; if €109 billion is sufficient to rescue the situation; to what extent and by what method the ESFS fund can be leveraged; and how a guarantee and to what extent the so-called firewalls can be put in place to prevent contagion and serious issues arising for other countries.  Those central questions were the focus of a response from leaders.For our part I voiced that opinion exceptionally strongly and it received support.  The discussions that are ongoing are complex and technical in respect of what needs to be done if the situation is to be rescued.  I cannot give any further detail beyond what was discussed at the meeting, both of the eurozone and of the 27 European Union member states.  Deputy Martin indicated that the German Chancellor is giving a detailed response to the Bundestag, but that level of complex detail was not discussed at the meetings of the eurozone or the 27 member states.There was an agreement on the range of the discussions that would take place between the technical people who are looking at the involvement of the private sector in the banks in the Greek situation.  Suffice to say that although Prime Minister Papandreou was of the opinion originally that his country could get back to the bond markets at the end of 2012 it is now clearly the situation that Greece will not be able to get back to the bond markets until 2020.  That means the situation for Greek citizens will be severe and austere for the next ten years.The ECOFIN meeting which was to be held tomorrow is now cancelled.  Either that means there has been some conclusion at the technical discussions or else that all of this will go to the leaders meeting tomorrow evening at 6 p.m.  I cannot give any further update on the matter because officials from the Departments are in Europe at the moment.

Have we put that on the table?  Is the answer "Yes" or "No"?  This Parliament is entitled to a basic response to the question.  The reason I ask the question is because the Taoiseach made a big deal of that not so long ago, as did the Minister for Transport, Deputy Varadkar, the Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, in New York, and the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation.

On 2 November, the Government will authorise the payment of €700 million to unguaranteed senior bondholders in Anglo Irish Bank.  That €700 million would pay for special needs assistants, new hospitals and resources for hospitals.  Not paying the money would mean no welfare cuts, household charge or universal social charge.  Ar bharr ar sin fosta, tá an Taoiseach sásta brú a chur ar ár muintir.  Idir seo agus Mí Eanáir beidh €2 bhilliún á thabhairt do shealbhóirí.  Sin airgead arbh fhéidir a chaitheamh ar leapacha d'othair agus ar dhaoine atá faoi strus ag an uair dheacair seo.Ba mhaith liom go ndéarfadh an Taoiseach go soiléir go mbeidh sé ag cur stad leis seo.  Ná bíodh sé ag tabhairt brontannais eile do Anglo Irish Bank.  Why is it acceptable to write down Greek debt while Irish people have to pay private bankers?  Why is money being cut from special needs assistants, hospitals, schools and other essential services while billions of euro are being given to unguaranteed bondholders?

The question is very straightforward.  On 2 November the Government, and not the previous Government or Fianna Fáil, will pay €700 million.  There is no onus on the Government to do so.  It is not legally, morally or politically bound to do so.  The money will be paid to unguaranteed bondholders.  The money has been taken away from special needs assistants, hospital facilities and other necessary public services.  Chuir mé ceist ar an Taoiseach why it is acceptable to write down Greek debt — I have no objection to that — while Irish people have to pay private bankers.  It does not make sense.It would be a great boost to people to know the Taoiseach is standing up for the citizens of the State.  Two Irelands are developing under Deputy Kenny's leadership.  There is the Ireland of the banker agus an ciorcal órga — the golden circle — and the Ireland of the ordinary people, who are suffering at the bottom.

However, as a country that is meeting the challenges of the memorandum of understanding and of our bailout situation, we want to ensure the decisions made are interlinked so all countries are protected and the Greek situation is recognised as being unique and that the decisions taken by the countries of the eurozone see to it that Greece is unique and that every other country is protected by that firewall.

#ShaneRoss	unknown-#ShaneRoss-party	unknown-#ShaneRoss-dob	unknown-#ShaneRoss-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-25 00:00:00	Prelude	150	I join the Taoiseach and other leaders in offering my sympathy on the tragic deaths of the member of the Garda and the Filipino national today.One of this morning's newspapers used an unfortunate turn of phrase.  I believe it was The Irish Times, which talked about the Italian Prime Minister getting a dressing down from the German Chancellor and the French President.  It is important to ask the Taoiseach questions about burning bondholders and Irish default.  However, the Taoiseach put his finger on the issue.  Greece is not now the only problem in Europe.  The game has moved on to Italy, which is a much more serious potential problem.  Yesterday, Chancellor Merkel and President Sarkozy confronted the Italian Prime Minister and told him it was time for him to introduce far more stringent austerity measures.  That is undoubtedly true.  The Italian austerity measures are unsatisfactory.Where does Ireland stand on the great quarrels that are going on among the European leaders?  It is obvious there is a huge split given the Italian Prime Minister's robust response to France and Germany that he will not take dictation from them.  Where does Ireland stand on the need for austerity in Italy?  Where does it stand on the split between Prime Minister Sarkozy and Chancellor Merkel in regard to how much pain should be taken by those who invested in Greece?
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-25 00:00:00	Prelude	151	I spoke to all of the personalities and leaders mentioned by Deputy Ross.  For the first time in my attendance at these meetings there was a genuine focus on the fundamentals of what needs to be done.  I too have heard the reports of the conversations between President Sarkozy and Chancellor Merkel with Prime Minister Berlusconi.  However, I do not know the details in that regard.  I am aware that the Italian Government approved an austerity programme.  The question now is its commitment to implement it.Deputy Ross asked where Ireland stands on austerity.  No more than anyone else, we do not like it.  However, we recognise that following the lifting of political carpets in departments one often finds a great deal of unseemly activity that went on in the past which must be cleaned up in the interest of getting out of a bailout situation.  In regard to where Ireland stands on austerity, our people understand the challenge we face.  We all want to get out of this situation as quickly as we can.  I do not have any direction over Prime Minister Berlusconi.  However, there were at the meeting which took place during the week some direct political comments about what needs to be done.
#TimDooley	unknown-#TimDooley-party	unknown-#TimDooley-dob	unknown-#TimDooley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-25 00:00:00	Prelude	152	What did the Taoiseach say?
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-25 00:00:00	Prelude	153	To be honest, a number of prime ministers or leaders may not have been as sufficiently aware of the situation in other countries as they now are.  At the conclusion of that meeting there was an understanding of how serious this is in the European context.  The Deputy will have heard the comments of President Sarkozy about Ireland echoed by others.  While we have done well, there remains a long way to go.  No more than Portugal or any other small country, we want everyone to understand that if we are to get out of the bailout, we will need continued support for the path we are on.My contributions to the various discussions on this matter were to remind people that all the decisions that must be made must be interlinked and must focus not alone on the bigger countries, but on all countries.  As the Deputy correctly pointed out, contagion is not limited to the Greek situation or to any other individual country.  The decisions to be made by the eurozone leaders tomorrow night must deal comprehensively and conclusively with this issue.  It may well be that following those decisions details will have to be worked out, in some cases by the ECOFIN Ministers.  There were serious expressions of concern by the leaders in regard to the potential that now exists to deal conclusively with this matter.  That discussion went on for some time.
#ShaneRoss	unknown-#ShaneRoss-party	unknown-#ShaneRoss-dob	unknown-#ShaneRoss-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-25 00:00:00	Prelude	154	I understand the Taoiseach's reluctance to become involved in another European spat.  However, it is important that Ireland is not only perceived as the good poster boy of Europe who is abiding by the rules imposed on him by the IMF-EU and not getting involved in any of the great arguments taking place.  The Taoiseach stated in response to my question that he is not in favour of austerity but that it is necessary.  Where does the Taoiseach stand when it comes to other nations having to impose austerity on their people?  It is all very well saying we have done it and done so successfully, but that is not the position in which I want to be.  Where does the Taoiseach and Government stand on the two big powers of Europe saying that another country must impose austerity?  Does the Taoiseach stand on one side or the other or is he neutral on the issue?
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-25 00:00:00	Prelude	155	France and Germany never said at the meeting that country X or Y should now impose austerity measures.  There was general discussion and agreement on the need for fiscal discipline and control over countries' spending.  Ireland is in the difficult situation it is in because of such lack of control.  It is not the case that Chancellor Merkel or President Sarkozy stated what a particular country should do, rather there were strident comments from many people about what needs to be done, including a discussion in respect of governance of the eurozone for the future.  Comments were also made by countries not members of the eurozone in regard to their individual economic interests and so on.Rather than focusing on the requirement for austerity measures in any individual country, there was a clear understanding that there needs to be far greater fiscal control in respect of any individual country and how it does its business.  I pointed out for the benefit of the meeting that being in a bailout situation brings with it detailed and complex analysis on a fortnightly basis by a troika of the country's economic circumstances and that no money will be paid if it exceeds what has been agreed.  The marker for Ireland is a return to the bond markets.  We do not want that stymied or prevented or for there to be any loss of understanding of just how much encouragement and further assistance a country like ours needs as we proceed.As pointed out by the Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, on many occasions we have achieved a saving of €10 billion for our taxpayers and we need more.  In this regard, a number of options and alternatives are under discussion and negotiation.  It is not a case of the big powers saying who must impose austerity measures and so on.  There is a general acceptance that if Europe is to get this right, and if the eurozone is to plough ahead in a prosperous fashion, countries must ensure fiscal discipline in the manner in which they do their business.  We are measuring up to the conditions of our programme.  However, I do not want anyone to lose sight of the fact that while we have come some of the way, there remains a long way to go.  We need further assistance and will continually point this out in the context of the overall decisions that must be made.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2011-10-25 00:00:00	Prelude	156	I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 to 5, inclusive, together.There are five special advisers in my Department, four of whom are special advisers to me and one of whom is special adviser to the Government Chief Whip.  I do not have a dedicated adviser-consultant on health in my Department.  A specialist adviser on health was appointed to the Minister for Health and Children of the previous Government but was based in the Department of the Taoiseach and his salary was paid from that Vote.The primary function of special advisers is to help achieve the Government's objectives and secure implementation of the programme for Government.  Under the supervision of my chief of staff, the special advisers working in my Department provide briefings and advice on a wide range of policy matters as well as performing such other functions as I may direct from time to time. They also liaise with other special advisers in other Departments so that I remain informed on developments across Government.I am circulating in the Official Report a table showing the salary of each special adviser.  The total salary cost of the five special advisers is approximately €576,000, which  is 47% less than the €l.l million total salary cost of the seven special advisers appointed to the Department of the Taoiseach by the previous Administration.The names and salaries of the special advisers appointed in the Department of the Taoiseach since 9 March 2011 are contained in the following table:Name and GradeAnnual SalaryMark Kennelly, Chief of Staff€168,000Andrew McDowell, Special Adviser€168,000Paul O’Brien, Special Adviser€80,051Angela Flanagan, Special Adviser€80,051Mark O’Doherty, Special Adviser to Chief Whip€80,051
#RichardBoydBarrett	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-party	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-dob	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-25 00:00:00	Prelude	157	My question is specific to the issue of health.  Today, 344 people are on hospital trolleys throughout the country.  Communities from Roscommon to west Cork to Blanchardstown to Loughlinstown to Tipperary to Galway are outraged because the Government's health policy is in tatters.  We have lost 1,000 nurses in the past two years and 6,000 health workers.  The number of bed closures climbed to 2,317 in the past few weeks.  It is a disaster.  Our health service is being massacred.  The Taoiseach's Government promised the most ambitious reform programme ever in health care and that there would be no closures of accident and emergency services unless better, and what were seen to be better, services were put in their place.The Taoiseach needs some advice about what is going on in our health service because lives are at stake.  Communities are terrified by the dismantling of their local health, accident and emergency and ambulance services.  People have come from Bantry today to protest outside the House about what is happening in west Cork.  Who is advising the Taoiseach or is he taking any specific advice on how we will deal with the catastrophe in our accident and emergency and health services throughout the country?
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-25 00:00:00	Prelude	158	The Deputy's question was specific.  He asked if I had any advisers or consultants on health within my Department and if I would make a statement on the matter.  I have made a statement on the matter.  I have no specific special advisers or consultants in my Department dealing with health.  I chair the Cabinet sub-committee on health, which is due to meet again shortly.  It will meet every month for the next six months and then review the position.  In the past, the Cabinet sub-committee met once every quarter.I would point out, however, that in a number of hospitals where there was a consistently high and unfortunate number of trolleys over the past years.  This has been seriously reduced because of increased competence being put into manage the hospitals.  The Minister for Health, who is my chief adviser on health matters, has put together a package for new competency measures to be put in place in respect of the Mid-Western Regional Hospital and University Hospital Galway where, as the Deputy knows, there have been serious overruns in the past.There is not a simple answer.  It takes some time to change that structure but that is where the focus and priority of the Minister lies.  We will keep the Deputy updated as decisions are made on this.The Deputy will also be aware of the special delivery unit which the Minister set up to analyse why these backlogs occur in hospitals in the first place, whether it is due to a virus, a winter vomiting bug, holiday arrangements for cover and so on.  These are all areas which have been set out in the programme for Government.  The Minister has been clear that we want the very best facilities for, and the very best attention given, to patients in the first instance and facilities to be made available to people working on the frontline to service that.  As the Deputy pointed out on a number of occasions in the past, we cannot stand over a situation where independent medical advice indicated that in some cases, safety requirements are not up to standard.
#GerryAdams	unknown-#GerryAdams-party	unknown-#GerryAdams-dob	unknown-#GerryAdams-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-25 00:00:00	Prelude	159	I have three questions. Ba mhaith liom cúpla nóiméad a ghlacadh orthu.The Taoiseach said he had no health advisers, and it shows.  I refer to this notion that it is a winter vomiting bug and so on.  It is not winter yet.  It is a lack of capacity and a deliberate running down of the public element of our health service.I was in Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital in Drogheda this morning.  The Taoiseach may know that last week, a patient who had been on a trolley for five days was found to have TB.  Other patients are now being screened for this dangerous disease.I understand the Cabinet sub-committee on health has met only once and did not meet over the summer.  My question on this issue is — with the Ceann Comhairle's permission, I would like to come back in on the other questions — does the Taoiseach accept that overcrowding in our hospitals is dangerous to staff and patients alike?  Is there not a need for an urgent response from the Government?I was in Blanchardstown hospital on Saturday with an Teachta Mary Lou McDonald, an Teachta Richard Boyd Barrett and others.  Funding for that hospital has been cut by 20%.  Should the Government not put in the extra resources which the health service and the public element of our health service require?
#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-25 00:00:00	Prelude	160	I remind Deputies that this is Question Time.  If they could avoid statements, it would be helpful in order to get through the questions.

#GerryAdams	unknown-#GerryAdams-party	unknown-#GerryAdams-dob	unknown-#GerryAdams-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-25 00:00:00	Prelude	162	I did not say it was not a good situation.  I said it was a dangerous situation.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-25 00:00:00	Prelude	163	As I said, I do not agree it is a good situation, and nobody would.  The question was if we are in a position to deliver the best quality health service for the patients who get into the system with the facilities for those who provide that attention.  This needs to be done in a streamlined manner so that we do not have this backup and the situation we have had over the years where there are all these trolleys in hospitals.  Everybody here has visited hospitals on numerous occasions.The Deputy mentioned Blanchardstown hospital.  There has been enormous public investment in state-of-the-art facilities there.  The hospital is central to the delivery of a quality health service.  The Minister for Health and his colleagues have been there in the recent past.  I do not have the details before me in respect of what is happening at Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital today but I am sure if the Deputy raises this as a Topical Issue matter, the Ceann Comhairle might consider it in due course.
#GerryAdams	unknown-#GerryAdams-party	unknown-#GerryAdams-dob	unknown-#GerryAdams-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-25 00:00:00	Prelude	164	I know precisely what is happening in Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital.  As I said, I was there this morning.
#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-25 00:00:00	Prelude	165	I think I selected Deputy Adams for a Topical Issue today.
#GerryAdams	unknown-#GerryAdams-party	unknown-#GerryAdams-dob	unknown-#GerryAdams-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-25 00:00:00	Prelude	166	I am really pleased with that.  Go raibh míle maith agat.  Is tusa an Ceann Comhairle is fearr sa domhain.  Coming back to this issue, one of the anomalies in this State is that the hospital in Blanchardstown is called Connolly Hospital.  James Connolly would turn in his grave if he saw the way our patients are being treated.  That hospital does not even have an MRI scanner.In regard to the five point plan, I agree with the sentiment that patients should have full access to proper health care but patients are not getting it.  It is unacceptable that so many citizens are on hospital floors, on hospital trolleys and on chairs in hospital corridors.The Taoiseach has not answered the following question, which has been raised a number of times.  My friend, Deputy Mary Lou McDonald, has also raised it.  There are a number of special advisers in the Taoiseach's Department earning a salary of €168,000 which is almost five times the average industrial wage.  I believe the Taoiseach is a decent man but I do not know how he can square that.  There are 500,000 people on the dole and 150,000 young people have emigrated but the Taoiseach's Department is in clear breach of the guidelines set down by the Department of Finance.  Is that social solidarity?  Did the Taoiseach request that the salary cap be breached for these individuals?

The further expansion of the MRI facilities will come.  The Deputy understands — he does not live in fantasy land either — that we do not have an endless, bottomless pit of money to provide all of these things now.

We actually have two different Irelands.  Sinn Féin is an all-island party, but it has a different view up North from the one it has down here.  It does not seem to have any difficulty in agreeing to pretty serious cutbacks in Northern Ireland, but it hums and haws about everything that happens down here when the Government is in a bailout situation, we are not in control of our economic destiny and we must cut our cloth according to our measure.

#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-25 00:00:00	Prelude	179	Deputy Adams talks about decisions in respect of advisers.  I am not at all happy — how could I be? — about the numbers who are unemployed.  That is why, through the Departments of Social Protection, Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation and Finance, we want to put a real emphasis on job opportunities, getting people off the dole and providing up-skilling and retraining opportunities for them so that they can understand and appreciate the dignity of being able to go to work and contribute to their local economies, country and their own well being.On the one hand, we must deal with the requirements of the memorandum of understanding to get down to 8.6%.  In dealing with that challenge, we will put whatever resources we have into providing some sense of confidence in our indigenous economy — small businesses and medium-sized enterprises — to give people opportunities to get off the dole.
#GerryAdams	unknown-#GerryAdams-party	unknown-#GerryAdams-dob	unknown-#GerryAdams-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-25 00:00:00	Prelude	180	The Taoiseach is not answering the question.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-25 00:00:00	Prelude	181	In 2009, the cost of seven advisers in the Department of the Taoiseach was €1.085 million.  It is now €576,000.  Call them what one wills, in my Department there are three of the people in question at the lowest level of the public service scale that applies to them.
#GerryAdams	unknown-#GerryAdams-party	unknown-#GerryAdams-dob	unknown-#GerryAdams-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-25 00:00:00	Prelude	182	They are in breach of the Department of Finance's stipulations.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-25 00:00:00	Prelude	183	Two of the others are in excess of that level.  This reflects the positions they held previously when they worked within the Fine Gael Party.  As I pointed out to the Deputy last week, one of the persons working for a Minister was on a private sector salary of €200,000 and is now on a salary of €129,000 or €130,000 in respect of his or her public duties.It is important that, when people cover a range of Departments and governmental issues, the Minister of the day has at his or her access people of competence who can inform him or her accurately as to what the situation actually is.  The cost is very much reduced from what it was.
#GerryAdams	unknown-#GerryAdams-party	unknown-#GerryAdams-dob	unknown-#GerryAdams-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-25 00:00:00	Prelude	184	It is still in breach of the Department of Finance's guidelines.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-25 00:00:00	Prelude	185	In Question No. 5, I asked the Taoiseach whether he had put in place in his Department rather than just in his office any expertise on health policy.  I find it incredible that the answer is "No".  Given that the Department of the Taoiseach through the Taoiseach chairs the Cabinet sub-committee on health, it is unacceptable that there is no health expertise within the broader Department to inform the Taoiseach's work as chair of that sub-committee and to bring certain perspectives to its work.The Taoiseach's fundamental difficulty is that he made commitments on health that could not be realised.  In recent months, he has broken hospital after hospital.  Roscommon is the classic example, but there are examples in Sligo, the orthopaedic hospital in Mallow and the many others in respect of which he made cast iron guarantees through letters and commitments in advance of the election.  He has needed to resile from all of them.At the macro level in terms of the advice and expertise required, the programme for Government contains two fundamental commitments.  First, the move to a not-for-profit trust with insurers for every local hospital.  This would be a retrograde step.  Insurers would deal with hospitals directly to control costs.  The Taoiseach mentioned Ennis and Galway.  I understand that tenders have been sought for private outside contractors to manage those hospitals.  He needs to spell this situation out further.  We need a more comprehensive debate, as it is a specific change.Second, a pathway to universal hospital care insurance was committed to in the programme.  I note the word "pathway" has been introduced for the first time.  It was never used prior to the election.
#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-25 00:00:00	Prelude	186	Could we have a question, please?
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-25 00:00:00	Prelude	187	It is a comprehensive and complex issue.  The new wording suggests the Government is resiling from its commitment in terms of the timeline and a genuine commitment to the proposal's implementation.  It suggests that the Department requires some level of expertise on health to enable the Taoiseach to chair the health sub-committee and to allow these issues to be discussed, if that is his desire.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-25 00:00:00	Prelude	188	I can deal with that for the Deputy.  Obviously, the special advisers who formerly worked for the party and are now in the Department of the Taoiseach are well able to cover a range of sectors.  The economic adviser is up to date with every element of every Department and its budget.I chair the Cabinet committee on health.  It is going to meet next on 10 November.  It includes the Tánaiste, the Ministers for Public Expenditure and Reform and Children and Youth Affairs and the Ministers of State with responsibility for primary care and disability, equality, mental health and older people.  The chairman and CEO of the HSE also attend, as do senior officials from the relevant Departments.  Rather than having an extra bill placed on the public sector and taking in someone to the Department of the Taoiseach, as applied on the last occasion, I deal directly with my own special advisers but also with the Cabinet sub-committee on health.  For years, that committee met once per quarter.  I was not happy about that and I have informed it that we will meet once per month for the next six months.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-25 00:00:00	Prelude	189	It has only met once in the past seven months.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-25 00:00:00	Prelude	190	Yes, but the next meeting is on 10 November.  To be fair, I accepted the suggestions that came from Deputies about the necessity for a committee on health.  I have an interaction with the Minister for Health and his two Ministers of State, who have specific responsibilities, on a regular basis.  I do not need to ask for another special adviser to be put into the Department of the Taoiseach to cover health——
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-25 00:00:00	Prelude	191	I did not say "special adviser".

I do not have consultants on health in the Department of the Taoiseach.  I do not have a special adviser on health in the Department of the Taoiseach.  The people who are there are well able to get the information I need at any time.  We discuss all of these matters at the committee on health and will again on 10 November.

#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2011-10-25 00:00:00	Prelude	231	I propose to take Questions Nos. 6 to 8, inclusive, together.The National Economic and Social Development Office, NESDO, is the only State agency under the aegis of my Department.  The NESDO was established under the NESDO Act of 2006 and is the body corporate for the National Economic and Social Council, NESC.  The role of the NESDO is to advise me on all strategic matters relevant to economic and social development in the State.  The role of the NESC is to report to me on strategic issues relating to the efficient development of the economy and the achievement of social justice.  The council also provides a forum for engagement between the Government and the social partners.  The NESC has made a major contribution to Irish public policy over almost 40 years.  I have high regard for the quality and rigour of its reports and analysis, based not just on excellent research but on the quality of the deliberation among its members.  Successive Governments have recognised that and that Ireland's development requires the support and contribution of a wide range of groups — economic, social and environmental.  I believe the council has the potential to continue to make an important contribution in the time ahead.  In that regard I have asked it to focus on more immediate and shorter term issues where the experience and insights of members will be valuable, have more frequent shorter reports and reflect the varying or individual views of its members.In addition, following the dissolution of Comhar, its sustainable development role will be integrated into the work of the council.  In this way sustainable development can be integrated into research and action on the significant national challenges we are facing.I believe that the NESC has an important role to play as the vehicle for engagement on economic, social and environmental issues.  I also believe in the importance of social dialogue.  In responding to parliamentary questions in this House on 11 October, I confirmed my intention to meet with social partner organisations as part of a wider process of ongoing social dialogue.  The exact details and schedule of these meetings have not yet been finalised.  I look forward to future contacts with those partners as part of the Government's efforts to ensure economic and social recovery.  In addition the Tánaiste and I will attend a plenary session of the council each year.I mentioned that NESDO is the corporate body for the NESC.  The changes to the NESDO over the last year or so, such as the dissolution of two constituent bodies, mean that we must look again at the legislation to make sure we have the proper governance arrangements in place and to make sure that it properly reflects the role I envisage for the NESC.  My Department is doing this at the moment.

#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-25 00:00:00	Prelude	251	Will the Deputy please proceed?
#RichardBoydBarrett	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-party	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-dob	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-25 00:00:00	Prelude	252	I am deeply frustrated that I cannot ask a supplementary.
#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-25 00:00:00	Prelude	253	We have 25 minutes remaining for these questions and I ask the Deputy to proceed.
#RichardBoydBarrett	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-party	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-dob	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-25 00:00:00	Prelude	254	As I did not hear the beginning of the Taoiseach's answer, could he clarify if the National Economic and Social Council is the only State agency for which his Department is responsible?  If that is the agency for which his Department is responsible, why was a question I put down to him some time ago asking him to comment on a report produced by the council passed to the Minister for Finance for reply?  If we ask the Taoiseach questions about an agency for which his Department is responsible, he should have to answer those questions instead of batting them off to another Department for reply.In respect of what the Taoiseach said about social dialogue, while I take on board his comments about not wanting to incur further costs for his Department or the taxpayer generally in terms of special advisers, might it not be an idea in some areas, particularly important ones such as health where there is a crisis, to have representatives of the INMO and of doctors and nurses on his subcommittee along with representatives from the HSE who might tell him that the reason there is a crisis in our hospitals is because the Government is massacring staff in terms of the number of staff and the budgets?
#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-25 00:00:00	Prelude	255	The Deputy asked a question in regard to State agencies.  Will the Deputy please stick to the question?
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-25 00:00:00	Prelude	256	The answer to the Deputy's question is as follows.  The Deputy asked me if the National Economic and Social Development Office——
#RichardBoydBarrett	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-party	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-dob	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-25 00:00:00	Prelude	257	Council.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-25 00:00:00	Prelude	258	——is the only State agency under the aegis of my Department.  The answer to that question is, "Yes".  The Deputy also mentioned the importance of having people on the NESC who reflect particular sectors.  For instance, under the community and voluntary pillar nominees there are representatives from Social Justice Ireland, INOU, the Society of St. Vincent de Paul and the NYCI.  The membership of the National Economic and Social Council covers a broad range of sectors and personnel of particular ability.  As I said in my reply, the latter half of which I hope the Deputy heard, I value their individual presentations and encourage them to state their views when we meet, to have shorter reports and to reflect on the more short-term problems that the country faces in terms of this economy and social justice.In respect of the report on the NESC that the Deputy mentioned, that deals with the broader details of the economy and the Department of Finance would have a particular interest in that.
#GerryAdams	unknown-#GerryAdams-party	unknown-#GerryAdams-dob	unknown-#GerryAdams-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-25 00:00:00	Prelude	259	Tá dhá cheist i mo ainm.
#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-25 00:00:00	Prelude	260	That is correct.
#GerryAdams	unknown-#GerryAdams-party	unknown-#GerryAdams-dob	unknown-#GerryAdams-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-25 00:00:00	Prelude	261	The Taoiseach spoke about short-term projects and ongoing social dialogue which I can only interpret as part of his clear statement previously that he wants to move away decisively from social partnership.  He did not tell us how that process will be structured.  Will the community and voluntary sectors be involved?B'fhéidir go bhfuil mé mícheart faoi seo.  Is cuimhin liom gur chur NESC moltaí chun cinn fá choinne cruthú oibre agus cothú fás eacnamaíochta.  Ar mhol NESC gur chóir banc straitéiseach Rialtais a bhunú?  Níl mé cinnte gur tharla sé sin, ach tá mé á úsáid mar chás.  Cad a tharla leis na moltaí a cuireadh chun cinn?
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-25 00:00:00	Prelude	262	An féidir leis an Teachta an cheist sin a chur arís?  Níor chuala mé é go soiléir.
#GerryAdams	unknown-#GerryAdams-party	unknown-#GerryAdams-dob	unknown-#GerryAdams-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-25 00:00:00	Prelude	263	Gabh mo leithscéal.  Is cuimhin liom — b'fhéidir go bhfuil mé mícheart — gur chur NESC moltaí chun cinn i dtaobh obair a chruthú, fás eacnamaíochta a chothú agus banc straitéiseach Rialtais nó Government strategic bank a bhunú.  Ar tharla sé sin?  Má tharla, cad a rinneadh leis na moltaí?
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-25 00:00:00	Prelude	264	Tá a fhios agam gur chur NESC tuarascáil ar fáil faoi chúrsaí traenála agus buntáiste oibre do dhaoine atá ar chúrsaí leasa shóisialaigh.  Tá na moltaí sin á phlé ag an Aire.  Tá an cheart ag NESC an tuarascáil sin a chur ar fáil.The NESC, for instance, covers the trade union pillar nominees, the business and employer organisation pillar nominees, the agriculture and farming organisation nominees, the community and the voluntary pillar nominees, the environmental pillar, and the Government and independent nominees from the ESRI, NUIG, Queen's University, Trinity College Dublin, Maynooth College and so on.  The NESC reports are important and are considered by individual Ministers and Departments where they are relevant.  I value the expressions of interest and proposals they put forward.  It is not possible to adopt all of them but they are all valuable and I consider their work to be very useful.
#GerryAdams	unknown-#GerryAdams-party	unknown-#GerryAdams-dob	unknown-#GerryAdams-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-25 00:00:00	Prelude	265	The Taoiseach spoke two or three times about valuing the individual contributions.  I can only deduce from that that he does not value the reports the NESC has put forward.  If he moves away from social partnership, which I believe is his intention, how would the alternative process be structured?
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-25 00:00:00	Prelude	266	I mentioned the quality of the debate among members, which is important.  I also mentioned that the reports should reflect the varying individual views of the members and therefore when they meet us as a council I do not expect them to have all of that distilled into a few paragraphs stating that this is the considered view.  If there are varying views within the council it is important to hear that.  It is an opportunity for the different representative pillars on the council to give their view and ask that it be taken into account.  There is a spectrum of views which is important for Ministers and myself to be able to acknowledge but politics is about making decisions on those views.The answer to the Deputy's question is "Yes".  They do excellent research and I value the deliberation that they have as a group dynamic, but I also respect the reflected individual views of the members.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-25 00:00:00	Prelude	267	In terms of the structure of the dialogue with the trade union movement, about which we asked some time back as well, it is not clear what that will be.   The Tánaiste mentioned that there would be a structured dialogue with the social partners generally.  I think the Taoiseach's position has been of a more informal kind of engagement.  In the context of the dialogue to begin in November, will the Croke Park agreement be up for renegotiation or is it envisaged that it would be covered by that dialogue?
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-25 00:00:00	Prelude	268	The Tánaiste set out the views here, with which I agree, to SIPTU on 5 October last.  While the engagement with the social partners was a well-established part of the process of government over a number of years, we intend to initiate a process of dialogue and engagement with those who represented the social partners.  I cannot give Deputy Martin the dates now, but I think I myself have arranged three meetings with IBEC, ICTU and the IFA over the next couple of weeks.  I addressed the IBEC president's dinner on 22 June last and I met representatives of IBEC on 20 July last.   The Tánaiste and I will attend at a plenary session once a year.When we met both IBEC and the trade unions we made it perfectly clear that the lines of contact and connection to Government are very open.  We are not going into the sort of structure that applied there for a long number of years but there is no blockage, to put it that way, on those who were in the social partnerships making contact with Government.  That is an important part of the dialogue.Deputy Martin asked will the Croke Park agreement be up for assessment.  The Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform is dealing with that and is in discussions on a regular basis about getting the full implementation of the Croke Park agreement, which, as Deputy Martin will be aware, is a central part of the troika agreement.  That has been a challenging position for all concerned and the Minister is very active on that.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-25 00:00:00	Prelude	269	The issue of a State honours system has been discussed many times in the past but there has never been all-party support to sustain its development.  Such support would be required if consideration of an honours system were to proceed.While I would have no objections to all-party consideration of this matter, the timing of any such consideration would, of course, have to take cognisance of other political priorities at this time.For the information of Deputy Keating, I remember that I, as a Minister of State many years ago, implemented the concept of the Gaisce awards, which are the presidential awards for young people.  Personally, I do not favour the conferral of formal titles on people.  Deputy Keating will be aware that the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade has introduced a new recognition system for Irish people of the diaspora for outstanding contributions and it might be worth having a discussion about this in that context.Personally, I do not want to see a situation where there are lords, and titles and all of that conferred by the State.  As there are the People of the Year awards, the Entrepreneur of the Year awards and other systems, perhaps it might be appropriate if all of the Members were to agree on some form of recognition, be it by an award of the Uachtarántach, as an expansion, if you like, of the Gaisce awards, but I would not want to proceed on that road unless there was all-party consensus.
#DerekKeating	unknown-#DerekKeating-party	unknown-#DerekKeating-dob	unknown-#DerekKeating-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-25 00:00:00	Prelude	270	I thank the Taoiseach for his positive response to this proposal.I wondered at one stage how would we ever reward persons such as former President Bill Clinton and Mr. John Hume, who have made such a significant contribution to the lasting peace in Ireland, persons in business such as Mr. J. P. McManus, Mr. Michael O'Leary and persons in sport.  In Ballyfermot, I grew up with the expression ringing in my year, "Run like Ronnie".  Of course, we have been renowned for our successful sportspersons over the years: Ms Katie Taylor in recent times, Ms Sonia O'Sullivan, Mr. Johnny Giles and, indeed, Mr. Mick O'Dwyer.  We have been very successful.The Taoiseach recently had the pleasure of presenting the Person of the Year award to Ms Joan Freeman, another person who has dedicated her life to a wonderful cause of saving the lives of those who are most at risk of suicide but this, of course, is a commercial award.  Notwithstanding the fact that I would agree with the Taoiseach in so far as we do not want titles such as "lord", at the same time I favour some civic opportunity to acknowledge those who have made a substantial and significant contribution to supporting the people of this country in so many ways.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-25 00:00:00	Prelude	271	The Tánaiste, at the global forum, announced that the Government would shortly introduce a new system of recognition for sustained and distinguished service to Ireland or Irish communities abroad by individual members of the diaspora and he presented the first of those to former President Bill Clinton.For the information of the Deputies, this question of a State honours system was discussed on many occasions in the past.  In 1999, then Taoiseach, Mr. Bertie Ahern, initiated consultations with other party leaders about an honours system.  The record shows that the overwhelming majority of the Fine Gael Front Bench, of which the Ceann Comhairle was a member, stated that it should not be pursued further.  In October 2007, then Taoiseach, Mr. Bertie Ahern, again wrote to the party leaders and no agreement was reached.There is no point in proceeding with this unless Members are agreeable that there should be some form of recognition of outstanding contribution by Irish persons for whatever one chooses to specify.  If one wants to term it an expansion of the presidential Gaisce for young people or whatever, only on the basis of agreement could we consider this further, but it would not be "lord" or a title of that nature.
#GerryAdams	unknown-#GerryAdams-party	unknown-#GerryAdams-dob	unknown-#GerryAdams-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-25 00:00:00	Prelude	272	To lighten the mood, the Taoiseach might recall that the British Prime Minister, Mr. David Cameron, mistakenly named me as a baron.

#GerryAdams	unknown-#GerryAdams-party	unknown-#GerryAdams-dob	unknown-#GerryAdams-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-25 00:00:00	Prelude	276	I thought the Taoiseach might be pleased to know that if he did bring in an award for political U-turns, I would be pleased to nominate him and the Tánaiste as joint honoraries.

#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-25 00:00:00	Prelude	284	I appreciate the question tabled by Deputy Keating and his strong and committed views, but I put it to the Taoiseach that the fundamentals of a republic are based on merit.  The great success of the Gaisce programme is that it is a creative productive programme based on the merits of the young people who participate who reach certainthresholds of achievement through their lives.The notion of honours and awards does not sit easily with a republican viewpoint and a republican perspective.  That is a view I would have and would put on the record on the issue tabled.  We should maintain our commitment to a merit-based approach to society which has stood us well.  In other jurisdictions, not least in Britain, there have been times when the honours system has been brought into disrepute in a number of ways.  Would the Taoiseach confirm that view?
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-25 00:00:00	Prelude	285	That comment is very much in line with my own view.  I would not like to see a situation where annually, because of who persons might be, some sort of honours or whatever were allocated on that basis.We might consider at an appropriate time a merit achievement-based recognition — call it what one will — but not honours or the conferral of titles.  In respect of real merit and real achievement by persons, perhaps there is a way of giving recognition.  I would share Deputy Martin's view.
#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-25 00:00:00	Prelude	286	I call Question No. 10.

#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-25 00:00:00	Prelude	290	We got an answer here,  I am sorry.
#PeterMathews	unknown-#PeterMathews-party	unknown-#PeterMathews-dob	unknown-#PeterMathews-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-25 00:00:00	Prelude	291	I commend Deputy Keating on his contribution.
#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-25 00:00:00	Prelude	292	This is Question Time.
#PeterMathews	unknown-#PeterMathews-party	unknown-#PeterMathews-dob	unknown-#PeterMathews-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-25 00:00:00	Prelude	293	Rather than an awards system as in prizes, it would be an honours system as in recognition of lifetime service.  It is a maturity, not merely something brief.
#DerekKeating	unknown-#DerekKeating-party	unknown-#DerekKeating-dob	unknown-#DerekKeating-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-25 00:00:00	Prelude	294	I thank Members and the party leaders for their contributions.  The word "merit" is central to my suggestion.  I would agree with the Taoiseach's suggestion and perhaps the wheels could be put in motion to see if all-party agreement is possible and then proceed if this is the case.
#BernardJDurkan	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-party	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-dob	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-25 00:00:00	Prelude	295	I have similar views to the previous speaker, having pursued this subject matter for many years.  I did not allow the matter to rest just because there was nobody who would merit the order of merit.  I wish to point out that France is a republic and it has an order of merit or the equivalent and this has been very successful.
#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-25 00:00:00	Prelude	296	Has the Deputy a question?
#BernardJDurkan	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-party	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-dob	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-25 00:00:00	Prelude	297	It should be borne in mind that in the case of people who have made a significant contribution to society over a long period of time, some means should be found to recognise this.  On the other hand, there are many people who have made a negative contribution to society and we should, therefore, recognise those who have made a positive contribution.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-25 00:00:00	Prelude	298	In response to Deputy Keating, I will write to the party leaders and representatives about this matter.  Deputy Durkan has been an advocate of some system for very many years.  I am not sure whether he is talking about a sash down here and a sash in Northern Ireland or whatever but we might have a look at that.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2011-10-25 00:00:00	Prelude	299	I propose to take Questions Nos. 10 to 14, inclusive, together.I intend to visit Belfast in mid-November and a programme of engagements including meetings with political leaders is being planned.  I am looking forward to the next meeting of the North-South Ministerial Council on 18 November in Armagh.  All arrangements have been made.  I anticipate that the meeting will review progress across the full range of areas of North-South co-operation.At the last plenary meeting of the North-South Ministerial Council in June, we had a broad-ranging economic discussion.  We stressed that it makes good practical sense to continue to explore areas where efficiencies and economies can be achieved by working together, North and South.  We discussed progress made on the satellite radiotherapy unit at Altnagelvin.  An update on the A5, north-west gateway to Aughnacloy and the A8, Belfast to Larne, roads projects was also provided and we agreed that a further payment of  £11 million would be made in respect of this development.  We agreed to finalise deliberations on the outstanding commitments under the St. Andrews Agreement at the forthcoming plenary meeting in November.The Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, met the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland on Thursday, 6 October.  The sixth meeting of the North-South Ministerial Council in institutional format was held in Stormont Castle, Belfast, on 3 October 2011.  The Irish Government was represented by the Tánaiste with the Northern Ireland Executive represented by the First Minister, Peter Robinson, acting Deputy First Minister, John O'Dowd and the Minister for Regional Development, Danny Kennedy.  Both jurisdictions face substantial budgetary challenges and we discussed shared economic challenges.Sectoral meetings continue to be held between Ministers, North and South, with meetings held on 12 October on the languages body and on inland waterways, a meeting on aquaculture and marine on 14 October and a meeting on transport on 21 October.I spoke to the Prime Minister, Mr. Cameron, on 11 October in advance of his meeting with the Finucane family.  The Prime Minister informed me that is was his intention to get to the truth of the matter quickly and to issue an apology to the family.  This would be achieved, in his view, by the appointment by the British Government of Sir Desmond de Silva, a senior queen's counsel, to undertake a review of the case.  However, I reminded the Prime Minister of the all-party motion passed by the House in 2006 which called for a full independent public inquiry into the murder of Pat Finucane as had been recommended by Judge Cory.  As I have said previously in this House, that position has not changed and the Government fully supports the family in its long-standing campaign.The Government continues to maintain close contact with the Finucane family.  At my request and on behalf of the Government, the Tánaiste met with the family and their legal representatives on Monday, 17 October.  Discussions with the Tánaiste focused on exchanges with the Finucane family prior to their meeting with the Prime Minister and how best to progress from this juncture.The Finucane family expressed their deep disappointment with the outcome of their meeting with the Prime Minister as it fell short of genuine expectations.  They are determined to continue to seek the truth through a full independent public inquiry.  The Tánaiste undertook to pursue the matter with the British Government and to engage fully with them on this issue, having assembled a comprehensive summary and assessment of events to date.  My office has also maintained contact with officials in Downing Street on the matter.Finally, I reiterate the Government's position which is quite clear and which has been communicated to the British Government — the requirement for a full inquiry to be held as set out in the 2006 all-party motion adopted by Dáil Éireann and as expected by the Finucane family and the international community.  I reiterated that view to the Prime Minister in a brief conversation at the EU Council meeting on Sunday.
#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-25 00:00:00	Prelude	300	I remind Members there are 13 minutes remaining to deal with five questions.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-25 00:00:00	Prelude	301	I asked about the position regarding the Taoiseach's contacts with political leaders from Northern Ireland since 4 October.  I take it from his reply there have been no contacts with political leaders since 4 October.  Will the Taoiseach agree that nothing can be taken for granted regarding the situation in Northern Ireland?  Have meetings or contacts been deferred until after the presidential election in order to give the First Minister a chance to return to the day job?  Is this the reason there have been no contacts?  In my view it is important to maintain contacts with political leaders.  It is not just enough to have the institutions established as a result of the Good Friday Agreement; it is important that politicians deliver for the people.  Will the Taoiseach comment on a view that it is not the case that the Northern Ireland Executive is working very well and effectively and that over recent years it could have worked much more effectively, particularly from a socio-economic point of view?I refer to the Finucane case and the inquiry.  The Taoiseach stated he reminded the British Prime Minister of the Finucane case.  Will he agree that there has been a breach of a solemn agreement between the two Governments as regards the holding of an independent inquiry into the Finucane case?  Will he agree that the British position adopted regarding the appointment of a QC to investigate the murder represents a breach of an agreed position between the two Governments and a solemn agreement between the two Governments?  Has the Taoiseach put this point in such language to the British Prime Minister?
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-25 00:00:00	Prelude	302	There was not any particular reason for not visiting Northern Ireland since October.  The visit is planned for November and I hope to undertake a number of engagements.  I appreciate the Deputy's comment in respect of the effective working of the Assembly.I spoke with the Prime Minister by telephone when he was to meet with the Finucane family.  His view was he wanted to get at the truth and to issue an apology to the Finucane family.  He said that his preferred method now was to appoint a QC.  I reminded him in that telephone conversation that this House had passed a unanimous motion calling for a full public inquiry in the Finucane case and that this was still our view.  I said that unless the Finucane family were happy with what was being offered, that remained our view.  I reminded him of this view on Sunday in a brief conversation with him.It is true that following the recommendations of Judge Cory that there should be inquiries into certain matters, this House followed through by establishing the Smithwick inquiry.  It remains my view that the same should apply in the case of Pat Finucane, unless the family were to agree otherwise.  They do not so agree so there is no change in the position of this House or of the Government in regard to having a full public inquiry into the death of Pat Finucane.
#GerryAdams	unknown-#GerryAdams-party	unknown-#GerryAdams-dob	unknown-#GerryAdams-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-25 00:00:00	Prelude	303	I wish to take issue with the manner in which the Taoiseach has grouped these questions together.  Leaving everything else aside, the issue of the Pat Finucane inquiry should have been dealt with separately.  We do not have much time so I will not ask supplementary questions about the other questions but instead concentrate on the issue of Pat Finucane.There was an agreement between the two Governments at Weston Park and it is called the Weston Park Agreement.  The British Government has now broken that agreement.  I welcome the fact the Taoiseach raised the issue of Pat Finucane's killing with Mr. Cameron on Sunday.  That is good.  However, if I understand properly what the Taoiseach told us previously, when he talked to the British Prime Minister on the day he was to meet with the Finucane family, it was the Prime Minister who telephoned the Taoiseach.  Was that the first time the British Government told the Taoiseach — just an hour or two before it met the family — that it was not going to go ahead with an inquiry?  What about all the contact between the officials, the Tánaiste and the British at Downing Street?The last time the Taoiseach spoke about this was when the British Queen was here.  While I accept entirely that the Taoiseach supports the family, this is a case on which the Government must be very proactive.  With respect, I know how this works.  I know how the British work and I know how the Government works.  The Taoiseach must take this as a personal mission.  Sometimes there is a lot of talk here about the North and sometimes the Taoiseach speaks about things he knows better.  However, this is an issue he, as Taoiseach, needs to take on as a personal mission.  He must say to Mr. Cameron that this is an agreement between two sovereign governments and that we want him to honour it.  Even if there had not been a Dáil motion or any of the other issues involved, he must point out to Mr. Cameron that this is an agreement between two sovereign governments and that he is in breach of it.  The Taoiseach needs to catch his attention.  We will support him in whatever he does on this issue.  It is not an issue on which to be passive, but one on which the Taoiseach must be proactive.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-25 00:00:00	Prelude	304	The situation is very clear.  Judge Cory recommended a public inquiry into this.  The British Government, for its part, has made it clear on a number of occasions that it does not want to go down a road of endless public inquiries into so many incidents——
#GerryAdams	unknown-#GerryAdams-party	unknown-#GerryAdams-dob	unknown-#GerryAdams-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-25 00:00:00	Prelude	305	It agreed to this.  I was there.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-25 00:00:00	Prelude	306	I do not speak for the British Government.  It has made it clear that it does not want to go down the road of endless public inquiries.  I raise this issue on any opportunity I get with the British Prime Minister.  I did not hear of the British Government's decision until the message came through to my office that the Prime Minister wanted to talk to me.  I left a Cabinet meeting to take that call and spoke to him.  I reminded him, during that conversation, that if what he was offering was not acceptable to the Finucane family, I would not agree to it.  I reminded him the Smithwick tribunal was set up following the same recommendation from Judge Cory and that there was unanimous approval and endorsement of a motion from this House that there should be a public inquiry.  We have been very clear about that and will continue to state that view.I cannot stop the British Government appointing Mr. Da Silva QC to look at the million pieces of paper on this issue.  I do not know whether he will come across something among those pieces of paper that may point to a real truth.  I cannot say that.  Obviously, my preference is for a public inquiry as was agreed between the two countries and as was recommended by Judge Cory.
#GerryAdams	unknown-#GerryAdams-party	unknown-#GerryAdams-dob	unknown-#GerryAdams-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-25 00:00:00	Prelude	307	It strikes me, from what the Taoiseach has said — I am not being partisan about this — that he did not remind the British Prime Minister that this inquiry was a solemn commitment from the two Governments.  That is the flaw on how this case should be advanced.  I know the Taoiseach is extremely busy, but I believe he should meet the Finucane family.  The family was expecting to meet him and the Tánaiste, but that did not happen.  This has been going on for 23 years and the Taoiseach, as leader of the Government, needs to make it a personal mission.  I urge him to make a commitment here today that he will make it a personal commitment.  The way to come at it tactically and strategically is that it is part of a solemn agreement made at Weston Park between two Governments and that he expects the British Government to keep to that.There is no point in the British Prime Minister phoning the Taoiseach an hour or two before he meets the family and saying he is sorry, but he has changed this and for the Taoiseach to say that goes against the Dáil and that there is all-party support for it.  It was a solemn agreement between the Government here and the British Government.  It was not up to the British Government to go off on a solo run.  It should have been kept to the commitment it made.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-25 00:00:00	Prelude	308	I am sure the Deputy will appreciate that central to this are Geraldine Finucane and her family and their quest for the truth of what exactly happened in respect of the murder of her husband.  Were she to come here and say to me that she would be happy with a QC being appointed to examine all of these papers, she, as the person central to this——
#GerryAdams	unknown-#GerryAdams-party	unknown-#GerryAdams-dob	unknown-#GerryAdams-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-25 00:00:00	Prelude	309	The Taoiseach knows she would not do that.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-25 00:00:00	Prelude	310	I agree and I said to the British Prime Minister, that if Geraldine Finucane, on behalf or her family, was not happy with what he was offering, there would be no change in the position here.I met Ms Finucane in Washington when I was there in March.  It was not possible for me to be at the meeting with the Tánaiste and the Finucane family here.  The Tánaiste had come back from Korea, I think, and I was somewhere else.  I have no difficulty with arranging another meeting with Geraldine Finucane and perhaps I can do that when I have the opportunity to go to Northern Ireland in November, or I can make an alternative arrangement for here or somewhere else.  I take the Deputy's point about the Weston Park Agreement.  As I said, there is no change in our position here.  I would like to see a public inquiry in the case of the murder of Pat Finucane and I will take the opportunity on every occasion I meet with the British Prime Minister to remind him of the position and how important it is in dealing with this to get at the truth and to have it dealt with conclusively.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-25 00:00:00	Prelude	311	I asked earlier whether the Taoiseach would agree that the action of the British Government in appointing a QC to investigate the murder of Pat Finucane was in itself a breach of a sovereign agreement between two Governments which was arrived at solemnly at Weston Park.  Does the Taoiseach accept it represents a breach of that agreement?
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-25 00:00:00	Prelude	312	In so far as it does not comply with the recommendation of Judge Cory — who was given the documentation to recommend that an inquiry should be carried out in a number of cases — that he felt an inquiry should be carried out and there was agreement that should happen.  It is not happening in the case of Pat Finucane and from that point of view it does not live up to the agreement made.Written Answers follow Adjournment.

Does he agree that a referendum should be separate from all of those in the future, given the dissatisfaction and unhappiness that exists with the debate on the current referenda?

I hope that at the appropriate time in the new year, we can have a referendum on this.  In response to the specific question, it is important to have an understanding of the balance between the interest in the referendums and adequate time to have them properly debated.  On the question of whether they should be run in conjunction with any election, I do not propose to have an election next year and, in the context of a general election or presidential election, it will not arise.

One of these sanctions could mean that a turf cutter could receive up to three years in prison and €500,000 in fines and an old person could potentially have a mobile telephone taken off him or her and have the information on it used to prosecute for ringing a turf cutter to keep the house warm.  Will time be provided to discuss and debate this and vote on the introduction of these regulations?  If the Government is so fond of them and so keen on them, it should put them to a vote.

Is it proposed to introduce legislation to update or amend that Act to provide for the privatisation or the leasing of those facilities?

#BrianHayes	unknown-#BrianHayes-party	unknown-#BrianHayes-dob	unknown-#BrianHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-25 00:00:00	Prelude	362	On behalf of the Government I express my deep sympathy to those affected by the flooding of recent days.  In particular, I express my condolences to those who have suffered bereavement.  The flooding has impacted on homes, commercial premises and infrastructure in several parts of the country.  The emotional and financial impact on individuals in these circumstances is severe, with many parts of Dublin badly affected.  Met Éireann has indicated that the amount of rainfall on Monday was in excess of the total for the same month last year and was extreme by normal standards.  Yesterday saw the highest ever daily rainfall recorded at Casement Aerodrome.Emergency response planning is, in the first instance, the responsibility of the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government.  That Department has informed me that the local authority services responded to the developing situation by dispatching fire services, drainage and road crews to reported instances of flooding.  As the evening progressed and the scale and serious nature of the flooding in Dublin became apparent, Dublin City Council and South Dublin County Council activated their major emergency plan shortly after 8 p.m. yesterday evening, mobilised additional resources, including the Civil Defence, and activated local co-ordination arrangements in order to establish the extent of the issues and manage their combined response with An Garda Síochána, the Health Service Executive and the public transport companies, in addition to normal traffic management arrangements.  The Office of Public Works provided pumping equipment at the request of Dublin City Council and will continue to provide any equipment or technical resources that may be of assistance and where called upon by the local authorities concerned.In accordance with standing arrangements, the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government, as the lead Department for severe weather emergencies, was notified of the declaration of a major emergency.  Departmental officials had been monitoring the situation before the major emergency was declared.  Following assessment of the situation and given that the problems were confined, in the main, to the Dublin area, where the local co-ordination arrangements of the major emergency plan had been activated, it was decided not to activate the national co-ordination-level arrangements.  However, Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government officials continued to liaise with staff in the Dublin local authorities and to brief officials across other relevant Departments.A post-event analysis of the response to this emergency by the regional emergency authority will be undertaken in the coming weeks, with input from all authorities and the OPW.  This will inform the effectiveness of the emergency response and identify any improvements needed.  Significant damage was caused over a broad geographic area, including the southern part of Dublin where the rivers Dodder, Poddle and Camac all caused flooding.  Transport systems were disrupted as roads and rail lines were flooded and became impassable and signalling systems failed.  Dublin City Council's traffic management centre worked with the pubic transport companies and An Garda Síochána to enable people to complete their journey home last night.The rain ceased during the night and the focus of the public authorities today has been on restoring traffic and public transport to full capacity.  Forecasts indicate that up to 10 millimetres of rain will fall today, but further major damage is not anticipated.  Nonetheless, there remains some disruption as damage to infrastructure is assessed.  Likewise, the task of assessing the scale of the damage to residential and community property began this morning.  When an initial assessment is made, the Government will consider what measures may be required to alleviate the difficulties caused.  A report on the activation of the major emergency plan will be prepared by the principal response agencies in accordance with standing arrangements.  The OPW will input fully to the review of the response to the emergency.With regard to the provision of assistance to those affected by the flooding, this is the responsibility of my colleague, the Minister for Social Protection.  The supplementary welfare allowance scheme functions as a safety net within the overall welfare system in that it provides assistance to eligible persons whose means are insufficient to meet their needs and those of their dependants.  The main purpose of the scheme is to provide immediate flexible assistance to those in need.  The Department of Social Protection can provide assistance under the scheme to households affected by emergency events such as flooding.  The type of assistance provided has included the provision, in conjunction with local authorities, of temporary accommodation, and financial assistance towards essential items such as food, clothing and bedding.While the Department of Social Protection has had overall responsibility in regard to humanitarian aid since 2004, any decision to grant humanitarian aid is a matter for the Government.  Until such time as the full extent of the damage is ascertained, the need for such a scheme cannot be determined.  Arising from the 2009 floods, some €1.65 million in emergency payments was provided to more than 1,300 households throughout the country.  The Government will look sympathetically on a request for emergency financial aid should it be made by those authorities closest to last night's events.The OPW has responsibility for capital flood relief activities, in which it has invested more than €218 million in the last ten years.  This has resulted in the completion of several flood relief schemes throughout the State which have brought much needed relief and peace of mind to residents and business owners in those areas.  Dublin City Council and the OPW recognise flooding as a significant risk for the city and are pursuing a programme of structural flood relief works to reduce flood risks in areas throughout the city.  Work on the lower stretch of the River Dodder has been ongoing since 2007, in association with Dublin City Council.  The completed works in the Irishtown area mean the general area was free of the flooding arising from the severe weather in recent days.  Relief works on further stretches of the River Dodder are in the planning stage and we hope they will be implemented in due course.  The OPW has also profiled expenditure for 2012 on the River Wad in the Donnycarney area, where flooding has occurred on several occasions in recent years.  A scheme has been designed by Dublin City Council and agreements are being finalised with local stakeholders on its progression.In addition to these capital schemes, a national programme of catchment flood risk assessment and management, CFRAM, is being commissioned by the OPW throughout 2011.  The OPW appointed engineering consultants, RPS, in May 2011 to undertake the eastern CFRAM study.  This work will identify and examine in detail the causes of flooding throughout the eastern river basin district catchment area and provide an integrated plan of specific measures to address the significant flood risk factors in a proactive and comprehensive way.  The consultant is currently gathering flood event data to analyse what happened and to design solutions for flood risk management measures.It is often necessary to address localised flood problems in a catchment that require immediate attention pending development of a CFRAM study or where a capital scheme may not be appropriate.  To this end, under an initiative announced in 2009, the OPW has provided financial and technical assistance to local authorities to carry out studies or works to address localised flood problems.  This scheme is open to all local authorities and will provide them with resources and access to appropriate expertise to develop and implement flood mitigation measures.From 2010 to date, the Office of Public Works, OPW, has allocated funding of €1.35 million to four local authorities in Dublin and Wicklow to address flooding problems in those regions.  The minor works scheme was introduced in 2009 to provide funding to local authorities to undertake works and studies to alleviate flooding problems within their administrative areas.  A number of areas have availed of this source of funding from the OPW and have been protected from recent events.The Office of Public Works is assessing a number of applications from the local authorities.  A funding application from Dublin City Council for works on the Santry river in Raheny, with an estimated cost of €150,000, is currently under consideration.  Two applications with an estimated total cost of €670,000 from Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council for coastal works at Corbawn Lane and a coastal study are also being assessed.  In addition, a further six applications from Wicklow County Council, estimated at €570,000, are currently under consideration.  All applications are being assessed having regard to the scheme criteria and the availability of funding for flood risk management.I reiterate my deep sympathy for people who have suffered loss or hardship as a result of the flooding and affirm my determination and that of the Government that a thorough review of the response by the relevant agencies will be carried out to ensure that we understand what we got right and what we got wrong and also that sufficient funding is put in place to remedy those issues where they arise.

#JoeCostelloLAB	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-party	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-dob	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-25 00:00:00	Prelude	364	I extend my sympathies to the family of the 35 year old woman from Parnell Road who drowned in the flooding last night and to the family of Garda Ciaran Jones who died in the line of duty working heroically to prevent the lives of other people being endangered.First, in my constituency of Dublin Central virtually the entire area was flooded to a greater or lesser degree.  Cabra, the Navan Road, Ballybough, Botanic Avenue, North Strand and East Wall were all badly flooded.  This is the fifth flooding in ten years.  Why does that position still pertain if that degree of flooding is taking place?  Second, why were sandbags not available for Cabra or the inner city which would have alleviated the problem and may have prevented many houses being flooded?  People were prisoners in their own homes.  They had to use bed clothes and various garments to try to keep the water out and had to sweep it out themselves.I am glad to hear from the Minister for Social Protection, who has just arrived, that short-term measures will be available through the supplementary welfare scheme to allow people deal with issues such as temporary accommodation and financial assistance.  How extensive will that fund be available to people in need because enormous damage has been done to residents' homes, property and so on?What will be done to alleviate this problem in the future?  We do not want to hear again and again that this is a once in 50 or 100 years event.  This is becoming almost an annual event — effectively every two years in my constituency.  We will have to bite the bullet and address the issue of the structural works that will be required to deal with this matter once and for all.
#BrianHayes	unknown-#BrianHayes-party	unknown-#BrianHayes-dob	unknown-#BrianHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-25 00:00:00	Prelude	365	I know the part of the city the Deputy represents very well and he correctly outlined the extensive flooding that has occurred there over many years.  In the first instance it is the responsibility of Dublin City Council to make applications to the OPW in respect of works it believes must be done.  I will convey immediately to Dublin City Council the Deputy's comments about the scale of works that he believes need to be done because it is clear this is an annual problem.We will look sympathetically on any application but I make the point to all Deputies that where an application comes in to the OPW, it is assessed on one simple criterion, namely, the impact of building a wall or doing some drainage works.  If we believe that value comes from the expenditure of money on that we will make that decision.  This scheme is open on a 24 hours, seven days basis throughout the year.  Local authorities can apply to our Department for funds to deal with alleviative flood risk measures such as those I mentioned earlier.I cannot answer the Deputy's question on sandbags not being made available.  That is a matter for Dublin City Council in the first instance.  If it knew such an event was forecast and its likely effect it should reply explaining the reason sandbags were not provided.  That was unacceptable.On the question of social welfare relief, the Minister may respond to that but in the first instance funding is provided through the social welfare system.  The Government will look sympathetically on the need for additional funds to be provided but that must come from the agencies responsible for this area locally, namely, Dublin City Council.  We will look upon that request sympathetically.As to the future, already significant sums of money have been put into flood defences in the past eight years.  We are working on the basis of the CFRAM studies, one of which is in the eastern area, but regarding Dublin city and particularly the low lying areas of Dublin city, significant funds have been put in already.  More must be put in but as the local authorities produce schemes we will have them assessed and ensure those funds are made available where they can make a difference in these events.  These are very significant events some of which occur once every 50 or 100 years.  The total amount of rainfall last night was extraordinary but we will continue to respond as the applications arise.

The level of humanitarian assistance is a matter for the Government as a whole but is administered in general by the Department through community welfare officers.  The critical issue that Members can assist with is information on people who are in terrible distress.  I am aware of that.  I was out last night in the floods.  The SWA scheme is meant to provide humanitarian assistance.  More complex, longer-term works relating to flooding are obviously primarily a matter for the Office of Public Works.

#EoghanMurphy	unknown-#EoghanMurphy-party	unknown-#EoghanMurphy-dob	unknown-#EoghanMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-25 00:00:00	Prelude	377	I do not believe this is only about money.  We must acknowledge that the local authority in Dublin city is no longer the correct responsible authority to deal with emergency responses in this city.  Deputy Costello has already alluded to the lack of response from the local council last night.  I can only outline my own experience.  I tried to telephone officials at 9 p.m. last night but the emergency response number for the city council was down.  When I managed to get somebody on their private mobile phone, they were not even aware that the number was down.  I went onto the website but there was no indication that the number was down, nor was there any indication of the road closures or transport disruptions that had been occurring in the city for approximately four hours.When I went to Gordon Street with Councillor Kieran Binchy, I found Deputy Humphreys there helping residents to sandbag their homes.  I did not see any council officials.  I learned that the flooding of those homes could have been averted had the council acted more quickly, but at that stage it had not acted at all.  I commend Deputy Humphreys for what he did.  The people there owe him a debt of gratitude for the effort he put in.  It was something to see.I then went to Newbridge Avenue to see the flood defence walls along the Dodder.  The floodgates were still open, although it was between 9.30 p.m. and 10 p.m.  The residents and fire crews were trying to close them and when they did, they found they could not lock them because they did not have the correct keys.  When the council officials arrived, they did not have them either.  We can spend all the money in the world, and we have spent €3 million on the flood defence wall on this stretch of the Dodder, but that type of incompetence renders flood defences meaningless and useless.  The local authority must hold up its hands and explain why those gates were not closed.  People telephoned Dublin City Council in the afternoon to recommend that they be closed as a precautionary measure, but that did not happen.Businesses in this city pay rates; in Dublin, 25% of the businesses nationally pay 50% of the total amount of rates to local authorities.  Is the local authority the correct authority to protect their properties and businesses in this regard?  Can we turn to home owners and ask them to pay rates to a council that cannot protect their properties?  I realise the Minister cannot answer these questions directly but it is incredibly important that the local authority does.  I believe its representatives should appear before an Oireachtas committee and answer these questions.  If they have explanations, they should give them and if they do not, they should put their hands up.  I recommend that the Minister consider a proper emergency response plan for this city, one that does not fall to the responsibility of the local authority in the city.

I also extend my sympathy to his parents, brother, sisters, the wider Kilbride community and to the GAA community in Wicklow, of which Ciaran was one of the leading lights.  I also sympathise with the family, relatives and friends of the Filipina lady who died and with the Filipino community in Ireland.The Minister, Deputy Brian Hayes, has put a great deal of time and effort into the provision of funding for flood relief since he took office, but my main concern is the emergency response to the sudden flooding.  This is more appropriate to the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government, the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport and the Department of Justice and Equality than to the Minister with responsibility for the OPW.  Notwithstanding that, I am very angry about this.  A number of weeks ago I raised the issue in the House.  I spoke in the House after the last big freeze in Dublin when there was chaos.  Although I do not have any empirical evidence, yesterday's events were a shambles on the part of the authorities.I was an hour away from Dublin yesterday, in Wicklow, but at 6 p.m. I knew there was chaos in Dublin and that something had to be done about it.  At 6.50 p.m. I was so worried that I telephoned the newsroom in RTE to ask that the station broadcast an alert about the dangers with bridges and small rivers.  People who were out in the weather had contacted me and told me it was frightening and dangerous.  Only they realised how serious it was, but there was no response.  I spoke to people who left Dublin at 4 p.m. yesterday to travel via Jobstown and the Embankment and they told me it was chaotic.  I spoke to a lady on the telephone at 6 p.m.  She was at Jobstown and at 8 p.m. she was still there, driving around in circles.  She had seen no sign of a garda, a fire brigade or ambulance.  There was nobody to direct her.  When I drove in this morning there was a report the road was closed off.  There was a Garda van parked across the road but there were no directions as to where one should go.  One had only to look at the surrounding green areas to see the chaos and fear that existed last night, but nothing was done about it.It is very difficult to merge services that are available 24 hours a day, seven days a week and services that finish at 5 p.m.  I ask the Acting Chairman to bear with me on this issue because I am tired——

We run the emergency plan exercises.  I am sure Kingswood was flooded last night.  Would the Minister agree that it was chaotic and nobody was in charge?  There were some individual workers on the scene but there appeared to be no co-ordination and no plan.  It is totally unacceptable.  There is a lovely booklet and lovely centre, and the Minister of State gave a lovely speech.  However, the effect on the ground is that nothing happens, which is unacceptable.The Minister should invite the relevant bodies to speak about what they did.  Who was supposed to be in charge and where were they at 3 p.m., 4 p.m., 5 p.m. and 6 p.m.?  I am glad the Minister gave a commitment about the funding.  Several areas in County Wicklow are cut off because bridges and roads have collapsed.  I also wish to make another small point.

I share the anger expressed already and also express my condolences to the families who have lost family members.  I will limit my comments to the emergency relief fund and its potential.  I understand the complications that might be involved in who oversees and administers it.  Ultimately, that is a decision for the Government.I ask the Ministers to focus on the central issue that most concerns me for the future, house insurance.  Deputy Finian McGrath and I were in Donnycarney this morning.  I was in Clontarf last night and residents in Artane were on the telephone to me all day today.  Since the Wad River has burst its banks on previous occasions the insurance companies are now refusing to insure homes in the Donnycarney area.  Those houses are de facto worthless.  One cannot sell one’s house if one cannot get home insurance because a potential buyer cannot get a mortgage if they cannot get house insurance.  The houses are worthless and the owners are liable for all the work that must be undertaken in those homes.  Families not only have the emotional trauma of having to move out for the couple of months required to fix things again, but there is also the huge financial heartache.The city council has let them down time after time.  Although moneys have been provided by the previous Government and this Government for the works to be undertaken, people are still waiting for those works to be carried out.  Meanwhile, they are left exposed to the elements.  Today, women, children and families are in floods of tears because now they must bear the financial cost.  I have a direct question for the Minister.  Those families are financially liable because, through no fault of theirs, they have no home insurance.  They have been left high and dry by the insurance companies.  Can we find a mechanism to support them at this time?  They must keep an eye on the skies every day of their lives until the next flood, which is inevitably only months away unless those essential works are carried out.
#BrianHayes	unknown-#BrianHayes-party	unknown-#BrianHayes-dob	unknown-#BrianHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-25 00:00:00	Prelude	387	On the last question raised by Deputy Ó Ríordáin about floods and insurance, I have visited many parts of the country and spoken to many communities.  A number of them have seen important work carried out by the local authority or the OPW but they still cannot get insurance.  I have already met with the Irish Insurance Federation and I hope to be in a position to announce a new protocol over the next month which will give a measure of better communication with the Irish Insurance Federation and the insurance companies, whereby they will know the work we have done and will take account of that.  Where the State invests colossal sums of money it is utterly wrong that the insurance companies do not provide the insurance cover.The Deputy spoke about people being unable to get insurance cover.  That is a very real issue for communities throughout the country.  My officials are in discussion with the Insurance Federation to see whether we can make some progress on this issue because I am determined that we have a much better means of communication between our Department and the insurance companies that they understand that funding is being put in place.Deputy Billy Timmins spoke about the emergency response and was critical of it.  We have got to learn lessons from this.  In the first instance, it is the local authority's responsibility to lead with other local authorities in responding to the crisis.  We need to review that and it will be done.  As the Deputy rightly pointed out, it comes under the remit of the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government but I will ensure the Minister is made aware of the Deputy's comments and the comments of Deputies Eoghan Murphy, Joe Costello and other colleagues about the lack of response that occurred.Deputy Costello raised the question of flood alert.  I understand it is the responsibility of Met Éireann to inform Dublin City Council or whichever local authority and it is the decision of the local authority to declare a flood alert.  It must be asked why this did not happen.

#BrianHayes	unknown-#BrianHayes-party	unknown-#BrianHayes-dob	unknown-#BrianHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-25 00:00:00	Prelude	389	I will investigate that issue.  Until the Deputy gave me the information I had no information on that issue.  I will investigate that and come back to the Deputy.  It would be outrageous if a flood alert was issued to the business community but not to householders.  This is the first time it has been brought to my attention.Deputy Eoghan Murphy referred to the lack of communication between the local authority and the agencies.  That is his view and I appreciate that view.  However, very substantial work was done last night by crews, local authorities, the Garda Síochána and Civil Defence personnel across the city.  In some circumstances, if these events are so dramatic and so vast in terms of the amount of rainfall in one day, it is difficult to have the perfect solution.  I agree with him that we need to learn lessons from this and we need an immediate review to see what went right and what went wrong because in the first instance it is the responsibility of the local authority — those on the ground — not central Government.  If the local authority is seeking additional help we will look upon that request sympathetically.

#KevinHumphreys	unknown-#KevinHumphreys-party	unknown-#KevinHumphreys-dob	unknown-#KevinHumphreys-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-25 00:00:00	Prelude	391	I recognise that staff on the ground did much hard work but, unfortunately, the response was poor.  Many people in my area have been flooded three and four times.  They are not insured not because they did not want to pay, but no insurance company would give them cover, despite having carried out extensive work.  I welcome the Minister's response to that issue and suggest the need to move on quickly and look at ways of helping people.  I was in the home of an 84 year old gentleman whose neighbours helped to lift the furniture out of his house.  He had no household insurance because he cannot get it.  That is horrendous.The response was poor.  If it was vandalism, I committed vandalism last night.  I went along with other residents and we hacksawed locks off containers to get sandbags, even though I had been in touch with the council at earlier stages.  For me to have to lead a group of residents to cut locks off sheds in order to get out sandbags is unacceptable and needs to be accounted for.Irish Rail built a dam underneath the DART bridge in Ballsbridge and Ballsbridge has been flooded yet again — I will pass on the information to the Minister of State.   A dam continues to be in place.  Who gave Irish Rail the permission?  Why did it not respond?  There must be accountability.  We cannot push this further down.  After 2002, people were given a guarantee this would not happen again.  After Hurricane Charley, the people were promised it would not happen again.  We have a responsibility to get to the bottom of this issue.  We need to hold the insurance companies accountable.I ask the Minister of State to head up his Department and ensure that many areas of Dublin are not flooded again.  I welcome the Minister for Social Protection to the House.  There is a large job to be done by her Department.  As I said earlier, many vulnerable people have not got the money to get back on their feet.  This is the third and fourth time this has happened.  I ask for as generous a response as possible.  It is difficult for residents but I ask that she speak with her community welfare officers.  Many who will be in tears in the coming days do not know how to get back on their feet.  I ask that her community welfare officers to respond in the best manner possible.
#FinianMcGrath	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-party	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-dob	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-25 00:00:00	Prelude	392	I thank the Acting Chairman for the opportunity to raise the important issue of flooding.  I will deal with three issues — the emergency response, the insurance issue and the action that needs to be taken.  Last night and this morning I visited Clontarf, Donnycarney, Fairview, Elm Mount and Artane and spoke with residents and saw at first hand the major damage to their homes and the hurt and anger.  The real issue in regard to the response was why no major preparations were made.  I was told that Met Éireann informed Dublin City Council that a major issue was about to happen.  Even residents told me that they knew more about it than Dublin City Council.  The response of the emergency services was pathetic.In regard to the services, I spent hours on the telephone last night.  When I tried to get through to the fire services I waited 25 minutes for a response.  Eventually I got through to the person dealing with the fire services but he was apologetic because he could not get through either.  If this is an emergency plan, and I as a public representative cannot get through, God help the poor residents and citizens.  The Minister of State mentioned the river water in the Elm Mount-Donnycarney area.  A flood prevention project has started to deal with the underground river and drainage issue but we need to get on with it.I met a gentleman this morning who has had at least €15,000 worth of damage caused to his house.  He has no insurance and cannot get it.  That family is suffering.  He has asked me to raise the matter with the Minister.  It is all very well to say we will try to do something about it but those people need action and a response from Dublin City Council and the Minister and they want to know when and how it will be done.

Is it appropriate that it is the local authority that declares an emergency of that scale?  The local authority has failed on a number of occasions in Dublin, but not only in Dublin where the local authority has not acted as quickly as we would like and as we presume it is able.It is a sad day for the HSE and the Filipino community who have lost a worker and the Garda who has lost a colleague, Garda Ciaran Jones.  It is also a sad day for many other households and businesses, many of which are in my area and in areas affected by rivers which are culverted and some of which are open but which have not flooded for many decades.  While I hope it a once in a lifetime event, I ask the Minister of State to liaise with the local authorities specifically to carry out a survey of culverted rivers in the city to ascertain if they contain material which is causing blockages.  Much dumping has taken place in recent years on some of those rivers.  If they were clear perhaps that would lessen the problem for some people.Given what Deputy Timmins and others have said, a survey of the bridges and riverbanks should be carried out.  There is a need to ensure they are safe to cross.  We recall the problem when the railway track fell in at Portmarnock and it was only spotted by the scouts.  We do not want that to happen.  Surveys must be undertaken immediately.Does the Minister of State agree that the problem is exacerbated by the constrained budget, in particular of Dublin City Council?  I have been informed that in recent times the clearing of gullies has been reduced at this time of year from once a week to once a month which means that much of the drainage in Dublin was blocked and caused the road flooding which made them impassable.  The other factor relating to costs and the constrained budget of Dublin City Council is the fact that we are operating in the city with a reduced number of staff in the fire brigade.  Its numbers are reduced by 60 to 70 people because of a recruitment ban.  If the positions had been filled then up to 70 extra people would have been available to help with the situation or answer the telephones yesterday.
#MaryLouMcDonald	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-party	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-dob	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-25 00:00:00	Prelude	394	I join with other colleagues in offering sincere sympathies to the families of Garda Ciaran Jones and the young Filipino woman who lost her life in this tragedy.  I do not know whether the Minister of State has seen the film "Groundhog Day".  It is a film in which a repetitious cycle of the same day is played endlessly.  That is really what the situation is like.  In my constituency, all across Cabra, the Navan Road, Blackhorse Avenue, East Wall, Sheriff Street and Drumcondra, flooding occurred and one could have predicted to a household those that were going to get flooded because it had happened before.  Any reflection on the emergency response or assessment of the works done to date by the State have to be taken in conjunction with that reality to the forefront of our minds.  Houses that had been flooded were flooded again and unless we change the way we do things and invest in preventative measures, they will be flooded from here to eternity.I do not have the words to describe not just the tearfulness, but the sheer misery only a few short weeks from Christmas of households that have been flooded and the consequent disruption for families.  Many of the households have no insurance cover.  I welcome the fact that the Minister is in discussion with the Irish Insurance Federation.  Let us be frank: sufficient resources have not been invested in flood defence because of the State's coffers.  I dare say the Minister of State will not be able to put his hand on the kind of resources that need to be invested.  We have potentially a number of families who cannot now get insurance.  What is the State going to do about that?  I suggest to the Minister that if the commercial insurers will not insure those homes then the State must.I ask the Minister for Social Protection to issue clear instructions to community welfare officers to actively assist those individuals and families affected by flooding and that they do not block them with endless red tape, complications and bureaucracy.  People have lost virtually their shirt.  Their homes are destroyed and they need immediate assistance.The criticisms of Dublin City Council have been fairly made in the Chamber today.  I share the concerns expressed.  Equally, it should be said that Dublin City Council is working under considerable financial constraints with the loss of overtime and the recruitment embargo, and it is also dealing with all of the other State agencies such as the emergency services that are understaffed and under resourced.  When the Minister of State undertakes a review of the emergency response, he should by all means call each of those agencies to account — that is as it should be — but he should also analyse the Government's performance and what needs to change in respect of resourcing the arms of the State correctly and also supporting families who are now not just tearful but raging that yet again they are put in that position.
#BrianHayes	unknown-#BrianHayes-party	unknown-#BrianHayes-dob	unknown-#BrianHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-25 00:00:00	Prelude	395	On the last point, more than €210 million has been spent over an eight-year period on capital works on flood defences.  We are coming from a poor position in comparison to other European countries that have much more sophisticated funding mechanisms in place for many years.  Despite the adjustments in recent years this is one area where we have managed to date to ring-fence the budget.  This year €40 million will be spent plus a carry-over of €5 million from last year.  A significant proportion of that is continuing.  Needless to say all Departments are under pressure on the capital side but as far as I am concerned this is a priority area.  We know that these events are happening with greater frequency due to climate change.  We have a responsibility to catch up in comparison with other countries which, historically, have invested in flood defences.  That is my intention as Minister of State with responsibility for the Office of Public Works, OPW.The previous Government examined the possibility of a State insurance system for families that could not obtain insurance from other sources and turned it down because of the potential liability.  I give an assurance to the Deputy to examine the issue again to see if progress could be made.  I have met many communities across the country, from Dublin to the west, the south and the north.  I am aware of the enormous psychological damage that it causes in communities when one's house is flooded and one feels a sense of destitution.  We have a responsibility centrally and locally to get things right.Simple things could be done.  I was horrified by the lack of communication outlined by Deputy Finian McGrath.  I spoke to officials from across Dublin last night from 8 p.m. until 12 midnight about what was happening.  I was texting them, ringing them and finding out what was happening through social media.  Some local authorities were better than others.  It is unacceptable that public representatives would not receive a text message or be otherwise informed of what was happening in their community.  I will raise the issue with Dublin City Council.  We must improve.  Basic things do not cost much money.  I refer to things to do with cop-on such as communication through text messages about issues on which Deputies must be informed because invariably they are deluged with calls from constituents.  That issue must be sorted out.Deputy Ó Snodaigh made a sensible suggestion that I will consider further.  He is correct about culverts.  In recent years because of the level of development in the city many small rivers and tributaries have been put underground.  The question arises of whether the culverts are deep enough given the severity of weather events.  OPW engineers have informed me that it is not just a question of the depth of the culverts, it is the angle at which they are built and whether the angle allows the flow to get out into the river as one would expect.  We must liaise with local authorities on the issue.  I will follow it up.My understanding about the situation in Dundrum is that it is due to an underground river.  Deputy Olivia Mitchell is seated behind me.  The river was put underground to facilitate the development.  We all saw last night on YouTube and elsewhere the enormous damage that was caused within seconds because a culvert burst.  Questions arise in that regard which I will follow up.  It is sensible that we would examine the matter of gullies as well, which is also a matter for local authorities.  Keeping them clear is particularly difficult at this time of year with falling leaves leading to blockages in the system which exacerbated the situation.I accept what Deputy Humphreys said about the necessity for much greater responsibility and emergency planning from all and sundry.  We must review what has happened and learn lessons from it.  My colleague, the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Hogan, who has responsibility for this area is leading the review.  We must work together to find a better way to ensure that our response to crises such as this represents the best of joined-up Government locally and nationally.I will send a transcript of the debate to the agencies with responsibility for the issue and seek an immediate reply on the substantive points raised by Deputies for which I or my colleague may not have responsibility.

#OliviaMitchell	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-party	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-dob	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-25 00:00:00	Prelude	397	I appreciate the opportunity to raise the issue of genuine confusion about eligibility for JobBridge.  I refer, specifically, to the eligibility of young graduates.JobBridge is acknowledged to be an excellent scheme and an ideal opportunity, in a recession, for young people to be eased into the workforce.  However, it seems that a large cohort of young graduates are ineligible to participate.  I speak about graduates who are living at home, largely because they have no jobs, and because they are assessed on family income, they are not eligible for jobseeker's allowance which, in turn, prohibits them from participating in the graduate scheme.In a recent reply to a parliamentary question, the Minister informed me that signing on for credits would entitle a graduate to participate after the requisite 78 days.  My concern is twofold.  First, a graduate who is ineligible for jobseeker's allowance and who has never paid a PRSI contribution — has never had a job — cannot sign on for credits and is, therefore, ineligible to participate in the scheme.  Second, there is a lack of clarity regarding those who have paid PRSI, perhaps as part of a summer job, and their eligibility.  The Department's website says one is eligible if one has paid a contribution in the last two years.  Someone in the Minister's Department told me one is eligible if one has ever paid a PRSI contribution.  Several cases have come to my attention of graduates who have worked and paid contributions but have been told they are ineligible for JobBridge.  There seems to be inconsistency in this regard.I ask the Minister to clarify the rules that pertain in these cases and to ensure that all social welfare offices are clear about the criteria.  My main concern is the graduates who are not in receipt of jobseeker's allowance and who have never worked.  The rules are clear.  They are precluded from the scheme.  For them there is a vicious circle in that because they cannot get a job, they cannot sign on and because they cannot sign on, they cannot apply for JobBridge and are disadvantaged in the jobs market.  Given that they are forced through unemployment to live at home and, therefore, be assessed on their parents' incomes, they will be precluded from the scheme forever.  The Gradlink scheme, which was subsumed into JobBridge, was aimed, specifically, at this group and it seems unfair that they are precluded.First, is it possible to relax the rules?  I realise there are financial implications, but I am sure people who have no jobs and recognise that they are ineligible for jobseeker's allowance or benefit would be willing to participate in JobBridge, even for the top-up payment of €50.  Second, can the Minister clarify the question of PRSI contributions?  What is required in terms of the number and timing of contributions?  Can those criteria be made absolutely clear to offices throughout the country?
#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-25 00:00:00	Prelude	398	I am delighted to have an opportunity to reply to the matter raised by Deputy Mitchell.The JobBridge scheme is the Government's national internship scheme.  It will provide up to 5,000 places for those seeking employment, with an internship opportunity of six to nine months in an organisation in the private, public or community and voluntary sectors.  During this time participants will receive an allowance which will consist of a €50 per week top-up to their existing social welfare entitlements.There are, currently, 2,500 internships advertised on the JobBridge website and just over 2,000 people have commenced an internship.  That includes about 625 people who transferred from the FÁS work placement programme, where no top-up was paid.  The rest are people who started with the JobBridge internship programme.In order for an individual to be eligible to participate in JobBridge, the national internship scheme, an individual must be currently in receipt of a live claim, that is, jobseeker's allowance, jobseeker's benefit or signing for credit, on the live register and have been in receipt of jobseeker's benefit, jobseeker's allowance or signing on for social insurance contribution credits for a total of 78 days or more in the last six months.A recent graduate signing for credits will be eligible to participate in JobBridge 78 days from the day they first signed on.  A person may qualify for credits if they have one paid contribution and do not have a two year gap in their social insurance record when they sign on.  If the graduate has never worked, he or she is not eligible to participate in the scheme.  However, graduates who are not eligible for JobBridge can avail of the work placement programme.  Anyone who is unemployed is eligible to apply for the work placement programme.  It is another work experience programme that allows graduates to continue to develop and improve their skills in a work environment.The scheme has been extremely successful.  It has been going for 16 weeks and we have more than 1,400 participants.  It is not a graduate only scheme.  There is no requirement that a participant would have graduated.  It is, however, suitable for people who have completed a certain level of education or training.  Some are graduates or, indeed, postgraduates.  The scheme is proving extremely popular.  Many employers have offered to take part and host internships.I will bear in mind what the Deputy has said.  The scheme came with conditionality in relation to taking people off the live register.  That was one of the IMF conditions that we acceded to.  I am conscious of the situation the Deputy describes.  We are amending the scheme as we go along where we can get the agreement of the Department of Finance.  It came with certain conditionality.  However, there is a great deal of enthusiasm about the scheme.  It is new to Ireland and we are listening very carefully to any criticisms that are offered.  That is the experience of the host employers, of applicants and of those who have commenced internships.
#OliviaMitchell	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-party	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-dob	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-25 00:00:00	Prelude	399	I appreciate the Minister's response.  There is a realisation that the group of people of whom I speak fall between all stools.I am aware of the work placement programme but it is not geared toward graduates.  There is a real need for graduate internships.  Graduates, particularly in technical or scientific areas, de-skill very quickly if they do not get work opportunities.  I am delighted the Minister recognises the need to be flexible and may respond in time to this group.I take it that the requirement is that an applicant must have made a PRSI contribution in the previous two years.
#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-25 00:00:00	Prelude	400	We are keeping the scheme under review.  It has been extremely successful.  We are limited overall to 5,000 places over a two year period but we will continue to examine the eligibility criteria.  The scheme is a labour activation measure.  We have agreed with the IMF that people who have been on the live register should be given encouragement options to go back to work or to take part in training.  We have clarified that people who are coming directly from training courses can proceed to JobBridge.  Last Friday, I was pleased to be involved with Skillnets when 25 people, principally engineers, had received training in areas such as medical devices and were about to participate in JobBridge.There are many innovations in the scheme.  I remain open to innovate further as the opportunity arises, subject of course to the agreement of my colleague, the Minister for Finance.
#MichaelMcNamara	unknown-#MichaelMcNamara-party	unknown-#MichaelMcNamara-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcNamara-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-25 00:00:00	Prelude	401	I draw the attention of the House to the increase in off-licence sales and decrease in on-licence sales and to some of the consequences of this for the State.  Official figures from the Revenue Commissioners suggest two thirds of beer purchased in Ireland is purchased in pubs, with one third being purchased in off-licences.  However, industry sources suggest the figure for pubs is somewhat lower and for off-licences is higher.Currently, there is a 5% per annum reduction in the amount of alcohol purchased in licensed premises.  However, there is no such reduction in regard to alcohol purchased in off-licences.  We will soon reach a situation whereby half of all alcohol purchased in Ireland will be from off-licences, rather than pubs as has been the tradition heretofore.  This has a number of consequences for the State which are not good, the obvious one being a loss in revenue to the Exchequer.  Even if the same amount of alcohol was being sold — it is not because there is a decrease in this regard — VAT is at 21%.  Therefore if, for example, supermarkets sell beer at €1 per can as a loss leader, which they are and have been doing, the VAT to the Exchequer is relatively small.  On the other hand, the VAT to the Exchequer from the purchase of alcohol from licensed premises at a considerably higher price is much greater.Approximately 60,000 to 70,000 people are employed in the hospitality sector in Ireland, a great proportion of whom are in the pub business as compared with the off-licence sector which, I understand, employs approximately 4,000.  A number of jobs are under threat because of the shift from the consumption of alcohol on licensed premises.  Approximately five rural pubs are closing every week, with a resultant loss of employment.  By and large, pubs are family businesses which employ people on a casual basis.  In response to a question from Tourism Ireland brand tracker in regard to what people look forward to doing when visiting Ireland, 46% of visitors from France, 43% of visitors from the US and 40% of visitors from the UK said they looked forward to visiting an Irish pub.  Unsurprisingly, no one looked forward to going to an Irish off-licence as it is hardly a unique experience.I understand the next budget will not be a giveaway budget.  It will on the contrary be a painful budget.  However, I wonder if the move from consumption on licensed premises to off-licence sales could be addressed in the forthcoming budget, even if this means favouring the sale of alcohol, from an excise or tax perspective, in pubs, which are supervised environments.  It is illegal to sell alcohol to a person who is intoxicated.  However, people can purchase as much alcohol as they want from an off-licence.  I believe many of the difficulties being experienced on our streets is the result of young people purchasing large amounts of alcohol in off-licences, drinking it at home and then going out onto the street.  I ask the Minister to try to address this through taxation measures.
#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-25 00:00:00	Prelude	402	I thank Deputy McNamara for raising this issue.  The Revenue Commissioners is responsible for the collection of tax on alcohol products.  Alcohol products tax is charged by reference to the nature of the product.  The same rate of tax applies irrespective of the type of premises in which the product is sold.  I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that for this reason data are not available on the breakdown of alcohol products tax receipts between licensed premises and off-licences.The basis on which alcohol products tax is charged means there is no loss in the yield from that tax to the Exchequer if a product is sold in an off-licence as opposed to a licensed premises.  In fact, the lower prices typically associated with off-sales mean the tax incidence is higher in the case of such sales.  The rate of VAT is also the same irrespective of where the alcohol is sold but the yield would be somewhat lower from the sale of a particular product when sold in an off-licence given the typically lower prices in that particular sales channel.  However, the rate of VAT from any level of expenditure on alcohol is the same regardless of whether it takes place in an off-licence or a licensed premises.Receipts from excise duties on alcohol products totalled €826 million in 2010, down from €968 million in 2009.  Projected receipts for alcohol excise for 2011 are likely to show a slight increase over 2010.  The excise duty on all alcohol products was decreased in budget 2010 by approximately 20%.  Prior to this, excise duty on beer had remained unchanged since the budget of January 1994, apart from the introduction in October 2008 of a new 50% lower rate of excise for beers and cider of alcohol strength by volume of less than 2.8%.  The duty on cider was increased in December 2001 and duty on spirits was increased in December 2002.  Duty on wine was increased in October 2008 by 50 cent per standard 75cl bottle and pro rata increases were applied to related products.  The Deputy should be aware that the decreases in 2010 applied across all areas regardless of where the products were consumed or sold.It is accepted that there has been a general trend towards off-sales in recent years.  High pub prices, price discounting in supermarkets, the smoking ban and the introduction of random breath testing for drivers have all contributed to this shift towards the off-trade.  While this movement is excise-neutral there is a loss of VAT from sales at lower off-licence prices.  A report on the Irish beer market in 2010 published by the Irish Brewers Association earlier this year indicated that in 2010 some 33.4% of beer was sold through the off-trade as compared with 28.9% in the previous year.  This is in line with anecdotal evidence of a trend over time away from on-trade to off-trade.
#MichaelMcNamara	unknown-#MichaelMcNamara-party	unknown-#MichaelMcNamara-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcNamara-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-25 00:00:00	Prelude	403	I thank the Minister for his detailed response.  The loss of VAT from sales at lower off-licence prices concerns me.  Perhaps the Minister would consider addressing this issue, even if this means raising VAT on off-licence sales so as to ensure licensed premises are better able to compete.  I understand there would be legal difficulties in doing so owing to European Union law.  However, as I understand it Portugal applies a higher taxation level for alcohol sold in off-licences.  Perhaps the Minister would consider introducing similar measures in Ireland to try to protect the few rural pubs remaining.
#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-25 00:00:00	Prelude	404	The same tax regimes applies in respect of alcohol products whether sold off-trade or on-trade.  There is no variation in that regard.  There would be no possibility of distinguishing for VAT purposes between off-licences and public houses.  Pricing in respect of alcohol will be a key issue in the recommendations of the steering committee on substance misuse, which is expected to be published shortly.  The recommendations contained in that report will form the basis for a Government action plan on alcohol due early next year.  The Deputy could perhaps commence the debate here and continue it when the report is published.  We might be able to make some progress by approaching it from a different direction.
#CharlieMcConalogue	unknown-#CharlieMcConalogue-party	unknown-#CharlieMcConalogue-dob	unknown-#CharlieMcConalogue-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-25 00:00:00	Prelude	405	I thank the Ceann Comhairle for putting this matter on the agenda and ensuring it will be addressed by the Minister.  This is a very important issue to County Donegal which has been leading to some concern among people over the past number of days.  I have put this on the agenda to give the Minister for Health and his Department the opportunity to reassure people in County Donegal that there is no threat to the continuation of NoWDOC services at the four centres in County Donegal from which it is currently provided and that the service will be maintained at its current level, thus ensuring people have 24 hour access to a GP within a reasonable distance from their homes.When people contact NoWDOC or a GP in the middle of the night or outside normal office hours, it is not because they have something wrong with them which can wait until the next day; it is because they have a concern in regard to their health that often is an emergency which needs to be addressed by a doctor immediately.  There has been some concern, and much coverage in newspapers, in the past week in regard the potential closure of three of the outreach centres in the county, with the GP service from midnight to 8 a.m. being provided through Letterkenny alone.  Indeed, there is a rumour that perhaps only one car will be provided.As we can all understand, that is very concerning and it must be knocked on the head immediately by the Minister and the HSE so that we can all be sure that service will continue to be provided.  We had a meeting last Friday, which all Oireachtas Members from the county attended, with HSE management and which was very useful.  We made it very clear at that meeting that this issue must be addressed immediately.  HSE management indicated that it does not have any plans to change the service but in written correspondence from the HSE, we have not received absolute clarity that is the position of the Department of Health and the HSE.This is a red line issue and it is not up for negotiation.  The Minister has the opportunity to reassure people and I ask that the Minister of State takes this opportunity to do so.
#RoisinShortall	unknown-#RoisinShortall-party	unknown-#RoisinShortall-dob	unknown-#RoisinShortall-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-25 00:00:00	Prelude	406	I thank the Deputy for raising this issue.  The provision of general practitioner, GP, out-of-hours co-operatives throughout the country is an essential part of our health service and we fully support that policy in terms of strengthening primary care services and ensuring that, as far as possible, care needs are met in the primary care setting.  Out-of-hours co-operatives are now in place in all HSE areas, providing coverage in all or in part of all counties.  The service can be accessed through a single lo-call telephone number in each region and caters for both public and private patients.Out-of-hours co-operatives allow GPs to manage the provision of urgently needed care for their patients while their surgeries are closed in the evenings, at weekends and on public holidays.  The co-ops also afford GPs reasonable off-duty arrangements.  Under the GMS contract, GPs have a responsibility to enable contact to be made with them, or a locum, for emergencies outside normal practice hours.  It is a matter for the GPs how they arrange this cover.The NoWDOC service, which is now ten years in existence, is a co-operative structure between GPs and the Health Service Executive to provide urgent GP services to patients who may require them in the out-of-hours periods, that is, evenings, nights and weekends.  It covers Donegal, south Leitrim and north Roscommon, with 98 full-time GPs participating in the service.  The budget for the NoWDOC service last year was €3.168 million, while the national budget for GP out-of-hours services last year was almost €100 million.  More than 57,000 people contacted the NoWDOC GP out-of-hours service last year and, of these, more than 36,000 were treated at the GP out-of-hours treatment centre or received a home visit.  Some 33,600 people contacted the NoWDOC service in the first six months of this year.In terms of the partnership that exists between the GPs and the HSE, the HSE provides the infrastructure for the service, including support staff, such as drivers, receptionists, nursing staff and so on.  The GPs provide the cover for the various doctor rotas for the out-of-hours periods.  All calls to the service are handled and triaged in the call centre in Letterkenny and treatment centre visits are arranged by appointment only.The HSE west is currently reviewing the NoWDOC services.  This follows directly from the recommendations of the national review of GP out-of-hours services which was carried out and published in 2010.  The HSE, in implementing the recommendations of the national review, is looking at all operational activity, including staff who are employed by the HSE, to ensure that safe and efficient services can be maintained in the current difficult financial environment.  This review to date has resulted in the HSE submitting proposals to the trade unions regarding the redeployment of receptionist staff and the expansion of the drivers' role under the provisions of the public service agreement 2010-2014.  These discussions are ongoing and will be concluded in the coming weeks.The proposed changes reflect the staffing models that operate elsewhere throughout the country and will provide for the continuity of safe patient care at each of the centres which are affected in this proposal, that is, Derrybeg, Carndonagh, Mountcharles and Carrick-on-Shannon.At the annual general meeting of NoWDOC Limited, the GP members of NoWDOC passed a motion to form a sub-committee to examine viable options for the provision of GP cover for red eye periods and submit proposals to the HSE to outline how such cover might be provided more efficiently without compromising patient safety.The outcome of the GPs review has not yet been finalised and no proposals have been submitted to the HSE for consideration.  While changes to service delivery arrangements may be proposed in the future, the issue of curtailing or reducing services has not featured in any discussions to date.  Again, I thank the Deputy for raising this matter.

I note she said that no changes are proposed to service delivery arrangements.  That, in itself, is welcome.  However, it is important that it is made absolutely clear to the Department of Health and the HSE, in the future and in these more difficult financial times, that the provision of GP services at centres, which are local to people throughout County Donegal and the rest of the country, are a red line issue and not up for negotiation.  No one has any problem with GPs and the HSE talking to each other.  However, the key point which has not been made clearly enough today or by the HSE is that from a Department of Health and a HSE point of view the continuation of GP services in a local area and within a reasonable distance from people's homes is absolutely critical and will be at the core of any discussions so that people can be assured there is no threat to local GP out-of-hours services, whether red eye or pre-midnight services.  That is critical and I ask the Minister of State to be clear in that assurance.Will the Minister of State comment on the current restriction that applies to NoWDOC cars in that they are restricted to the speed limits even when they are on emergency calls?  This does not make sense.  Many roads in County Donegal have 80 km/h speed limits because they are not national roads.  Only a few weeks ago, a GP car responding to a call in the Carndonagh area was fined and received two penalty points.  That needs to be addressed.  If someone in County Donegal or elsewhere is waiting on an emergency GP service, one does not want that GP stuck doing 30 mph within a 30 mph zone or 80 km/h within a 80 km/h.  One wants the GP to put on the emergency lights and get to the patient as quickly and as safely as possible.  Will the Minister of State assure the House that people will continue to have access to GP services within their local areas?

This is one reason for the clear commitment in the programme for Government to provide for free GP care during the Government's lifetime.  It is also one of the reasons we will start debating a Bill this evening on opening up access to the General Medical Services, GMS, scheme.  I am working on expanding the number of GP training places, as we want 90% of health care activity to occur at primary care level.  During the coming months and years, we will roll out reforms to enable this health activity to take place as close as possible to patients, which is where people want to be treated.  It makes sense.Ensuring access to out-of-hours GP care is part and parcel of the reforms, as it makes sense from the patients' point of view to deal with people's conditions early and before they become serious enough to warrant a trip to hospital.  This approach also takes pressure off the hospitals.  We will discuss this point during Private Members' business.I pay tribute to the work of NoWDOC in providing a range of services in the north west during the past ten years.  However, it is the contractual responsibility of GPs to ensure out-of-hours cover is provided.  While the HSE provides the infrastructure and support services, for example, receptionists, drivers and so on, it is primarily the responsibility of the GPs to ensure that they adhere to the terms of their contracts.  The HSE is waiting for the proposals to be returned by the GPs involved to determine the arrangements it will make to ensure the existing cover in the north west is maintained.I am not in a position to respond on the issue of speed limits, but I will take it on board and determine what can be done.

Cé go bhfuil áthas orm go bhfuil an tAire Stáit anseo linn, tá mé míshásta nach bhfuil an tAire, an Teachta Reilly, i láthair.  Is ceist an-tábhachtach í ceist na ndaoine le TB.This morning, I visited Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital in Drogheda.  I visited it several times in recent months and witnessed many patients, some of whom were elderly, lying on hospital trolleys or sitting on chairs or the floors while waiting to be treated by an overstretched and overworked medical staff.  Níl a fhios ag na hothair seo cathain a bhfeicfidh siad dochtúir, nó an mbeidh leapacha cearta acu.  Tá an córas slándála atá againn sa tír seo ar nós córas sa Tríú Domhan.Last Friday, it was revealed that a patient who had been on a trolley in the emergency department for five days had TB.
#GerryAdams	unknown-#GerryAdams-party	unknown-#GerryAdams-dob	unknown-#GerryAdams-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-25 00:00:00	Prelude	411	I do not want to cut across the Minister of State and Deputy Ciarán Lynch.  Gabh mo leithscéal — tá mé ag caint faoi rud an-tábhachtach.  Three other patients and an undisclosed number of staff are being screened for this dangerous disease.The deterioration in the hospital's situation is not unexpected.  Bhí mé ag tabhairt amach anseo faoi sin.  Chuir mé eolas faoin slí criticiúil ina bhfuil saoránaigh sna otharlanna seo roimh an Aire agus an Taoiseach.  Three weeks ago, Deputy Tóibín, Dr. Rory O'Hanlon and I wrote to the Health Information and Quality Authority, HIQA, to ask it to launch a full public investigation of the hospital's emergency department urgently and immediately and to publish the findings.  We did so because Drogheda has consistently ranked as the hospital with the worst waiting list in the State.  For months, the number of patients on trolleys at the hospital has consistently exceeded 30, resulting in significant pressure on the emergency department.  This represents a clear threat to patient safety and welfare.  Management at the hospital has responded by putting into effect the full capacity protocol, which means that it identifies spaces in wards in which to place patients even though the wards may not be appropriate to the patients' health needs.HIQA declined to order an investigation.  In light of the TB case and the ongoing crisis in the emergency department, I am calling on HIQA to reverse its decision.  I am disappointed that the Minister for Health is not present, although I am grateful that the Minister of State is substituting for him.  If HIQA continues to refuse to order an investigation, the responsibility for doing so falls to the Minister.  I am calling upon him to do it.
#RoisinShortall	unknown-#RoisinShortall-party	unknown-#RoisinShortall-dob	unknown-#RoisinShortall-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-25 00:00:00	Prelude	412	I thank Deputy Adams for raising this issue.  The Minister, Deputy Reilly, is not in a position to take the debate, but I will do so on his behalf.The incident raised by the Deputy related to a patient who presented to the emergency department of Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital with symptoms unrelated to TB.  In all, the patient spent five days in the emergency department.  During his time there, he was given a chest X-ray and was found to have TB.  Following the discovery of TB, appropriate isolation and treatment commenced.During the period that the patient spent in the emergency department, three patients were identified as potentially having had contact with him for more than ten hours.  They have been contacted, counselled and offered testing for TB.  All staff with potential contact have been offered counselling and TB testing.  Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital has reassured the public about the incident, saying that contact had been made with the patients involved.  The HSE is satisfied that the incident has been appropriately handled from the points of view of infection control and contact tracing.While it is important that any public concern be allayed, I will address the wider issue of emergency department waiting times.  The Minister does not consider it acceptable that a patient should wait five days.  To tackle unacceptably long waiting times in emergency departments, he set about establishing the special delivery unit, SDU, immediately following his appointment.  Its aim is to unblock access to acute services by improving the flow of patients through the system.  The SDU is focusing initially on emergency departments and will be working to support hospitals in addressing excessive waiting times for admission to hospital.
#GerryAdams	unknown-#GerryAdams-party	unknown-#GerryAdams-dob	unknown-#GerryAdams-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-25 00:00:00	Prelude	413	I have a great deal of sympathy for the Minister of State, who has probably been handed a script to read out, but her reply was unsatisfactory.  She did not mention that the patient was on a trolley for five days.  Instead, she stated: "In all, the patient spent five days in the emergency department" and the Minister "does not consider it acceptable that a patient should wait five days".  Today is Tuesday.  The Minister of State should imagine being restricted to a trolley, even in the best of health, until Sunday.  Her reply is not worth the paper on which it is written.  Will there be an inquiry?  Were we advised of measures that will be put in place to discover how this situation occurred?In its five point plan the Fine Gael Party pledged to reform the health service and cut waiting lists, but it is prepared to perpetuate the mess initiated by Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats.  Today there are 344 patients on trolleys across this State and 28 of these are in Drogheda.  The waiting list for hospital treatment has increased by 40% since the start of this year.The health service is not being properly funded.  That is obvious to the professionals — I met with the management briefly today — and to the patients.  The Government says the money is not there but that is not true.  Politics is about choice and everybody present in this Chamber knows that.  The Government is making political choices.  A political choice was made to read a script such as the one the Minister of State read.  It contains a big lie in that it omits the fact that this person was on a trolley.  A political choice will be made on 2 November to give €700 million of the people's money to unguaranteed banks.  The Government is making a political choice in paying off unguaranteed bondholders instead of fixing the health service.  That is not acceptable and I do not mean this personally in terms of the Minister of State, but tá a lán rudaí mícheart leis na rudaí anseo.  There are many things wrong but this is one issue and one problem which can be fixed.There is a hospital up the road from Drogheda that has a 23-bed ward which is closed.  Across that region there are 62 patients, mostly elderly people, who have already been medically discharged but have nowhere to go because of the mess in regard to the fair deal scheme.This matter needs to be resolved.  With all the fine rhetoric that sometimes flows about citizens' rights, the republic and so on, when it comes down to it if one is lying on a trolley in a hospital corridor and contracts TB, that is how one measures one's republic.
#RoisinShortall	unknown-#RoisinShortall-party	unknown-#RoisinShortall-dob	unknown-#RoisinShortall-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-25 00:00:00	Prelude	414	When I responded to the Deputy's matter, I told him the factual position.  The patient concerned was in an emergency department for five days and during that period was discovered to have TB.  The appropriate action was taken at that point in terms of isolation and treatment.I said at the end of my reply that the fact that anybody is on a trolley for five days is not acceptable.  That is why this Government is setting about introducing fundamental reforms to the health service.  It is an absolute priority of both parties in government to bring about that reform.  They are the political choices that this Government is making.  We are setting about a root and branch reform of the health service and considerable work has been done to date.  It is one of the reasons we are committed to introducing a single tier health system because it is not a question of tinkering at the edges with the existing health system.  The issues are much more complex than simply being about funding.  The whole system needs to be changed and we are determined to do that.  That is set out clearly in the programme for Government which commits to introducing a single tier health system based on providing care on the basis of a person's need rather than on his or her ability to pay.  That will happen as soon as possible.  We are introducing an insurance-based health system.  We are doing that as soon as possible and in the short term we are introducing significant reforms in the primary care area.In addition to that, very soon after being appointed, the Minister established the special delivery unit, SDU, whose job is to act as a hit squad, as it were, to target those hospitals where there are difficulties, where systems are not properly functioning, to enable them to deal with the kinds of demands that they have.  That work by the SDU is well under way.  It has examined a number of hospitals and identified 15 that provide unscheduled care and those hospitals that need urgent support from the SDU.  Among those hospitals are eight that currently account for approximately 60% of the trolley count.  Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital is one of those eight hospitals.  Those hospitals have been identified as needing urgent and high level support from the SDU.  The eight hospitals have recently been asked for proposals setting out measures that could be taken quickly in the hospital and-or in a closely related community setting which would significantly relieve pressure on the emergency department by, for example, addressing delayed discharges and having step-down beds.  Proposals relating to seven of the hospitals or associated community services have just been received and will need to be given very detailed consideration by the SDU.  These proposals from the seven hospitals include proposals from Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital and the SDU is examining those urgently with a view to implementing them very quickly.A good deal of action is being taken.  The Government is committed to longer-term reform and that work is well under way and in the shorter term the SDU is addressing the current logjams that exist in many of our hospital emergency departments.  The proposals have just been received from Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital and they will be responded to very quickly.  I thank the Deputy for raising this issue.

#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-25 00:00:00	Prelude	416	I move: "That the Bill be now read a Second Time."The regulatory failures of the financial crisis have been the subject of extensive and objective analysis.  The reports from Professor Patrick Honohan, Messrs. Regling and Watson, theNyberg commission and the Moriarty tribunal point out the problems to be addressed.  Poor supervision, an overly-deferential attitude by regulators, poor assessment of risks and a lack of follow-through on enforcement all played a part in the financial crisis.The Central Bank (Supervision and Enforcement) Bill 2011 draws on the lessons from that experience.  It involves a careful overhaul of the statutory basis for the Central Bank's regulatory powers.The Bill brings clarity to the Central Bank's ability to set requirements.  It provides for good information flows and objective analysis to support regulatory supervision.  Where things go off course, there is provision for prudential intervention and corrective action.  Where the law is broken, there are effective and dissuasive, yet proportionate, sanctions.  There are also provisions dealing with restitution and costs after the fact.  I should add that my Department and the Central Bank are currently examining further proposals which I may bring forward on Committee Stage.However, this is not a piece of crisis legislation.  It provides a long-term regulatory framework to underpin the regulation of more than 14,000 regulated financial service providers in Ireland which will be covered by the Bill.  That includes insurance companies, investment intermediaries, bureaux de change, securities and investment firms and banks.A financial service involves making money from money and this requires an element of risk taking — risk to investors, risk to consumers and risk to the financial and economic system.  The Bill must provide a prudent yet flexible basis for regulating a sector that is varied, fast-paced and ever-changing.  That regulation must be prudentially-based, ensuring that firms identify, monitor and control risk both for their own good and to prevent spillover into the wider sector and the economy.  However, it must also ensure effective oversight of regulated firms to ensure proper management of risk by them.No doubt some will raise the issue of under or over-regulation.  The choice between regulation and business success is not black or white.  Sound regulation ensures that those well-run firms who abide by the rules do not suffer a competitive disadvantage.  It requires balance, proportionality and judgment.  A regulator must have the qualities of a good referee; he must establish his authority, have eyes in the back of his head and keep the game flowing.The National Competitiveness Council has identified the need for robust financial services regulation as key in improving the export competitiveness of the Irish financial services sector.  It has stated that "Reform of the regulatory environment to ensure greater transparency and to rebuild trust in the system is critical to sustain and further develop the sector".Earlier this year the Taoiseach launched the Strategy for the International Financial Services Industry in Ireland 2011-2016. The strategy sets out a vision for the future development of the IFSC, with the goal of creating 10,000 net new jobs over the next five years.  One of the drivers of growth identified for the IFSC is a credible, responsible and proportionate regulatory regime.Under the relevant European treaty provisions, the European Central Bank must be consulted on proposed legislative changes affecting national central banks.  The ECB published a positive opinion on the Bill on 9 September in which it stated that "the ECB welcomes the draft law as enhancing the supervisory and enforcement tools available to the Central Bank of Ireland".Of course, legislation alone will not be enough to address the failures of the past.  In recent years the level of regulatory activity has intensified with increases in staff numbers and skill levels at the Central Bank.  On-site inspections and review meetings have gone from 606 in 2009 to 1,046 in 2010.  Staff levels increased by 17% in 2010 to 1,226.The Central Bank has published an enforcement strategy for 2011 and 2012 setting out its strategic approach to enforcement for the benefit of consumers and the integrity of the Irish financial services sector as a whole.  The Central Bank has also taken a number of measures under its new approach to banking supervision.  During 2011 it has re-organised its internal banking supervision structures and it has invested heavily in training all supervisory staff.  A panel of risk advisers with specialist and industry expertise has been in operation since September 2010.I will provide an overview of the provisions of the Bill.  Part 1 deals with technical matters such as the interpretation provisions and the commencement of the Bill.  Of note within the interpretation provisions is the definition of Irish financial services law as this concept recurs throughout the Bill.  The term is used as shorthand to refer to the various instruments which make up the body of financial services law and includes the various enactments which regulate each of the sectors of the financial services industry as well as the Central Bank Acts themselves.  An important lesson from the financial crisis is the need for the Central Bank to have access to an independent expert view of the position of financial service providers.Part 2 provides that the Central Bank may require a regulated financial service provider or a related undertaking — referred to as the "reviewee" — to commission and pay for a report from an independent expert, who is approved by the Central Bank.  These reports may be used, for example, for diagnostic purposes to identify risks or issues of concern, or for remedial purposes to follow up on an earlier problem.  The Central Bank will prescribe the purpose, scope and form of the report, which must be prepared by someone appearing to the Central Bank to have the necessary skills for the job.  The person must also have sufficient detachment to ensure the objectivity of the report — this is important to avoid conflicts of interest or the risk of client bias.The reviewee will be responsible for the cost of preparing a report.  In my Department's consultations with the industry this point was raised a number of times.  Of course, I am sensitive to the issue of placing costs on firms.  For that reason, a number of features have been included in the Bill which do not appear in the equivalent UK provisions.  Before requiring a skilled person report, the Central Bank must first have regard to whether some other of its powers are more appropriate; the relevant knowledge and expertise of the reviewee to do the report itself; the cost implications for the reviewee; the reviewee's resources; and the benefit to the reviewee of the report, for example, where the report leads to an improvement in its systems.  The provision has been carefully balanced to meet the regulatory need for objective analysis with the cost burden on firms.  It also ensures that the cost is borne by the firms being reviewed rather than by the sector at large through a regulatory fee.One of the distinctive features of Irish financial services legislation is its sheer volume and complexity.  There are over 250 separate Acts, statutory instruments and directives to be navigated and understood.  Many of these have been amended time and time again, leading us to the point where even the most nimble legal brains have had some difficulty identifying what the law states.  A full consolidation of the relevant legislation will be a substantial task but one that it is intended will be undertaken in due course.In the meantime Part 3 begins the process of simplification and clarification as far as it relates to the powers of persons appointed by the bank to gather information.  The Statute Book contains some 20 different regimes setting out the powers of authorised officers in the banking, building society, insurance, investment and others sectors.  This can create confusion for the regulated financial service providers who must comply with the law, and makes the business of information-gathering needlessly complex from the Central Bank's point of view.  Part 3 seeks to replace almost all those different regimes, by taking the most useful features of each to create a single regime.The Bill sets out the persons to whom the authorised officer provisions apply.  These include a regulated financial service provider; a related undertaking; any person who holds relevant information; and administrators, special managers and liquidators.  An authorised officer may enter a premises being used for the business of a financial service provider or related undertaking or where relevant records are kept.  However, an authorised officer cannot enter a private dwelling without a warrant or consent.Among other things, an authorised officer may search, inspect and secure the premises; inspect and copy records; question persons on action or records; and request a report.  This part also provides that an authorised officer may attend meetings of a regulated financial service provider.  It is an offence to obstruct or provide false or misleading information to an authorised officer carrying out the functions under this part.  Section 6 provides a saver provision in regard to authorised officer powers exercised under enactments now being repealed.Part 4 provides protection from civil liability and employer penalisation for whistleblowers.  Schedule 5 sets out the redress available to employees for penalisation.  The provisions are flexible enough to provide for protections outside the strict employer-employee context.  The identity of whistleblowers is not to be disclosed without their agreement unless it is necessary to ensure the proper investigation of the matter concerned.The Bill also provides a mandatory disclosure regime for those performing pre-approval controlled functions — these are prescribed senior or influential positions within financial service providers.  Failure to make such a disclosure without reasonable excuse could be grounds for an investigation and action under the fitness and probity regime.Part 5 deals with the bank's power to give directions.  The Central Bank already holds a range of sectoral powers to issue directions and these are not being repealed.  The intention of this power is to enhance the bank's capacity to make regulatory interventions across the range of its responsibilities in specified serious circumstances.  The bank may issue a direction where it is found that a regulated financial service provider or related undertaking is unable to meet its obligations to its creditors or customers, not maintaining adequate capital or other financial resources, failing or likely to fail to comply with financial services law, or jeopardising the rights and interests of its customers.A direction by the bank must be made in writing to the regulated financial service provider or related undertaking and can include a direction to refrain from providing a financial service for up to 12 months; to raise and maintain capital or other financial resources; to comply with requirements and conditions imposed by financial services legislation, or to make required modifications to its business practices and dealings with third parties.A regulated financial service provider or related undertaking may apply to the High Court within 14 days to have the direction set aside.  Similarly, the bank may apply to the High Court for an order to enforce a direction made to a regulated financial service provider or related undertaking.  Following a direction made by the bank, the consent of the High Court is required before any person may commence or continue proceedings for the winding-up, dissolution, receivership, bankruptcy or related proceedings of a regulated financial service provider or related undertaking.  Part 6 of the Bill provides for extended powers for the Central Bank to make regulations to ensure the proper and effective regulation of the financial services industry.The nature of modern financial regulation both in Ireland and internationally is such that there is a need to provide a mechanism for the regulator to issue binding requirements on matters of detail, procedure and standards across a range of areas.  The approach in the Bill allows the primary legislation to set out the policies and principles within which these more detailed requirements may be set out; in other words, the Oireachtas draws the picture and the Central Bank colours it in.Some of the matters covered in this Part of the Bill may already be the subject of Central Bank codes.  The Bill provides a mechanism for these requirements to be set out in a more formal way through regulations.  This approach also brings greater clarity to the scope of the Central Bank's powers to impose regulatory requirements in this way.The areas in which the Central Bank would be empowered to make regulations include the management and mitigation of risks; administrative, accounting, auditing and reporting arrangements; the training and qualifications of those working in the financial sector; protections for consumers including provision for customers in financial difficulty; the making of loans and other credit facilities; related party lending; and switching.When making regulations, the Central Bank must consider the need to ensure that the requirements imposed by the regulations concerned are effective and proportionate, having regard to the nature, scale and complexity of the activities of regulated financial service-providers or the class or classes of regulated financial service-providers to whom the regulations apply.  The Bill also provides for consultation with the Minister for Finance and broader consultation before the introduction of regulations.  Once made, the regulations must be laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas.Part 7 of the Bill deals with enforcement.  Section 44 allows the bank to publish a notice warning the public where it reasonably believes a company is providing a regulated financial service without proper authorisation.  Section 45 provides for restitution where a regulated financial service-provider has been found to have committed a breach of Irish financial services law and has become unjustly enriched or other persons have suffered loss.  The Bill provides that the Central Bank may apply to the High Court for a restitution order to require the regulated financial service-provider concerned to provide to the Central Bank an amount equal to the unjust gain or loss, which the Central Bank would then distribute to persons who have suffered a loss as a result of an offence.  This Part also provides for the bank to recover the costs of an investigation from a regulated financial service-provider convicted of an offence.  It is only fair that the burden of funding the investigation of serious wrong-doing falls on the offender rather than law-abiding financial service-providers.  Section 47 provides an assurance to all those who may be requested to provide information to the Central Bank in the course of carrying out its regulatory functions that they will not have any liability in contract or tort to employers, customers, counter parties or anyone else, for having provided that information.Part 8 of the Bill deals with amendments to the administrative sanctions regime provided for in Part IIIC of the Central Bank Act 1942.  Administrative sanctions may be imposed on regulated financial service-providers by the Central Bank for prescribed contraventions of Irish financial services legislation in accordance with Part IIIC of the Central Bank Act 1942.  The changes proposed in this Bill are intended to increase the penalties the Central Bank may impose for breaches of the law by all regulated financial service providers affected.  A number of technical changes are provided for in this Part including enhancements to the bank's powers to compel witnesses to attend before an inquiry under Part IIIC; clarification of the situation where individuals are party to breaches of Irish financial services law by regulated financial service-providers; and improved powers to ensure compliance with an agreed settlement.  Significantly, the Bill doubles the maximum levels of financial sanction to €10 million or 10% of turnover, whichever is the higher, for a body corporate and €1 million for a natural person.  Part 8 also provides that the Central Bank may suspend or revoke an authorisation as a sanction.  This decision would be appealable to the Irish Financial Services Appeals Tribunal.Part 9 of the Bill deals with miscellaneous matters.  The first item, co-operation with overseas regulators, provides that the bank may use its information-gathering and authorised officer powers to collect information in co-operation with overseas regulators.  In doing so the bank must be satisfied that the overseas regulator it is assisting is duly authorised to perform corresponding functions in its jurisdiction.  In some instances the Central Bank may require the overseas regulator to contribute towards the cost of an investigation being undertaken at its request.  This provision is necessary to allow the Central Bank to become a signatory to the multilateral memorandums of understanding of the International Organisation of Securities Commission and the International Association of Insurance Supervisors.  There is also an amendment to the Personal Injuries Assessment Board Act 2003 to allow the Governor of the Central Bank to nominate an employee of the Central Bank for appointment as a member of the Personal Injuries Assessment Board.The Schedules to the Bill provide largely for repeals, revocations and amendments to various Acts and statutory instruments consequent upon the changes set out in the Bill.On publication, I referred the Bill to the Commission on Credit Unions for a recommendation on its application to credit unions.  In its interim report, the commission recommended that the powers and functions intended under the Bill should be applied to credit unions.  The commission noted that there is an urgency to the issues involved.  However, the commission could not arrive at a single position as to the statutory mechanism for applying these powers and functions to credit unions, in other words, whether these powers would apply through this Bill or the credit union-specific legislation being prepared.  I will give this issue further consideration as work on both Bills progresses.This Bill is essential if we are to rebuild confidence in our financial system.  The Bill's importance is underlined by its inclusion as a structural benchmark in the EU-IMF programme.  My Department has been engaged in consultation with various stakeholders since publication of the Bill and I remain open to considering constructive suggestions whether made inside this House or otherwise.  I commend the Bill to the House.

#MichaelMcGrath	unknown-#MichaelMcGrath-party	unknown-#MichaelMcGrath-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcGrath-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-25 00:00:00	Prelude	419	I welcome the opportunity to contribute on Second Stage of the Central Bank (Supervision and Enforcement) Bill 2011.  This Bill was commenced last year following the adoption of the Central Bank Reform Act and it forms part of an overall package of measures designed to reform the regulatory system which is crucial for the future of our economy.We all recognise the abject failure of the regulatory system in Ireland to properly supervise the financial sector during the years of the Celtic tiger.  This was, undoubtedly, one of the key factors leading to the severe economic difficulties we now face.  The taxpayer has been left with a bill in order to recapitalise the banks.  To date, direct capital support by the State runs to approximately €64 billion, which exceeds 40% of Irish GDP.  By any international comparison, this is a remarkable figure and it is a measure of the scale and the extent of the failure of the regulatory system to supervise and intervene where necessary in respect of the actions of the very large financial institutions in particular.We all recognise that the system of regulation was seriously deficient, deferential to the banks and lacked teeth.  There was also an unwillingness to act within senior levels of the regulatory system.It was not just a failing at the level of the Financial Regulator.  The Central Bank also failed in its duty to raise any red flag on the prudential side or to warn Government in a robust and vigorous way of the implications for the broader economy of the over-reliance on the construction sector or of the scale of lending that was going on among the principal banks here and the foreign banks.  While reckless lending was undoubtedly a prominent part of the system for many years, others in the banking system were possibly also guilty of fraudulent and criminal activity.  We should take the opportunity in this debate to say how galling the lack of progress on the investigations is for ordinary people.  The investigations into certain transactions at Anglo Irish Bank and other institutions have been going on for almost three years.

#MichaelMcGrath	unknown-#MichaelMcGrath-party	unknown-#MichaelMcGrath-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcGrath-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-25 00:00:00	Prelude	421	It was back in February 2009 that the fraud squad raided the offices of Anglo Irish Bank, but now towards the end of October 2011, while some files are with the DPP, no prosecutions have been brought and no charges have been laid before any court in Ireland with regard to the practices that went on.  For the sake of confidence in the democratic and political system, it is essential those matters are brought to a conclusion in the short term.It was interesting to note the comments from the outgoing Director of Public Prosecutions in a Sunday newspaper at the weekend that it may be necessary to bring in specialist jurors or to provide training and expertise for lay jurors so that they will have the know-how and wherewithal to adjudicate on some of these complex criminal cases should they come before an Irish court.  I hope the Government is taking this matter seriously, because the last thing we want is for cases to come to court and for there to be no satisfactory process whereby justice can be served.On a positive note, we would all agree that the appointments by the former Minister for Finance, the late Brian Lenihan, of Matthew Elderfield as Financial Regulator and Patrick Honohan as Governor of the Central Bank were landmark appointments.  There is wide acceptance across the House and outside of it that these two individuals are performing their functions to the highest standards.  They are certainly introducing a new culture in the Central Bank and the financial regulatory system and that is welcome.  The Central Bank, which now incorporates the financial regulatory function, now has more staff and a better skills mix.  This too is welcome.  The figures on the numbers employed by the Central Bank have been outlined and they are significantly higher than the numbers employed in recent years.We all accept the need to have the right regulations in place and for those regulations to be enforced in an appropriate manner and that is the thrust of this Bill.  Its aim, along with the other legislation that has been advanced, is to ensure we have a regulatory system in this country that is fit for purpose and that ensures the scandalous, reckless management of banks, which was allowed to happen for a number of years, never happens again.  We can also agree that the model of regulation must focus attention on the areas of most risk.  This is an area where there were failings within the financial institutions.  The risk assessment systems they employed were almost non-existent.  Also, the assessment of risk within the regulatory authority, where the threat to the economy was resting, and the action following that assessment were severely lacking.  While we all recognise that the larger banks and financial institutions, which are regulated by the Financial Regulator, clearly contain the highest areas of risk, this Bill applies to over 14,500 financial service providers here, ranging from the major banks to small local insurance providers and all other regulated financial service providers.The Office of the Financial Services Ombudsman does tremendous work and some 6,000 to 7,000 complaints are lodged every year with the ombudsman.  That office holds a wealth of knowledge and experience that can be used and can feed into a proper regulatory structure.  I am not sure how much of a tie-in there is between the ombudsman's office and the regulatory structure, but it is something we should look at.  Individuals are coming forward with complaints based on their personal experience of dealing with the regulated entities and are, in effect, doing the work for the regulatory function.  They are highlighting the areas where there are deficiencies and the areas of risk.  Those complaints are being adjudicated on by the ombudsman, but I would like to see clarification from the Minister as to whether all of that information is fed into the regulatory system and is used by the Financial Regulator to ensure, for example, that hire purchase companies, money lenders, mortgage and credit intermediaries perform their functions properly.  Insurance companies are also subject to scrutiny by the ombudsman's office and this area will be an increasing area of activity.  Last night we had floods in Dublin and we had them in Cork a couple of years ago, where huge issues arose with regard to insurance.  This is an area where we can expect to see a growing number of complaints.It is appropriate that the EU-IMF programme entered into last November contains an emphasis on an improvement to the regulatory system and a requirement that this Bill be advanced.  The Bill was published in July and aims to provide the Central Bank with sufficient powers to oversee and enforce the effective regulation of the financial services sector in Ireland.  We would all agree that the combination of a well resourced central bank, staffed by skilled personnel, equipped with regulatory powers and within a strong framework is key to the effective regulation of the financial services sector here into the future.  The Bill seeks to address a number of the resource concerns, which were identified by the Central Bank in its enforcement strategy 2011-12 and by the new Central Bank enforcement directorate.Turning to some of the specific elements of the Bill, the provision dealing with the "skilled persons reports" allows the Cental Bank to request an independent report into a regulatory matter.  This means the Central Bank does not have to rely upon the information provided by the financial services provider in question, but can require an expert independent report on the issue, paid for by the firm.  I welcome that the Bill recognises the need to have regard to the cost implications for the firm being reviewed.  However, I would like to raise an issue with regard to this.  The company in question nominates a firm or individual to prepare the report, which the Central Bank approves, or if it fails to nominate a firm or if confirmation is denied by the Central Bank, the Central Bank will appoint the firm to conduct a review.  I suggest a better system would be for the Central Bank to appoint the firm that will carry out the review so that the onus would not be placed on the company which is subject to the review to identify an appropriate reviewer.  It would be a more meaningful review if it was conducted by an independent firm selected by the Central Bank.  I am sure it could put together a panel of suitable firms to conduct such reviews, similar, for example, to the various framework agreements the OPW entered into in the context of procurement.It is important to emphasise the need for real independence when the Central Bank assesses the firm that will undertake the report.  Firms with clear financial links to the company concerned might compromise the independence of the report.  Sometimes it may be difficult for the Central Bank to get under the skin of the transaction and to determine whether there is a connection between the company seeking the review and the company conducting the review.  That is the reason it would be more robust and independent for the Central Bank to arrange for the review to be carried out.  In addition, given that many of the financial service providers covered by the Bill are small operations, we all recognise that costs must be kept to a minimum.  I will return to that issue shortly.On the question of authorised officers, the provision consolidates the existing 20 authorised officer regimes into a single regime.  The Minister has outlined the legislative challenge it poses.  These officers are the front line investigators of regulatory compliance and simplifying the regimes they operate under makes it significantly easier to ascertain information.  Under the Bill, they are being given extensive powers and we need to ensure that people of the utmost integrity are being appointed to these positions, people who will not seek to abuse the extensive powers they are granted.  They are in a privileged, sensitive position when conducting their work and it is essential there is a proper code of conduct in respect of these authorised officers under the new system.The whistleblower protection provision protects whistleblowers from victimisation by their employers and from civil liability.  If a staff member informs the Central Bank of misdemeanours in the company, he or she will be protected from punishment by that company.  We all welcome that in general terms but a number of issues have been raised.  In researching this Bill, I came across a number of documents and responses to the legislation.  Some of the issues raised are valid, and some of them have been raised by legal firms, accountants and others.  While a person who makes a report under the Bill will receive whistleblower protection, it is not yet clear how the reporting obligation will operate in terms of timing.  Must reports be made to the Garda Síochána and the Central Bank at the same time?  It is not clear what due process, if any, should take place in an organisation before a person makes such a report.  Is protection afforded irrespective of whether an internal process has been exhausted?  Under the Criminal Justice Act 2011, a person who fails, without reasonable excuse, to report information that could be of material assistance regarding a relevant offence under that Act, or a suspected relevant offence, to the Garda Síochána will be guilty of an offence.  However, under the current Bill, the responsibility to report activities is confined to individuals in pre-approved control positions and senior management, not all personnel as set out in the Criminal Justice Act 2011.Regarding directions, sweeping powers are afforded to the Central Bank and, in general, we do not have a difficulty with this.  Similarly, on the issue of making appropriate regulations, a proper framework whereby the Central Bank can conduct intervention actions where appropriate was lacking and has been corrected in this legislation.  I also welcome the increase in the level of fines.  The lack of a proper deterrent and a lack of willingness to impose the deterrent was one of the factors that contributed to the malaise and the light touch regulatory system in Ireland for some time.On the issue of sanctions, the Central Bank may revoke the authorisation of a financial services provider, which is welcome.  A number of other areas, such as restitution orders and co-operation with overseas regulators, are to be welcomed but I emphasise to the Minister the need to ensure proper consultation with the industry.  He referred to consultation in his opening remarks and perhaps he can elaborate on the type of consultation and who he consulted with.  Were the representative bodies of small players in the industry consulted?  They are the most vulnerable in many respects and the cost implications of ensuring they comply with this legislation will be a major burden for them.  We need to ensure that while we weed out any cowboys in the financial services sector, we do not want to stifle the many good operators.  At a time when we are trying to restore competitiveness to our economy, costs associated with compliance must be at the forefront of our consideration of this matter.I refer to the bodies and entities not regulated by this Bill or any legislation, such as debt management advisers and companies such as Home Payments Limited, which collapsed in August with devastating consequences for thousands of its customers in Dublin.  While great emphasis is rightly being placed on ensuring regulated entities are comprehensively regulated, we must move with the same urgency to ensure that people in vulnerable positions, such as people struggling with personal debt and mortgage arrears, are also protected from the companies and businesses providing services.  We have published a Bill, which is sitting on the Order Paper, providing for the regulation of debt management advisers.  The Minister has asked the Central Bank for feedback and is awaiting it.  I urge the Minister to move on that issue with the same speed and urgency with which this Bill is making progress.  I look forward to detailed engagement on Committee Stage.
#BillyKelleher	unknown-#BillyKelleher-party	unknown-#BillyKelleher-dob	unknown-#BillyKelleher-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-25 00:00:00	Prelude	422	I welcome the opportunity to speak on this Bill, which is a case of bolting the stable door after the horse has gone down the paddock in the context of oversight, regulation and a lack of enforcement and supervision of the banking sector in recent years.  I hope this Bill will go a long way to restoring the confidence of the people, inside and outside Ireland, in ensuring we have a strong, robust regulatory system that sends a strong signal, internationally and nationally, that we are seen to have proper supervision of financial services.  Critically, in an international context, the Irish financial services centre is a key component of the Irish economy.  It generates a major amount of employment and is seen as an important hub in the provision of financial services.  Anything that undermines the confidence of international investors, in terms of banking supervision and regulation, could potentially damage financial services.  The financial services sector here has withstood, in general terms, the broader world recession and the damage caused to financial services across the world in respect of employment.  The sector is now growing.  When speaking publicly about the lack of oversight of banks and financial services in this country, it is important that we do not damage the integrity of the country in broad terms.This is my first opportunity to speak on financial matters since the return of the Dáil.  We must be honest about what we are trying to achieve, which is to ensure that we do not have banks capable of engaging in cowboy activities and reckless lending and becoming so big that they cannot be allowed to fail.  That is what happened in recent times.  I will take a certain amount of criticism as I was sitting on the Government side of the House for a long period of time.  At the time, not only did the Financial Regulator, the Central Bank and the Department of Finance fail, this House failed substantially.  It failed because it did not hold anyone to account by raising concerns that we all have now, with the benefit of hindsight, about what the banks were doing.  They were involved in speculative lending and forced property prices up, which all fell on mortgage holders in this State.This was coupled with the emergence of the eurozone and the fact that our economy was out of sync with many other economies.  We needed high interest rates and we got low interest rates.  The euro was not at the correct value when we joined it, from the point of view of the cyclical nature of our economy.  These are historical facts but they lead us to a situation where we have tens of thousands of mortgage holders under major financial pressure because of the activity in the banking sector, developers, the lack of oversight and policy failures.  This applies in the context of Government but also in the context of this House.  I am not going to apportion blame but trying to highlight the fact that this House never discussed any issue to do with banking, nor did we have a broad debate on banking over many years.  There was a general consensus in the House that there would be a soft landing and that we would have potential growth of between 2% and 4% in the years after the rapid growth of the Celtic tiger era.  That failed to materialise for a number of reasons.  If we want to genuinely address the challenges facing the Minister, this Government and our people in the years ahead, we must be honest about how we arrived at this point and about how we deal with getting out of the equation.There is a genuine need for an honest investigation into what went wrong and how we can arrive at policy decisions in the years ahead which will ensure it does not recur.  A referendum will take place this coming Thursday which seeks to afford the House of the Oireachtas powers of inquiry into matters of public importance.  However, under the Commissions of Investigation Act 2004, passed by this House some years ago, we could already have had an inquiry up and running into what went wrong and where the failures arose.  The Nyberg report, Honohan report and Regling and Watson report, as well as findings by the Financial Regulator, Mr. Matthew Elderfield, pointed clearly to a lack of oversight in financial regulation as well as policy failures across the board.  Instead of waiting an indeterminate period and allowing a political charade to take place in this House, we should have an honest debate on how to get out of our difficulties in a manner which has the support of the public.We must examine how we can ease the burden on those facing unemployment, mortgage arrears, threatened repossession of the family home and all the other challenges the Minister for Finance faces in framing the budget this December.  He must not only devise a sustainable budgetary framework for the coming years which facilitates us in returning to the bond markets but must also ensure it complies with our memorandum of understanding with the EU-IMF-ECB troika.  In that context, the Minister must surely accept that we have not yet had an honest debate in this House on all of these issues.  Even as early as January and February of this year, a sustained deceit was in evidence in the context of election campaigning.  People were promised, for example, that bondholders would be burned and that mortgage interest relief would be extended for those most burdened by mortgage debt as a consequence of negative equity.  No action has been taken on either of these issues.  Before its publication, the Keane report was held up as a panacea that would address the fundamental issues of mortgage arrears and negative equity.  It has not addressed those concerns.  We all accept there is no easy solution, but the reality is that people were led to believe that bondholders would be burned, thus reducing the cost to the State of the bank bailout and facilitating some leeway in assisting mortgage holders.  That undertaking was clearly given by several political parties at the beginning of the year.There are great challenges to be faced, unemployment being the most obvious, as well as mortgage arrears, negative equity and Ireland's international reputation.  Our objective is to return to the bond markets and to self-sufficiency in funding our activities.  Regarding the memorandum of understanding with the troika, I spoke about it to the former Minister for Finance, the late Brian Lenihan, on several occasions, including only several weeks before he passed away.  He was clearly of the opinion that we were bullied by the European Central Bank in terms of accessing the bailout fund.  Moreover, we received no support from the European Commission.I have made the point repeatedly that the Commission is meant to be the guarantor of the various treaties ratified since the Treaty of Rome.  However, it has singularly failed to ensure that small nations such as Ireland and Portugal get a fair crack of the whip.  No bondholders have been burnt and the burden on taxpayers in this State has not been lessened.  Rather, we have been saddled with the full debt.  We can argue about whether the bank guarantee was the right action to take but, at the time, the view was that there was no choice in the matter.  We now have a situation where promissory notes are being issued on a regular basis to fund the bailout of Anglo Irish Bank.  There is a clear obligation on the Government to seek to lighten the burden on this State in order to allow it to become self-sufficient by returning to the bond markets.The debate in this House, particularly against the backdrop of the general election, was deceitful and dishonest in many cases.  People were led up the garden path in being told there was an easy route out of the great difficulties we face.  I accept my portion of the blame, but rewriting history at this early stage does no service to what we all wish to achieve, namely, to get this State back on its feet and back into the bond markets.  Ireland has a good reputation internationally and we are a very capable people.  In recent days there has been an acknowledgement at European level that we are resilient, resourceful and willing to make tough decisions and to carry our fair share of the burden.  However, we are not getting fair treatment from the European Commission in terms of its responsibility to stand up for the rights of small nations.  Likewise, the European Central Bank intimidated and bullied this State into accepting a bailout.On the challenges facing individuals, I recall speaking in this House some years ago about escalating house prices.  Many Deputies were making such points.  We were aware for a long time that there was a difficulty in regard to escalating house prices, and previous Governments made several interjections, such as serviced land initiatives, amendments to the tax regimes and so on, in an effort to curtail house price increases.  Clearly, those initiatives did not work.  We were all assured at that time that there would be a soft landing, everything would proceed in a smooth manner and there would be no great difficulties arising from the large debts accrued by individuals.  That has not turned out to be the case and we have made no inroads in addressing those problems.We have, however, made a start in restoring our international reputation, as has been acknowledged by EU leaders.  There will be discussion at tomorrow's summit of the debt crisis facing Europe.  For several years, in this Chamber and across all commentary, the only acceptable view was that Ireland's difficulty was entirely our own fault.  That is clearly not the case.  There is a broader, European context to the debt crisis.  For several years we were told that if we got our house in order in addressing our budget deficit, which we began doing in 2008, that all would be well.  That has not happened.  The Minister will have the support of everybody in this House if he seeks a genuine renegotiation of our bailout terms.  However, there is no point in pretending that he has already succeeded in renegotiating several aspects of the memorandum of understanding.  The Minister has renegotiated around the edges.  On the fundamental issues, in respect of which the Government made commitments to the Irish people in February this year, there has been no renegotiation.  Not a single bondholder has been burnt.In regard to failures of oversight, there is much talk of prosecutions and investigations into potential criminal activity.  Charges were made in this House that the previous Government was hiding bankers from being prosecuted.  However, in the eight months since this Government assumed office, no banker has been charged with any crime.  A little honesty on all sides of the House might persuade the public that we have the capacity to deal with the fundamental challenges facing us all.
#MaryLouMcDonald	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-party	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-dob	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-25 00:00:00	Prelude	423	I will resist the strong temptation to pick up the challenge raised by Deputy Billy Kelleher in addressing the issue of "sustained deceit" in Irish political life.  I will also stay away from Fianna Fáil revisionism and its bout of chronic amnesia, which we have just seen rehearsed in this Chamber.The Bill before us this evening strengthens the power of the Central Bank to supervise financial service providers and, where they are found to be in breach of existing regulations, to impose sanctions aimed at protecting the integrity of our financial system and the interests of the users of those services.  The Bill also provides valuable safeguards for whistleblowers in order to encourage people to come forward and report suspected wrongdoing, safe in the knowledge that they will not experience negative consequences.  It is an important Bill and it has the support of Sinn Féin.  Much of its content is of a technical nature.  Given the sheer number of financial service providers covered — the Minister referred to 14,000 — that is not surprising.  The Minister outlined the detail of the provisions for skilled person reports for authorised officers as well as sanctions and fines.  I will not rehearse these aspects of the Bill.However, I wish to refer to Part 4.  Whistleblowers provide a vital function in exposing breaches not only of law but of good practice in public and corporate life.  We must ensure the fullest protection for those brave women and men who are willing to expose bad practice.I am pleased that the Bill protects whistleblowers from civil liability and victimisation.  I am also pleased that this protection extends not only to employers who are implicated in the detail of the information provided but also those outside the employer-employee relationship.
#JoeHiggins	unknown-#JoeHiggins-party	unknown-#JoeHiggins-dob	unknown-#JoeHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-25 00:00:00	Prelude	424	I move:"That Dáil Éireann:noting that:the ‘FairCare' health reform plan of the Minister for Health, James Reilly T.D., is in chaos as a result of health cuts and that as a result there is a spiralling crisis in health service delivery and accident and emergency (A&E) services across the country;this crisis in our public health system is particularly manifest in the following areas:Limerick: The closures in 2009 of 24 hour A&E departments in Nenagh, Ennis and St. John's hospitals have resulted in acute overcrowding in Limerick Regional Hospital and promises that additional resources would be made available have not materialised;Loughlinstown: The plan to downgrade A&E in St. Colmcille's will inevitably put pressure on St. Vincent's Hospital which is already overcrowded and has had to go ‘off call' on a number of occasions over the last weeks;Blanchardstown: The funding cut from €104 million in 2009 to €84 million in 2011 while there is an almost 10% increase in both the local population and the amount of patients treated during this period will inevitably affect patient safety.  Twelve beds in Laurel Ward and 16 in the inpatient surgical day ward are set to close.  A costing for running the A&E on a 12 hour basis has been performed.  This is causing grave concern among residents in the hospital catchment area of 330,000;Cork: Planned cutbacks to emergency services in Cork, which include closing Victoria South Infirmary A&E in April, Bantry minor injury assessment unit and unspecified dates for downgrading Mallow and Youghal, will put unacceptable pressure on Cork University Hospital and Mercy Hospital.  The downgrading of Skibbereen Ambulance Service to an 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. service leaves west Cork with a wholly inadequate ambulance service: it is already a regular occurrence on weekend nights for no ambulances to be available.  West Cork will be dependent on the ambulance in Clonakilty (which serves Rosscarbery to Kinsale) which can take 30 minutes on blue lights to reach Skibbereen and 90 minutes to Castletownbere;Roscommon: The downgrading of A&E services in Roscommon represents an unacceptable cut in the level of health services for the people of Roscommon/Leitrim, putting additional pressure on Galway University Hospital where, on 20th October, 37 people were on trolleys;South Tipperary: The recent announcement of the closure of the acute psychiatric unit in South Tipperary Hospital;Letterkenny: The recruitment embargo means that staff have to be pulled in from other essential services to ensure that the hospital can function as an essential healthcare facility, adversely affecting community and other services; andTallaght: Tallaght Hospital has been historically underfunded.  It is the busiest hospital in the State but ranks lowest of the top five hospitals in Dublin for funding.  Its catchment area has been expanded from 350,000 to 500,000.  The Health Service Executive has identified the need for step down beds and improved primary care as major contributors to increasing pressure on the acute hospitals; recently, however it announced the closing of the Crooksling nursing home in Brittas.  Tallaght and Clondalkin have twice the average number of people per general practitioner in Ireland and three times the average in France and Germany;the loss of almost 5,000 beds since 1980 and the more recent closure of more than 1,700 beds due to budget cuts and the recruitment embargo means there is a crisis of capacity in our public hospitals that is the immediate cause of the problems in A&Es.  There are fewer than 3 acute hospital beds per 1,000 population in Ireland compared to an EU average of 4 beds per 1,000; andsince 2008 there are 6,000 fewer health-workers in the health service because of the recruitment embargo.  These are overwhelmingly frontline staff including 1,000 nurses.  The Chief Executive Officer of the Health Service Executive, Mr. Cathal Magee, admits there will be 7,000 more staff lost by 2014, a total loss of 13,000 or 11.7% (2008:111,000; 2011:105,000; 2014:98,000); andresolves to:lift the embargo on recruitment to the health service and to reverse the policy of closing hospital beds — reopening, as a matter of urgency, the 1,700 recently cut beds;abandon the policy of closing or downgrading local and regional hospitals;safeguard the 24 hour A&E of Blanchardstown Hospital and reverse the bed closures in the Laurel and day surgical wards;reverse the downgrading of 24 hour A&E in Nenagh and Ennis to relieve pressure on Limerick Regional Hospital;reverse the plan to downgrade the A&E in St. Colmcille's in Loughlinstown preventing further pressure on St. Vincent's Hospital;reverse the downgrading of 24 hour A&E in Roscommon relieving pressure on Galway University Hospital;reverse the announcement of the closure of the acute psychiatric unit of South Tipperary General Hospital;abandon planned cutbacks or downgrading in emergency services in the Cork area specifically, at Victoria South Infirmary, Bantry, Mallow, Youghal or the downgrading of the Skibbereen ambulance service;lift the embargo at Letterkenny Hospital to ensure that the hospital can function as an essential healthcare facility; andimpose no further cuts in the health budget 2012."I am sharing time with Deputies Richard Boyd Barrett, Seamus Healy and Catherine Murphy.This motion is in the name of the United Left Alliance Deputies and supported by other Deputies.  Our motion lists in a comprehensive way the huge range of attacks on our hospital services particularly and on the health service generally throughout the country.  Unfortunately, these attacks are intensifying which bears witness to the fact that instead of the change the Labour Party-Fine Gael coalition Government promised it has continued on where Fianna Fáil and the Green Party left off in terms of the savaging of our public services, in this case health, while at the same time continuing the disastrous policy of austerity begun by its predecessors.It is incredible that our motion outlines crucial and devastating cuts to areas of our health service, and hospitals particularly, throughout the country and at the same time in two weeks' time €700 million will be paid to unsecured Anglo Irish Bank bondholders and, if this Government continues to have its way, €3.5 billion by the end of June.  That is a devastating condemnation of this coalition of Fine Gael and the Labour Party.I will concentrate particularly on the effects on Connolly Hospital in Blanchardstown.  Connolly Hospital has undergone debilitating cuts in recent years including a cut of €20 million in its budget, from €104 million to €84 million in the past two to three years alone, with consequences for reduction in beds and other difficulties.  That comes down to more suffering for people on waiting lists and huge pressure on the frontline staff at Connolly Hospital who, by common consent and the testament of the people who use the service, are model workers in the health field.In terms of these new cuts to Connolly hospital, incredibly, this week provision is made and is being implemented for the removal of 26 surgical beds from Connolly hospital.  The surgical day ward is closing for two weeks and when it reopens only eight beds will continue to operate with another 12 beds being removed from the Laurel ward, making a total of 28.These new cuts are being implemented without a murmur of opposition from two Ministers who represent the catchment area of Connolly Hospital, namely, the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Varadkar, and the Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Burton.  These two Ministers exhibit the most acute cynicism and hypocrisy in their attitude towards Blanchardstown hospital.  On 5 October last year, the Minister, Deputy Varadkar, who was then Deputy Varadkar, was withering in his criticism of the most recently announced cuts at that stage which included the closure of 24 beds in Connolly hospital and a total of 118 across the northside hospitals in Dublin.  The then Deputy Varadkar stated:With 118 beds closed, hospitals on the northside will be a war-zone this winter.  I have worked in the Emergency Departments in both Beaumont and Connolly Hospital and also on the wards during winter time.  I know how busy it gets during the winter as the number of cases of pneumonia, COPD, heart failure and chest infections soar.  With over 100 beds closed, we are facing into an A&E trolley crisis the like of which we have never seen.That was the Minister, Deputy Varadkar, speaking as a simple Deputy 12 months ago but two weeks ago at a public meeting in regard to the new cuts at Connolly Hospital, Blanchardstown, he baldly declared: "These new cuts will remain and there must be more cuts".  What changed in the past 12 months?  The only thing that changed is that the Minister assumed high office in Government and then cynically betrayed the people whom he claimed to stand for previously.The Labour Party Minister, Deputy Burton, is equally cynical and hypocritical in her attitude to the new cuts in Connolly Hospital.  Last year, the then Deputy Burton declared: "With proper investment, James Connolly Memorial Hospital will develop into a world class medical facility".  She outlined among her five key priorities for Dublin West making Connolly Hospital a world class medical facility.  Now the Minister, Deputy Burton, is silent on the effects of the €20 million cuts in the Connolly Hospital budget and the new cuts just announced.  How can she make a world class medical facility and how can she stand for investment in that against the background of the massive cuts to the budget and these new cuts taking out dozens of surgical beds?  Like the Minister, Deputy Varadkar, the Minister, Deputy Burton, has displayed the most acute cynicism and hypocrisy.The people of the catchment area, however, are acutely concerned about these most recent cuts.  The closure for a few weeks of the surgical day ward and the huge reduction in beds in the surgical day ward will mean dozens fewer procedures on a daily basis for those now on waiting lists to have their conditions ameliorated.  We can be sure that for them it will mean cancellation and rescheduling well into next year, with all the stress and suffering that goes with that, yet two Ministers who represent the area and claim to be champions for Connolly Hospital, its patients and staff are not just silent but are condoning this new round of cuts.The people of part of the catchment area in the constituency of Dublin West will have an opportunity in two days to make a judgment, through the ballot box, on this monumental cynicism and hypocrisy.  I am sure they have already drawn the conclusion that sending another Fine Gael or Labour Party backbencher to this House following their vote next Thursday will simply intensify these draconian cuts and the Government's determination to continue them, whereas sending a representative of the campaigns that have genuinely fought and continue to fight for the hospital, particularly my colleague, Councillor Ruth Coppinger, would be a massive warning to this Government that these cuts will not be tolerated.We want investment back in the hospital, the cuts reversed and the Government's disastrous policy of austerity changed.  We need and will have, after Thursday, genuine champions for the hospital, its staff and patients, not fair weather friends for whom it is politically convenient at certain times to support them but who, on getting into positions of power, immediately forget the allegedly solemn promises they made to protect and defend our health service in this area.
#RichardBoydBarrett	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-party	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-dob	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-25 00:00:00	Prelude	425	As with so many issues before the election, Fine Gael and the Labour Party were full of fine words, noble sentiments and not a few specific promises when it came to the protection of our health services, accident and emergency services and hospitals in general.  The Fine Gael pre-election document spoke about having the most ambitious plan for the health service since the establishment of the State.  Fine Gael was going to increase access and make the system much fairer, dismantle the dysfunctional HSE, created by Deputy Micheál Martin, and end the efforts of Fianna Fáil and the former Minister and Deputy, Mary Harney, to privatise the health system by favouring private over public care.  With regard to accident and emergency services, the document stated boldly that no accident and emergency services would be withdrawn unless a demonstrably better service was put in place and was seen to work.  It also talked about addressing the manpower crisis within the health service and said that Fine Gael would initiate a long-term manpower strategy to tackle the chronic front-line staff shortages.Not only have all those fine words and noble sentiments been dissolved and the promises broken, but what the party is doing is exactly the opposite.  The ambitious plan for reform is now beginning to look like a very ambitious plan to massacre the public health services, slash the number of beds and front-line health services and to prepare the health system for full-scale privatisation.  The evidence can be seen everywhere.There are people from Skibbereen and Bantry in west Cork in the Visitors Gallery tonight.  Throughout the country, people are out on the streets protesting against plans to cut the number of hospital beds, cut budgets and downgrade accident and emergency services that are reeling under the impact of the recruitment embargo which is slaughtering the number of front-line health workers who are able to deliver the services.  In west Cork, Donegal, Roscommon, Nenagh, Ennis, Blanchardstown, Loughlinstown, Dundalk, Drogheda and any area one cares to name the services are being slashed.The figures in that regard are quite shocking.  The number of people on trolleys is worse than ever.  A total of 344 people were on trolleys today.  In Cork University Hospital there were 23 people on trolleys, in Beaumont Hospital it was 37, last Friday in Galway University Hospital it was also 37, in Drogheda today it was 30, in Wexford it was 22 and in St. Vincent's Hospital it was 24.  In fact, in the case of St. Vincent's Hospital that figure was low compared with the figure on some days last week.  On five consecutive days two weeks ago St. Vincent's Hospital had to go off call for two hours because it simply could not cope.  That is the reality.  A total of 2,317 beds have been closed, 1,000 nurses have gone from the health system since 2008 and 6,000 other health workers, mainly front line, have also gone.  Furthermore, according to the HSE, another 7,000 health workers will be gone by 2014.  That is the reality of what the Government is doing to the health service.  According to the Irish Nurses and Midwives Organisation, INMO, the number of people on trolleys in the past year has increased by 33%, but the Minister still persists with the attacks, downgradings and cuts in the health service.All of this is covered and justified with spin and, frankly, lies about reconfiguring services, health and safety issues and, the one I like best, centres of excellence.  The Government is busy creating centres of excellence.  The truth is, as the Minister, Deputy Varadkar, predicted when he was just a humble Deputy, the centres of excellence are war zones.  They are like scenes from horror movies except that, unlike the movies, they are real.  Accident and emergency departments are overrun, overwhelmed and unable to cope.  The Minister is trying to tell us that downgrading or closing accident and emergency services in Roscommon will not make the situation worse in Galway, that doing so in Nenagh and Ennis will not make the situation worse in Limerick, that doing so in west Cork will not make the situation in the bigger hospitals in Cork city much worse or that closing Loughlinstown hospital will not worsen the already overwhelmed situation in St. Vincent's Hospital.  It just does not add up.  If one cuts budgets and the number of front-line workers, closes down beds and downgrades services, it is obvious that one will not get centres of excellence but disaster zones which simply cannot cope with the volume of cases coming to them.  That is the reality of the so-called fair care policy.What is really going on behind the spin and the pre-election noble sentiments and promises?  We got some indication from the revelation that the Minister is considering bringing in outside private contractors to manage some of our hospitals.  That gives the game away.  When one wishes to run down a health service or public amenity, the oldest trick in the book is to starve it of resources, claim there are health and safety issues and cause a crisis in that service to terrify people into moving to private providers.  This also justifies a more general privatisation onslaught on the health care system.  In this manner the Minister can open health care to the same type of privateers and corporate vultures who have wrecked our financial system and who, through speculation and gambling in the financial sector, have crashed our economy.  He wishes to hand over our vital health services to those types of people.This is all linked to the EU-IMF austerity programme.  We all know, and no sane person disputes it, that it was greed for profit and the unregulated privatised nature of the financial system that led to the economic catastrophe that is now gripping Europe, yet the EU-IMF demanded privatisation in Greece, Ireland and Italy in these so-called bailout packages.  That is what they want.  Standing behind them are the general agreement on trades in services and the round table of industrialists in Europe who see services such as health and education as previously protected areas that they can prise open and get their greedy, profit-hungry hands on vital services that people need and from which they can make money.  The Government is collaborating with them in destroying our public health services in order to open the door to these corporate vultures who are being assisted by the troika, the EU-IMF-ECB, in demanding austerity cuts and privatisation of our vital services.I hope the big protests that are beginning to take place in Bantry, have taken place in Roscommon and are planned for Loughlinstown this weekend, and which we saw in Limerick in recent weeks, will link together into a national movement that will resist this vicious, unjustified, brutal, unfair assault that is going on in our public health services and force the Government to reprioritise people and the most needy over bailing out bankers and opening things up for corporate vultures.
#SeamusHealy	unknown-#SeamusHealy-party	unknown-#SeamusHealy-dob	unknown-#SeamusHealy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-25 00:00:00	Prelude	426	Any reasonable person looking at the health service will know and appreciate it is in crisis, particularly the hospital services.  My colleague has just outlined the reasons for that.  What we have is the implementation by the Government of the policies of the previous Government.  The three key areas creating that crisis in our hospitals and health services are bed closures, of which there were 1,700 in the past 12 months — 5,000 since 1980 — and the moratorium through which we have lost 6,000 staff since 2008.  Another 7,000 will be lost between now and 2014, giving a total of 13,000 staff gone from the system.  The third element, as the Minister is aware and which is clearly shown in the case of Blanchardstown hospital, is a budget reduction from €104 million to €84 million.  That is a huge reduction but there is an expectation that the same number, if not more, patients will be treated.  The throughput is higher, staff are under enormous pressure and the consequences for patients are huge.  We know the consequences because we see them every day.  Today, there are 344 patients on trolleys and that is happening in every acute hospital throughout the country.Yesterday, an individual came to my clinic who was unwell and has been waiting for a barium meal for six months.  It is unfair that any person should have to wait that length of time for a procedure which is crucial for that person's health.  That is not an isolated case; it is happening in every acute hospital.  Despite the best efforts of staff from the top to the bottom, who work above and beyond the call of duty on a daily basis, they simply cannot cope because those three elements are putting the health services in crisis.The Minister is the political head of the health services.  His amendment to the motion refers to the delivery of safe care closer to local communities and freeing up capacity in larger hospitals.  I agree 100% with that statement.  All international research and professional evidence suggests and proves that is the way to go, that health services should be delivered locally.  The same independent international research proves that 95% of all health treatments can be provided locally in safety, as the Minister has described in his amendment.  Is it not time the Minister instructed the HSE to implement that policy throughout the health services because it is doing the exact opposite?  The Health Service Executive is implementing, by any other name, the Hanley report.  It is implementing centralisation and specialisation on a daily basis.It is time the political head of the health services instructed the HSE to follow the policy he claims to espouse in his amendment which states that it supports the Government's policy of developing the role of smaller hospitals to their full potential rather than closing or downgrading them; welcomes the Minister's intention to publish a framework for smaller hospitals which will include plans to transfer appropriate services from larger hospitals to smaller facilities; and supports the process of local consultation that will help inform future decisions on the organisation of acute hospital services.  That is the kind of language we have been listening to from the Health Service Executive for years.  What it means is the downgrading and closure of local hospitals, more Nenaghs, Ennis', Monaghans and Cavans.The Minister speaks about the transfer of appropriate services from larger hospitals to smaller facilities but he has to transfer some services from those hospitals to do so.  That is the key.  What happened in respect of Monaghan, Cavan, Nenagh and Ennis is what this paragraph means and it is totally at variance with the proper delivery of safe services locally.  I would be absolutely delighted if he was supporting the process of local consultation to help inform future decisions.  However, we all know, including the Minister, that is not happening, that the Health Service Executive is a bully boy and makes the decision first without any consultation.  After the event, to try to pull the wool over people's eyes, it involves itself in discussion with some stakeholders not about the decision or the service, but how its decision is to be implemented so there is no local consultation.  There should be a real process of local consultation with stakeholders, whether staff, members of the public, service users or patients, before decisions are made.  There is no point in having consultation after a decision has been made because the HSE will only have consultation on the basis that it wants to implement the decisions made.I know that is the case because I have seen it at first hand in south Tipperary where the Health Service Executive made the decision to close the acute inpatient psychiatric unit at South Tipperary General Hospital without any consultation whatsoever.  The decision was announced overnight and the first staff knew about it was on the local radio the following morning.  Now, after the event, the Health Service Executive will discuss the issue, but it will not discuss the appropriateness of the decision.  It will not discuss having a proper options appraisal nor will it discuss a proper cost-benefit analysis of the decision.  It will only discuss the implementation of the decision.  That will not work.The policy being pursued by the Health Service Executive is the policy of the Hanly report.  It is a policy of centralisation and specialisation.  It is a flawed and misguided policy that is not providing a good service to patients in this country.  We have seen that at first hand.  What else is the reconfiguration of hospital services in Monaghan and Cavan into the hospital in Drogheda?  What else is the reconfiguration of hospital services in Ennis and Nenagh into Limerick hospital only the implementation of the Hanly report?  That has been an absolute disaster in both cases.International, independent, professional research shows that medium-sized hospitals of approximately 200 to 300 beds provide the best quality of care, good value and proper access.  The suggestion that biggest is best is simply wrong.  It is leading to a situation where we have a major crisis in the health service, in particular in hospital services in this country.  I support the motion.
#CatherineMurphy	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-party	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-dob	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-25 00:00:00	Prelude	427	I thank the United Left Alliance for tabling the motion.  The Government terms the health care service it intends to build as fair care.  It is difficult to visualise what in fact the Minister has in mind.  I accept we must build a health care system that gives us the best possible care that is affordable.  I do not think any of us would dispute that, but I do not get any sense that this is what is occurring.It seems that the Department of Finance is running the health service or the mandarins with the financial purse strings in the Health Service Executive.  Many of our institutions — educational, health and local government — were largely constructed in the 19th century and we further fragmented and complicated them.  It does not seem that we are capable of building the kind of institutional arrangements that are needed for our public services.  It is not just about institutional arrangements but the principles under which those arrangements are in place, namely, equality of care and its delivery on the basis of need, and the question of social solidarity where people make a contribution so that everyone has the ability to receive fair services.The health service is a mixture of voluntary hospitals, public hospitals, private hospitals and co-located hospitals.  It is dysfunctional.  The overarching dysfunction is complicated by the Health Service Executive, the design of which was flawed from the outset.  It does not function for those who work within the system and it certainly does not function for those who require services.  There is no doubt that those who can afford to pay for private health care do so because they can expect better outcomes.  Essentially, they purchase private health care largely because they are afraid of depending on the public system.  When people get into the public system they get very good care but the problem is to get in.The list of hospitals in the motion and the problems they face is not exhaustive but it gives a snapshot of what is going on.  We need to see a map of hospital services nationally and the functions they perform, what hospitals are linked, how many beds are available and how that relates to the population.  The census indicates we have a growing population.  The greater Dublin area shows consistent growth.  Demographics play a part in health care needs.  We must see that kind of mapping of the health service.We have been told that it will take more than one Dáil term to reform the health care system but we need to have some sort of indication of what is intended and the sequence of what is intended.  Currently, there is a reduction in spending and a reduction in staff.  The closure of hospitals always has a knock-on effect on the hospitals to which they are linked.  For example, when one closes the hospital in Navan, one puts pressure on Blanchardstown hospital.  When Blanchardstown hospital is under pressure the Mater hospital is under pressure.  When the Mater hospital is under pressure, Beaumont hospital is under pressure.  It is a linked system.  We are told that when services in Navan are reduced, the other hospitals will pick up the slack if that is necessary, but at the same time one sees the budgets of those hospitals being reduced.  It does not appear that a system is being put in place that will be able to deliver.We talked to some nurses who were outside Leinster House some weeks ago.  They begged us to go and look at what they face every day in accident and emergency services and wards.  They are told to postpone appointments for people who choose elective surgery.  One might not see that as being serious but having spoken to the nurses concerned, it appears serious.  They are at the coalface trying to deliver a service in a difficult situation.Beds are being closed in hospitals and people are being left on trolleys in the same hospitals.  The Health Information and Quality Authority, HIQA, has indicated that the situation, for example, in Tallaght hospital was unsafe.  There are knock-on problems in terms of infection control when one tries to shoehorn too many people into a small space.  It cannot be described as anything other than a crisis.The recruitment embargo is a crude instrument.  Agency nurses are a much more expensive way of delivering health care but they are being used to fill gaps where there is inadequacy.  The implementation of the changes is not targeted.  That will be problematic when it comes to February when more people leave the system.  Those who retire are often at the top end who have been in place for a long time.  They are the most experienced and will be the most difficult to replace, in particular those who are on the front line.  Adequate consideration has not been given to what will happen in that regard.  The lack of step-down facilities is another concern.I was interested to read something to which this country signed up in 2006.  I refer to a TASC report, Eliminating Health Inequalities.  It states on page 26 of the report that:In 2006, the Irish government, together with its EU partners, agreed a statement of common values and principles that underpin EU health systems and provide the framework for an explicit statement of national health policy in this country.  Following the decision to exclude healthcare from the scope of the Directive requiring competition in the provision of health services within the EU, the member states acknowledged that health systems are a central part of Europe's vision of social protection and make a major contribution to social cohesion, social justice and sustainable development.In their statement, the European health Ministers pledged to protect the values of universality, equity, solidarity and access to good quality care.  It is worth elaborating on what these values mean:Universality — no one is denied access to medical care;Equity — there is equal access according to need regardless of ability to pay;Solidarity — the cost of medical care and health systems is borne fairly across society and in such a way that accessibility to all is guaranteed;Access to good quality care — medical care is safe, of a high quality and responsive to patients' needs.I know the world has changed dramatically since 2006.  The Lisbon treaty enshrines the Charter of Fundamental Rights.  We had two Lisbon treaties.  After the financial crash, people came to Ireland to tell us we needed to sign up to the Lisbon treaty.  What does the treaty say about health care?  It says:Everyone has the right of access to preventive health care and the right to benefit from medical treatment under the conditions established by national laws and practices.  A high level of human health protection shall be ensured in the definition and implementation of all Union policies and activities.We hear nothing now from the European Union about solidarity or the Charter of Human Rights.  We hear only about financial matters.  We must get back to the point where solidarity, equality and people mean something.  We must put Europe under pressure to deliver on these matters.There is a direct relationship between the €700 that will be transferred to Anglo Irish Bank in the next week and what is happening in the health services.  It is astonishing that tens of thousands of people are not out on the street, given what is happening at present.  This is a crisis and it needs to be faced up to.

The IMF came to town and we lost our economic sovereignty.  If that does not make sense to Deputy Higgins, perhaps he will have a look again.Deputy Boyd Barrett is now in competition with Deputy Higgins for hyperbole.  He talks about massacre and slaughter.  I ask him to look at the figures for Tallaght hospital.  He mentioned all the other figures.  Two weeks ago four people were lying on trolleys in Tallaght hospital.  At one stage last week, no one was lying on a trolley there.  Today's figures are as follows.  This morning 13 people were on trolleys, 11 of whom were there for less than six hours and two of whom were there for between six and 12 hours.  At 2 p.m., according to INMO figures, there were five people on trolleys.  It is not all doom and gloom.  I admit it is not great, but it is not all doom and gloom.My primary concern as Minister for Health is for the safety of patients.  I cannot stand over unsafe services and I will not stand over a return to untenable, unsustainable and irresponsible service provision.  I am working tirelessly with my Government colleagues to make sure every service we deliver is of the highest quality for the patients who need it.Changes in acute hospital services for vulnerable patients always give rise to public concern.  This concern is understandable.  Nobody wants to feel that their service is being taken away and no one wants to see what they think is a downgrading of their service.However, we are not doing any of these things.  What we are doing is seeking what is best for patients, and then how best to achieve it.  My interest is in how we improve the services we provide to patients and how to achieve this as quickly as possible.  The Opposition would like to have people believe that this is a system in chaos.  That is not the case.  Change is always difficult but change is necessary and we must not step back from that imperative.  There is nothing clearer.  The Government is working to clear policies aimed at delivering coherent changes to provide better structured and better managed, safer care in a very difficult budgetary situation.As Minister for Health, I want to guarantee equal access to health care for all in our country.  It is my view that this can only be achieved through a single-tier system, supported by universal health insurance, which ensures access based on need, not income.  There are a number of important stepping stones along the way.  These include hospital reform, including the work of the special delivery unit on waiting times and "money follows the patient" funding, with hospitals established as independent trusts.  Work is already under way in this area.Primary care reform is another key step.  The Minister of State, Deputy Shortall, will address that issue in a few moments.  We will improve and expand the capacity in the sector on a phased basis to allow for gathering of staff and other resources.  This will allow us to move from the old hospital-centred model, with its episodic, reactive and fragmented health care, and to deliver a more proactive, joined-up approach.Once the building blocks are in place, we will be ready to proceed with the introduction of universal health insurance.  This system will give patients a choice of health insurer and will guarantee that everyone has equal access to a comprehensive range of curative services, both primary and hospital care.The reform programme is a significant undertaking and should not be underestimated.  With the scope and complex nature of what is planned in mind, the Government has approved an implementation group on universal health insurance.  This group will assist in developing detailed and costed implementation proposals and will also help to push the implementation of the reform programme.The national clinical care programmes under Dr. Barry White, HSE director of clinical strategy and programmes, mark a very significant development for the health services.  The clinical programmes have three main objectives: to improve the quality of care delivered to all users of public health services, to improve access to all services and to improve cost effectiveness.The multidisciplinary, clinician-led approach of the clinical programmes is a particular strength.  Clinical disciplines can work together and share innovative solutions for greater patient benefits.  Great credit is due to those involved.  The work in the programmes also shows that there can be an appropriate expanded role for smaller hospitals and for greatly increased community-based treatment.One of my biggest concerns is about our emergency services.  It is totally unacceptable that patients have to wait hours and sometimes days to be assessed and treated at an emergency department or to be admitted to hospital.  I am also dissatisfied with waiting times for some inpatient and day procedures, and with the time some patients wait for outpatient appointments.  Long waiting times and bed access cannot be resolved within emergency departments or hospitals alone.  Emergency department difficulties must be addressed on a system-wide basis.  No part of this health service operates in isolation.Earlier this year, I established the special delivery unit in my Department.  The unit's role will be to unblock obstacles that stop patients being seen and treated quickly.  I have asked the unit to concentrate on a number of priority areas.  In emergency departments, for example, admission waiting times are currently unacceptable.  People waiting in emergency departments are the most ill and must take the highest priority.  Inpatient waiting times have been rising.  We are also focusing on this area.  The time from GP referral to an appointment with a consultant is unacceptably long in many specialties.  We do not even have accurate figures.  However, we are working on this and should have a full handle on it by April of next year.  Access time to diagnostics is also too long in many instances.The special delivery unit is already working on the emergency department issues, visiting emergency departments and examining the data.  It has identified 15 hospitals providing unscheduled care that require support.  Eight of these require very high support and the HSE has been asked for action plans to address this.  The unit will review these plans and will work closely with the hospitals to ensure that long waits on trolleys will be a thing of the past.  This week, we will see initiatives taken in the hospitals that are most in need of support, such as Beaumont, Drogheda, Cork, Galway and a number of others.The special delivery unit initiatives are designed to support medical and nursing staff in the important job they do.  Similarly we must support management, and the recent initiatives in Galway and Limerick are to do this.Smaller hospitals are to be a key part of an integrated hospital service.  They will provide a range of services safely, efficiently and as close as possible to patients' homes.  Smaller hospitals should be the cornerstone of local provision, with clear links to other services.  They should provide a range of diagnostics and expanded elective day surgery and medical procedures.  These need to transfer from the larger hospitals, freeing these facilities for more complex work.  I have no doubt that when this comes to pass and the pressure comes on the larger hospitals to let this work go to smaller hospitals we shall see more protests from various interest groups and possibly from some of the Deputies sitting opposite.

#DrJamesReilly	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-party	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-dob	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-25 00:00:00	Prelude	430	Smaller hospitals now treat small numbers of patients with complex or acutely life-threatening conditions.  It is not easy for clinical staff to maintain their skill levels in these complex cases.  As such, small hospitals have difficulties in ensuring best outcomes.  However, where it is necessary to transfer more complex services from smaller to larger hospitals, the transition must be managed.  We want to improve the quality of the service.  Key to quality will be the HSE clinical programmes, HIQA small hospital framework recommendations and the programme for Government policy on acute hospital services, including independent hospital trusts licensed by a patient safety authority and a universal health insurance health system.  Under the framework, growth in local hospitals will be in ambulatory care, including chronic disease management and day surgery, diagnostics and rehabilitation, with close links to primary health care for the local population.Smaller hospitals can deliver faster access for patients by increasing elective services in selected specialties.  In turn, larger hospitals need to utilise smaller hospitals to meet access requirements for the more complex care only they can provide.  We can and will expand the services safely delivered in smaller hospitals, in particular in day surgery, ambulatory care, medical services and diagnostics.  It makes little sense to retain all of these services and in so doing clog up larger hospitals.  This framework is the first of its kind to describe a genuine and positive role for smaller hospitals.  It will be developed further as our reforms take hold and local communities, health professionals and other stakeholders will continue to be consulted as it develops.The transformation will not be easy and will not happen overnight.  It requires good planning and positive engagement with communities.  Successful implementation of this approach means we must also transfer the right services to smaller hospitals.  Thus far, there has been the transfer of services to larger centres for reasons of safety.  We must rebalance this approach in order that smaller hospitals can develop confidence about their future roles.  The flow of activity needs to reverse for less complex work. I have in the past drawn the analogy of sending one's ten year old Volkswagen to a Ferrari testing centre which, while it will do a great job, is hardly necessary when the local garage would do the job just as effectively and a lot more conveniently.  It is important that smaller hospitals continue to provide immediate and urgent treatment in less complex, non life-threatening cases.  The expert advice available emphasises that urgent care centres can manage typical presentations to emergency departments, most of which are not complex or life-threatening.In line with HIQA and international evidence, we are implementing the best care model for complex and emergency cases, to transport seriously ill or injured patients to the centre best equipped to treat them.  Ambulance personnel are highly trained and skilled clinical staff.  They treat patients immediately at the scene and get them to the most appropriate, not necessarily the nearest, hospital as quickly as possible.  Putting in place urgent care centres with ambulance bypass protocols to bring seriously ill patients to larger hospitals is not about closing emergency services, rather it is about making services safe.  I am committed to this approach so as to ensure very ill patients have the greatest chance of survival.Emergency ambulance services are not being diminished.  Traditional work practices within the national ambulance service are changing as stations move from on-call to on-duty status.  This move to on-duty status means highly trained paramedic crews will be in the stations or their vehicles to respond to calls rather than having to be called out to the station, which is inevitably slower when responding to emergency calls.  This is a better way to provide the service and better for patients.  On-duty status allows a modern emergency response service to be provided, including paramedics, advanced paramedics, community first responders and GP out-of-hours services, working together to respond to emergencies.  This approach is consistent with international best practice and will ensure compliance with HIQA response times and quality standards.Apart from the strategic initiatives I have addressed, there is a series of positive developments to which I can point.  The new unit at St. Vincent's University Hospital, comprising 100 single rooms and provision for cystic fibrosis patients, is on target to open in April next year.  A few days ago I opened the new colposcopy unit at the Coombe Women's Hospital.  Also, resources have been made available to upgrade the hospital's theatre and labour suite to bring it up to international standards.  As I mentioned, Tallaght hospital is now operating within its monthly budget, with reduced numbers waiting in its emergency department.  Management enhancements will shortly be put in place at Limerick and Galway hospitals.  Much improved, more up-to-date information is available on waiting lists, with weekly reporting in most hospitals to the special delivery unit enabling the addressing of individuals waiting more than 12 months for procedures.  As I said previously, we are for the first time driving not in the dark but with full headlights on.  Before the introduction at Our Lady's Hospital, Navan of a money follows the patient system initiative, no patients were admitted on the day of procedure.  Currently, 80% are admitted on the day of procedure, providing for much greater efficiency.  Cappagh National Orthopaedic Hospital, in which much greater numbers are being seen, has increased its day of admission figures by 45%.On Deputy Healy's contention about smaller hospitals, I ask him to consider Louth County Hospital as a case in point.  While in 2009 there were no care of the elderly cases at the hospital, thus far in 2011 there have been 388.  The figure for haemochromatosis patients treated with phlebotomy was 535 in 2009; thus far this year it is 1,783.  In respect of colposcopy, the figure in 2009 was nil; in 2010 it was 2,083.  The number of surgery cases is up from 3,400 to 3,600; in respect of radiology, it is up from 534 to 3,000 plus, while the number of outpatient assessments is up from 933 to 974.  This is the future for the small hospital, namely, appropriate work carried out safely, rather than trying to be all things to all men, with dire consequences.Regulations to allow pharmacists to deliver the flu vaccine at much reduced cost and with increased accessibility are now in place.  Also, later this week I will sign regulations to provide for a fall in fees to GPs from €42 to €28.50.  On the catch-up programme for HPV, the cervical cancer vaccine, all girls in secondary school will be vaccinated during the next three years.The choice for the Opposition is simple: swim against the tide or join us in making the health service a place wherein patients feel safe and those who work in it can feel proud.

The motion is about reform and having a plan for the health service.  However, on reading it, one would not know reconfiguration is taking place.  Reconfiguration involves the expansion of some services and the opening of new services and facilities, a point cynically not made in the motion which is an attempt from some quarters of the Opposition to exploit people's fears in seeking a quick and cheap headline.  We need to take a reasonable approach to the health service and use proper language.  At the very least, we must recognise that we have a Minister for Health who is pioneering and wants to see change.  I am confident that at the end of his tenure in office we will have a health system that will be a changed model from the one we inherited.  The decision by the Health Service Executive to reconfigure health services in Cork city was made in November 2009, one to which my constituency colleagues, the former Minister, Deputy Martin, and the former Minister of State, Deputy Kelleher, acquiesced.  Listening to the comments of the former Minister, Deputy Martin, one would imagine he was never in government or that he had abandoned the concept of collective Cabinet responsibility.  Since the HSE announced its reconfiguration plans for Cork city, many of my colleagues and I have engaged with it.  We have arranged meetings with HSE managers and listened to them.  Many of us expressed concern about the proposed changes and how they were being communicated.  I have been told by HSE management in Cork that there will be an independent assessment of the new services to determine if they are delivering improved health care.The motion refers to the closure of the accident and emergency department at the Victoria South Infirmary Hospital.  What it does not mention is the opening in December of an acute medical unit in Cork University Hospital, the opening in 2012 of a surgical assessment unit in the same hospital, the opening of an urgent care centre at St. Mary's Orthopaedic Hospital, the opening in December of a regional pain management service at the Victoria South Infirmary Hospital, the doubling of orthopaedic surgery capacity at Cork University Hospital and the return to that hospital of paediatric orthopaedic surgery services, which service was abolished by the previous Government.

As a member of the south-west regional health forum, I am aware that reconfiguration has left people less confident about the health service and that there is concern about HSE management at local and national level.  The lack of political leadership during the past 14 years has eroded trust and confidence in the ability of the HSE to deliver change.  That is why we will see change under the Minister's stewardship.  We need to see independent verification of any changes and independent verification of claims by the HSE that proposed changes will result in improved delivery of services.I have concerns about the creation of centres of excellence, in particular in regard to Cork University Hospital, which is overstretched.  However, I am willing to listen.  HIQA should get involved in this process as it would offer people much needed reassurance on the quality of services provided.The Minister has been in office for just over seven months.  It is politically wrong to blame him for every problem and earlier we heard rhetoric about war zones and crises.  The Minister understands that reform of the health service is needed and he is driving that reform.  That is why he has proposed radical changes in how the health service is delivered.  Those opposite may be cynical and make smart comments but they should give the Minister an opportunity to drive that change, which has not happened for 14 years.  We had a series of Ministers who sat at the Cabinet table, hid behind collective responsibility and did not deliver change.I am happy that change will occur.  It will not happen overnight or in seven years.  If one talks to health care professionals and people working in the health service, they will tell one that morale is low and that change is needed but they are confident that we have a Minister who, and a Government which, will drive that change.Everybody will not be happy.  Stakeholders by their nature have vested interests and they will not all be happy because they will have to stand by their positions in their little kingdoms or fiefdoms.  There will be opportunities for those opposite to jump up and down in their seats, to go out on the plinth and to lead delegations and mass protests.The treatment of people and health matter.  This Government is a reforming one.  It has been in office since last March and not for 14 years.  In 14 years time, we will have a different health system which has at its core quality health care delivered to the people who matter most.

They must show us what they are about.What do they believe is the role of paramedics or rapid response ambulances?  Do they believe we should be reactive and react after something happens, like when an accident and emergency department closes or do they believe we should be proactive and get these ambulances, with the appropriate paramedics, to parts of the country where they can make a difference, as per what the Minister discussed?  They have nothing to offer on an issue such as that and have nothing to say about air ambulances or about upskilling GPs to work in accident and emergency, as is happening in Ennis hospital currently.  They have nothing to say about upskilling GPs to deal with emergencies on the side of the road——

They have absolutely nothing to say about those matters.Neither have they anything to say about the way we are changing the role of pharmacists, GPs and practice nurses to deal with chronic care management.  The Minister and the Minister of State, Deputy Shortall, have a vision in this regard but those opposite have nothing to say.  These things matter to patients and the people they claim to represent.Balancing the needs of local communities and access to urgent care with the expectation of how health care professionals believe their patients should be protected can be tricky at times.  People who genuinely care about patients do not see the idea of an accident and emergency unit at every crossroad as a way forward.  Medicine is changing quite rapidly and we must keep up with those changes, as outlined by the Minister in his contribution.  These are the sort of things the Members opposite should be able to discuss.None of the accident and emergency departments they discussed has any long-term future if it remains as it is now.  They must change to have a long-term future.  If they do not understand that, they do not understand the health service at all.  They are changing dramatically as we speak.If in a few years time when I am back in general practice, the things that will matter to me are those about which the Minister spoke, namely, admission waiting times in accident and emergency departments, inpatient waiting times, the time between a GP referring a patient for an appointment and the patient seeing the consultant and getting proper access to diagnostics.  They are the sort of things I would like to talk about and not the rot we listened to earlier.
#RoisinShortall	unknown-#RoisinShortall-party	unknown-#RoisinShortall-dob	unknown-#RoisinShortall-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-25 00:00:00	Prelude	443	I am glad to have the opportunity to contribute to this debate.  As my colleague, the Minister, already stated, our main concern and that of this Government is the safety of patients.  We will not stand over unsafe services.  We have been clear about that from the very beginning.  We are working hard within Government to ensure that safe and appropriate health services are delivered in the most appropriate setting.This Government recognises the important role of smaller hospitals in local communities.  We believe they represent, and will continue to represent, a fundamental element of an integrated health service in their regions providing as wide a range of treatment and care as possible.  The future of health care delivery is about delivering appropriate care in the appropriate setting.  This will mean that some services will move from smaller hospitals to larger ones but it will also mean that services will move from larger hospitals to smaller ones.  In future, we will be sure that smaller hospitals will deliver appropriate and safe care for the communities they serve.  Access for GPs to services and diagnostics will form a crucial part of the development of the role of smaller hospitals.In considering the motion, it is important to state that apart from the very many reforms which are already under way and which the Minister outlined, primary care and its development is an essential component of health service reform and in the delivery of the most appropriate care as close to the patient as is possible.  In a modern and responsive health care system, up to 95% of people's day-to-day health and social care needs can be met in the primary care setting.  Deputy Healy made that point earlier, and that is our intention.  They are the kind of reforms towards which we are working.It is interesting that the motion refers to things that happened as far back as 1980 and in 2008 and 2009.  We have a legacy of a lot of bad decisions which were made by the previous Government.  We are setting about reversing them, addressing those past mistakes and introducing the kind of fundamental reforms our health service requires.We intend to further develop services in the community so that everyone has direct access to integrated multi-disciplinary primary care teams of general practitioners, nurses, physiotherapists, occupational therapists and others.  These primary care teams will be supported by a wider range of professionals, including pharmacists, dieticians, psychologists and chiropodists.  That will all happen within a health care network.We intend to develop integrated services in which patients have access to a range of primary care services within their communities, preferably in modern buildings.  This is what the public wants and deserves.  It makes sense from a health point of view and gives value for money.  We are determined to deliver this type of modern, responsive health care system.We want to develop and strengthen the number of primary care teams that are in place and I intend to build on the progress already made in respect of the primary care strategy.  In addition, the programme for Government commits to the removal of cost as a barrier to accessing primary care services.  The clear commitment is for the delivery of free access to GP care within the Government's term.  This will be my main job as the Minister of State with responsibility for primary care.  The delivery cannot be done overnight.  Rather, it must be done incrementally so as to build capacity in the system.  We are working in this regard.  We also need a separate delivery structure for primary care within the health system so that it does not compete with other demands.  We need a ring-fenced budget for primary care.  Side by side with that will be key reforms, such as the roll-out of chronic disease programmes.  These factors have the potential to transform our health services radically.I am sorry to disappoint the Members opposite, but we will not be handing over the health system to the privateers——

We intend to reverse the privatisation of the health system introduced by the Ahern-Harney Government.  This was our Government's first statement on health policy.  It is naive and misleading of Deputies to suggest that money will solve the problems in the health service.  If money was the solution, the problems would have been solved long ago.  We need fundamental reform.  We recognise the system's dysfunction to which Deputy Catherine Murphy referred and we are determined to bring about a fundamental reform to provide the modern and responsive health system that the public is entitled to expect.

There will be ideological debates and differences over how to provide that care, but the Minister and Deputies opposite referred to the fundamental issue, namely, that we should have an honest debate on what we are trying to achieve, how to provide primary care and how to fund health care, be it through universal health insurance or otherwise.The Minister has only been in Government for a short period, some eight months, but his transformation and that of the parties opposite has been chameleon-like, given the differences between their remarks in the Chamber now and only a short while ago.  We should have an honest debate on what was said previously and what is being said today.  I filled in for Ministers for Health and Children and answered questions while I was on the other side of the House.  Roles have been reversed, but I am listening to some of the same answers.The closure of hospital beds is a fundamental issue.  As recently as last year, the Minister stated that bed closures kept people on trolleys or at home in severe pain.  Beds are being closed daily.It has been suggested that the Opposition does not have a role to play in holding the Government to account, but we must hold the Government to account by highlighting the inadequacies in hospital services and health care provision.  We must also hold people on the opposite side of the House politically accountable for their statements and decisions.I am a fair person and will adjudicate on the longer term.  In the short term, the Government has not made a good start.  The Minister has rescinded numerous solemn commitments that he gave while on this side of the House and while traipsing across the country promising people the sun, moon and stars.  If there are concerns in the country and an opposition to reconfiguration, they were sown by the Minister and no one else.  He consistently promised that, if he was elected, accident and emergency services in all hospitals would be defended, there would be more beds and more hospitals would be built.  None of this has come about.Roscommon County Hospital is an example of an appalling U-turn.  The people of Roscommon were given a cast iron commitment that their accident and emergency services would be retained and enhanced.  Besides sacking the board of the HSE, the Minister's first decision was to close those services.  He hid the closure under the guise of hospital safety, but when issues about Portlaoise hospital arose, the Government had a different view.  It can rubbish one report but must commit itself to another.  There are glaring inconsistencies in the policies emanating from the Government.Patient safety is paramount, as the Minister of State, Deputy Shortall, stated.  I assume every Deputy is for patient safety.  If so, the Minister's commentary while on this side of the House was reckless.  Everything he is doing now in the interests of patient safety is the exact opposite of what he stated he would do while in opposition.  For example, he was going to retain accident and emergency services across the countryside.Let us have an honest debate.  I addressed the Seanad numerous times about the reconfiguration of hospital services in County Wexford.  Are local Deputies now fully supportive of those proposals?  Often——

The Minister does not need to worry about those of us on this side at all.  At the very least we are obligated to hold people to account for the commitments they make during elections and the formation of Governments.  This Government's start to date has not been great.Cork was mentioned.  I defended the reconfiguration of hospital services in Cork while in Government and I will defend them today, but I never slouched around Cork city making empty promises.  The people of Cork were given a solemn commitment to the effect that orthopaedic services would remain with St. Mary's Orthopaedic Hospital.

As a medical practitioner, the Minister knows full well the difference between those and other services.  The commitment was that orthopaedic services would remain with St. Mary's on the north side of the city while all other health services would remain with the other hospitals.  I knew at the outset that it was an empty promise, yet it was made by people who also knew.  The rigamarole that followed saw an independent review group set up to examine the issue quickly.  It threw its eye over the reconfiguration plans and recommended the removal of orthopaedic services to South Infirmary-Victoria University Hospital, which is now under way.The suggestion is that we can now trust what the Government is telling us, but the parties' statements while in opposition differ wholly from what is occurring on the ground and the policies being implemented.  There is considerable financial pressure, but I knew about it last January and February, as did the Minister.  That he could go to Navan and promise to build a new hospital in the north east——

For example, strong, brave commitments were made about Mallow General Hospital.  The Minister and I know that the accident and emergency department in Mallow General Hospital will not be retained but promises and commitments were made that it would be retained.  The hospital will have a medical assessment unit and patients with serious injuries and illnesses will be transferred to the regional hospital in Cork.  Promises were made at local level to retain the accident and emergency department and that undermines people's confidence in how health services are delivered.On the broader issue of universal health insurance, we have heard a lot of noise about the merits of the Dutch model.  What are the riding instructions and terms of reference of the implementation group established by the Minister to deal with the implementation of universal health insurance?  The Minister said it is a long-term plan and the can has been kicked well down the road to the election following the next election.  If it will be such a fundamental change to the manner in which health services will be funded in this State, it would be appropriate for us to have sight of the terms of reference given to the implementation group and to have a debate on this issue.  Of all the provisions and pronouncements made by the Government, this is a fundamental issue regarding how our health services will be funded in the years ahead.  No one other than the members of the implementation group, and perhaps the Minister, know the terms of reference and riding instructions, when it will report back and when implementation of the new universal health insurance will take place.  The Minister should examine that and at least have a broader debate on the fundamental issue of the provision of health care in the country.The Minister sacked the board of the HSE and took personal responsibility for it for a while, but that position has now changed in that in replies to parliamentary questions we are referred continually by the Minister to the HSE.  I thank the Minister for that courtesy but he said he would adopt a hands-on approach to the provision of health care and that he would be running the HSE.  We have now been informed we will have to wait a longer period than envisaged for legislation to be brought forward to change the governance structures of the HSE, but in the meantime who is running the health services?  Is it the Minister, the Minister and the Department of Health, the HSE or who is it?  This is allowing a drift to occur in the area of policy making, policy formulation and the implementation of Government decisions.

Management change and changes of structures take seven to ten years to implement.  The idea that we will go through a huge upheaval again in the health services will only undermine the capability of whatever organisation is there to provide health services to deliver what it is meant to do.  In the meantime there must be clarity on the issue.  I know from speaking to people in the HSE that they are unsure what policy direction will be taken and who is responsible for provision and delivery of health care in this country.The national children's hospital project is a major issue to be decided on by the Government.  Many people have had varying views on its location.  The Minister expressed a view on it also and as a Deputy representing a Dublin constituency and a general practitioner, his view should be respected.  An independent expert group was set up to establish whether the Mater site was the right one and to assess its cost effectiveness.  It has reported that it is the most efficient site in terms of having a university hospital and a children's hospital on the one site.  When will the decision on this project be made?  I know it has gone before the public expenditure review group but this is a political decision.  It is a decision the Government makes.  It is not one for the public expenditure review group.

I am concerned that this project has been allowed to drift.  It is at the planning stage.  The Minister could state that if its gets planning approval, it will be built immediately, but that commitment has not been made and we are still waiting for clarity on that.  The planners should be let do their job but if the project is granted planning permission, will the building of it commence immediately?  Many people are concerned that there is not a strong political commitment to this project.I welcome the opportunity to speak on this motion.  Every area of the country has been touched by what is proposed.  I would like to speak on this matter again in time to come but I want to allow my colleague to contribute.

I thank the Minister and the Minister of State for being present.The Minister said that he feels he is driving with the headlights on and that we are no longer driving in the dark.  He should say that to the people in Cahersiveen who have lost their ambulance service during the hours from 8 p.m. to 8 a.m.  The people there will not have an ambulance service during those hours, they will not have headlights and they will be in the dark.  This region is like no other in terms of the vastness of the area the ambulance service covers.  I appreciate what Deputy Twomey stated about a first responder service and he is correct that we will have a first responder service.  The Minister should note that during the hours the ambulance service will not be available in Cahersiveen, if an accident or an incident occurs or a person becomes ill on Valentia Island, Ballinskelligs, The Glen or Portmagee, the nearest ambulance base will be in Kenmare, Killarney or Tralee.  The quickest time an ambulance can travel that journey is an hour and 45 minutes.  The first responder will go out and, one hopes, stabilise the patient, but it will take the ambulance an hour and 45 minutes to arrive on the scene of whatever has happened.  That cannot be right.  The Minister's solutions are not applicable to the entire country because of the nature of the geography of the area.  The Minister is right in his praise of the on-duty versus the on-call service for some cases but he is blatantly wrong in regard to other cases.  This is a case in point where we should retain our ambulance service at night in Cahersiveen.  We certainly do not want to see it suspended.I support the motion and thank the Technical Group for bringing it forward.  The dental clinics in Kenmare are under threat.  We have already lost the one in Dingle.  The Sláinte na Gaeltachta group would not be long telling the Minister what they think of the health service in that at a time when we have a new hospital in Dingle, we are losing our dental clinic which means that the people living in the Dingle Peninsula will have to travel to Tralee, as will the people in Kenmare and Cahersiveen.  That is wrong because the distance people have to travel for treatment is ridiculous.We are losing our call centre in Tralee and in Cork because the service is being centralised in Dublin.  We got a bad enough fright when we saw what happened to the processing of medical cards once that service was moved from Tralee.

We are facing into what may be one of the worst ever winters in our health services.  If the Fine Gael-Labour Government does not act in accordance with the commitments it gave to the electorate prior to the general election, then the situation outlined at hospitals listed in the motion, and at other hospitals, will deteriorate rapidly.There are over 1,900 public beds closed in our hospitals, yet the Minister for Health, Deputy Reilly, is in denial about this reality.On 3 October last, I asked the Minister in the Dáil if he would commence a programme of reopening public hospital beds in view of the research by the Irish Nurses and Midwives Organisation showing that 1,947 public hospital beds are currently closed.  I asked if he agreed that more beds closed means more patients suffering needlessly on trolleys and more patients waiting at home in pain due to cancelled operations.  He replied: "I do not agree that more beds closed means more patients on trolleys and more people waiting".  I then pointed out that in May 2010, after 33 beds were closed in Beaumont Hospital, Deputy Reilly, as an Opposition Deputy, stated: "More beds closed means more patients suffering needlessly on trolleys and more patients waiting at home in pain due to cancelled operations".  After less than a year in office, the Minister is already parroting the words of his predecessor, Ms Mary Harney.  Her words have become his words.The Minister's words and those of his Labour coalition partners were all very different when he was in opposition.  In The Irish Times, on 8 February 2011, Deputy Reilly stated: “We will put in place an emergency plan to accommodate the predictable surge in activity that occurs every winter”.  In that same feature his colleague, then Labour Health spokesperson, Deputy Jan O’Sullivan, said: “In the first months of Government, we will lift the moratorium on replacement of frontline staff where beds or operating theatres are closed because of a shortage of nurses, etc”.I would appreciate if the Minister paid a little attention to what I am saying.

The INMO states that this situation will deteriorate even further in the coming months as the winter period is traditionally worse in emergency departments nationwide.Pressure on the Lourdes and on Cavan General Hospital have been greatly increased by the so-called hospital reconfiguration process in the north east — the removal of services and downgrading of other services at other hospital sites in the region.  This downgrading process totally contradicts the Minister's supposed strategy of giving smaller hospitals and primary care a greater role.  The hours of the minor injury unit at Monaghan General Hospital are being cut.  The rapid response vehicle has been withdrawn from the ambulance service covering County Monaghan and north Louth.  Services have been taken away from the Louth County Hospital in Dundalk and from Our Lady's Hospital in Navan.  Clearly, these services must be restored.  Nothing less is acceptable.We had our attention drawn recently to the growing chaos in the Mid-Western Regional Hospital in Limerick where nurses were driven to industrial action, not in pursuit of better pay and conditions for themselves but for the safety of patients.  The downgrading of smaller hospitals at Ennis and Nenagh have contributed to that pressure in Limerick.

All of these proposals are under consideration and they are a further indication of what some of those within management in the HSE are prepared to do.  The Minister has taken on responsibility.  He has taken on accountability.  Those were his own words.  I ask him now to be both responsible and accountable.
#SeanKyne	unknown-#SeanKyne-party	unknown-#SeanKyne-dob	unknown-#SeanKyne-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-25 00:00:00	Prelude	491	The issue of mortgage and personal debt is having profound implications for the well-being of everyone in society and it will continue to do so for decades to come unless positive action is taken now.  I am pleased to see the Government, after such a short time in office, is recognising the severity of the problem and actively examining measures to combat it.There are few solutions to be found in apportioning blame but it must be acknowledged that there is an element of collective responsibility.  Banks lent too much and too freely in the recent past; Irish banks were pumped with money by European banks looking to cash in on the Irish property market; builders built quick and fast and, as we are now seeing, to a less than acceptable standard in some instances; some borrowers accepted mortgages too readily without fully thinking through the consequences of the onerous obligations which a mortgage brings; and the Government failed to provide a proper measure of oversight and regulation with catastrophic consequences.The new Government set up the interdepartmental mortgage arrears working group to examine methods of assisting those grappling with mortgage arrears.  It was also set up to ensure that help is provided to those who cannot pay and not to those who choose not to pay.There is a consensus, not just on the magnitude and the urgency of the debt crisis but also on the solutions to address it.  Most of those engaged in the debate believe that new, reformed bankruptcy legislation is required; most recognise that it is not only mortgage debt, but multiple sources of debt, which need to be tackled in a holistic way; and most correctly believe that the vast majority of those suffering from debt problems are genuinely unable to pay rather than simply refusing to do so.  It is these who must be supported by Government.The report is correct in concluding that a blanket debt forgiveness plan would not be practical or beneficial.  The cost of such a scheme would be colossal and, more worryingly, it could provide an opportunity for certain persons to escape their responsibilities.  It would also be extremely unfair to those with long-established mortgages who have made sacrifices for ten, 20 or more years so as to be able to pay off their home loans, and it would also be unfair on those who, for whatever reason, choose not to take out a mortgage but to rent a home instead.I fully welcome the recognition from the group that some mortgages are simply unsustainable leaving people in hopeless situations.  It is in no-one's interest that such mortgages be allowed to continue with all the negative effects over-indebtedness can have on individuals and families.  Another proposal, that of introducing a mortgage-to-rent scheme, could provide a real solution to some struggling homeowners and would allow families to stay in their homes and the communities in which they have built their lives.On the legal side of the matter, I positively welcome the Government's commitment to reform the bankruptcy law which began with the commencement of the new bankruptcy legislation on 10 October.  A non-judicial debt settlement system must form a significant component of the reforms on which the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Shatter, and his Department are working.Perhaps the one area which the group overlooks is the existing supports in place.  Ireland is quite progressive in European terms in having the Money Advice and Budgeting Service, MABS.  Some 53 locally-managed companies, guided by the Citizens Information Board, provide crucial advice and assistance to over-indebted persons.  MABS, along with other groups such as FLAC and the Society of St. Vincent de Paul, are working on the ground, hearing directly of the desperate situations.  With a wealth of experience and information, these groups are providing a message loud and clear that the Government must listen.MABS is already well established and has a proven track record in helping people.  Any new debt management and settlement system which would seek to address the totality of a person's debt, including mortgage debt, credit cards, personal loans etc., must work closely with MABS.  Further support could be provided by experts in the NGO sector who are more firmly consumer-oriented, as opposed to the banks which never have trouble finding resources to fight their corner.

The banks have been supported and would not exist were it not for the support given by the Irish people.  I welcome the Government's resolve to force the banks to co-operate, to sit down with borrowers in order to find a solution in compliance with the codes of consumer protection and conduct on mortgage arrears.  At this stage several reports have been completed and the scale of the problem is widely known and visible in communities across the country.  It is now time for urgent action to address the problem because our economic recovery depends on it.

The issue of mortgage arrears is a very serious matter which many constituents have brought to my attention over the past months.  Not only are such people in mortgage arrears but they also have high levels of personal debt, credit card, bank loans or credit union borrowings.  In fact, some have advised me that their mortgage not only purchased their house but also their car and, in some cases, their honeymoon.  The recklessness which led us to this place during the so-called Celtic tiger years was widespread.  The Government and the Financial Regulator appeared to have a total hands-off policy during this time of house-buying mania, allowing the banking system to not only loan money to people without proper scrutiny but to allow them offer unsolicited loans to customers.  Encouraging older home owners to release equity in their homes to enable the next generation to get on the property ladder was the order of the day.  It was all about commission, as far as I can see.It is staggering to learn that by June of this year, 45,000 households were in mortgage arrears for more than 90 days.  From conversations with my constituents it appears there are different types of borrower affected by mortgage debt.  First, the borrower who should never have been loaned the money in the first place, because of an unstable income stream or a low level of income which could not sustain regular mortgage payments or take any kind of loss of income.  Second, the borrower who could afford a mortgage but because of pay cuts or the loss of a partner's income, got into difficulties with payment and is also in negative equity.  Third, the speculator who may already own his or her own home or have a small outstanding mortgage but who dabbled in becoming a landlord and purchased another property to let.  The needs of these borrowers are all different and any attempt to address their situations must reflect these differences.People in this country are not sleeping at night due to the stress of their indebtedness and the potential loss of their home.

This is not right and it is appalling.  Others have told me that they want to stay in their home and they want to pay their bills but they need some assistance to do so.  Keeping people in their homes must be the cornerstone of our efforts to tackle this problem while freeing up household incomes to service mortgage debt and to get money circulating in the economy once again.  Losing homes will not benefit anyone.The credit institutions who were so helpful in lending money whether it could be afforded, must now take a collegial approach by assisting customers to restructure where possible in order to repay their loans.  Restructuring will not work for everyone and the challenge for both the Government and society is to provide help for those who need it while being cognisant of our scarce resources.To this end, some of the recommendations in the Keane report have merit.  The suggested mortgage to rent schemes in which approved housing are involved and leasing to local authorities, are interesting proposals which could provide support to more than 10,000 households.  I look forward to the Minister of State, Deputy Penrose's pilot proposals.  Trade-down mortgages, split mortgages and sale by agreement, all have their merits but each mortgage problem must be considered on a case-by-case basis.  I am most interested in hearing the views of the banks about these proposals.I commend MABS, the money advice and budgeting service, on its excellent work in assisting people to deal with their finances while acknowledging that the Keane report considers that a more specialised mortgage advocacy service is needed.  The Minister for Justice and Equality has undertaken extensive work on a personal insolvency Bill to tackle the current problems of bankruptcy and personal insolvency law without which we cannot solve the mortgage arrears problem.  I also look forward to the implementation strategy which will be set out at the conclusion of this debate by the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Justice and Equality to assist those in difficult mortgage situations.

I agree fully with the previous speaker.  This is an horrendous situation for people and all of us meet people in our clinics who are in very difficult situations.  Many find it difficult if not impossible to sleep at night and many are terrified of the situation in which they find themselves.  The vast majority, if not all, are people who want to pay their bills, who want to keep the roof over their head but for various reasons such as unemployment or a reduction in wages or working hours, find themselves unable to meet their mortgage repayments.  Many of them will go to extreme lengths to meet those repayments.  For instance, they will reduce their food bills or avoid going to the doctor.  They will do almost anything to ensure they can meet their mortgage repayments in order to keep the roof over their head.  There is something in the Irish psyche that creates a desire to own one's own home and we are prepared to pay for it.  However, many people simply cannot meet their mortgage commitments.I know of a public servant who had an affordable mortgage of €278,000.  The same apartment in the same development was on the private market for €475,000.  The owner had been able to repay the mortgage but after two reductions in pay and a pension levy and with the apartment now only worth €150,000, he is in negative equity and is put to the pin of his collar to make the repayments.This is probably one of the better cases because in many cases people are unable to meet their repayments.  A constituent contacted me today.  She has lost her job and is now in receipt of social welfare payments and is unable to meet the mortgage repayments.  I welcome this report and any contribution to this debate is welcome as we strive to solve the problem.  It is regrettable that other stakeholders in this area were not involved in the compilation of this report such as MABS and New Beginning and those who are in mortgage arrears.  The report would have benefited from such inputs.Every part of the Irish establishment was effectively telling people to get on the property ladder and that this was the time to start.  It was predicted that, at worst, the landing would be soft.  People were effectively forced to take on mortgages by the establishment, the banks and by the media, with newspapers publishing property supplements on a daily basis.  There was no talk of moral hazard when the banks were bailed out, but there appears to be a huge moral hazard with regard to bailing out mortgage holders who are in disarray and difficulty.  Properties should be revalued at current prices and mortgage repayments should be based on the current valuation.  That is the only way this matter can be solved.
#TomFleming	unknown-#TomFleming-party	unknown-#TomFleming-dob	unknown-#TomFleming-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-25 00:00:00	Prelude	499	The ongoing debate regarding arrears in mortgage repayments, personal loans and utility bills is often trivialised by some commentators who prefer to link the problem to that of over-borrowing.  People who use this simple but incomplete argument are not being thorough in their examination of the scale of the problems facing families today.A number of reports published by the European Union and the Council of Europe in recent years attribute the issue of indebtedness to unforeseen events such as unemployment, sickness or changes in family situations.  In one report, the Council of Europe concluded that a high level of consumer credit use is not necessarily an indicator of debt problems.In recent years, Ireland has experienced a severe income crisis affecting everyone.  Repayment capacity is likely to deteriorate for some time to come as a recent spate of cost increases take their toll, including increases in fuel costs, mortgage repayments, insurance costs and inflation in general.  It has been argued that Ireland must return itself to a state of competitiveness.  I agree with this policy, provided it achieves the right result and gets the country back to work.  However, in the meantime, we must accept that reducing all our wages will have a severe negative impact on some people, especially their capacity to service their debts, loans, repayments and utility bills.  There is no simple solution to the income crisis and the resulting debt crisis facing families.  I believe we must collaborate on what has been suggested up to now.  We must tease out the inter-departmental report, the Keane report, and identify what is practical and workable within it to assist the more than 70,000 borrowers in arrears, a number which is increasing rapidly and which will probably reach 100,000 within a short period.I welcome the Bill proposed by Deputy Michael McGrath, which is not before time.  As I pointed out in this Chamber last May, the Law Reform Commission report has been left gathering dust on the shelf since last December.  It should be implemented as it provides personal debt management and debt enforcement strategies and argues for the overhaul of laws that govern debt in Ireland.  Its recommendations make sense and represent a breath of fresh air in an area of law that has long been forgotten.  We still operate with laws that are antiquated with regard to dealing with debt in society.  How can we ask people to accept lower incomes and yet not change the law to address their diminished capacity to service their debts.I commend Deputy Michael McGrath for drafting realistic proposals, mechanisms and a formula to implement them.  We must have a system that deals with people individually and on a case by case basis and must deal with the crisis in a holistic manner.  We need to update the laws on personal solvency and bankruptcy.  We are in the middle of an income crisis, not just a debt crisis.  Families who are affected most need the laws that will protect them.  We must act immediately.  The Law Reform Commission recommendations and the best input from the Keane report provide the House with the means to act.  We cannot delay as protecting homes is paramount.
#JerryButtimer	unknown-#JerryButtimer-party	unknown-#JerryButtimer-dob	unknown-#JerryButtimer-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-25 00:00:00	Prelude	500	I welcome the opportunity to speak on this issue.  Last Friday week, I listened to Mr. Matthew Elderfield in University College Cork and during the course of an excellent discourse he spoke about the importance of the Central Bank and its statutory duty to protect the consumer and safeguard the stability of the financial system.  He is right.  It is the twin job of the Central Bank to mind and protect people.This is a very difficult time for people here and the issue is not just about statistics or about a report which is left on a shelf.  The issue is about ordinary citizens who are struggling, i dtrioblóid, faoi bhrú and under pressure.  I welcome the fact that the majority of people are meeting their mortgage and personal financial commitments.  However, these are extraordinary times and people in their personal and business lives are going through a medley of emotions which have huge implications for and a profound impact on the quality of their lives and those of their husbands, wives, children and communities.  These are difficult times which I hope we can overcome and there is an obligation on us all to put in place a plan to ensure this happens.A particular obligation lies on the Government, the banks, the lending institutions and borrowers to work together.  Banks, in particular, must work with people.  The Minister of State present, Deputy McGinley, will understand what I am about to say.  Our banks must not frighten and intimidate people, but must engage, co-operate, work and collaborate with people to reach an agreement.  I am not interested in the fly-by-night merchants who are trying to rip off the system or who want to renege on their debts and responsibilities.  I do not speak for them.  I speak for the ordinary man or woman who bought a house or invested in a business to create jobs and who now find themselves, often through no fault of their own, in trouble.Our banks have not helped at all.  I go so far as to say that they are telling lies to us.  They are lying to the Minister, the Government and even to their employees, because they are not working with and helping people in difficulty.  Despite the rhetoric, the statistics and the reports they publish, they are not working with people.  They must do so.  People are looking to us and to Government, the Central Bank and Mr. Elderfield.  I heard Deputy McGrath speak earlier on the Central Bank (Supervision and Enforcement) Bill.  I wish we had Matthew Elderfield earlier and a proactive regulatory system sooner, but we did not.  Fianna Fáil wants the Government to bring up workable solutions.I note that the interdepartmental working group puts forward two core objectives which are worth analysing and tweaking.  These are to assist those facing real difficulties to remain in their own homes where appropriate and to ensure a distinction between those who cannot afford to pay their mortgages and those who choose not to pay their mortgages.  Is it not an extraordinary indictment of the Government of the past 14 years that today in our cities, towns and throughout the country there are men and women struggling to remain in their homes?  I was very struck by Mr. Elderfield's remarks in UCC that the State, through its taxpayers, has already assumed too great a burden in this crisis.  These are the words of our Financial Regulator when speaking on the issue of mortgage arrears in Cork.Like unemployment, mortgage arrears are a juggernaut set in motion by the financial crisis that has shattered the hopes and dreams of so many families.  The report under discussion makes solutions and suggestions, such as trade-down mortgages, split mortgages, mortgage to rent, and a specialised mortgage advice service.  However, this must only be the starting point in developing mechanisms for dealing with mortgage arrears.  There are two distinct groups who need separate consideration in the devising of a solution to the problem, the owner occupiers and those with buy-to-let mortgages.  In June, some 7.2% of owner occupier mortgages were in arrears by more than 90 days.  That is up from 3.3% in September 2009.  This is a massive increase.  Arrears in the buy-to-let category are also increasing rapidly.  The report has urged a case by case handling of distressed mortgages.  That makes practical sense because no two loans or entities are the same and the changed financial circumstances of the borrowers will not have the same impact in each case.  However, we cannot leave it to the banks to pick a solution from a menu of options.  The banks cannot press a button and select an option.  The ultimate concern for banks will be the impact of rescheduling on their balance sheets, not the impact on the life of the borrower.  The borrower is a person, a husband or wife, a person with a family or a person alone living in a community and these events have a knock-on effect.  The Government, as the majority shareholder in the Irish banks, must use its influence to achieve equitable solutions.  It must assert its position with the banks.  Perhaps there could be a role for a mortgage advice service and, instead of simply advising, it could dictate to the banks the most appropriate form of rescheduling.  The Minister is correct when he says there are no easy options.  Whatever solution is put in place, our concern must be to enable borrowers to fully participate in society.  Whether they purchased a primary residence or a buy-to-let property, they could never have envisaged such economic devastation.  They could not have anticipated jobs disappearing, salaries being cut, personal debt accumulating and mounting mortgage arrears.We spoke about restructuring, which there is much of in our banks.  I welcome the fact that there will be a plan and that we will be able to help people.  Where borrowers actively engage with lenders, negotiating a rescheduling of the mortgage must not affect their ability to earn a living and carry on a business.  Therefore, it is imperative that the credit ratings of these people cannot be affected because of a negotiated rescheduling.  It is equally crucial that the Government, hand in hand with attacking the issue of mortgage arrears, reforms the personal insolvency legislation.  The Money Advice and Budgeting Service, MABS, makes the point that "it is counter-productive to address mortgage arrears without simultaneously seeking to manage the issue of personal debt".  The Minister for Justice and Equality has commenced reforming this area but it is also important that we do not delay in rolling out a new personal insolvency regime that facilitates people in negotiating reasonable and practicable settlements.In conclusion, mortgage arrears is a complex problem that needs careful, balanced consideration.  A solution will be difficult but we must seek a fair balance between the competing interests of the taxpayer and the social impact on the lives of those faced with unsustainable mortgages.  In saving the banks, the burden borne by the taxpayer has been great.  It is now time to ensure that our equity interest results not just in a financial return but also in a social dividend.
#CatherineMurphy	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-party	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-dob	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-25 00:00:00	Prelude	501	We waited in hope for the report on mortgage debt because we all know just how serious the issue is.  I was greatly disappointed by two major failures in the report.  One was the exclusive nature of the people who put it together and the second was the conservative nature of the report and the piecemeal solution it proposes.  Some of the measures are worth doing but it is not a solution.  It has prompted a debate in this Chamber and among other organisations.  A recent press conference at Buswells Hotel featured a number of organisations, such as FLAC, Threshold, Focus Ireland, the Society of St. Vincent de Paul, New Beginning, Northside Community Law Centre, Ballymun Community Law Centre and Respond!, outlining what they describe as nine key principles to overcome the personal debt crisis.  The Law Reform Commission report was an extensive document and had some worthwhile components, some of which have found their way into Government policy.  The organisations describe themselves as having "a strong track record of working and campaigning on anti-poverty issues including debt and credit, social housing, social welfare, homelessness and tenants' rights".  We must recognise that they are front line organisations.  Instead of highlighting the disappointments in the Keane report, I want to highlight some of the measures the document produced by these organisations identified as part of the solution.The document defines the problem as over-indebtedness, which we know.  This does not just involve mortgage arrears, we must have a much broader response.  The Law Reform Commission proposal says the same.  There must be a multidimensional response and it must be co-ordinated and strategic.  The document describes the kind of problems that lead to people being unable to pay, including loss of employment, failed enterprises, ill-health and relationship breakdown.  Some of these elements are intertwined.  People who are paying the highest amount for credit are those who can least afford it.  They often end up with sub-prime mortgages.  The lending practices facilitated by regulatory, statutory and Government inaction and indifference are highlighted by the report.  The document points out that it is not a question of people deliberately choosing not to pay but lacking the capacity to pay.  That is something I recognise because I have had such people come into my office and the fact that I have a box of tissues there permanently describes the stressed state they are in.  One person told me that she and her two children eat once a day.  Another person told me that he had to sell his home before it was repossessed.  He had put the home together brick by brick but now he has lost that and just about covered his costs by selling it.  It had been worth much more but he sold it for less.  Another person told me of having lost their business, lost their home and having debts following them.  The one thing that person wants to do is wake up without the fear one morning.  These are real people with real problems and that is why it is so disappointing that front line people dealing with these cases on a daily basis were not part of the deliberation.  Consider the peace process in the North, which only worked when we got the two sides together.  In this case, we need to get the two sides together.The document refers to a war of attrition if one only looks at mortgage debt and does not consider other debt.  Today's Irish Independent refers to “400,000 families in arrears as energy firms step up drive to install pay meters”.  That amounts to one in every four households.  One cannot look at mortgage debt alone and make arrangements for people to pay if one does not consider their ability to pay, which is linked to the amount of their indebtedness.  It is not only mortgage indebtedness.The other Bill being discussed this week also considers the lack of hard evidence on the level of indebtedness.  There is a lack of statistics on consumer credit arrears as well as rent and utility debt.  We need to find a way of quantifying precisely the extent of the debt.  The authors of the report to which I referred argue that the Central Bank should require arrears data from all lenders.  That is a positive and achievable proposal.The report also calls for an independent evaluation of current policy, with a rolling assessment, in order to ensure evidence-based, informed and responsible policy making.  The report is measured in its statement that there are no quick-fix solutions, which I accept.  It calls for a comprehensive policy framework rather than continuing merely to muddle along in the hope that the situation will improve.  That is no longer acceptable.  The report points to the consequence of continuing in this mode, including the cost for welfare budgets, the cost in terms of crime and the type of disintegration that will happen in both families and communities.  We are already seeing households under great stress in the face of unsustainable debt.Action is being taken on some of the report's recommendations, including the introduction of legislation on personal insolvency.  That Bill must be brought forward as soon as possible.  The report uses the term "settlement, not forgiveness" and makes reference to moral hazard and people being categorised as either "deserving" or "undeserving".  The authors argue that this is a shallow characterisation of such schemes as debt forgiveness.  They highlight what is available in other European countries as a norm in terms of dealing with debt problems.  We are not the first to deal with this issue and we should employ best practice in other countries.  There are other models from which we can learn.The report also refers to a debt resolution agency, something we discussed last week in this House.  The authors point out that the housing debt problem is worsening.  While one in ten households was in mortgage arrears at the end of 2010, this had increased to one in nine by March of this year and to one in eight by the end of June.  The report indicates that the average amount of arrears is €21,000.  We are heading towards a situation where people will surrender their homes rather than waiting for repossession.  I have seen evidence of that in my constituency.The blame game which casts those who purchased homes during the boom as foolish ignores the fact that there was a media consensus at the time, as evidenced by the extensive property supplements, which served to stoke the boom.  The Government encouraged people to purchase property and we were told the banks were well capitalised.  People queued overnight to secure homes in new developments and thus avoid the inevitable price increase of €10,000 or €20,000 in the next phase.  Every expert under the sun was wheeled out to urge people to get onto the property ladder.  One cannot blame people for believing what they were told from every quarter.  We must have a fair and proportionate response for those who find themselves in an entirely untenable position.  The report produced by these groups is a useful addition to the debate.
#MichaelMcCarthy	unknown-#MichaelMcCarthy-party	unknown-#MichaelMcCarthy-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcCarthy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-25 00:00:00	Prelude	502	I welcome the opportunity to contribute to this important debate on the Keane report on mortgage arrears.  The combined issue of personal debt and mortgage arrears is a significant social and economic problem facing thousands of households across the State.  The Keane report is not the Government's final response to the mortgage crisis.  Rather, it is a measure of our commitment to it.  It is a prescriptive document — a blueprint for action which sets out a suite of options to be considered by the Cabinet in the coming weeks in conjunction with various stakeholders.It is important that we infuse this debate with some element of positivity.  It is important for the people who depend on us to have a robust and mature debate in seeking a solutions-based approach to this issue.  We should not contribute to public misery by criticising all attempts to address the problem and by pandering to vested interests.  There will be many who will not welcome the solutions proposed in the Keane report.  We must stay focused.  At the heart of this problem are thousands of families under enormous pressure.  The modus operandi of Government in seeking to resolve these difficulties must have these people at its centre, not those on the periphery and certainly not those who would seek to be messenger boys and girls in this House.The publication of the Keane report is a measure of the Government's ability and commitment to tackle the mortgage and debt crisis.  It is a crisis which sees some 45,000 households in arrears of more than 90 days, including 32,000 in arrears of more than 180 days.  In addition, a further 56,000 households have restructured loans, equating to approximately 70,000 mortgage accounts.  We must consider the Keane report against the backdrop of the key and guiding principles which underpin it.  The first principle is that people in distressed situations who are making honest attempts to meet their financial obligations will not be put out of their home.  That was a key principle of the Labour Party leading up to the general election, it is a key principle of the programme for Government and a key recommendation and outcome of the publication of the Keane report.I welcome the proposals being put forward by Fianna Fáil on this issue.  I am favourably disposed to solutions-based approaches but I am taken aback by the speed with which that party has rushed to the aid of distressed mortgage holders.  Heretofore, the only solutions available to borrowers and lending institutions were forbearance or foreclosure.  The Keane report offers several possible solutions, including mortgage-to-rent schemes, trade-down mortgages, split mortgages and sale by agreement.One of the key recommendations is the early introduction of new judicial and non-judicial bankruptcy options.  The true extent of Fianna Fáil's concern for home owners was highlighted in the autumn of 2009 when the Labour Party brought forward a Private Members' motion in which we indicated that a mortgage crisis was fast approaching and called for a structure to deal with stressed mortgages.  Since then the number of people falling behind by 180 days in their mortgage payments has doubled.  On that evening, Fianna Fáil, then in Government, talked down the extent of the problem.  The stock Government response was to wait to see what happened.Further highlighting the extent of Fianna Fáil's concern is the fact that two reports commissioned by the former Government into the problem were never acted upon.  The Cooney report was published on the day the Dáil went into recess in the summer of 2010 and it was not debated in this House.   Nor were its final recommendations, which were published in November last year.  It is wildly disingenuous of Fianna Fáil Members to talk about the urgency of holding a debate on this issue when, on two specific occasions, that party refused to facilitate debate in this House.There is a growing agenda within certain circles which promotes blanket debt forgiveness.  It is in the interest of those promoting it to undermine the key recommendations and the robustness of the Keane report.  The Government, in line with the report, is crystal clear on where it stands in regard  to blanket debt forgiveness, namely, that it will not happen.  Banks are already dealing with arrears on a case by case basis.  That may be unpalatable but it is absolutely necessary.My colleague, the Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Joan Burton, has invited the various stakeholders in the mortgage and personal debt debate to a forum to be held in November.  Their views and recommendations on the Keane report on mortgage arrears are welcome and will form part of the solutions that will deal with the complex problems of mortgage and personal debt.It is incumbent on each of us in this Chamber and in the Seanad to put forward positive, solution-based approaches and not come in here and pander to an elitist circle who have no interest in seeing the recommendations of this report materialised.  This report is for people with mortgage arrears, not for vested interests.

Unlike some of the previous speakers this evening and during last week's debate on this subject, who seem to make a virtue of the fact that they are having sleepless nights about two bankers participating in the working group, out of a total of 17, I will lose no such sleep because at the end of this process it is not two bankers or 100 bankers who will decide on this document or the legislation but the people elected to this House.

I compliment the Minister for Finance because after only 20 weeks this group was up and running, so to speak, and in a limited framework of nine weeks we are here discussing it.  This problem did not arise last February or March.  As my colleague, Deputy McCarthy, pointed out, people were having a problem with mortgage debt in late 2007 and early 2008.  We should deal with facts in regard to it.This document is not a solution to every problem but for those of us in the Labour Party as part of this Government and our colleagues in Fine Gael, the bottom line is to keep people at risk of losing their family home in their homes.  Whatever about the other facets of it the bottom line is that no one will be declared homeless.  That is what this report is about, and when the legislation comes before the House it will be for all Members of the House to ensure that it is fit for purpose and that no family should be declared homeless as a result of difficulties with their mortgage.This is a compassionate document about a human problem where there are children involved, etc.  I read some of the critique of it and some people seem to have a hang-up about the possibility that some people may become council tenants.  I say to those, without naming them, that I was born in a council estate.  My parents were council tenants.  I now live in a council estate and I am proud of it.  The fear that some people may be declared council tenants is rubbish.  Have we learned nothing from the Celtic tiger years when we got carried away, and some people are still being carried away?  I look forward to the legislation and have great confidence that this Government will deliver a compassionate resolution to the difficulties of mortgage debt.
#MattieMcGrath	unknown-#MattieMcGrath-party	unknown-#MattieMcGrath-dob	unknown-#MattieMcGrath-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-25 00:00:00	Prelude	506	I, too, welcome the opportunity to record my views on the Keane report.  I do not have any hang-up about the composition of the committee referred to by the previous speaker.  It is a pity some people have a hang-up about that because it was the bankers, in the main, who got us into this mess and their expertise, if they have any left, should be sought out.  They have a role to play in that regard.I hope the Keane report will not be another report left on the shelf.  I compliment the Minister, Deputy Noonan, on setting up the working group and on the membership he chose.  I welcome the timely publication of the report and it is important that we discuss it.It was welcome to hear Government speakers say that any final decisions will be debated in legislation here and voted by Members of this House.  That is important because like previous speakers I do not want to cause a scintilla of additional concern or anguish to the parents, siblings and children of the families affected for whom this problem has become a nightmare.  We are aware that over 70,000 family units are experiencing serious problems.  That is a tragedy coming off the back of the Celtic tiger and the expectations created during that time when the flames were fanned by the media, the previous Government, most economists and everybody.  Enormous pressure was put on anybody under 30 years of age who had never known stringent times.  I have children of that age and they do not understand when we talk about the last recession and learning from our past mistakes but we have learned nothing from previous mistakes.  Accountants, solicitors, auctioneers and so on got busy and it was a case of buy the house today or it will increase by €10,000 tomorrow.  New catch words are being used such as moral hazard and people not deserving something but after we have cherry-picked parts from this report we must ensure that no family home will be taken away.  The primary family residence must not be taken from the family.An aspect of the Keane report with which I do not agree is that the bankers have got out under the wire again.  The banking system practically forced the money on people, although I accept they signed for their mortgages but when applying for the mortgage they added in the cost of a holiday, an SUV or whatever.  It was all done on a commission basis for the people behind the counter.  Many thousands of good, decent people work in the banking industry but the senior and junior managers were zealous to get extra profit for themselves.  The problem was greed, which is a horrible word.  Those people should not be let slip under the radar again.The Central Bank or the regulator must get an accurate figure in terms of the full extent of this problem and deal with it.  Blanket debt forgiveness is not a realistic option because I refer primarily to the family home.  I am not talking about people my age or younger who have 20 houses at this stage.  The word "greed" comes to mind again because those people fanned the flames of the market but the ordinary couple who wanted to get married, settle down and purchase their own house did not have a hope.  I do not know how the people who bought all the houses thought they would maintain that.   We all know people who had enough to maintain one or two but I am not talking about those people.  They have to deal with those problems and it has created a problem in their own personal situations but that is another day's work.  They were small, medium and big speculators but I am talking primarily about the family home.Some of the solutions put forward in this document are unrealistic.  I have no problem with anyone in a county council house but I have a problem where it affects a family who have been paying their mortgage for 15 or 20 years.  I do not know where the county council will get the funds to take back the houses and rent them.  That is not fair because the bank will win again.  The taxpayers and the home owners are carrying the can.

#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-25 00:00:00	Prelude	516	I am informed by the Garda Authorities that at present, there are around 50,000 applications in the course of being processed and that the average processing time for vetting applications received at the Garda Central Vetting Unit (GCVU) is approximately 9 weeks.  While there can be seasonal fluctuations, the average processing time of 9 weeks is a significant improvement on the average processing time of 12 weeks at the end of last year.There has been a substantial increase in the volume of vetting applications received by the GCVU over recent years.  The year on year increase since 2008 is as follows:2008200920102011 (to 30/09/11)218,404246,194291,938228,454I am very conscious of the need to keep the time required to obtain a vetting to the minimum possible.  Since taking office I have taken a number of initiatives with a view to achieving this objective.In that regard, the sanction of the Department of Finance was obtained to retain the services of 10 temporary employees working in the GCVU.  A further sanction was obtained to engage an additional 10 temporary employees and these have recently commenced work in the GCVU.  That brings the staffing levels in the GCVU to 102.  This is composed of 5 Gardaí, 76 full-time Garda civilian personnel and 20 temporary civilian personnel.  The Unit is headed by a Garda Superintendent.  This represents a very significant increase in the level of personnel assigned to the unit, which stood at only 13 before the current process of development in Garda vetting began in 2005. All of this should have a positive impact on processing times.  I am looking at other options which may assist further in reducing processing times.
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-25 00:00:00	Prelude	517	I am informed by the Irish Prison Service that there were 4,275 prisoners in custody on 20 October, 2011 against a bed capacity of 4,510.  This represents an occupancy level of 95%.  The information requested with the breakdown per prison is set out in the attached table.As the Deputy may be aware, there has been a consistent increase in the total prisoner population in Ireland over recent years, with dramatic increases in the number of sentenced prisoners, those being committed on remand and a trend towards longer sentences.  The problem of prison overcrowding therefore remains a challenging issue which unfortunately cannot be resolved overnight.I share the view of the Thornton Hall Review Group that decisive action is required on a number of fronts in order to address the problem of overcrowding and poor physical conditions particularly in Mountjoy and Cork Prisons.  As the Deputy will know, the Government has decided in principle to proceed with the construction of new prison facilities at Thornton Hall and also at Kilworth, County Cork, albeit on a much smaller scale and design to that previously envisaged. The timeframe for this project is currently being discussed in the context of the Government's discussions on capital spending priorities for 2012.The State has also been engaged in an ongoing capital programme with almost 600 additional prisoner spaces constructed and brought into use since January 2008.  There are a number of ongoing projects, most notably the construction of a new accommodation block at the Midlands prison.  This will provide a potential 300 spaces, a new kitchen and work training/education block, and an extension to the visits/reception areas.  It is planned to have the new block fully commissioned by mid 2012.  An administrative building on the Dóchas site has also just been converted into a new accommodation block which will provide 70 spaces.  These will become operational next month.InstitutionBed CapacityNumber in Custody% of Bed CapacityMountjoy (m)590588100%Mountjoy (f)105117111%St. Patrick’s21718686%Cork272281103%Limerick (m)290293101%Limerick (f)342779%Castlerea351356101%Cloverhill43141897%Wheatfield70067997%Portlaoise35925671%Arbour Hill148149101%Midlands61659897%Training Unit12711389%Loughan House16011069%Shelton Abbey11010495%Total4,5104,27595%
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-25 00:00:00	Prelude	518	Following examination of the final report provided by the National Commission on Restorative Justice my Department, through the Probation Service, introduced a scheme to test a range of restorative interventions for adult offenders based on the recommendations contained in the report.The scheme involves the expansion of both the Nenagh and the Tallaght projects.  The Nenagh Community Reparation project has been expanded into Districts Courts in Tipperary Town, Borrisokane and Roscrea.  The Tallaght based project has been expanded to the Criminal Courts of Justice and to Courts in South Co. Dublin.The objective of the scheme is to build the foundation for the implementation of a robust restorative justice model of practice providing an alternative to a prison sentence of less than 12 months duration.  This will test the model's ability to manage up to 100 adult offenders by Community Reparation and up to 300 by the Restorative Justice Service.The Probation Service will monitor, oversee, and evaluate the implementation of the scheme and will provide a report on the effectiveness and value for money of the model after a 12 month operational period.  The Deputy can be assured that my focus is to encourage the use, to the greatest extent possible, of the menu of non-custodial options available to the courts.  I believe the restorative justice concept has a place in that range of available options.

I replied that serious consideration is being given to granting such recognition.I am aware of the long-standing wish of some Travellers that such status be granted but equally that there is no unanimity among Travellers about this issue.  The previous Government was of the view that Travellers are not an ethnic minority.I am aware that dialogue between staff of my Department and representatives of Traveller organisations has taken place on the issue, most recently on 11 November 2010 during the course of a seminar on the third State report under the Council of Europe Convention on National Minorities.  Consideration is ongoing and I intend that the question will be before the Government for decision as soon as possible.
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-25 00:00:00	Prelude	520	As indicated in the Government Legislation Programme announced by the Chief Whip on 14 September 2011, the Judicial Council Bill is in the course of being drafted with a view to being published in early 2012.  As well as providing for the establishment of a Judicial Council which will promote excellence and high standards of conduct by judges, the proposed Bill is aimed at providing a means of investigating allegations of Judicial misconduct supported by the establishment of a Judicial Conduct Committee.  Both the Council and the Committee are to include lay representation.The appointment of judges is, and in my view should remain, a separate matter. Judges are appointed by the President on the advice of the Government.  At present, such appointments are dealt with by the Judicial Appointments Advisory Board which was established pursuant to the Court and Courts Officers Act 1995. Under Section 16 of the Act, where a judicial office stands vacant or before a vacancy in a judicial office arises, the Advisory Board submits to me, as Minister for Justice and Equality, the names of all persons who have informed the Advisory Board of their wish to be considered for appointment to that vacancy and the names of at least seven persons whom it recommends for appointment.  I then bring the names to Government. Section 17 of the same Act provides that these procedures shall not apply where the Government propose to advise the President to appoint a serving judge.  I have asked officials at my Department to undertake a review of the current process of judicial appointment, with particular reference to the practice in other jurisdictions.  That review is ongoing and I do not wish to prejudge its outcome — I will be returning to the matter when the review is complete.
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-25 00:00:00	Prelude	521	I am informed by the Garda authorities that, following a formal complaint made to An Garda Síochána, investigating gardaí searched the home of the person referred to by the Deputy under warrant in June 2010 and seized a number of items as part of their investigation.  The person was subsequently arrested on suspicion of having committed an offence of harassment under section 10 of the Non-Fatal Offences Against the Person Act 1997.  An investigation file was forwarded for directions to the Director of Public Prosecutions.  In April 2011, the DPP directed no prosecution against the person at that stage.  The person subsequently contacted investigating Gardaí seeking to have his property returned.  Following review of the matter by An Garda Síochána, the property was returned in September 2011.The person subsequently complained to the responsible Chief Superintendent in respect of the complaint originally made against him.  He declined to refer his complaint to the Garda Síochána Ombudsman Commission.  He requested that it be dealt with by the Chief Superintendent, who explained the nature of the complaint against him that was the subject of the Garda investigation.  The Chief Superintendent responded in writing to the person on 5 October, 2011.I am informed by the Garda authorities that local Garda management is satisfied that there is no basis for the complaints being made by the person.  It remains open to the person to contact the Garda Síochána Ombudsman Commission.
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-25 00:00:00	Prelude	522	I receive regular updates on the implementation of the Inspector's recommendations.  The Inspector himself recognised that in certain areas prisons will not be able to comply with all the recommendations in the short term.  As long as there is overcrowding and limitations on resources there will be difficulties in achieving full implementation.However, progress is being made.  To give examples, issues raised by the Inspector regarding the general cleanliness of prisons including the need for broken fittings to be replaced are being addressed by the Governors of each institution.  A programme for painting and cleaning is in place in each prison and those programmes are sufficient to meet the needs of that prison.Areas mentioned by the Inspector include the use of special cells, prisoners' complaints and the procedure to be followed following deaths of persons in custody.  New procedures have been adopted and will be supported by changes to the Prison Rules which have been drafted.  These are being finalised in conjunction with the Office of the Attorney General.The Inspector also referred to minimum standards for prison accommodation and the regimes and services that should be provided.  The Government, as you know, is committed to the elimination of slopping out in prisons.  The upgrade of more than 100 cells at Mountjoy Prison, including the installation of in-cell sanitation, will be completed by the end of this month.  The Irish Prison Service will then consider the feasibility of installing in-cell sanitation in the remaining cells of Mountjoy and to other facilities elsewhere.  The completion of the Midlands Prison extension and the provision of 70 extra dormitory style spaces in the Dóchas Centre will mean that 80% of the prisons estate will have in-cell sanitation by mid 2012.The Inspector also recommended the creation of dedicated committal areas and vulnerable persons units in each closed prison.  The Irish Prison Service is looking at all options available to implement these recommendations where they are not already in place.In relation to the Inspector's recommendation that drug free units be established in each closed prison to accommodate drug free prisoners, I can advise that Arbour hill, St. Patrick's Institution, the Training Unit and Wheatfield Prison already have drug free wing/landings or areas within their prisons.  A drug free unit in Mountjoy Prison will become operational before the end of the year.  The template developed for the operation of this unit should have application across many of the closed prisons where the development of a drug free unit is warranted.  To this end, the Health Care Directorate, working in conjunction with prison management, is looking at the options for the development of drug free areas in closed prisons.

The Garda Síochána Act 2005 consequently makes provision for this and the CSO has established a dedicated unit for this purpose.  Following the setting up of the necessary technical systems and auditing of the data from which the statistics are compiled, the CSO is now compiling, publishing and responding to queries regarding recorded crime statistics.  I have requested the CSO to provide the detailed statistics which he has sought directly to the Deputy.Detection rates vary, depending on the types of offences involved, with, for example, an 83% rate for homicides in 2010.  I fully support the efforts of An Garda Síochána to maintain detections at as high a level as possible.
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-25 00:00:00	Prelude	524	The Garda Computer system, PULSE, has the capacity to generate automated letters to victims of crime.  PULSE letters are sent when a crime is reported to An Garda Síochána. It contains the name of the investigating Garda, how to contact the Garda, details of the PULSE incident number and the number of the National Crime Victims Helpline or Irish Tourist Assistance Service as appropriate. A second PULSE letter is sent to an injured party where a person has been made amenable for the crime, including where a person has been charged, summonsed, dealt with by Adult caution or under the Juvenile Diversion Programme.PULSE letters improve communications with victims of crime through the provision of information and by providing reassurance that their report is being dealt with by An Garda Síochána. The general feedback from victims and victim support organisation has been positive to the PULSE letters.It can be seen from the table circulated that the number of letters issued in the first two quarters of 2011 was pro rata 11% greater than the number of letters issued in 2010, and was 26% greater than in the first two quarters of 2009.I am circulating a table containing the information requested.DivisionYear2009Quarter 3 & 4*20102011Quarter 1 & 2Cavan/Monaghan1,0412,1231,086Clare5201,656655Cork City1,7003,8832,101Cork North5891,417896Cork West463981663D.M.R.

The Garda Commissioner is therefore quite properly reviewing all aspects of the Garda Síochána's policing model, so as to ensure that Garda resources are managed and deployed in the most appropriate manner to meet existing and emerging policing requirements.The Garda Commissioner's review will examine all aspects of current policing, including the deployment of personnel, the utilisation of modern technologies and the operation of Garda stations.While no decision has been taken, clearly the reduction in public opening hours in some Garda stations, and the closure of other Garda stations, will be issues that the Garda Commissioner will have to address as part of the review.  He may well have to consider whether, in appropriate cases, a better policing service could be delivered to a local community by having Garda members out on patrol rather than in a station.I will very carefully consider the outcome of this review and the Commissioner's policing plan for next year with the objective of ensuring that priority is given to the maintenance of front-line services.

Recorded seizures of methamphetamine by An Garda Síochána and the Revenue Customs Service, as recorded by the Forensic Science Laboratory,  for the years 2007-2011 (up to 30 September, 2011) are set out below.I am further informed by the Garda authorities that a recent seizure of methamphetamine at Dublin Airport was found to be in crystal form. However, the Garda National Drugs Union is of the opinion that this was an isolated seizure and is not indicative of a new or developing phenomenon with regard to this drug.The Health Service Executive has also advised that the number of persons currently presenting for drug treatment services who report any use of crystal methamphetamine remains very small.  That said, as the Deputy has highlighted, misuse of methamphetamine remains a significant part of the international drug problem and its abuse can result in extremely harmful  medical and social consequences.  We must therefore continue to monitor the drugs situation as it occurs so as to identify any emerging trends.As the Deputy may be aware an Early Warning Emerging Trends Sub-Committee, under the auspices of the National Advisory Committee on Drugs (NACD), is in place to monitor emerging trends in problem drug use in this jurisdiction.  Representation on this Committee includes a range of State departments and agencies including my own Department and An Garda Síochána.I  am informed that An Garda Síochána is acutely aware of the dangers associated with this drug. In 2007 the Garda National Drugs Unit hosted an international seminar, under the EU-funded AGIS Programme, to examine the potential threat posed by methamphetamine within the European Union.An Garda Síochána remains committed to tackling the supply of all drugs at all levels in keeping with its commitment to the National Drugs Strategy.  An Garda Síochána in liaison with the Customs authorities and its European counterparts, will continue to closely monitor the availability of drugs including methamphetamine within this jurisdiction, based on an on-going analysis of intelligence and drug-seizure data.YearQuantity2011*1.378 kg (34 cases)2010404 g (20 cases)20091.213 kg (27 cases)20084.7k gs (26 cases)200710 g (5 cases)*(up to 30 September 2011)
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-25 00:00:00	Prelude	528	I assume the Deputy is referring to the announcement I made last week concerning a consultation process to help inform the future direction of legislation on prostitution.  For ease of reference, I am appending the text of the relevant press release and trust that it explains the position in this matter.Minister Shatter announces publication of his Department's report on Sweden's legislation to combat prostitution and human trafficking17 October 2011The Minister for Justice, Equality and Defence, Mr. Alan Shatter T.D., today announced publication of a report of the Department of Justice and Equality on Sweden's legislation criminalising the purchase of sexual services — often referred to as the "Swedish model".In July, 2010 Sweden published the findings from the first formal evaluation of its 1999 ban on the purchase of sexual services. In September last year, the Dignity Project arranged a visit to Sweden by a group which included representatives of what was then the Department of Justice and Law Reform and An Garda Síochána to meet officials and experts in this area and to discuss the Swedish legislation and its operation. Following the visit, a report was prepared by the Department for the then Minister, and after consideration by him it was submitted to the Attorney General's Office.Since then Minister Shatter has carefully examined the report and the advice subsequently received from the Attorney General.Announcing publication of the report, Minister Shatter stated "I am determined to ensure that everything that can possibly be done to combat prostitution and human trafficking will be done. However, it will be recognised that any proposal to criminalise the purchase of sex within our legal and constitutional framework raises complex issues and would have to be considered very carefully. Also, it is inevitable that there will be conflicting views about such a proposal and representations made to me in this matter reflect different and genuinely held views. There has been much media coverage on these matters and, in order to help inform public debate, I have decided to put my Department's report into the public domain."Minister Shatter also said:"I am concerned to ensure that public debate on this issue is open to the widest possible audience. I therefore intend to arrange a consultation process to help inform the future direction of legislation on prostitution". A consultation document to facilitate this process is being prepared and the Minister will make a further announcement shortly.The report is available on the Department's website www.justice.ie.
EndsNote to EditorsThe Dignity Project was an EU funded, inter-agency and inter-jurisdictional research project which examined services provided for victims of human trafficking with a view to replicating best practice models in partner countries. Led by the Dublin Employment Pact and the Immigrant Council of Ireland, Dignity concluded its work at a final conference held in February, 2011.Legislation introduced in Sweden in 1999 provides that a person who obtains or attempts to obtain a casual sexual relation, in any place, in return for payment commits the offence of purchase of sexual service.In Ireland, traditionally the law has had two objectives. Firstly, it is aimed at protecting society from the more intrusive aspects of such activity from a public order perspective. For that reason, under the Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Act 1993, which codified the law relating to prostitution, it is an offence to solicit in a street or public place for the purposes of prostitution. The offence can be committed by the client, the prostitute or a third party — a pimp, for example. The second objective of the law on prostitution is to protect prostitutes from exploitation. Accordingly, under the 1993 legislation, it is an offence to organise prostitution, coerce or compel a person to be a prostitute, knowingly live off the earnings of a prostitute, or keep or manage a brothel.In this jurisdiction, it is not an offence, in itself, to sell sex. In general, it is not an offence to purchase sex either. However, the Criminal Law (Human Trafficking) Act 2008 made it an offence to knowingly solicit or importune a trafficked person, in any place, for the purpose of prostitution.
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-25 00:00:00	Prelude	529	As I have previously informed the House, the majority of the Fines Act 2010 has been commenced.  It is particularly important to note the commencement of Section 14 of the Act, which for the first time placed an obligation on the court to take account of a person's financial circumstances before the amount of a fine, if any, to be imposed.Implementation work is continuing on two key sections of the Act.  Section 15 provides for the payment of fines by instalment. There are a number of practical and technical issues required to commence this provision. As the Deputy will appreciate, the current system of payment allows only for a single payment in respect of each fine to be made within a specified period and this payment is recorded on the Courts Service IT system, the Criminal Case Tracking System (CCTS).  In order to allow for a fine to be paid by instalments over a year or in certain circumstances longer as the Act provides, it is necessary for the system to be substantially modified to allow for the payment of instalments and to ensure that such instalments are accurately recorded and tracked.In that regard, I met with the Courts Service management and informed them of this Government's commitment to ensuring that payment by instalments is introduced as speedily as possible. I requested the Courts Service to consider the matter and to report back with implementation proposals before the end of October 2011. The Courts Service has now reported that work has commenced on the development of the specifications of the necessary changes required to the CCTS to facilitate implementation. The Service is also in the course of establishing a Project Board, which will be representative of the relevant business units, to oversee the development of the CCTS enhancements. Subject to funding availability, it will take approximately 12 months to complete the administrative and technical modifications required.Section 16 of the 2010 Act will require a judge, consequent on determining that a fine is to be imposed, to make an order appointing an "approved person", commonly referred to as a receiver, to recover the fine in the event of default.The Courts Service is engaged in discussions with the Revenue Sheriffs, who have relevant experience through their work in the recovery of outstanding tax liabilities on behalf of the State, with a view to Sheriffs being nominated as approved persons.  Again, some IT enhancements will be necessary in order to allow for the electronic transfer of recovery orders and data exchange with the receivers. This work will take approximately six months to complete and will be done concurrently with the other enhancement works already mentioned.I should also point out that my Department is currently examining a number of proposed amendments to the 2010 Act which may be necessary to address some practical issues in terms of implementation.  The Government remains committed to implementing the remaining provisions of the Fines Act 2010 as speedily as possible.

I will, of course, continue to keep the Act in question under review.
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-25 00:00:00	Prelude	531	Tackling serious crime including drug trafficking remains a key ongoing priority both for the Government and for An Garda Síochána.These priorities are clearly reflected in the Garda Policing Plan for 2011. A key action in the Plan is the proactive targeting by An Garda Síochána of drug trafficking, including low-level drug dealing.Under the direction of the Assistant Commissioner at An Garda Síochána's National Support Services, the Garda National Drugs Unit and the Criminal Assets Bureau are pursuing their respective remits.As part of this structure, a strategic partnership has been established between the Garda National Drugs Unit and the Criminal Assets Bureau to particularly target those criminals and criminal groups believed to be deriving profits and assets from drug-related criminal activity.In addition, the  Criminal Assets Bureau continues to utilise the services of criminal assets profilers located in Garda Divisions throughout the country. The Bureau uses the valuable local knowledge supplied to them by these profilers to target the assets of known drug dealers in local communities.The role of the Criminal Assets Bureau in tackling those involved in drug dealing, and the Bureau's focus on middle and lower ranking criminals, was acknowledged during the public consultation process which informed the development of the National Drugs Strategy 2009-2016.With regard to further initiatives, the Deputy will be aware that the Programme for Government includes a commitment to strengthen the powers of the Criminal Assets Bureau in relation to the forfeiture of the proceeds of crime.In this regard, an Expert Group, has been established under the auspices of my Department, to review the operation of the Proceeds of Crime legislation with a view to identifying possible improvements which would serve to enhance the powers of the Bureau. When that work concludes I will bring forward my proposals in the normal way.

I will, in due course, make known the report's findings and any proposals which may arise.
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-25 00:00:00	Prelude	534	The Maritime Analysis and Operations Centre, Narcotics (MAOC-N) was established pursuant to an international agreement concluded on 30 September 2007 between Ireland, the Netherlands, Spain, Italy, Portugal, France and the United Kingdom.The impetus for this regional initiative was a concern that the analysis of dug imports, in particular cocaine imports  from South America into Western Europe, had shown an increase in illicit drug trafficking by sea and air across the Atlantic to Europe and the West African Seaboard. Furthermore, there was a concern about the difficulty in obtaining timely information for actions in this field.The purpose of the Centre, which is based in Lisbon, is to facilitate cooperation in the suppression of illicit drug trafficking across the Atlantic towards Europe and the West African Seaboard, with the possibility of extending its operations,  inter alia, into the Western Mediterranean basin.  The functions of the Centre are collecting and analysing operational information, enhancing intelligence through better information exchange, and ascertaining the availability of assets to facilitate interdictions in accordance with the national laws of the Parties.The Centre's work is primarily focused on intelligence exchange and cooperation between the Parties leading to the interdiction of large maritime and aviation drug shipments and the severing of links between transportation networks and the shore based command and control personnel.All Parties to the Agreement are members of the Centre. The Executive Board of the Centre is comprised of a representative from each of the Parties. In addition, all of the Parties have national drug liaison officers stationed in the Centre who can assist in the exchange of intelligence with the other State Parties and in the development of international multi-agency operations.Ireland is represented at the Centre by Liaison Officers from An Garda Síochána and the Revenue Commissioners (Customs Service). While significant funding contributions towards the centre are made by the European Commission, additional costs are borne equally by the Parties to the Agreement.The Centre has played a significant role in assisting the interception of narcotic shipments destined for the European Union arriving from the Americas. Since the Centre was set up it has assisted in 47 maritime interdictions, which resulted in the seizure of over 52 tonnes of cocaine and over 47 tonnes of cannabis.
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-25 00:00:00	Prelude	535	In response to this question, I will firstly explain the direct provision system, how it came about, why it remains a necessary feature of the State's asylum and immigration system.The accommodation of asylum seekers through the direct provision system is the responsibility of the Reception and Integration Agency (RIA) of my Department.  Direct Provision means that the State, through RIA, assumes responsibility for providing for asylum seekers suitable accommodation and certain other services on a full board basis. All accommodation costs, together with the costs of meals, heat, light, laundry and maintenance are paid directly by the State. Asylum seekers in direct provision accommodation also receive a weekly cash allowance which takes account of board and lodgings and other ancillary benefits provided through the direct provision system. Asylum seekers can also apply to Community Welfare Officers (CWO) for assistance to meet a particular once-off need by way of an exceptional needs payment under the Supplementary Welfare Allowance scheme. Payments under this category cover once-off costs such as back-to-school clothing and footwear.In addition to full board accommodation, RIA coordinates, through other Government bodies, a number of ancillary services to asylum seekers in direct provision accommodation. All asylum seekers are offered free medical screening on arrival in the State and are allowed access to health services on the same basis as for Irish citizens.  Asylum seekers in direct provision accommodation will generally qualify for a medical card whereby they are eligible to receive a wide range of health services free-of-charge including GP services and prescribed medicines. Other HSE-provided supports include Public Health Nurse (PHN) service as well as a dedicated asylum seeker psychological service in Dublin.Asylum seeker children are entitled to access free Primary and Post-Primary education on the same basis as an Irish citizen. In addition, English language supports are made available to adult asylum seekers; in some cases facilities are provided on-site in RIA accommodation centres for such classes. At a number of centres, RIA has provided facilities for on-site preschool services.As of today, RIA has 39 asylum seeker accommodation centres throughout the country. The system is a constantly evolving one, taking account of the ebb and flow of residents and of the financial resources available to RIA. Overall demand for RIA services is declining. At the beginning of 2009, RIA was accommodating an overall number of 7,002 asylum seekers. Today, it is accommodating just over 5,500 persons, a reduction of over 21% during this period.The direct provision system was a necessary response to the large numbers of asylum seekers who arrived into the State from the late 90's. Before 1999, these asylum seekers were treated as homeless under the structures then in place.  These structures were entirely unsuited to the situation facing Ireland and the homeless service of the then Eastern Health Board could not cope and there was a serious prospect of widespread homelessness among asylum seekers.In response to this serious and unprecedented challenge, the organisation which was subsequently named the Reception and Integration Agency (RIA) was established to coordinate the scheme of dispersal and direct provision for asylum seekersThe direct provision system is only one element of the State's response to its international obligations on the asylum issue. As well as educational, health and welfare costs there is the asylum determination system itself, as well as the downstream judicial and policing costs.  In the period 2005 to 2009 inclusive, the total amount spent across the whole of Government on asylum seekers was €1,275.31 million of which €424.43 million was spent on the direct provision system.  Quite clearly, meeting our international obligations in this respect consumes very considerable public monies. But Ireland is not unique in this respect.  All countries which take their responsibilities in this area seriously are faced with similar calls on their financial resources.   There are no cheaper alternatives to the direct provision system.  This was a key finding in the recent Value for Money Report on the direct provision system which was published in 2010 and is on the RIA website —www.ria.gov.ie.  In fact, if we were operating a system which facilitated asylum seekers in living independent lives in individual housing with social welfare support and payments, the cost to the Exchequer would be double what is currently paid under the direct provision system.In relation to the standard of accommodation provided in direct provision, the deputy may wish to note that all accommodation providers are required under contract to ensure that accommodation centres comply and operate in accordance with all statutory requirements of local authorities and state agencies in relation to bedroom capacity, food, food-hygiene, water supply, fire safety and general safety.In addition, all operators are required to offer menus which reflect the reasonable ethnic dietary customs of asylum seekers. There are 96 nationalities with hugely divergent food and ethnic needs accommodated by RIA at present and in all the large centres, 56-day menu cycles are in place. Other centres, depending on their size, operate 28-day and 14-day menu cycles. In addition, particular emphasis is placed on meeting, to the greatest extent possible, specific needs of asylum seekers. For example, special arrangements are made to cater for the needs of Muslims observing Ramadan.RIA independent external assessors to conduct comprehensive inspections of all centres on at least an annual basis.  These inspections are always unannounced and the inspectors look at all aspects of the accommodation centres in relation to the proprietors' obligations under the contract. These inspections cover such areas as reception, staff cover, menus, facilities being provided, maintenance of the property and fire and safety issues.  In addition, RIA has an internal Inspections Unit which conducts inspections of each of the properties used to accommodate asylum seekers at least on a twice yearly basis.  Further unannounced visits are made to accommodation centres throughout the State on a regular basis by senior management to ensure that standards are being maintained. Staff from the Agency hold information clinics on a regular basis in accommodation centres which afford asylum seekers an opportunity to comment on accommodation and operating standards and to discuss other general issues.Any diminution in standards which comes to the attention of the RIA is immediately followed up and proprietors are instructed to make any changes and improvements deemed necessary. Follow-up inspections are also arranged as appropriate.  In cases where standards stipulated in the contract have not been met and the proprietor has not made sufficient efforts to remedy the situation, the contract may be terminated.A number of asylum seeker accommodation centres have received the Excellence Ireland Quality Association mark (or equivalent) and each year, a number of them qualify as finalists and also feature as winners in the overall National Q Mark Awards. In the most recent award ceremonies (held on 14/10/2011) two centres — Balseskin and Clonakilty — received overall national awards for excellence.  RIA welcomes the recognition of standards shown by the EIQA award and the commitment shown by staff and management at the various centres towards achieving and retaining the relevant standards required.  The Deputy should note that, notwithstanding the stringency of its own contractual requirements, RIA does not oblige operators to obtain Q Marks (or equivalent).RIA staff liaise with providers of accommodation in other European countries and have visited centres elsewhere in the EU.  While no two countries accommodate asylum seekers in exactly the same way, RIA strongly contends that the treatment of asylum seekers in this country is, at a minimum, on a par with the best on offer in this context anywhere in the EU.  The direct provision system delivers a high standard of service, a consistent standard of service and value for money to the taxpayer through coordinated service delivery to asylum seekers.I do not believe that any alternative model would deliver the same level and consistency of service to asylum seekers. While the operation of direct provision is being constantly monitored, and is kept under continuous review in my Department, I have no intention of seeking a change in direct provision policy at this time.

It is responsible for coordinating the activities of the national border guards in ensuring the security of the EU's borders with non-member states. Frontex is headquartered in Warsaw, Poland.Frontex was established by Council Regulation (EC) 2007/2004. The agency started to be operational on 3 October 2005 and was the first EU agency to be based in one of the new EU states.Frontex's mission is to help EU Member States implement EU rules on external border controls and to coordinate operational cooperation between Member States in the field of external border management.  While it remains the task of each member state to control its own borders, the Agency is vested with the function to ensure that they all do so with the same high standard of efficiency.Frontex also assists EU Member States and Schengen-associated countries in the co-ordination of return flights. In the event that somebody is determined by a Member State government to be staying in that country illegally, they may be asked to leave.  Most do so voluntarily, but those who do not may be returned to their country of origin by the Member State concerned. In these cases, it is Frontex's role to coordinate repatriation activities between those countries to ensure that humanitarian standards are met and to maximise efficiency and cost-effectiveness in joint return operations.  Together with the experts from the Member States and refugee and asylum organisations, Frontex is also involved in identifying best practices in this area.The Deputy will appreciate that in light of the above clarification, Frontex is not a company and its operations in Ireland are subject to Council Regulation (EC) 2007/2004.

Furthermore, the Courts are, subject to the Constitution and the law, independent in the exercise of their judicial functions. Accordingly, I cannot intervene in any way in relation to a particular case.

A programme to fit improved modesty screens in these cells to provide further privacy from other occupants is currently under way.  Such screens have been fitted in Castlerea Prison, Cloverhill Prison and all doubled-up cells in Wheatfield.  This programme will continue to be rolled out where necessary and will be completed in 2012.
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-25 00:00:00	Prelude	539	There has been a consistent increase in the total prisoner population in Ireland over recent years, with dramatic increases in the number of sentenced prisoners, those being committed on remand and a trend towards longer sentences.   As of  20 October, 2011, there were 4,275 prisoners in custody and 755 on temporary release.  The number on temporary release equates to 15% of the total prisoner population.While measures are being taken to upgrade prison facilities and increase the range of non-custodial options available to the courts, the problem of prison overcrowding remains a challenging issue which unfortunately cannot be resolved overnight.I share the view of the Thornton Hall Review Group that decisive action is required on a number of fronts in order to address the problem of overcrowding and poor physical conditions particularly in Mountjoy and Cork Prisons.  As the Deputy will know, the Government has decided in principle to proceed with the construction of new prison facilities at Thornton Hall and also at Kilworth, County Cork, albeit on a much smaller scale and design to that previously envisaged. The timeframe for this project is currently being discussed in the context of the Government's discussions on capital spending priorities for 2012.The State has also been engaged in an ongoing capital programme with almost 600 additional prisoner spaces constructed and brought into use since January 2008.  There are a number of ongoing projects, most notably the construction of a new accommodation block at the Midlands prison.  This will provide a potential 300 spaces, a new kitchen and work training/education block, and an extension to the visits/reception areas.  It is planned to have the new block fully commissioned by mid 2012.  An administrative building on the Dóchas site has also just been converted into a new accommodation block which will provide 70 spaces.  These will become operational next month.I am also pursuing alternatives to custody and progress is being made.  The recently enacted Criminal Justice (Community Service) (Amendment) Act 2011 requires the sentencing judge to consider the imposition of community service where a custodial sentence of 12 months or less is being considered.  My officials are also working on the roll-out of a pilot community service scheme under which offenders who pose no threat to the community are offered earned earlier release in return for community service.   In addition, I intend to give new guidelines to the Parole Board for the application of a similar scheme to long-term prisoners.  It may take time but I expect to make further announcements about the implementation of these reforms later in the year.The Fines Act 2010 introduced measures to prevent the automatic imprisonment of fine defaulters.    I intend to bring forward new legislative proposals to introduce a system of “attachment orders” allowing a small amount of money to be taken from wages or social welfare facilitating the payment of the debt or fine over time.   The concept of restorative justice also has a place in the range of non-custodial options which are available for use by the courts.   The Deputy can be assured that my focus is to encourage the use of such options to the greatest extent possible.
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-25 00:00:00	Prelude	540	I wish to refer the Deputy to my reply to Question Nos. 10 and 16 of 23 June, 2011 below.The position remains unchanged.10.  To ask the Minister for Justice and Equality if he had any discussions with either his British counterpart or his European colleagues regarding the possibility of changing our time zone to European Time; his views on the benefits or disadvantages to Ireland if such a change was made; and if he will make a statement on the matter.—Noel Harrington.16.  To ask the Minister for Justice and Equality his plans to conduct a cross Departmental analysis of the potential costs and benefits of advancing time by one hour all year round for Ireland; if his attention has been drawn to the passage of a Bill in the House of Commons undertaking a similar study; and if he will make a statement on the matter. — Noel Harrington For ORAL answer on Thursday, 23rd June, 2011.I can inform the Deputy that I am aware of the Bill to which he refers.  The Daylight Saving Bill 2010/11 passed its second reading in the House of Commons on 3 December, 2010. I understand that, if it became law, this Private Members' Bill would require the British Government to conduct a cross-departmental analysis of the potential costs and benefits of the advancing time by one hour for all, or part of, the year. I further understand that such analysis would include a breakdown, so far as possible, of the costs and benefits for England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland. In light of this, I would expect that each of the devolved administrations in Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland would ensure that their views and concerns would be fully reflected in any analysis that might be conducted.Were this cost benefit analysis to be conducted, the Bill requires that an independent Commission would be established to assess it. If that Commission were to conclude that the advancing of time by one hour for all, or part of, the year would be beneficial to England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland then an Order bringing the Commission's recommendations into effect for a three-year trial period would need to be made. Given that European Union Directive 2000/84/EC results in all EU member states starting and ending summer time simultaneously in order that time differences between member states remain constant throughout the year, this would impose a limitation on the discretion available in this area.At present Ireland and the United Kingdom operate in the same time zone. Each year summer time begins at 1:00 a.m. Greenwich Mean Time (GMT) on the last Sunday in March when clocks are put forward one hour and ends at 1:00 a.m. GMT on the last Sunday in October when clocks are put back one hour. During summer time our clocks are set at GMT plus one hour and at GMT during winter time. Were clocks to be put forward for an hour for all of the year, clocks would be set at GMT plus two hours during summer time and at GMT plus one hour during winter time. To illustrate this point I wish to inform the Deputy that today in Belfast sunrise was at 4:48 a.m. and sunset will be at 10:04 p.m. If clocks were put forward by one hour sunrise in Belfast would have been at 5:48 a.m. and sunset would be at 11:04 p.m. Six months from now, if clocks were put forward by one hour, sunrise would be at 9:45 a.m. and sunset at 5 p.m. instead of 8:45 a.m. and 4 p.m.I can also inform the Deputy that in advance of the second reading of the Bill Mr. Edward Davey, Parliamentary Under-Secretary at the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills sought a meeting with our Ambassador in London to discuss issues concerning daylight hours. The meeting took place in November 2010.I can further inform the Deputy that in February 2011 officials from my Department and our London Embassy met with the Bill's Sponsor, Rebecca Harris, M.P. in order to find out more about the background to her Bill as well as registering our interest in its passage and the potential implications for this country.  While there has been contact with the British no discussions have been held with our European colleagues in relation to this matter as the matter is not at a sufficiently advanced stage.I have no plans at this time to change the present time zone arrangements or to conduct a cross-departmental cost benefit analysis of advancing time by one hour all year round for Ireland. However, officials of my Department and the Department of Foreign Affairs are keeping a close watch on the issue and should the position I have outlined change I will review the situation.

The Act provides that JPCs operate under guidelines issued by the Minister for Justice and Equality after consultation with the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government.  The current guidelines were issued in September, 2008.The Programme for Government makes a commitment to build on existing community policing partnerships and forums to enhance trust between local communities and their Gardaí.  I am aware that some JPCs are working better than others, depending on the local authority.  As I have already informed the House, I intend shortly to communicate with local authorities to get an overview of how the JPCs are operating and the extent to which their activities are constructive and beneficial to the community and the Gardaí.  My Department, the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government and An Garda Síochána have commenced work on reviewing the operation of the Committees.  My intention is that a document will be prepared, on the basis of which consultations will take place with the local authorities on how the operation of the Committees might be improved, with a view to updating the guidelines.  I envisage that this process will be substantially complete in the early part of next year.In addition, my Department has been engaged in a major consultative exercise leading to the production of a White Paper on crime.  One of the issues addressed in this exercise has been the role of the JPCs.  The White Paper will set out a policy framework for future strategies to combat and prevent crime.  The intention is that this process will lead ultimately to a national anti-crime strategy, in which the JPCs will have a role to play.
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-25 00:00:00	Prelude	542	The Sex Offenders Act 2001 contains a comprehensive series of provisions aimed at protecting children and other persons.  Part 2 of the Act makes persons convicted of a range of sexual offences subject to notification requirements.  The provisions of the Act also extend to any offenders convicted abroad of the same range of sexual offences who enter the State.  I am informed by the Garda authorities that as of 19 October, 2011 there were 1,175 persons subject to the requirements of Part 2 of the Act.All offenders subject to the notification requirements are monitored by the Sex Offender Management and Intelligence Unit (SOMIU) at the Garda National Bureau of Criminal Investigation.  The Unit is supported by Garda Inspectors nominated in each Garda Division throughout the State.  I am informed that the nominated Inspector in each Division has access to all necessary resources within his/her Division to assist him/her in carrying out his/her duties.  Where An Garda Síochána becomes aware that an offender subject to the notification requirements has breached those requirements, appropriate action is taken.  I am confident that the appropriate level of monitoring is carried out by An Garda Síochána and all breaches of the requirements which come to notice are pursued.An Garda Síochána receive on a regular basis notifications regarding convicted sex offenders who travel to this country.  When SOMIU receives such a notification, it is recorded on the Garda PULSE system and the relevant nominated Divisional Inspector is notified immediately.  I am informed that the information requested regarding the number of such notifications received is not readily available and would require a disproportionate amount of time and resources to collate.My Department is conducting a wide ranging examination of the law on sexual offences, including an evaluation of the Sex Offenders Act 2001.  The review is close to completion, and I expect to bring legislative proposals to Government in the coming months.

In this regard, Revenue has embarked on a vigorous campaign targeting specific locations nationwide.  This action has resulted in a number of these outlets closing down.  Evidence regarding the sale of illegal diesel through reputable outlets has not yet been established.The Revenue Commissioners are fully supported in this area of work by An Garda Síochána. Searches are regularly undertaken by members of An Garda Síochána, at the behest of the Customs authorities as part of intelligence-led operations led by Customs, which have resulted in a number of significant seizures of diesel and the closure of diesel-laundering plants, particularly in Border counties.As an example of this co-operation,  a recent multi-agency operation involving An Garda Síochána and the Revenue Commissioners resulted in the seizure of approximately 110,000 litres of diesel, the search and closure of a sophisticated diesel laundering plant, the arrest of four persons, and the search and closure of five filling stations at locations in Dublin and the Midlands.Furthermore, a Cross Border Task Force, comprising representatives from the Police Service of Northern Ireland, HM Revenue Customs, the UK Serious Organised Crime Agency, An Garda Síochána and the Criminal Assets Bureau and the Revenue Commissioners (Customs Service) has been established.Arising from the work of this Task Force, a number of groups involved in the laundering and distribution of illegal fuels, operating in both jurisdictions, have been identified and are now being specifically targeted for investigation by all law enforcement agencies concerned.I can assure the Deputy that our law enforcement agencies continue to tackle, within their respective remits, the problem of illegal diesel .
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-25 00:00:00	Prelude	545	There are currently over 2,000 full-time-equivalent civilian support staff in the Garda Síochána.These staff provide vital support services in a wide range of areas, such as human resources, training and development, IT and telecommunications, finance and procurement, internal audit, research and analysis, accommodation and fleet management, scene-of-crime support and medical services. In doing so, they release highly trained Gardaí from administrative tasks to operational policing.While the current number of civilian support staff is an increase on previous years the level of civilian support staff in the Garda Síochána is still significantly lower than in many comparable police forces. This is reflected in the 2009 Garda Inspectorate report on Resource Allocation, which called for the numbers of Gardaí available for operational duty to be maximised through a structured programme of civilianisation.However, in seeking to increase the number of civilian support staff, we must face the reality of the need to reduce overall numbers in the public service.  The answer may lie in the more effective use of resources across the public service, including in particular more flexibility in redeployment of staff to priority areas.  Indeed, the Garda reform agenda under the Croke Park Agreement contains a specific commitment, agreed by Garda management and the Garda Associations, to augment civilian support staff in the Force through appropriate redeployment of staff from elsewhere in the public service.
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2011-10-25 00:00:00	Prelude	546	I propose to take Questions Nos. 80 and 441 together.Following the submission in 2004 of a report and recommendations by an expert group on crime statistics, it was decided that the compilation and publication of crime statistics should be taken over by the Central Statistics Office, as the national statistical agency, from An Garda Síochána.  The Garda Síochána Act 2005 consequently makes provision for this and the CSO has established a dedicated unit for this purpose.  Following the setting up of the necessary technical systems and auditing of the data from which the statistics are compiled, the CSO is now compiling, publishing and responding to queries regarding recorded crime statistics.I have requested the CSO to provide detailed statistics directly to the Deputy.The criminal law takes a serious view of offences committed by persons on bail.  Section 11 of the Criminal Justice Act 1984 provides that any sentence of imprisonment passed on a person for an offence committed while on bail must be consecutive on any sentence passed on him or her for a previous offence, or on the sentence last due to expire, if more than one is being served.  It also provides that the fact that an offence was committed while on bail must be treated as an aggravating factor at sentencing and that the court shall impose a sentence that is greater than that which would have been imposed otherwise, unless there are exceptional circumstances.The Bail Act 1997, which gave effect to the terms of the Sixteenth Amendment of the Constitution, provides for the refusal of bail to a person charged with a serious offence where it is reasonably considered necessary to prevent the commission of a serious offence by that person.  In addition, section 6 of that Act, as amended by section 9 of the Criminal Justice Act 2007, provides that every bail recognisance is subject to the condition that the accused person shall not commit an offence while on bail.I am conscious of public concern about the extent to which offences continue to be committed by persons on bail.  I share that concern.  I believe that bail law must be continually reviewed to ensure that all possible avenues are taken to protect the public against the commission of crime, particularly serious crime, by persons on bail.  In doing this, we have to take account of the restrictions which exist in the provisions of our Constitution and the European Convention on Human Rights on the extent to which the right to bail can be limited.My Department has been engaged in work to consolidate and update bail law with a view to presenting a clear, accessible and modern statement of the law.  In the context of that modernisation of the law, I will be seeking to restructure the law so that it has a focus on the protection of the individual and of the public.  My intention is that the new proposals will provide better guidance to the courts on how such protection might be provided.  I am also taking the opportunity to introduce some general improvements to bail law to improve the overall working of the bail system.I will bring proposals to Government on the matter shortly.

The Office is part of the civil service and like other Departments and Offices is managed by a Management Advisory Committee, headed by the Chief State Solicitor.The Office is entirely funded by the Exchequer and has its own Vote (Vote 13).  The net total voted allocation for 2011 is €34.188m, of which €14.995m is allocated to payroll.The Law Reform Commission has a whole-time staff equivalent of 23.The Commission does not have board members or a Chairperson, but rather a President and four Commissioners. The position of President is currently vacant.  The remuneration of the President of the Commission would depend on the circumstances.  Appointees to the office of President of the Commission to date have been holders of judicial office.  If a serving judge were President they would not receive any remuneration over and above their judge's salary.

However to be helpful to the Deputy I am providing the information requested in relation to both the CSO and the NSB.Central Statistics OfficeThe Central Statistics Office allocation in 2011 is €80.067m, compared with spending of €50.762m in 2010. The increase this year relates to the Census of Population.  The total number of whole time equivalent staff serving in the CSO at 30 September 2011 was 828. The peak number of staff was in April, during collection of the census, when more than 5,000 field staff were employed.  The total annual wages and salaries bill for the CSO amounted to €35.866m in 2010. The corresponding allocation for 2011 is €38.997m for office-based staff and €22.246m for staff engaged in the collection of statistics.National Statistics BoardUnder the Statistics Act 1993, the National Statistics Board comprises a Chairperson and seven Board members.One position on the board is unfilled at present.

The agency manages a budget of €450 million annually to deliver the range of assistance and services to its target population.  These include basic education, health services, community employment schemes and food aid for vulnerable families.Ireland has been, and continues to be, a strong supporter of UNRWA and its vital work.  In the past five years, funding of €21.2 million has been provided by Ireland to assist UNRWA in helping vulnerable Palestinians.  In 2011 alone, funding of €4 million in core programme support has been provided by Ireland to UNRWA.It has come to my attention in recent weeks that UNRWA's funding situation in Gaza at this point in 2011 is in serious crisis.  A number of activities including job creation, agriculture and fisheries programmes have already been cut back significantly and, in some cases, ceased in June.  Of particular concern to me is a funding gap of more than €12 million in the food aid programme which, if not met by donors in the coming weeks, will see the food aid supply to vulnerable refugees in Gaza, including children, breaking down.  If this happens, 600,000 refugees will no longer receive vital food rations and 200,000 schoolchildren will no longer receive school feeding supplements.  In response to UNRWA's urgent request for further assistance, I have now approved further emergency funding of €500,000 to be delivered to the agency at the earliest opportunity.It is my earnest hope that other governments will respond with similar speed and flexibility in response to this urgent situation.  It is vital that the supply of essential humanitarian assistance to the Palestinian refugee population in Gaza is not interrupted over the coming period.

Below are the details requested for the two bodies that operate under the auspices of my Department: the   Development Education Advisory Committee (DEAC) and Emigrant Services Advisory Committee (ESAC). The membership of the Committee was renewed for a further two-year term in April 2010.  Members serve in a voluntary capacity and are not remunerated.  Travel expenses relating to the work of the Committee are reimbursed on a vouched basis.The administration of the DEAC is serviced by the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade from the Department's overall budget.The current membership of the Committee is as follows:Ms Moira Leydon, Assistant General Secretary, Association of Secondary Teachers Ireland (Chairperson).Mr. Kevin J. McCarthy, Department of Education and Skills Inspectorate.Ms Annette Honan, National Council for Curriculum and Assessment (NCCA).Dr. Claire Lyons, Mary I College, Limerick.Ms Maria Barry, Trócaire.Mr. Patsy Toland, Self Help Africa.Dr. Paul Conway, University College Cork.The primary role of the Emigrant Services Advisory Committee (ESAC)   is to advise me on the welfare of and the allocation of grants to Irish community organisations in Britain under the Emigrant Support Programme.The Committee consists of thirteen members, including two officers from our Embassy in London who act as Chair and Secretary to the Committee. The other eleven members of the Committee serve in a voluntary capacity.In April of this year, after consultation with our Embassy in London and the Irish Abroad Unit in the Department, I made the following appointments to the Committee:Mr. Michael Forde —   Chairman of the Irish Diaspora Foundation.Mr. Séamus McGarry —   Member of the Ireland Fund of Great Britain; Board of Irish Cultural Centre, Hammersmith.Mr. Jim O'Hara —   Vice Chair, Irish Youth Foundation UK, Chair of Irish Cultural Centre, Hammersmith.Cllr.

The Ireland-United States Commission for Educational Exchange (The Fulbright Commission) and the North/South Ministerial Council (NSMC)   do not operate under my direct authority.  The Ireland-United States Commission for Educational Exchange   enjoys autonomy of management and administration in accordance with section 2(5) of the Educational Exchange (Ireland and the United States of America) Act, 1991. Under section 3(1) of the 1991 Act, the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade is responsible for the appointment of four members of the eight - member Commission.The Commission's accounts are available in the Oireachtas library. The Good Friday Agreement provides for the establishment of the North/South Ministerial Council   and the NSMC Joint Secretariat, which was established in Armagh to support and facilitate the North/South Ministerial Council. It is jointly-staffed by personnel from the Irish and Northern Irish civil services.  The NSMC, and each of the North/South Bodies which operate on an all-island basis under the auspices of the NSMC, are accountable to the Oireachtas and the Northern Ireland Assembly.

The transfer gives my Department an enhanced role in trade promotion.On a practical level, my Department now has responsibility for the management of the Export Trade Council and of our Joint Economic Commissions which Ireland maintains with a number of countries. I chaired the first meeting of the Export Trade Council, on Thursday 29 September 2011.  In line with the commitment in the Programme for Government the new Council will strengthen cooperation and coordination across all Government Departments and State Agencies involved in the promotion and development of trade and exports and will oversee the progressive implementation of the recommendations set out in Trading and Investing in a Smart Economy   published last autumn.I will lead the Irish delegation at the forthcoming meeting of our Joint Economic Commission with the Russian Federation scheduled to take place on 7 November next in Moscow.The transfer of trade functions has resulted in a closer working relationship with Enterprise Ireland, particularly in relation overseas trade missions which they organise and which are led by myself or my colleague the Minister for State for Trade and Development.  Minister O'Sullivan has recently led trade missions to London, Saudi Arabia and Qatar, and will shortly lead one to South Africa. I attended the annual meeting of Asia Pacific Ireland Business Forum (APIBF) in Seoul, on 14 October 2011 and while in the region, took the opportunity to travel to Tokyo to have a number of meetings there focussed on trade and economic issues.The Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation retains lead responsibility for trade policy, which includes representing Ireland's trade interests in the context of the EU Common Commercial Policy and at the World Trade Organisation.
#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-25 00:00:00	Prelude	559	Before issuing a passport to a minor the Passports Act 2008 requires that the Minister must be satisfied, amongst other matters, that the child is an Irish citizen, and that the passport application has been submitted by either a parent or guardian of the child.  On 8 June the family sought and were refused a declaration of parentage from the Circuit Court.  I can confirm that the Attorney General was on notice of the case and did not offer any objection to the order being made.  The consequences of this order are that the Irish citizen male has been found not to be the father of the child and accordingly the child is not entitled to Irish citizenship.  In light of this ruling, which is binding on the State, the Department is not able to issue a passport or other travel document under the Act.   I along with my officials fully understand and appreciate the depth of frustration and disappointment experienced by the parents as a result of the difficult and complex situation which they are now in.  Nevertheless, it is important to re-state the legal position in regard to that court decision which I have put on record in the House in our debate on 18 October last, that, there is no administrative procedure available to the State to overrule or ignore the determination made by Circuit Court in this case that would allow for the issue of a passport to this person at this stage.  That ruling can only be reversed on appeal by the High Court.The couple's solicitor has lodged an appeal with the High Court and has been informed that the Attorney General will not oppose the appeal nor seek any costs in this matter. I have informed the couple of this. There is no legislation specifically dealing with surrogacy in Ireland, but existing laws with regard to issues such as citizenship, parentage, guardianship and passports apply. It is clear that legislation is needed to deal specifically with this important and sensitive issue.    As provided for in the Programme for Government, it is the Government's intention to bring forward such legislation.  This matter is being dealt with by the Minister for Justice and Equality.  However, given the complexity of the issue and the policy involvement of various other Government Departments, including Health, Children, Social Protection and my own, this will take time.  In the short term, officials in my Department in conjunction with officials from the Attorney General's Office, the Department of Justice and Equality and others are currently working on guidelines on dealing with such cases pending the enactment of legislation in this area.  Work on the guidelines is at an advanced stage.  The aim of the process is to produce guidelines for the public that would bring a degree of clarity on the law applicable to this complex area.  It is also hoped to put people on notice in regard to the issues, requirements and difficulties which may arise.

Having such "in-house" legal experts reduces the costs which would be incurred if the Department was to engage externally for similar services.  The majority of other instances where legal advice and services have been required by my Department in the State during the period in question have been handled either by the Attorney General's Office or the Chief State Solicitor's Office, or have related to cases processed by the State Claims Agency.  As the Deputy will be aware, Government Departments do not directly pay for the legal services provided by the Office of the Attorney General and or the Chief State Solicitor's Office or for advice from Counsel briefed by them.Nevertheless, there are from time to time occasions where a need to engage external legal services in the State arises, where the necessary specialised expertise is not available within my Department and cannot be accessed from the AGO or the CSSO.  In the period in question this occurred on three occasions, the details of which are included in the table below.The Department's Missions abroad may have occasional requirements for legal services and these are sourced from local legal practitioners as and when required.YearSubject matterSolicitor/BarristerFeeNature of the workTendering2006Passport biometricsMason, Hayes & Curran€39,351.75Legal advice and associated servicesStandard tendering using etenders2006Preparation of tender for transport provisionRonan Daly Jermyn Solicitors€10,315.25Legal adviceAssigned by the CSSO2007EPassportMatheson Ormsby Prentice€1,473.78Oversight of EPassport certificationRecommended by the CSSO

Irish Aid in the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade maintains a roster of observers for election monitoring missions.  There are currently some 300 people on the roster, 104 women and 196 men.The main requirements for inclusion on the roster are overseas or domestic experience in the administration of elections, or significant overseas development expertise.  Members should also be Irish citizens, be in good health and have an ability to adapt to difficult conditions.  Knowledge of foreign languages is also an advantage.  Candidates who fulfil the requirements are placed on the roster following an interview.  The election observation programme is subject to continuous monitoring to ensure that it operates efficiently and effectively and provides the best possible value for money.The Government aims to ensure that, when requested, Ireland is represented at an appropriate level in international observation missions for elections and constitutional referendums.  Irish observers participate primarily on missions organised by the European Union and the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), but have also been involved in missions organised by the Council of Europe, the United Nations and the Carter Centre.A list in tabular form of persons sent abroad between May 2010 and October 2011 to monitor elections and referendums is set out below.Election observation missions, May 2010 to October 2010Irish observers act on observation missions as core team members, long term observers (LTOs) and short term observers (STOs).(52 observers on 12 missions)COUNTRYORGANISATIONROLEFORENAMESURNAME

I would support any move at EU level to exclude settlement products from entry to the EU.

I have explained, in reply to previous questions from the Deputy, the reasons why the Turkish authorities did not consider that sabotage had taken place.  I would be happy to have the views of the Irish Ship to Gaza group examined.  I met with them in June prior to these events, and I am of course already familiar with the case they have made in public, and to the Turkish authorities, in relation to their view that the Saoirse was sabotaged.  I would invite them in the first instance to meet with officials of my Department, to determine if they have further evidence beyond this to impart.The investigation of what happened in a port in Turkey is of course, and will remain, primarily the responsibility of the Turkish authorities.
#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-25 00:00:00	Prelude	566	In December 2010 the previous Government decided that the free facility, which provided those citizens who were aged 65 and over with a 10 year passport free of charge, would be withdrawn.  Since 11 April 2011, these citizens must pay the standard adult fees for their selected passport service.  Notice of this and other fee changes were published on the Department's website www.passport.ie and in advertisements in the national press.  Current fee information is also available from public notices which are generally displayed in Garda Stations, Post Offices and Passport Offices.A new print run of application forms and information form notes was issued this summer.  The information form notes advise applicants to check the amount of the fee for their requested passport service from these notices when they are applying for passports.  This is important as the payment of the wrong fee will delay the processing of their application.The newly amended information form notes do not include passport fee details.  The decision to omit this was based on the following considerations:(1) The levels of passport fees are reviewed on a regular basis and it would not represent good value for money to have to destroy the existing stock of unused and widely distributed application form notes and replace them with a new version any time there is a fee change.(2) There is no effective way of updating fee information on the stocks that are in use all over the world at the time of a fee change.  Outdated information on these forms has resulted at times in delayed passport delivery.Applicants are advised to first check the current fees on the Passport Office website or at the Post Office or Garda Station.It should be noted that the current adult fee for a regular passport is €80 for Passport Express, which is the passport service that is jointly operated by the Department with An Post, and €95 for those applications that are made at a Passport Office or submitted through regular postal services, including registered post.

#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-25 00:00:00	Prelude	571	This question relates to a submission by the Irish Bookmakers Association.  The issues raised are being examined in the context of the proposed Betting (Amendment) Bill, which is being drafted at present.  The Bill will amend the 1931 Betting Act to inter alia establish the regulatory framework for the licensing of remote bookmakers and betting exchanges, including measures to enforce the regulatory framework.  The extension of the opening hours of retail betting shops over the winter period is also being considered in that context.  The drafting of the Bill, which is fairly complex, is well advanced.  The Finance Act 2011 provided measures for the extension of the 1% betting duty to remote bookmakers and a 15% gross profits tax to betting exchanges, subject to a Ministerial Commencement order that can only be commenced when the Betting (Amendment) Bill is enacted.
#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-25 00:00:00	Prelude	572	The current annual earnings cap of €115,000 acts, in conjunction with age-related percentage limits of annual earnings, to put a ceiling on the annual amount of tax relief an individual taxpayer can obtain on employee or personal pension contributions.  I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that the full year yield to the Exchequer arising from reducing the earnings cap to the amount mentioned in the question is currently estimated to be of the order of €95 million.  This figure is provisional and subject to revision.  A breakdown of the figures by reference to income levels is available only in respect of the tax relief for contributions to Retirement Annuity Contracts (RACs) and Personal Retirement Savings Accounts (PRSAs) and to the extent that these contributions are included in the personal tax returns of tax payers.  With regard to occupational pension schemes (schemes set up by employers), the figures in respect of employee contributions are available only in aggregate form.  Information on such contributions is not captured in such a way as to make it possible to associate contributions with individual income levels.  For that reason the estimated yield to the Exchequer in respect of these contributions is extremely tentative.  The estimated yield is based on assuming that tax relief which would be affected by the changes mentioned in the question is currently allowed at the top income tax rate of 41% and at the maximum age-related percentage limit of earnings.  The figure provided could therefore be regarded as the maximum Exchequer yield in respect of those taxpayers.
#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-25 00:00:00	Prelude	573	The policy of my Department, as set out in Circular 43/2006 "Tax Clearance Procedures, Public Sector Contracts" is that, in the case of all public sector contracts of a value of €10,000 (inclusive of VAT) or more within any 12-month period, the contractor (and agent as appropriate) is required to produce either a valid tax clearance certificate or a C2 certificate.  The public sector includes all Government Departments and Offices, Local Authorities, the Health Service Executive and other Health Agencies, Educational Bodies and all State Bodies whether commercial or non-commercial (statutory or otherwise) and in general all authorities (agencies/entities/bodies) who finance contracts out of public funds.  The Circular is to be interpreted to cover situations where public sector bodies are buying, hiring or leasing goods, services or property or generally expending public monies including, for example, contracts.  It is not necessary that a contract be the subject of formal documentation or a tendering process for the tax clearance procedures to apply.  Contracts awarded and payments made by public sector bodies to other public sector bodies are excluded from the scope of these procedures.I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that the tax compliance of all contractors and sub contractors currently working on State contracts has been verified through the tax clearance or C2 process as outlined above.  Further monitoring on sub-contractors' compliance is carried out through the payments cards application process when the compliance status is reviewed before payments in excess of approved amounts can be made without deduction of Relevant Contracts Tax.In addition, State Bodies, principal and sub contractors are all subject to Revenue's various compliance programmes which range from unannounced visits to sites to fully comprehensive audits.  In that context they may be selected for intervention based on the presence of various risk indicators and other information available to Revenue.In the future the new Relevant Contracts Tax system that is being introduced by Revenue from 1 January 2012 will ensure that Revenue has access to up to date real time information on-line which they can monitor, review and respond to immediately.  The rate of RCT to be applied will change depending on the ongoing tax compliance of the sub contractors.  In effect it introduces a system of real time and ongoing tax clearance.Section 101 of the Minister and Secretaries (Amendment) Act 2011 has placed on a statutory basis the independence of the Revenue Commissioners in the exercise by the Commissioners of their statutory functions under the various taxation and customs enactments, including decisions relating to investigation.  This has given effect to the recommendation of the Report of the Tribunal into Payments to Politicians and Related Matters (that is, the report of Mr. Justice Moriarty), that the principle or convention of the independence of the Revenue Commissioners be elevated to the more robust status of a legislative provision.

The first valuation date for the levy was 31 December 2010 and the tax return and payment of the levy for 2010 is not due until 31 October 2011.  The yield figure will not be available until after that date.  As with other areas of taxation, the rules are constantly kept under review and any changes will be determined in the context of Budget and Finance Bill.
#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-25 00:00:00	Prelude	575	The supply of safety equipment including bicycle helmets for children up to 10 years of age is liable to VAT at the zero rate in accordance with paragraph 10(1) of Schedule 2 of the Value-Added Tax Consolidation Act 2010.  The supply of safety equipment for adults and children older than 10 years is liable to VAT at the standard rate of 21% as provided for in Section 46(1)(a) of the VAT Consolidation Act.  The application of a reduced rate on safety equipment for adults and older children is prohibited by the EU VAT Directive, with which Irish VAT law must comply.  In general, Member States must apply the standard VAT rate to all safety equipment.  Under Article 110 of the VAT Directive, where a Member State applied a zero rate of VAT to any item on 1 January 1991, they could continue to apply the zero rate.  It is under this provision that clothing and safety equipment for children is zero rated in Ireland.  As the standard rate applied to safety equipment for adults and older children on 1 January 1991, it is not possible for Ireland to apply a VAT rate lower than the standard rate to these items.  With regard to the VAT rate applying to safety equipment including bicycle helmets in the UK, the same VAT Directive provision (Article 110), allows the UK to zero rate safety equipment and bicycle helmets for adults as well as children.  This is because the UK applied such a rate to safety equipment on 1 January 1991.
#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2011-10-25 00:00:00	Prelude	576	I propose to take Questions Nos. 111, 115 and 137 together.In response to the Deputy's questions there are 2 bodies which are classed as commercial agencies and one body classed as non-commercial State agency which come under the aegis of my Department.The commercial bodies are Anglo Irish Bank and The National Asset Management Agency.The non-commercial State agency which comes under the aegis of my Department is The National Treasury Management Agency (NTMA).  The NTMA is responsible for borrowing on behalf of the Government and managing the National Debt.  It also acts as the State Claims Agency, the Manager of the National Pensions Reserve Fund and is the body through which the National Development Finance Agency performs its functions.  NewERA has been established in the NTMA, initially on a non-statutory basis.  The NTMA assigns staff to the National Asset Management Agency (NAMA) and also provides NAMA with business and support services and systems.The expenses of the NTMA, including staff costs, are paid directly from the Central Fund.  NAMA reimburses the NTMA the costs of staff assigned to NAMA and the costs of business and support services provided to NAMA from its own resources.
#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-25 00:00:00	Prelude	577	With effect from the start of this year, codified provisions in relation to transfer pricing address any understatement of profits for Irish tax purposes.  These provisions confirm that, for trading transactions between associated persons, the OECD "arm's-length" standard of pricing must apply.  Arm's length prices are those that would be agreed by independent parties.  If the amount payable under the terms of a transaction between associated persons is greater than the arm's length amount and reduces the profit, then the arm's length amount will be deemed to be the amount payable in substitution for the actual amount.  If the amount receivable under a transaction is less than the arm's length amount and reduces the profits, then the arm's length amount will be deemed to be the amount receivable in substitution for the actual amount.  Media reports have incorrectly suggested that highly profitable companies make arrangements using transfer pricing to reduce their payment of Irish corporation tax, effectively bringing the Irish tax rate below 12.5%.Arm's-length payments incurred, for the use of assets owned outside the State by an associated foreign company, will reduce the profits of the Irish company concerned.  The reports mistakenly attribute to Ireland profits that, in fact, represent the return due to assets owned in other jurisdictions by group companies resident in those jurisdictions.  Group companies resident in Ireland pay 12.5% corporation tax on their profits arising here.  However, by relating this corporation tax not only to the profits of the Irish-resident companies but, instead, to both those profits and   the profits of foreign-resident companies (which are not profits chargeable to Irish corporation tax), these reports produce an average tax rate for the companies concerned that is lower than 12.5% and an inference that Irish profits are not being charged.Multinational groups, with subsidiaries in other countries as well as in Ireland, incur bona fide  expenditures that are paid to foreign group members and reduce Irish profits.  This may reduce the average rate of tax for the total profits of the Irish and foreign-resident subsidiaries taken together.  Nevertheless, the Irish profits are being charged and the rate of tax actually paid on the profits of Irish-resident subsidiaries is the full 12.5%.

Over 700 submissions were made during the consultation, which forms part of an impact assessment process to assess the potential effects of amending, curtailing and/or abolishing such reliefs, in keeping with the commitment in the Programme for Government to curtail tax shelters which benefit very high income earners.  Submissions were received from a wide range of organisations and from individuals, and varied in length and scope.  These submissions are currently being examined and are adding to our understanding of the dynamic of these reliefs and providing a valuable source of information on the possible impacts on the State and investor groups of potential changes to the treatment of property-based legacy reliefs.It is anticipated that the analysis of the submissions along with the results of the impact assessment process will be available for consideration in the context of the forthcoming budget.As the Deputy is aware it is not customary to comment in advance of the Budget on any matters that might be the subject of Budget decisions.

The majority of EU Member States, nineteen of the 27 States, apply higher VAT rates to domestic energy than Ireland.  Ireland can avail of this reduced rate because of a provision, under Article 118 of the EU VAT Directive that provides that where a reduced rate applied to a good or service on 1 January 1991, Member States can continue to avail of that reduced rate.  However, this provision is restricted in that only a rate of 12% or more may apply to domestic fuels.The level and timeframe of any changes to the Irish VAT rates will be determined in the context of the annual Budget cycle.
#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-25 00:00:00	Prelude	580	In response to the Deputy's question information in relation to bodies listed  and which come under the aegis of my Department is as follows: Details requested in respect of the Office of the Appeals Commissioners and Office of the Revenue Commissioners are available in the revised estimates for 2011.The National Development Finance Agency (NDFA) performs its functions through the National Treasury Management Agency (NTMA).  The NTMA had 39 members of staff directly assigned to the NDFA at end-September 2011.There are eight members of the NDFA Board.  The Chairman and Chief Executive of the NDFA (the CEO and a director of the NTMA respectively) receive no fee.  The remaining 6 ordinary board members receive a fee of €12,600 per annum, which takes into account a 10% reduction in fees agreed by the Board at the request of the Minister for Finance in 2009.  Board fees are charged to the Central Fund.The National Pensions Reserve Fund (NPRF) is controlled and managed by the NPRF Commission.  The NTMA is the Manager of the National Pensions Reserve Fund and the Commission performs its functions through the Manager.  The NTMA had 13 members of staff directly assigned to the NPRF at end-September 2011.There are seven members of the National Pensions Reserve Fund Commission.  The Chairperson is paid €51,424 per annum and ordinary members of the Commission (other than the Chief Executive of the NTMA who is an ex-officio member of the Commission and does not receive a fee) are paid €34,283.  These fees take into account a 10% reduction in fees agreed by the Board at the request of the Minister for Finance in 2009).  The fees paid to the Commission are charged to the National Pensions Reserve Fund.The NTMA's shared services (Finance, HR, IT, etc.) provide support to all of the Agency's business functions, including the NDFA and the NPRF.The expenses of the NTMA, including staff costs, are paid directly from the Central Fund.  NAMA reimburses the NTMA the costs of staff assigned to NAMA and the costs of business and support services provided to NAMA from its own resources.  The costs incurred by the NTMA in its role as Manager of the NPRF are set out in the accounts of the National Pensions Reserve Fund.  These costs amounted to €4.5 million in 2010.  The costs incurred by the NTMA in relation to the NDFA are set out in the accounts of the NDFA.  These costs amounted to €7.1 million in 2010.Fees and expenses incurred by the NPRF Commission, other than the expenses of the NTMA as outlined above, are charged to the NPRF.Amounts are advanced from the Central Fund to fund the payment of external advisory fees and expenses incurred by the NDFA in the performance of its financing and advisory functions in relation to specific investment projects.  These fees and expenses are reclaimed from State authorities and the amounts advanced are then repaid to the Exchequer.

Finance Act 2011 abolished first time buyer relief, along with a number of other reliefs from Stamp Duty on residential property transfers, as part of the process in which the Stamp Duty rate was reduced to 1% on properties valued up to €1 million and 2% on any balance over €1 million.   I have no plans at this time to reintroduce this relief so the question of amending the provision does not arise.

The use of a competitive tendering process for these services is not feasible.Virtually all the fees paid to Counsel relate to tax and customs compliance, including tax avoidance.  The requirement for legal advice arises in the context of individual tax and customs cases, which cannot be detailed for reasons of taxpayer confidentiality, where Revenue is challenging, or being challenged. Other than the figures in Table 2 below, it is not possible to disaggregate the fees paid for advice from those paid for litigation and advocacy services.For completeness, I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that following competitive tender they entered into contracts with firms of solicitors to provide legal services associated with debt collection and recovery.

#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-25 00:00:00	Prelude	586	I would like to thank the Deputy for bringing to my attention the proposals for dealing with the mortgage arrears situation.  As the Deputy is aware a lot of discussion has taken place to deal with the mortgage arrears situation and a lot of suggestions have been put forward. In November 2010, the Expert Group on Mortgage Arrears and Personal Debt published its report. All of the Group's recommendations are listed in Chapter 2 of the Report which can be accessed on my Department's website: www.finance.gov.ie. More recently, the Economic Management Council, of which I am a member, requested an Inter-Departmental Mortgage Arrears Working Group to consider further necessary actions to alleviate the increasing problem of mortgage over-indebtedness. The Group's report was published on 12 October 2011 and is also  available on my Department's website.  The report was debated in the Dáil this week. This debate gave all sides of the House the opportunity to contribute in a constructive and realistic manner to the deliberations on this important issue. As I stated in the House, all of us recognise that the problem is a complex one. Neither the work of the Group nor the report were designed to offer the complete solution to the mortgage arrears problem. As is recommended in the report, further solutions need to be developed by the mortgage lenders and these need to be assessed by the Central Bank. The report sets out some very important recommendations on where the State should play its part by supporting mortgage to rent schemes, establishing a mortgage advisory function and introducing more appropriate bankruptcy legislation. Its sets out a clear framework for assessing individual situations and a range of suggested solutions.I have instructed the Banking Division of my Department to begin discussions with the banks to ensure implementation of the measures set out in the report.

The annual maintenance and support costs in respect of this service are €49,200.The Revenue Commissioners, which is under the aegis of my Department, is not part of my Department's shared services payroll. However, I am informed the annual Corepay costs for that body were, €81,070 in 2010.
#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-25 00:00:00	Prelude	588	As Minister for Finance, I do not get involved in or comment on negotiations/discussions between a borrower with his/her lender. I note that the borrower in question is engaging with the lender.  As the Deputy is aware the Central Bank's Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears (the Code) applies to mortgage lending activities with borrowers in respect of their principal private residence in the State. Under the Code, lenders must establish a Mortgage Arrears Resolution Process known as a MARP and use this framework when dealing with borrowers who are in arrears or in pre-arrears situations. Under rule16 of the Code, a lender must establish a dedicated Arrears Support Unit (ASU) to manage cases under the MARP. If a borrower is not satisfied with a decision of the ASU, then he or she can appeal the matter to the lender's internal appeals board which the lender is obliged to establish under rule 42 of the Code. A copy of the Code is available on the Central Bank's website: www.centralbank.ie.
#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2011-10-25 00:00:00	Prelude	589	I propose to take Questions Nos. 125, 130 and 134 together.As Minister for Finance, I have no statutory role in the setting of interest rates charged by financial institutions regulated by the Central Bank.The Central Bank has responsibility for the regulation and supervision of financial institutions in terms of consumer protection and prudential requirements and for ensuring ongoing compliance with applicable statutory obligations.  Interest rates and financial products are not regulated. Each institution determines the rate it charges its customers, depending on a number of factors, such as cost of funds and commercial considerations (such as competition in the market, risk pricing and the impact on deposit rates).Despite the Central Bank not having a statutory role in the matter, I have been advised by the Bank that a decision has been taken to require any bank that has received Government capital support to provide an impact analysis of any proposed standard variable mortgage rate increase in terms of the implications for its arrears portfolio and for future capital requirements. The Central Bank has also indicated that the Board of Directors of such a bank must, in future, review and approve this analysis to ensure that proper attention is given to the costs of such actions The Deputies may wish to refer to the address given by Mr Matthew Elderfield, Deputy Governor of the Central Bank to the Association of Compliance Officers in Ireland at University College Cork on 14 October 2011. This can be accessed on the Central Bank's website www.centralbank.ie.The Financial Services Ombudsman is a statutory officer who deals independently with complaints from consumers about their individual dealings with financial service providers that have not been resolved by the providers after they have been through the internal complaints resolution systems of the providers.  Because of the independence of the Ombudsman, it would not be appropriate for me to comment on his work or on how long it takes him to carry out his investigations.

#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-25 00:00:00	Prelude	591	The latest publicly available figures on the amount of Eurozone Government bonds, including Irish government bonds, held by AIB were published as part of the EU wide bank stress tests on 15 July 2011. A link to the main release on the Central Bank of Ireland's website is below. http://www.centralbank.ie/press-area/press-releases/Pages/2011EU-WideBankStressTestResultsforIrishBanksPublished.aspx
The results published by the Central Bank contain an individual PDF report for AIB detailing the various Eurozone and other Sovereign exposures, including Ireland, as of 31 December 2010. The Sovereign debt exposures are shown starting on page 7 of the PDF report.Additionally, AIB provided updated partial disclosure on their sovereign exposures as part of their 30 June 2011 half year results, the full detail of which can be found on page 27 of the document at the link below on the AIB website. http://www.aib.ie/servlet/ContentServer?pagename= AIBInvestorRelations/AIBDownload/aibddownload&c=AIBDownload&cid=1314616620712&channel=IRFP
I am informed by the bank that an up-to-date disclosure of its Irish Government bond holdings is not currently available on the grounds of commercial sensitivity and would only ordinarily be updated at accounting period ends or as part of other market announcements
#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-25 00:00:00	Prelude	592	The Programme for Government commits the Government to examining a proposal to increase mortgage interest relief to 30% for first time buyers who bought between 2004 and 2008 to be financed in part by the abolition of mortgage interest relief for new buyers from mid 2011.   This proposal was considered by the Inter-Departmental Group on Mortgage Arrears but was not recommended by the 0Group.  However, all tax matters remain for consideration in the context of the annual Budget and this remains the position.
#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-25 00:00:00	Prelude	593	Income Tax relief in respect of health expenses is allowable in accordance with section 469 of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997.  The section provides for tax relief for health expenses incurred in the provision of health care.  "Health Care" is defined as the prevention, diagnosis, alleviation or treatment of an ailment, injury, infirmity, defect or disability but does not include cosmetic surgery or similar procedures, unless the surgery or procedure is necessary to ameliorate a physical deformity arising from, or directly related to, a congenital abnormality, a personal injury or a disfiguring disease.   Hair transplant treatment for androgenetic alopecia (known as female and male pattern baldness) is not regarded as the provision of "health care" and, accordingly, tax relief is not due in respect of expenditure incurred for hair transplant treatment in such cases.  However, other forms of alopecia, such as scarring alopecia, are different from androgenetic alopecia and are considered separately by the Revenue Commissioners.Scarring alopecia, for example, arises because of inflammation or infection of the hair follicles, which results in hair loss.  Where ailments such as scarring alopecia are treated with medications to heal the scarring, tax relief would be allowed for the expenses incurred for the medications and the services of a medical practitioner.  Hair transplant treatment for scarring alopecia, may also qualify as the provision of health care, if it can be shown that the transplant treatment was not cosmetic and was undertaken for the treatment of a congenital abnormality, a personal injury or a disfiguring disease.If a person is not satisfied with a decision of the Revenue Commissioners to refuse tax relief under section 469, it is open to the person to appeal to the tax Appeal Commissioners to have the matter reviewed.Having regard to the approach adopted by the Revenue Commissioners as respects tax relief for non-androgenetic alopecia suffers and the fact that an appeal is available against the Commissioners decision I do not propose to make any changes in this area.
#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2011-10-25 00:00:00	Prelude	594	I propose to take Questions Nos. 131 to 133, inclusive, together.As the Deputy is aware the Board of the bank is responsible for the day to day operation of the bank, including the appointment of and assignment of staff within the bank. I have no direct function in this regard. The bank has informed me that it is constrained under the provisions of the Data Protection Acts from disclosing the personal details of employees of the bank when a question or series of questions would require the disclosure of personal data of individual employees.As already indicated my approval, as Minister, is required in relation to the appointment of and terms and conditions of employment of senior management at the bank. I can confirm, in the interests of clarity, that no member of the current senior management team reported directly to the former CEO at the bank prior to nationalisation.The current members of the senior management team of IBRC are:Mike Aynsley — Group Chief Executive Officer;Jim Bradley — Chief Financial Officer;Gary Marshall — Chief Operating Officer;Peter Rossiter — Chief Risk Officer;Lizanne White — Chief Legal Officer;Tom Hunersen — Group Executive — Corporate and Institutional Recovery;Richard Woodhouse — Specialised Asset Management;Mark Layther — Recovery Management Ireland;Jim Brydie — Recovery Management UK;John McGloughlin — Group Executive — Investment and Loan Servicing.
#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-25 00:00:00	Prelude	595	I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that the number of audits carried out in relation to licensed premises in each of the years 2007 to 2011 (to August), and the related yield across all tax heads, business and personal, is as follows:2007 —  314 — €11.5m [ 210 yielding/67%];2008 —  327 — €11.5m [ 242 yielding/74%];2009 —  307 — €15.7m [230 yielding/75%];2010 —  285 — €7.6m [207 yielding/73%];2011 (to August) —  194 — €4.7m. [143 yielding/74%].Yielding cases includes cases where there was no cash yield but reliefs and losses were restricted.  The proportion of yielding cases is in line with Revenue's risk based audit programme.These statistics are compiled based on cases with a NACE Code of 5540. NACE Code 5540 is a classification that encompasses licensed bars, licensed premises and licensed vintners. The above statistics do not include audits carried out on hotels, restaurants and off-licences.I am further advised by the Revenue Commissioners that the operators of licensed premises are controlled and monitored for tax compliance purposes in the same way as taxpayers in all other sectors. Operators of licensed premises, like all taxpayers, are obliged to make accurate returns under the self-assessment system and are liable to Revenue audit in the normal way. I am assured by Revenue that the audit of licensed premises is an ongoing aspect of their work.The main focus of Revenue continues to be on selecting cases for intervention based on the presence of various risk indicators and other information available. This is the type of targeted intervention that gets best results and that is most likely to change the behaviour of the taxpayer into the future. The targeted approach is greatly enhanced by the computerised Risk Evaluation Analysis and Profiling System (REAP) developed by Revenue. This system categorises taxpayers in accordance with defined risk criteria. The system allows for the screening of all tax returns against sectoral and business norms and provides a selection basis for checks or audits. This effectively means that 100% of self-assessed taxpayers are risk-assessed a number of times a year. REAP contains considerable information on all self-assessed taxpayers, including operators of licensed premises.
#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-25 00:00:00	Prelude	596	As the Deputy is aware my Department is carrying out an impact assessment of the potential effects of amending, curtailing and/or abolishing property-based "legacy" tax reliefs in line with the commitment in the Programme for Government.  The impact assessment process is examining the benefits that may accrue to the Exchequer in terms of additional tax yield as well as consequences for investor groups and the wider economy arising from possible changes to the treatment of these reliefs.  The assessment process included a public consultation, which afforded all interested parties an opportunity to present their views and, resulted in the submission of over 700 individual responses.The response to the consultation is currently being appraised in tandem with research conducted as part of the overall impact assessment.  It is anticipated that the analysis of the submissions along with the results of the impact assessment process will be available for consideration in the context of the forthcoming budget.As is customary, I do not propose to comment in advance of the Budget on any matters that might be the subject of Budget decisions.
#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-25 00:00:00	Prelude	597	Part 5 of the Credit Institutions (Stabilisation) Act 2010 ("CIS Act") provides power to the Minister for Finance to transfer assets and/or liabilities of a "relevant institution" i.e., an institution within the scope of the CIS Act to another institution subject to the approval of the Court.  Part 5 of the Central Bank and Credit Institutions (Resolution) Act 2011 provides similar powers to the Central Bank in relation to the assets and/or liabilities of an "authorised credit institution" i.e., an institution within the scope of the 2011 Act to another institution subject to the approval of the Court. The Court would of course consider each case on its merits. It is not the role of the Minister to speculate on the way in which the Court would exercise its statutory functions. However I can highlight a number of provisions of the legislation that are pertinent, which may be of assistance to the Deputy. Section 34 of the CIS Act provides that once the procedures in section 33 of the Act in relation to a proposed transfer order have been completed, the Minister shall apply to the High Court for a transfer order.  Section 34 (2) provides that if the Court is satisfied that the requirements of section 33 have been complied with and that the opinion of the Minister under section 33(2) was reasonable and not vitiated by any error of law, it shall make a transfer order on the terms of the proposed transfer order. Section 34 (5)  provides that the Court may make a transfer order on terms varied or amended from those in the Minister’s proposed order where the Court is satisfied that (a) there has been non-compliance with any of the requirements of section 33 or that the opinion of the Minister under section 33(2) was unreasonable or vitiated by an error of law, (b) it would be appropriate to do so, and (c) to do so is necessary for any purpose of the Act. Subsection 33(2) stipulates that the Minister may make a proposed transfer order only if, having consulted with the Governor of the Central Bank, the Minister is of the opinion that, having regard to any adverse consequences that may arise as a result of the transfer order, in relation to the interests generally of the creditors of the transferor or, where the transferor is a subsidiary or holding company, in relation to the interests generally of the creditors of the transferor or the relevant institution concerned, making a transfer order in the terms of the proposed transfer order is necessary to secure the achievement of a purpose of the Act specified in the transfer order. Subsection 33(2A) provides that nothing in subsection 33(2) requires the Minister to consider the possible adverse consequences of the transfer order concerned on the interests of a particular creditor or class of creditors of the transferor or relevant institution, as the case may be, or to consider any submission made by a creditor on behalf of that creditor, a class of creditor or creditors generally.  The Deputy may also wish to note that section 36(1) of the CIS Act provides that the relevant institution which is the subject of a transfer order, or a member of it, may apply to the High Court, within a specified period, to have a transfer order set aside. Sections 36(3) and 36(4) provide that, on an application under section 36(1), if it is satisfied that there has been non-compliance with any of the requirements of section 33 (proposed transfer orders) or that the opinion of the Minister under section 33(2) was unreasonable or vitiated by an error of law the Court will set aside the transfer order or, if the Court is satisfied that it would be appropriate to do so, having regard to any report referred to in section 34(3)    [i.e., a report prepared by the Central Bank] and that to do so is necessary to achieve any purpose of the Act, make an order varying or amending that order in the manner it considers appropriate.Part 5 of the Central Bank and Credit Institutions (Resolution) Act 2011 contains similar provisions to those outlined above.
#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-25 00:00:00	Prelude	598	The Universal Social Charge (USC), which came into effect on 1 January 2011, is a tax payable on gross income (after any relief for certain trading losses and capital allowances, but before pension contributions).    An individual is liable to pay the USC if his/her gross income exceeds the threshold of €4,004 per annum.  USC is not levied on payments from the Department of Social Protection.  For 2011, the rates are:2% on the first €10,036;4% on the next €5,980;7% on the balance.Currently, the USC is calculated on a pay period by pay period basis.   This means that, where an individual's income from employment exceeds €77 per week, the employer will compute and deduct USC from the gross income due to the employee.  The rate at which it is deducted will depend on the gross income payable for that week.Where USC has been deducted and, either, the individual's gross income is below the threshold amount, or, the USC should have been charged at a lower rate, an overpayment will arise.If after the end of the year the taxpayer, who is the subject of the question, believes they have overpaid USC, they should contact their local Revenue office for a review of their USC deductions.  Following such review, any amount overpaid will be refunded to the taxpayer.

#CiaranCannon	unknown-#CiaranCannon-party	unknown-#CiaranCannon-dob	unknown-#CiaranCannon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-25 00:00:00	Prelude	605	My Department contacted FÁS about the apprenticeship status of the person in question. FÁS has advised that this person is a redundant Carpentry and Joinery apprentice.  In order to qualify as a craftsperson, a Carpentry and Joinery apprentice must be employed by a FÁS-approved employer and complete all seven alternating on-the-job and off-the-job phases of his/her apprenticeship, which is a minimum of four years (208 weeks) in duration from the date of registration, as well as achieving the qualifying standard throughout their apprenticeship.  The economic downturn has resulted in many apprentices being unable to complete their apprenticeships in the normal manner.  However, FÁS has introduced a range of initiatives to allow apprentices complete their apprenticeships without undermining the integrity of the apprenticeship system.  The Redundant Apprentice Scheme (RAPS) and the Competency Determination Mechanism (CDM) are two such initiatives.  The RAPS allows redundant apprentices to complete the on-the-job phases of their apprenticeship.  The CDM has been introduced by FÁS to enable eligible redundant apprentices to complete their apprenticeships, if they are short of the minimum time requirements.I understand that FÁS placed the person in question on the RAPS with Dublin City Council. I understand he has successfully completed the equivalent Phase 5 (26 weeks) of his apprenticeship with Dublin City Council and is currently on the equivalent Phase 7 (12 weeks) of his apprenticeship with Dublin City Council.  He is scheduled to complete his participation on RAPS on 2 December 2011.  The person requires an additional 11 weeks of employment to officially complete his apprenticeship.  He will be eligible to participate in the CDM.  FÁS has advised that in order to progress apprentices through CDM, it is imperative to operate a transparent and equitable scheduling system for eligible apprentices.  The FÁS CDM scheduling system is designed to call eligible apprentices on a longest waiting basis.  FÁS directly contacts eligible apprentices when their participation on RAPS is successfully completed and their apprenticeship status returns to ‘Redundant'.  FÁS will offer the person in question an opportunity to participate in CDM when he successfully completes RAPS and his apprenticeship status returns to ‘Redundant' on a longest waiting basis.

#RuairiQuinn	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-party	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-dob	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-25 00:00:00	Prelude	609	As the Deputy will be aware, the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) is responsible, through its network of local Special Educational Needs Organisers, for allocating teaching staff and Special Needs Assistants (SNAs) to special schools to support children with special educational needs.  The NCSE operates within my Departments criteria in allocating such support.  My Department's Circular 0042/2011 was issued in June this year to notify school management authorities of the staffing arrangements which would apply in special schools in the 2011-12 school year.  The circular states that there are a small number of special schools which have significant excess teacher posts and that the NCSE may therefore contact such schools to review the individual circumstances in these schools.  The circular indicated that the NCSE may suppress a post in schools which have excess teaching posts in order to create a post in a school which does not have excess posts and which has growing pupil numbers.The special school referred to by the Deputy caters for pupils with severe or profound disability and ASD.  The correct teacher allocation ratio for schools catering for children with severe and profound disability is 6:1.  In 2010-11, the school had seven approved class teaching posts, three surplus teaching posts and 28 SNAs.  The enrolment is 38 pupils, including nine children newly enrolled for September 2011.  One of the surplus teachers retired at the end of the last school year and the school is not eligible for a replacement.  A further surplus post has been withdrawn leaving the school with one surplus post above recommended staffing allocation levels.  It is the position of both my Department and the NCSE that given the exceptionally high levels of teaching and support staff which have been allocated to the school, that notwithstanding the outcome of any review, the school has sufficient support within its overall allocation to enable it to provide for the teaching and care support requirements of all of the children enrolled to the school.
#RuairiQuinn	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-party	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-dob	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-25 00:00:00	Prelude	610	The criteria used for the allocation of teachers to schools is published annually on my Department's website.  The key factor for determining the level of staffing resources provided at individual school level is the staffing schedule for the relevant school year and pupil enrolments on the previous 30 September. The staffing schedule for the 2011-12 school year was published on my Department's website in March 2011.  While mainstream staffing for any school year is based on the previous September's enrolment, there is a provision whereby schools experiencing rapid increases in enrolment can apply for additional mainstream posts on developing grounds, using projected enrolment.  The retention of such posts in the current school year is subject to schools having achieved their projected enrolment on 30 September.  If the enrolment is not achieved, the post allocated on developing grounds is suppressed.  The staffing schedule includes an appeals mechanism for schools to submit an appeal under certain criteria to an independent appeals board.  Details of the criteria for appeal are contained in the staffing schedule, Circular 0019/2011.  The primary staffing appeals board will consider appeals shortly, including those against the suppression of posts that were allocated on developing grounds.  At that stage, the allocation process will be fully completed for all mainstream classroom teaching posts and those allocated on developing grounds.  The appeals board operates independently of the Department and its decision is final.

In 2005, my Department issued a circular letter to all primary school authorities urging them to make their facilities available, where possible, for community and recreation purposes. Any proposal for the use of school facilities outside of normal school hours must be approved by the local school management authority in the first instance and where appropriate, arrangements are put in place to reimburse the school for any additional expenditure incurred by the school associated with such usage.

Westmeath and Co. Longford VECs are very closely matched.  However, I am satisfied that geographically Mullingar is the most favourable location for the headquarters.  I expect that headquarters staff of Co. Longford VEC will move to the designated headquarters location in Mullingar as soon as feasible, although, a sub-office will be maintained in Longford for the immediate term in order to facilitate an orderly merger.  The detail in relation to the use or disposal of existing property interests in Longford, following the move of staff to the newly designated headquarters in Mullingar, will be worked through by my Department in conjunction with the VECs involved and the new merged body when established.Staff employed in the VEC headquarters are public servants and under the terms of the Croke Park agreement, such staff employed in a permanent capacity cannot be made compulsorily redundant.  However, surplus staff may be redeployed. In common with all areas of the public service, VECs are subject to an Employment Control Framework (ECF). This places an upper limit on the number of staff which a public service organisation can have.  Both VECs have each been set ECF targets to be achieved by the end of 2011. Redeployment arrangements to bring about the staffing reductions required to meet ECF limits will be agreed in accordance with the principles of the Croke Park agreement and will involve the unions representative of the grades concerned.

For example, HETAC and FETAC both charge award fees and HETAC charges providers a fee for programme validation and for agreement of quality assurance procedures. Universities, together with the Higher Education Authority, currently fund the IUQB, and so contribute to the cost of their external quality assurance. NQAI, through ACELS, charges an annual fee for recognition/renewal of recognition for English Language Schools and fees for inspections.The Qualifications and Quality Assurance (Education and Training) Bill enables fees be charged in relation to the following functions of the Qualifications and Quality Assurance Authority of Ireland (QQAAI):Submission and review of quality assurance procedures;Application for, and review of, validation by QQAAI of a programme;The making of an award;Request for, and review of, delegation of authority;Submission and review of procedures for access, transfer and progression of learners;Authorisation to use the International Education Mark;Review of compliance with the Code of Practice on international education, and use of the    International Education Mark;Lodging an appeal.The services for which fees will be charged and the level of those fees have not yet been determined.  The payment of fees to qualifications and quality assurance bodies is part of broader overall compliance and service costs to providers.  There will be savings for providers who currently deal with more than one of the existing bodies and incur costs in complying with currently   divergent policies and procedures.The establishment of QQAAI will result in savings to the Exchequer. It should be noted that NQAI, HETAC and FETAC have already delivered very significant savings since the announcement of the amalgamation in October 2008 through implementation of the moratorium and through expenditure reduction across their range of activities.  The bodies' exchequer allocation for current expenditure in 2011 (€8.823m) is approximately 30% lower than outturn in 2008. Further savings to the Exchequer of €1 million per annum will be achieved over time through further staff reductions in accordance with the Employment Control Framework, through rationalised corporate structures and supports and through integration of services.

The suitability of this site will need to be assessed and my Department has made initial contact with the relevant land owner regarding this site.The acquisition of a suitable site and the provision of a new school will be considered in the context of existing commitments and other competing demands on the Department's capital budget.

It is normally envisaged that landlords would be responsible for the repair and upkeep of rented school accommodation.  Therefore schools in rented accommodation do not qualify for funding under my Department's Summer Works Scheme or Emergency Works Scheme and this is outlined in these schemes.My Department is currently developing a template contract to ensure that these type of issues will be clearly agreed in future leases.If an application for funding is received from a school housed in rented accommodation that application would be considered based on the lease in place between the landlord and the school authority.
#RuairiQuinn	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-party	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-dob	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-25 00:00:00	Prelude	627	I wish to advise the Deputy that the 1998 Education Act provides the legal framework for the delivery of education to children through recognised schools. All recognised schools are legally owned by the school patrons or trustees and managed by a school's Board of Management which is also the employer of teachers in a school.While the Minister for Education and Skills provides funding and policy direction for schools, neither I nor officials of my Department have powers to investigate individual complaints, except where the complaint involves a refused enrolment, expulsion or suspension, in accordance with Section 29 of the 1998 Education Act.If a parent wishes to make a complaint against a teacher or school they should contact the relevant school authorities. The complaint procedures adopted by most schools are those that have been agreed between the teacher unions and school management bodies. If a parent has a complaint about a teacher or about the school, the first step is to speak to the class teacher, if the complaint is not resolved, the parent should then speak to the school principal. If the complaint is not resolved at this stage the parent can lodge the complaint in writing with the chairperson of the school's Board of Management/Single Manager/VEC.If the parent has exhausted the school's complaints procedure and the complaint has not been resolved, the parent can make an appeal to the Ombudsman for Children. The Office of the Ombudsman for Children may independently investigate complaints about schools recognised with the Department of Education and Skills, provided the parent has firstly and fully followed the school's complaints procedures. The key criterion for any intervention by the Ombudsman for Children is that the action of the School has had a negative affect on a child.I understand that the complaint in question has been referred to the Ombudsman for Children's office. Further guidance to parents on progressing a concern in relation their child's school is available on the Guide to Services Page of my Department's website at www.education.ie

#RuairiQuinn	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-party	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-dob	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-25 00:00:00	Prelude	630	Applications under the Home Tuition scheme are made to my Department by the person in whose care the child is at the time of application through their local office of the National Educational Welfare Board. In this case the National Educational Welfare Board informed my Department that home tuition was being sought for a child at primary level. My Department approved the home tuition as sought.  The tutor is engaged by the person whose application has been approved. The  grant is claimed in arrears by the approved person. The level of the grant is  based on the number of hours of tuition provided and a rate of pay which is  based on the tutor's registration status with the Teaching Council and their  qualifications. Two rates of pay apply a standard rate where the tutor is both  registered with the Teaching Council and qualified at the level at which the  application for tuition has been made, i.e. primary or post-primary. A lower  modified rate applies where the tutor does not satisfy both of these  requirements.   My Department inadvertently paid the home tuition grant at the post-primary  standard rate and not at the modified rate. When this administrative error was  identified my Department wrote to the person in whose care the child was at the  time to notify them of what had happened and advising them of the arrangements  for this overpayment to be recovered by offsetting it against subsequent grant  payments in this case. A copy of this letter was also circulated to the tutor.  My Department is satisfied that at this stage there is no overpayment or  underpayment of the total amount of grant payment for this child's home  tuition.
#RuairiQuinn	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-party	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-dob	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-25 00:00:00	Prelude	631	Following the closure of the school occupying the site referred to by the  Deputy in 2007, the City of Dublin VEC was requested by my Department to  oversee and manage, on a caretaker basis, the entire site.  It is my intention to lease this former community school site, including the sports complex referred to by the Deputy, to the City of Dublin VEC.  My Department has requested the VEC to ensure that the club referred to by the Deputy continues to have use of the sports facility following execution of the lease.   I am advised that the VEC has provided a draft user agreement to the club for  their consideration in anticipation of concluding legal formalities with my  Department in the near future.  I understand that this draft user agreement  recognises the club's current position as a user of the sports facility outside  of school hours.  I am advised that the VEC and the club will meet this week to  discuss the draft user agreement further.     In relation to providing a letter of comfort in relation to future use of the  sports facility, given that a user agreement, providing for use of the sports  facility by the club, has already been drafted, it is my Department's view that  this is no longer considered necessary.

#RuairiQuinn	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-party	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-dob	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-25 00:00:00	Prelude	634	The Professional Development Service for Teachers (PDST) National Coordinator post for support for the Leaving Cert Applied (LCA) programme in post-primary schools was vacated at the start of this school year.  Given recent changing priorities and developments in relation to continuing  professional development (CPD), notably the Department's literacy and numeracy  strategy, as well as pressure on personnel numbers, it is not intended to fill  the National Coordinator vacancy at the present time. However, the levels of resources including personnel available to the PDST are being increased for the 2011/2012 school year.  The PDST was established to provide the organisational structures and the flexibility necessary to respond to changing need. The key task of the PDST is  to build capacity at all levels within the organisation and among teachers but  in particular at advisor and associate level to ensure that CPD needs can be  identified and responded to in an effective way within the resources provided.  It is proposed to continue to provide for service in the LCA area, with the  co-ordination of activities taken over by other personnel within the PDST and  with the professional side (i.e course content/delivery/training of  facilitators etc) handled by the 2 PDST advisors who are currently working in  this area.     The PDST have prepared a comprehensive programme of support for schools engaged in the LCA programme in the current year which includes sessions for new schools and new LCA coordinators and a number of workshops, whole staff  supports and web based supports amongst other items. They are also actively  looking at further developing their network of part time personnel to further  expand the proposed provision.
#RuairiQuinn	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-party	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-dob	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-25 00:00:00	Prelude	635	The Deputy will be aware that the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) is responsible, through its network of local Special Educational Needs Organisers (SENOs) for allocating resource teachers and Special Needs Assistants (SNAs) to schools to support children with special educational needs. The NCSE operates within my Department's criteria in allocating such support. This now includes a requirement for the NCSE to have regard to an overall cap on the number of SNA posts.  The NCSE has now advised all mainstream schools of their SNA allocation for the current school year, taking into account the care needs of qualifying pupils  attending the school. The school in question has currently been allocated 1 full time SNA post and 86.4 Resource Teacher hours  The NCSE has recently published statistical information in relation to the  allocation of SNA posts and resource teaching hours to Primary Special and Post  Primary Schools. The information is provided on a county by county and school  by school basis on its website at www.ncse.ie.  The NCSE has a retained capacity to respond to emergency cases, or where  additional care needs arise for schools as a result of new school enrolments,  injuries or diagnoses, during the school year, in the context of existing SNA  provision in the school.   The NCSE will advise schools in the near future of a process to review allocation decisions to ensure that correct procedures were followed and that they comply with my Department’s policy. The merits of individual allocation decisions will not be open to appeal under this mechanism.  In relation to the allocation of individual Resource Teaching hours, the  position is that for the 2011/12 school year, an allocation of 90% of valid  identified resource teaching allocations has been made by the NCSE to schools,  including the school referred to by the Deputy, in the first instance, to  provide schools with the majority of their allocation, while also preserving  enough capacity to deal with late applications and ensure that my Department  remains within Employment Control Framework obligations.   Schools have now been asked to forward any outstanding applications, or  additional outstanding materials to support incomplete applications, to the  NCSE for consideration.   Consideration is currently being given as to whether there is potential to  revise the 90% allocation previously given to schools, and also the extent to  which new Resource Teaching allocations can be made, taking into account the  number of valid new applications received and in the context of my Departments  Employment Control Framework obligations.

The NCSE operates within my Department's criteria in allocating such support.   My Departments criteria in relation to the allocation of SNA support is set out in Circular 07/02. Special Needs Assistants are allocated to schools to cater for the care needs of children who have an assessed special educational need.  Schools then manage and deploy the SNA resources which have been allocated to them to provide for the care needs of designated pupils.   Circular 0006/2011 which was issued by my Department in January of this year  sets out the revised arrangements for the allocation by the NCSE of SNA posts  with reference to the cap on the number of posts.  In considering applications for SNA support, or any review of the level of SNA  support which has been provided to schools, SENOs actively engage with both  schools and parents to consider the level of SNA support which may be required  to meet the care needs of the children concerned, taking into account the level  of SNA support currently available to the school.   The NCSE also has a retained capacity to respond to emergency cases, or where  additional care needs arise for schools as a result of new school enrolments,  injuries or diagnoses, during the school year, in the context of existing SNA  provision in the school.   The NCSE will advise schools in the near future of a process to review  allocation decisions to ensure that correct procedures were followed and that  they comply with my Department's policy. The merits of individual allocation decisions will not be open to appeal under this mechanism.  My Department's Circular 37/2011 sets out the arrangements for the 2011/12  school year for the allocation of Resource Teaching hours for children with  assessed special educational needs.  Finally, the NCSE has issued circulars 01/11 and 02/11 setting out details  regarding criteria surrounding allocations and the timeframes for applying for  supports for pupils for the 2011/12 school year.

This particular document is provided to assist school authorities with the engagement of consultants and to ensure that any consultants employed are competent and qualified in the appropriate disciplines to carry out the works that they are appointed to do. This document also provides for the appointment of other consultants depending on the nature of the works to be grant aided. TGD 008 provide a balanced approach by allowing access for smaller firms while  also ensuring that appropriate consultants are engaged for small works. I do not propose to make any changes.

The student contribution replaces the Student Services Charge and applies  to all students who benefit under the free fees scheme.  In recognition of the financial pressures that the student contribution may place on families, my Department requested higher education institutions to consider putting in place arrangements under which a student may opt to pay the student contribution in two instalments in a given academic year. I have again asked the Higher Education Authority to request institutions to allow the  payment of the contribution in two moieties.  While a few institutions do not have this facility at present due to technical/systems limitations and administrative issues that make it impractical to allow for payment by instalments, all institutions have been requested to accommodate students who present with financial difficulties on a  case by case basis and, from the academic year 2012/13 onwards, to have systems  in place that allow for the payment of the student contribution in two  instalments.

The accommodation brief for the project is currently being finalised and the next step, following completion of this process, involves the appointment of a Design Team.   There are certain constraints relating to the site in terms of a protected structure and associated conservation issues.  Any substantial issues relating to these constraints will be addressed at the design and planning stages as the project proceeds through the architectural planning process.   The progression of all large scale building projects, including this project, from initial design stage through to construction phase will be considered in the context of the Department's multi-annual School Building and Modernisation  Programme. However, in light of current competing demands on the Department's capital budget, it is not possible to give an indicative timeframe for the completion of all aspects of the project at this time.   The current status of all projects on the school building programme may be viewed on my Department's website at www.education.ie and this will be updated  regularly throughout the year.  In the meantime, my Department has approved funding for emergency works to the existing protected structure.  These works commenced during summer 2011.

In respect of Vocational Education Committees, including Co Wexford VEC, positions other than teacher and SNA posts in schools, and teacher equivalents  that are directly providing tuition to pupils in schools, in special programmes  or in adult and further education, are comprehended by this decision. It is a matter for each VEC to implement work prioritisation across different functions, and to deploy available staff to execute those functions.  My Department received correspondence in June 2011 from Co Wexford VEC  requesting sanction to fill an additional caretaker post and increase the  number of cleaning hours at Enniscorthy Vocational College. In response my  Department informed the Chief Executive Officer that under the terms of the  moratorium those posts could not be filled and recommended that Co Wexford VEC  reallocate or reorganises work or staff according to its priorities.

The BTEA scheme was established to assist people who have been out of the workforce for some time and whose opportunities of obtaining employment would be enhanced by participation in the scheme. In this regard, I understand that there is a requirement to be in receipt of a relevant social welfare payment for a minimum period of time.  Effectively, the BTEA scheme enables continued payment of the full rate of social protection benefit or allowance so that, for example, an unemployed person will continue to be supported to enable him/her to upskill and move back into employment.  The student grant scheme has a different target group, for example, school leavers and mature learners who wish to return to education and the maintenance portion of the grant represents a contribution towards the living costs of the student.  While there have been changes in the eligibility criteria for certain  rates of maintenance grant, student grant recipients continue to have their  tuition fees and/or student contribution paid in addition to any maintenance  payment.  Students within this group on particularly low incomes may also qualify for a top-up in the higher, special rate of maintenance grant.  Independent mature students who have been unemployed or who qualify for a relevant social protection payment may opt to hold the BTEA, but may also apply for additional support for their tuition fees and/or student contribution under the student grant scheme.

For planning purposes the country was divided into geographic districts each with several primary schools feeding into a post-primary centre with one or more post-primary schools. The intention was and continues to be that these defined districts facilitate the orderly planning of school provision and accommodation needs.   Enrolment in individual post-primary schools is the responsibility of the  managerial authority of those schools and my Department does not seek to  intervene in decisions made by schools in such matters. My Department's main  responsibility is to ensure that schools in an area can, between them, cater  for all pupils seeking places. This may result, however, in some pupils not  obtaining a place in the school of their first choice.

In accordance with the Act, the personal remuneration of the current President is €325,507 p.a. and is subject to the normal income tax code including the Universal Social Charge. The remuneration of the current President is protected under the Constitution by virtue of Article 12.11.3 which provides that the emoluments and allowances of the President shall not be reduced while in Office.In line with its stated intention to provide for reduced salary rates for new members of the judiciary, the Government has provided for a revised rate of pay of €249,014 to apply to the person who takes up the office of President following the enactment and commencement of the Single Pension Scheme and Remuneration Bill, 2011.  That Bill is currently before the Oireachtas.Under the legislation the President also receives an allowance related to the Office of €317,434 p.a. which meets the expenses incurred in providing for state functions etc.I acknowledge that notwithstanding the Constitutional protection afforded to the emoluments of the President while in Office, the current President has voluntarily waived sums due in respect of her entitlements under the legislation. A similar facility will be open to the new President on election.

The overriding imperative is the absolute requirement to achieve major savings in all areas of expenditure and to reduce staff numbers and administrative overheads.  This underscores the need for radical streamlining of bodies, abolishing those bodies whose remit is no longer essential and amalgamation of other agencies or sharing of services between bodies, so that public services and functions can be delivered more cost-effectively.

There are six bodies in total, comprising Waterways Ireland, the Food Safety Promotion Board, the Trade and Business Development Body, the Special EU Programmes Body, the North/South Language Body and the Foyle, Carlingford and Irish Lights Commission (Loughs Agency).Five of the six bodies are affiliated to the North/South Pension Scheme (NSPS), with membership being compulsory for southern-based staff. The exception is the Foyle, Carlingford and Irish Lights Commission (Loughs Agency), which has stayed outside the NSPS, and whose staff have other pension arrangements. Tourism Ireland is also affiliated to the scheme.Much of the original staffing of the North/South bodies was provided by way of compulsory transfer of persons already employed in the Irish public service. Under the Implementation Bodies agreement between the Irish and British Governments, the pension terms of such staff were protected insofar as those terms were to be not less favourable than the terms they held just before their transfer, for example, Irish civil service pension terms.Persons who benefitted from this pension protection and who have not opted to switch to other pension terms are categorized as Reserved Rights members of the NSPS.  This means that their pension terms are as applying in the prior public service employment at the date of transfer; this reflects the wider guarantee of "no less favourable" treatment for transferees. This effectively means, among other things, that their years of service for pension purposes are transferred.Certain transferred persons in NSPS-affiliated Implementation Bodies who benefitted from this pension protection have since opted to avail of a once-off option to switch from Reserved Rights NSPS membership to the mainstream membership category in the NSPS, which is known as Core Terms. This is the default scheme variant for directly-hired employees of NSPS-affiliated Bodies; it provides non-co-ordinated pensions, which means that the occupational pension is not reduced by reference to the State Pension, along with inflation-linkage for post-retirement increases.

#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-25 00:00:00	Prelude	658	The Secretary General is the Civil Service Head of a Government Department.  The duties and responsibilities of a Secretary General are set out in the Public Service Management Act 1997.  Secretaries General are responsible for managing their Department subject to the policy direction of their Minister.  Their responsibilities include producing a Strategy Statement in respect of the Department for the Minister, reporting on its implementation, providing advice to the Minister and ensuring the resources of the Department are used appropriately and effectively. The Secretary General supports the Minister in the carrying out of the latter's duties and responsibilities as a member of the Government and as political head of the Department.The Minister's key conduit of contact with the overall organisational arrangements for the Department should be through the Secretary General.While Secretaries General are responsible for implementing the Performance Management and Development System (PMDS) within their Departments they, in their own posts, are not formally part of the process. However, there is a body of procedures against which the performance of the Secretary General can be assessed.The principal framework for assessing the performance of Secretaries General is the Departmental Strategy Statement which is submitted to the Minister. This, in conjunction with the Annual Output Statements which are submitted to the Minister each year, provide information to allow for an assessment of the organisation's performance in meeting objectives. The Annual Output Statements make explicit what the public can expect to see delivered, in terms of public service outputs and outcomes, from the public moneys that are voted to them by the Dáil each year. These Output Statements are considered by the relevant Dáil Select Committees alongside their consideration of the Annual Estimates. For the 2011 Estimates, the Annual Output Statements were superseded with a new ‘performance budgeting' initiative, involving the integration of the key output/outcome information alongside the financial allocations within the Departmental Estimate itself.  This approach, which was piloted for the Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform and Agriculture Groups of Votes, is being rolled out more generally for the 2012 Estimates.  The overall intention, in line with Government Programme commitments, is to heighten the focus upon overall performance and delivery by Departments and Offices, and improve accountability by office-holders for the achievement of results.In most cases, the Secretary General is also the Accounting Officer for the Department with statutory responsibility for preparing the Appropriation Accounts for the Department and giving evidence before the Public Accounts Committee in relation to the management of public funds.As regards the Secretary General's Accounting Officer function there is a rigorous independent examination of regularity, propriety and value for money by the Comptroller and Auditor General and the Public Accounts Committee. The Comptroller and Auditor General also carries out individual VFM examinations on the economy and efficiency with which a Department uses its resources.These review and evaluation processes are critical in promoting a culture of continuous performance improvement.

The figures include PAYE taxpayers who are required to return an income tax return Form 11 where non-PAYE income is greater than €3,174, and do not segregate earnings from public sources and those from other sources. Therefore, the earnings figures shown may include income from non public-sector sources.The data also include various forms of income from public sources to groups that would not normally be regarded as being employed within the public service, e.g. those receiving fees, those on State Boards etc. On the basis of the available tax-based data it is not possible to identify and exclude income from public sources to groups that would not normally be regarded as employed within the public service or to distinguish the earnings of employees associated with atypical work patterns. Accordingly, it is likely that the number of lower paid public servants is overstated. On this basis the total numbers of public sector employees, and the breakdown of those numbers by income ranges, is set out as follows.Income Tax Year 2009 Range of Gross incomePublic Sector EmployeesTotal Number€0 — €20,000105,745€20,001 — €30,00068,202€30,001 — €40,00075,717€40,001 — €50,00063,026€50,001 — €60,00039,650€60,001 — €70,00024,294€70,001 — €80,00016,647€80,001 — €90,00010,822€90,001 — €100,0007,295€100,001 — €120,0008,472€120,001 — €150,0005,194€150,001 — €200,0002,026€200,001 — €250,000704€250,001 — €300,000419€300,001 — €350,000277€350,001 — €400,000146€400,001 — €500,000132Over €500,00077Totals428,845The earnings data in the table relate to 2009 which does not reflect the pay reduction introduced for public servants from January 2010 (ranging from 5% to 20%) or the subsequent measures introduced by the current Government further reducing the pay of Office Holders and introducing a general pay ceiling of €200,000 for future appointments to higher positions across the public service, a general pay ceiling of €250,000 for future appointments to CEO posts within Commercial State Companies and a voluntary waiver system of up to 15% for current post holders who have salaries in excess of the relevant pay ceiling.

It is anticipated that there could be a large increase in the number of retirements of staff in the run up to the end of the "grace period" i.e. the period during which the calculation of pension is unaffected by the pay reductions applied under the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest (No 2) Act 2009  . In order to protect public services it is critical that management in each of the sectors have knowledge of the numbers of staff retiring and the business areas that will be affected by potentially large scale departures.We are also required under the terms of our Memorandum of Understanding with the EU/ECB/IMF to make quarterly returns on the progress being made in relation to reductions in numbers. Accurate and early information on intended retirements will be an important part of this reporting requirement. It will provide information on whether the reduction in the public service pay bill arising from impending retirements is sufficient to meet our commitments under the Memorandum of Understanding.In light of the potential demands on HR and pensions sections across the Public Service, the three month notice period will also allow time to process applications for retirement.  While the three month notice period has no direct legal force, where staff fail to give the full three months notice it may result in a delay in the payment of their pension benefit.The three month notice period was introduced specifically to deal with retirements coming up to February 2012 and further instructions will issue in relation to the notice period for retirements which take place after 29 February 2012.

The information requested by the Deputy in respect of those Agencies that have a Board structure and separate staff complement is set out in Table 1.In relation to the two Offices of the Department, the Office of the Registrar of Friendly Societies and the Patents Office, their staffing requirements are met from within the overall staff allocation for my Department. As regards the other organisations listed, namely:Advisory Council for Science, Technology and Innovation,Expert Group on Future Skills Needs,Irish National Accreditation Board,Management Development Council,National Competitiveness Council,Office of the Chief Scientific Adviser to the Government,these are representative advisory Groups and Councils for which the Department or one of its Agencies provides secretariat support. The Department may, where appropriate, be represented on these bodies. The costs associated with these bodies are, in general, met from the resource allocations of the Department or of the Agency that hosts the Groups. However, the Expert Group on Future Skills Needs (EGFSN) reports jointly to me and to the Minister for Education and Skills.  The costs of the EGFSN are met from the National Training Fund, which is administered by the Minister for Education and Skills.Information in relation to the Irish Takeover Panel is being collated and I will arrange to forward it to the Deputy at the earliest opportunity.Finally, I can advise the Deputy that, in March 2010, in light of the recommendations in the "McCarthy Report", a decision was taken that transferred the funding allocation previously made available by this Department in respect of the Irish Council for Bioethics (ICB) to the Department of Health and Children. Subsequently, as part of the programme for agency rationalisation and in line with the Government decision taken last year to dissolve the Council, I understand that an application seeking voluntary strike-off of the company was lodged with the Companies Registration Office in February of this year.AgencyNo. of WTE StaffNo. of Board MembersRemuneration PackagesAgency Wage Bill (2011 Est)Total Agency Exchequer Funding (2011 Est)InterTradeIreland1

#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	21408	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-25 00:00:00	Prelude	667	On 26 July 2011 the Government agreed a package of radical reforms to the Joint Labour Committee and Registered Employment Agreement wage setting mechanisms. The reform proposals deal with recommendations made and issues raised in the Independent Report on the JLC/REA systems (Duffy/Walsh report) as well as the outcome of the recent High Court ruling in the Grace Fried Chicken constitutional challenge.The proposed measures will provide for the retention of the JLC and REA systems, subject to the reforms that are required to place them on a more secure legal and constitutional footing. They will also reinstate a robust system of protection for workers in these sectors in the aftermath of the High Court ruling.Heads of a Bill to give effect to the reform proposals have been prepared by the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, agreed by Government, and communicated to the Attorney General, who has agreed to give the highest priority to drafting this legislation. It is my intention to have a Bill ready to introduce to the Oireachtas at the earliest possible opportunity this term.
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	21408	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2011-10-25 00:00:00	Prelude	668	I propose to take Questions Nos. 223 and 239 together.As evidenced by previous replies to the Deputy in relation to this matter over the last 4 weeks (replies dated 20, 27 and 28 September and 11 October refer) I am aware that a number of Industrial and Provident societies have failed to file annual returns to the Registry of Friendly Societies, and of the legislative position with regard to same.The initiation of enforcement action is a matter for the Registrar of Friendly Societies, and I have previously advised the Deputy that the Registrar is now considering such action in respect of Industrial and Provident societies, following on from targeted enforcement campaigns in 2010 and 2011 of Friendly Societies and Trade Unions.It is not the practice of the Registrar to publish lists of societies in instances where enforcement action is under consideration.  In the event that enforcement action is taken against a society notice is published in Iris Oifigiúil, and in the next subsequent Annual Report of the Registrar of Friendly Societies, which lists societies that are cancelled during that year.  The Registry also holds the individual file of each society, the information on which is available for inspection by the public.  It is open to the Deputy to make enquiries to the Registry of Friendly Societies regarding any individual named society.

In the case of the remaining non-commercial State agencies coming under my Department's remit, the employees are paid out of Exchequer funds, subject to the following exceptions and clarifications:-ForfásForfás has one fixed term contract position, located with the Discover Science & Engineering Programme, the funding for which is provided by the European Space Agency.  The salary cost of three members of Forfás staff, based with the Irish National Accreditation Board (INAB) is met through fee income generated from accreditation activities. In addition, the partial cost of a small number of other staff, supporting the work of the Expert Group on Future Skills Needs, (equivalent to approx 2.5 full time equivalents) is met from the National Training Fund.Irish Auditing and Accounting Supervisory Authority (IAASA):Pursuant to section 14 of the Companies (Auditing and Accounting) Act 2003, a grant not exceeding 40% of IAASA's programme of expenditure is provided by the Exchequer. The remaining 60% is funded by a levy on each prescribed accountancy body that is subject to the supervision of IAASA. The exception to this framework is the funding for IAASA's functions under the Transparency (Directive 2004/109/EC) Regulations 2007 (S.I. 277 of 2007) which is provided solely by the Exchequer.National Consumer AgencyThe payroll of 20 staff on secondment to the National Consumer Agency from the Central Bank is funded by the financial services sector by means of a levy. The payroll is managed by the Central Bank on behalf of the National Consumer Agency. All other staff of the Agency are paid directly from the Exchequer.InterTradeIrelandTwo-thirds of InterTradeIreland's costs are paid from the Vote of the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation. One-third of the body's costs are paid by the Northern Ireland Department of Enterprise, Trade and InvestmentThe National Standards Authority of Ireland (NSAI)The Exchequer grant to the National Standards Authority of Ireland is solely for payroll purposes. However, the amount allocated equates to approximately 47% of the total payroll costs incurred by the organisation. The remainder is funded from own resourced income through fees charged for standards and certification services.
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	21408	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-25 00:00:00	Prelude	670	My Department does not provide direct funding or grants to businesses but rather provides funding to a number of State Agencies, including the County and City Enterprise Boards (CEBs) and Enterprise Ireland, through whom assistance is delivered directly to businesses.  The role of the CEBs throughout the country is to provide a source of support for micro-enterprise in the start-up and expansion phases, to promote and develop indigenous micro-enterprise potential and to stimulate economic activity and entrepreneurship at local level.  The CEBs unique role positions them as a first point of contact for persons wishing to set up in business. The Boards give priority to manufacturing and internationally traded services, and support micro-enterprise businesses through both financial (grants) and non-financial (advice, training and mentoring) "soft supports", subject to certain eligibility criteria and  provided that the proposed projects have the capacity to achieve commercial viability.CEBs can assist in the establishment, and/or development, of new and existing micro-enterprise businesses subject to the following main eligibility criteria:the enterprise must be in the commercial sphere;the enterprise must demonstrate a market for the product/service;the enterprise must have a capacity for growth and new job creation;the enterprise must not employ more than 10 people;the enterprise must not give rise to deadweight or displacement.It is considered inappropriate to support areas such as retail enterprises, personal services (e.g. hairdressers, gardeners, etc), professional services (accountants, solicitors, etc) lacking export potential, construction, etc, as it is considered that these generally give rise to unacceptable deadweight (where projects would have proceeded anyway) and/or displacement (where the projects simply displace business from other players in the market) concerns.Longford CEB have advised me that the business promoter has availed of the soft supports offered by the CEB and, whilst not every business may be eligible for direct financial grant support, the services of the CEB remain available to the business as appropriate and the promoter is therefore advised to remain in contact with the CEB going forward.  The Board may be contacted at: Longford County Enterprise Board, Longford Enterprise Centre, Templemichael, Ballinalee Road, Longford. Phone: 043 3342757, Email: info@longfordceb.ie.

The information from 2007 to end-October 2010 had already been collated in response to a previous Parliamentary Question that consumed considerable resources within my Department at the time. Information relating to the year 2006 is not readily available and the compilation of this information dating back more than five years would consume a disproportionate amount of resources in my Department at a time of significant work pressure. However, if the Deputy considers that the information relating to 2006 is particularly relevant and essential, I will arrange for the relevant data to be provided in due course.In general, as with all Government Departments, my Department obtains most of its legal advice through the services of the Office of the Attorney General, although certain Offices of my Department, for example, the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement and the Companies Registration Office, employ dedicated legal expertise given the specialised nature of the work involved.Name of Company/ PayeePurposeCost(€)Was Competitive Tendering Process Held?

I also understand from my colleague the Minister for Justice and Equality that his Department has been in contact with the Commissioner of An Garda Síochána with a view to monitoring the situation.

#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	21408	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2011-10-25 00:00:00	Prelude	675	I propose to take Questions Nos. 230 and 231 together.IDA is an autonomous agency set up by statute with a mandate to attract foreign direct investment from manufacturing and internationally-traded services companies into Ireland, and to support new and existing FDI operations so as to maximise the related industrial employment, output, exports, economy expenditures including wages, and corporation tax contributions.The management and location of IDA staff is a day-to-day operational matter for the Agency and not one in which I have a function.  IDA decides where it needs its resources in order that it can meet its strategic goals.  IDA Ireland's strategy, "Horizon 2020” sets out the Agency’s targets for direct job creation in the FDI sector to 2014 of 62,000 direct jobs in 640 investment projects over the period, resulting in an additional 105,000 jobs overall in the economy.  In implementing this ambitious strategy the Agency has also set specific regional goals ofSecuring 50% of all investments into locations outside of Dublin and Cork.Transforming the existing FDI base across the country to develop, retain and grow employment in client companies operating here.In the context of achieving successful implementation of its strategy and challenging job creation targets, IDA is maximising efficiency through increasing the organisation's focus on business generation/client facing activities, which will ultimately benefit all regions. During 2010, a Business Transformation Process was carried out in IDA, which examined every job in the organisation.  The outcome provided opportunities to free up staff resources for core business generation activities and needs to ensure that IDA meets its job targets.The Agency informs me that the North West Region was in the unique position of having 2 offices; one in Letterkenny and one in Sligo.  These have now been merged into one North West regional office in Sligo where the new North West Regional manager will be based, when appointed.  IDA continues to have two people working out of the Letterkenny office and informs me that no staff cuts have taken place in Letterkenny.Under the National Spatial Strategy, Letterkenny is one of 9 Gateway locations and will continue to be a key location of focus for the winning of foreign direct investments.  The North West Region has 36 IDA client companies employing almost 5,000 people.  Indeed, Letterkenny had 2 key client announcements in the past year with the 200 person expansion of United Health Group, who now employ over 400 people, and Zeus, who expanded their manufacturing facility and will create 75 additional jobs.  Examples of other client companies in Letterkenny are Pramerica with 800 employees; Sita, 90 employees; Medisize, 140 employees and Abbot with 140 employees.
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	21408	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-25 00:00:00	Prelude	676	The Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act 2005 (No. 10 of 2005) requires every employer to ensure, in so far as is reasonably practicable, the safety health and welfare at work of his or her employees.  The employer's duty extends to the design, provision and maintenance of plant and machinery or any other articles that are safe and without risk to health.Regulation 30, of Safety, Health and Welfare at Work (General Application) Regulations 2007 (S.I. No. 299 of 2007), is concerned with inspection of work equipment both permanently installed and also equipment that is moved from place to place requiring assembly each time. Work equipment can be subject to a wide range of causes of deterioration which in turn can present workplace hazards.  Regulation 30 provides that equipment should not go into use until it has been inspected by a competent person to ensure that it has been properly installed and is safe for operation. Inspection relates to a wide range of hazards. Evidence of such inspections must be recorded and kept available for inspection by the Health and Safety Authority.  Regulation 30 (b) (i) provides for periodic testing where appropriate.In addition in relation to chemical agents, Regulation 6(1)(b) of the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work (Chemical Agents) Regulations 2001 (S.I. No. 619 of 2001) places a duty on employers to ensure that any engineering control measure, which can include local exhaust ventilation (LEV) systems, is properly maintained and used. It requires the employer to ensure that adequate inspection, testing and maintenance of plant and equipment occurs. As LEV systems vary in complexity, the frequency of maintenance and testing specified by the manufacturer, supplier or European Standard should be observed as a minimum.The above regulations derive in the main from EU law which has been formulated taking into account the wide range of hazards which can arise in workplaces.  In relation, inter alia, to equipment which might cause exposure to substances that cause asthma and other health problems, including contaminants, the 2005 Act provides that it is the duty of employers in all workplaces to identify hazards and to put in place measures to control exposure to such hazards. Compliance with this general duty, in addition to the specific duties set out above, should provide adequate protection for workers.

#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	21408	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-25 00:00:00	Prelude	678	Forced labour in the context of trafficking is currently criminalised by the Criminal Law (Human Trafficking) Act 2008 which is legislation that falls within the remit of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Defence. As regards the act of forced labour without trafficking, I would point out that international instruments such as those of the International Labour Office draw a clear distinction between employment i.e. voluntary labour, on the one hand, and forced labour, on the other.Employment rights and industrial relations legislation, which falls within my remit, regulates matters arising during, or on termination of, a contract of employment and is concerned with matters relating to voluntary employment. While it can and does make provision for criminal offences, it is almost unheard of in practice and the vast majority of issues arising are dealt with by quasi-judicial tribunals or by arbitration e.g. Rights Commissioners.Forced labour or slavery can embrace activities that are much more serious than the mere failure to respect labour laws and working conditions and which by definition are not based on contracts of employment. I understand that other jurisdictions, such as is the case in the United Kingdom, have made provision with regard to slavery, servitude and forced labour under their respective criminal codes.  I have no plans to bring forward legislation on forced labour that might be most appropriately achieved within the criminal law code.
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	21408	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-25 00:00:00	Prelude	679	The European Communities (Unfair Terms in Consumer Contracts) Regulations, which gave effect to the corresponding European Council Directive on Unfair Terms in Consumer Contracts, applies to any term in a contract concluded between a seller of goods or supplier of services and a consumer which has not been individually negotiated. Whilst contracts for financial services such as mortgages may indeed come within the scope of the Regulations, certain terms within such contracts are excluded from the scope of the Regulations. It is ultimately a matter for the courts to determine whether a specific term of a contract is unfair having regard to the features of the contract and the particular provisions of the regulations.
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	21408	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-25 00:00:00	Prelude	680	A comprehensive response to the submission from the Electro-Technical Council of Ireland (ETCI) was sent to Mr Hanly on 5 October.  In relation to the issues raised in the submission, in particular, international memberships, the position is that the National Standards Authority of Ireland (NSAI) took the view that, given the extent of the public funding, both direct and indirect, provided by it for the work of the ETCI, a private company, that it would be more appropriate and transparent if NSAI took over the international memberships directly. As Ireland's National Standards Body, set up under the NSAI Act of 1996, it is entirely appropriate that NSAI is the member of these organisations while the ETCI functions as the sectoral committee. This shift in membership secures Ireland's membership of these international institutions for the future. I understand that the NSAI and the ETCI have concluded a Memorandum of Agreement under which NSAI has taken over as the Irish member of the European Committee for Electrotechnical Standardization (CENELEC) and the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC).The submission also raised concerns about the enforcement of Health and Safety legislation and I am informed that senior executives of ETCI recently met with the Health and Safety Authority to discuss this matter.  As the issues concerning the Commission for Energy Regulation fall within the remit of the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, the submission was forwarded to that Department for consideration and direct reply to the Deputy's correspondent.

My Department's ICT Start of Year Statement for 2010 estimates ICT staff costs for the period, on the basis of staff complement and the mid-point salary per grade excluding overheads, at €1,497,680.  The ICT costs of agencies under the remit of my Department is a day-to-day operational matter for those agencies.

#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-25 00:00:00	Prelude	684	Under social welfare legislation any payments received by way of pension are not regarded as reckonable emoluments for the purposes of self-employed Pay Related Social Insurance (PRSI).  Pension annuities provide a secure means of converting savings into pension income to be paid over the span of the individual's life and thereby avoid the danger that pensioners could exhaust their pension savings in their lifetime.  Annuities payable under a retirement annuity contract are, therefore, regarded as a payment by way of pension and not subject to PRSI.Approved retirement funds or ARFs are funds managed by a qualifying fund manager into which an individual may invest the proceeds of their pension fund when they retire. The income and gains of such funds are exempt from tax within the fund. Any amounts withdrawn from an ARF are referred to as a distribution. A distribution is treated as income from an employment and accordingly subject to income tax within the PAYE system.  Unlike annuity products, ARFs are not pensions but are treated as assets.  As such, distributions from ARFs fall within the charge to self-employed PRSI.  It should however be noted that only distributions made before pension age will attract the charge to PRSI as social insurance only applies to individuals between the ages of 16 and 66.  Once the individual reaches pension age, PRSI will not be charged.

Up to now, the legislation provided for a 2 step process, first to the Health Services Executive (HSE) and, if still dissatisfied, to the Social Welfare Appeals Office.I am aware that the processing times for appeals is very considerable.  I am assured by the Chief Appeals Officer that she is keeping the methods of operation by which the Social Welfare Appeals Office conducts its business under constant review, and that the processes are continuously being enhanced to reduce the backlogs in the Office and, overall, to reduce the processing times for dealing with appeals.

Government policy supports this aspiration. However, under the provisions of the Pensions Act 1990, if a person with less than two years qualifying service leaves a pension scheme, they are entitled to a refund to the value of their own contributions less tax at the basic rate.  The Pensions Act also provides that a person can transfer their pension rights to a scheme operated by their new employer or to a vehicle which is capable of accruing pension benefits.  There are no proposals at present to amend the legislation to provide for further access to pension funds.

However, individuals must still have signed back on to the Live Register and be in receipt of JobSeekers Benefit/Allowance or Jobseeker credits immediately before commencing on JobBridge.The policy objective of the Scheme is to prioritise scarce resources on those on the Live Register so as to increase their chances of leaving it thereby ensuring a reduction in Exchequer costs over time. The optimum time for interventions of this nature is at three months and, therefore, the 3 month eligibility criteria for the scheme will remain in place.

It is essential that our tax and social protection systems play their part in addressing these issues and ensure that work is worthwhile. To this end, I established an Advisory Group on Tax and Social Welfare last June.  The main rationale for setting up the Advisory Group is to harness expert opinion and experience in order to address a number of specific issues and to make cost-effective proposals for improving employment incentives and achieving better poverty outcomes, particularly child poverty outcomes.The Advisory Group has been asked to examine a number of specific issues and make recommendations on these, including child and family income supports, working age income supports, the appropriate unit of assessment in both the tax and social welfare codes, the interaction of the tax and social welfare codes, issues concerning social insurance for self-employed people and any other issues that may be referred to it.The Group's method of working is based on producing modular reports on the priority areas identified in the terms of reference. Where possible, the aim is to provide recommendations that can be acted upon in time for the annual budget/estimates and legislative cycle and to allow the Government to best address its commitments under the EU/IMF Programme of Financial Support.I understand that the Group is currently prioritising the area of family and child income supports so that it can make a contribution in time for the 2012 Budget and I expect to receive recommendations in this regard in the near future. Thereafter, I expect that the Group will address the other issues provided for in its work programme including that of social welfare entitlements for the self-employed.

A participant may be eligible for different periods of engagement and extensions on CE due to a range of circumstances, including their age, the nature of the qualifying payment and/or time already spent on CE.  Extensions of a CE placement have to be requested a minimum of eight weeks before the proposed finish date by the CE Project Supervisor.  Once an extension application is received by the local FÁS office, a determination is made as to whether the placement is the most suitable and cost effective measure to assist the client in gaining employment.  Participants who are deemed job-ready by the Supervisor are not extended in order to free up the place for another client.  If no request for an extension is requested then the person must leave the scheme and re-qualify under the published eligibility rules for any further participation on the CE scheme.  The local FÁS employment office will be able to give advice on individual circumstances and the opportunities to extend participation on CE.As Minister for Social Protection I do not have a role in the administration of individual cases in regard to the operation of the Community Employment (CE) programme. The administration of individual cases under CE is a day-to-day matter for FÁS as part of its responsibility under the Labour Services Act, 1987, as amended by Part 3 of the Social Welfare (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 2010.

On completion of the necessary investigations relating to all aspects of her claim a decision will be made and the person concerned will be notified directly of the outcome.  The average time taken to process a claim to completion, including assessment of the claimant's means and the entitlement of the care recipient to full time care and attention on medical grounds is approximately 19 weeks.
#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2011-10-25 00:00:00	Prelude	694	I propose to take Questions Nos. 251 and 273 together.The challenges facing the Irish pension system are significant.  The fundamental principle is that people need to participate in the workforce for longer and they need to contribute more towards their pensions if they are to achieve the income they expect or would like to have in retirement.The population share of those aged 65 and over is expected to more than double between now and 2050, from 11% to 26%.  People are living longer and healthier lives with average life expectancy set to rise even further in the future, up to 88 years for women and 83.9 for men.   In contrast, the share of the working age population is projected to decline gradually from 68% to 58%.   There are currently six people of working age for every pensioner and this ratio is expected to decrease to less than two to one by mid-century.  These changes are taking place and therefore, the task of financing increasing pension spending will fall to a diminishing share of the population who are at work.  Spending on public pensions that is, social welfare pensions and public service occupational pensions, is projected to increase from approximately 5 % of GDP in 2008, to almost 15% by 2050.Therefore, as announced in the National Pensions Framework and as provided for in recent legislation State pension age will be increased gradually to 68 years.  This will begin in 2014 with the standardisation of State pension age at 66.   State pension age will be increased to 67 years in 2021 and to 68 in 2028. It is worth noting that, until the early 1970s, the qualifying age for SPC was 70 years of age.  The recent legislative changes in this regard also fulfil one of the commitments in the EU/IMF Programme of Financial Support for Ireland.By gradually increasing the qualifying age for State pension people will be further encouraged to remain in employment beyond 65 years of age and the option of deferring beyond pension age is currently being explored by my Department. The numbers currently at work drop dramatically at 65 years of age.  The Quarterly National Household Survey Q4 2010 showed that 77.2% % of people aged 45-54 years were at work.  This drops to 64.3% for 55-64 year-olds and to just 8.7% % for people aged 65 years or older.As provided for in legislation since 1997, the minimum paid requirement for State pension (contributory) will increase to 520 next year.  Changes outlined in the National Pensions Framework include a ‘total contributions' approach from 2020 to replace the current averaging system.  This means that from 2020 a person will require 30 years' contributions and credits to qualify for maximum pension with 10 years' contributions required for a minimum pension. This system will be fairer as the level of pension payment will be proportionate to a person's working career e.g. a person with 25 years contributions will receive 25/30ths of a pension.  Sustainable public finances are a prerequisite for maintaining an adequate system of social protection as well as achieving future economic stability and growth. The appropriate level of overall expenditure by my Department in the years ahead will be considered in the context of Budget 2012 and subsequent Budgets.
#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2011-10-25 00:00:00	Prelude	695	I propose to take Questions Nos. 252, 289 and 315 together.The purpose of rent supplement is to provide short-term support to eligible people living in private rented accommodation, whose means are insufficient to meet their accommodation costs and who do not have accommodation available to them from any other source.Rent supplement is subject to a limit on the amount of rent that an applicant may incur.  Rent limits are set at levels that enable eligible households to secure and retain basic suitable rented accommodation, having regard to the different rental market conditions that prevail in various parts of the country. It is essential to ensure that state support for rent supplement tenants, who form a substantial section of the rental market, does not give rise to inflated rental prices with particular negative impact on those tenants on lower incomes, including those who are in low paid employment.Staff administering rent supplement have the authority to set levels lower than those provided for in the regulations, in respect of sub-divisions of their functional areas, where this is appropriate. This allows for lower rent levels to apply in certain locations within counties reflecting local market conditions. Under normal circumstances rent supplement is not paid where the rent charged for the accommodation is above the relevant maximum rent limit. However, staff do have some flexibility around making payment above these limits.The most recent rent limit review established new maximum rent limits from June 2010 and I am satisfied that the rent limits are sufficient to enable eligible households to secure and retain basic suitable rented accommodation.The current rent limits will remain in force until December 2011 and will be reviewed later this year with a view to establishing new rent limits. The review will be based on analysis of data sets available to the Department on private rental prices within the state. This will include information supplied by the Central Statistics Office, the Private Residential Tenancies Board and other publicly available data sources.

Consideration is being given to extending this facility to customers in receipt of certain other scheme payments. An Post also currently provides front office services for AIB and National Irish Bank.  In such cases although the account is not held by the post office, social welfare and other customers can access their accounts and manage their payments through the network of post offices around the country.The current contract with An Post for the payment of welfare customers at Post Offices expires on the 31st December 2013.   Public sector contracts for the supply of products and services are generally awarded following a publicly advertised, competitive tendering process. In line with public procurement guidelines and in the interests of economy, the Department is required to seek tenders for the delivery of social welfare payments before the current contract with An Post expires in 2013.In addition, the award of public sector contracts with a significant financial value is subject to various EU Directives. This ensures that the taxpayer receives value for money and that all potential suppliers are given the opportunity to put forward for efficient, effective and competitive solutions for consideration and evaluation.While it will of course be open to An Post to bid for the new contract, the development of the An Post network and services is a matter for An Post to consider in consultation with the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources.

The scheme is limited to individuals who are currently on the Live Register and have been in receipt of jobseekers allowance/benefit or are signing on for credits for at least 3 of the last 6 months.Individuals participating on the scheme will maintain their existing social welfare entitlements and will also receive a weekly top up payment of €50.  The weekly social welfare entitlement plus the top up payment will be paid in a single allowance known as the internship allowance.It is considered that the €50 top-up payment represents a meaningful incentive to encourage eligible, unemployed individuals to avail themselves of the opportunity to gain valuable work experience and skills that will keep them close to the labour market and / or lead to employment.

As such its function is to facilitate persons who, earlier in their life, could not fully avail of educational opportunities now access further education. Qualification criteria are required to ensure that the allowance does not, of itself, become a factor for signing-on the Live Register in the first place.Currently the period for which a person is required to be on a qualifying social welfare payment before accessing the third level option is 9 months (234 days); this was reduced from 12 months in 2010.  Persons in receipt of a statutory redundancy payment may be in a position to access BTEA more quickly.Periods spent on qualifying social welfare payments, which are not broken by more than 12 months (52 weeks), may be used in determining if an applicant satisfies the qualifying period criteria.

#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-25 00:00:00	Prelude	728	A person wishing to pursue back to education allowance (BTEA) scheme will have to satisfy a number of conditions such as being a certain age, in receipt of a prescribed social welfare payment for a specified time period, pursuing a full time course of study leading to a recognised qualification in a recognised college and progressing in the level of education held by the client with reference to the national framework of qualifications among others.A waiting period is considered essential given that BTEA confers entitlement to income support for an extended period and avoids establishing a pull factor to the Live Register. It is also considered necessary as it reduces unnecessary provision, for those who will leave the Live Register in any event, in the context of targeting scarce resources at those who need it most.The qualifying period for the second level option of the scheme has remained at 3 months in recognition of the need for more urgent intervention in the case of people who have not completed formal second level education. With effect from 19th July 2010, the period for which a person is required to be on a qualifying social welfare payment before accessing third level education under the BTEA was reduced from 12 months to 9 months (a 2 year qualifying period continues to apply to participants coming from Illness Benefit).  Since 2007, people who are awarded statutory redundancy may access BTEA immediately, provided an entitlement to a relevant social welfare payment is established prior to commencing an approved course of study.However, if a person wishes to pursue a part time education course they may be able to do so while still obtaining their jobseekers payment.  They must apply at their local social welfare office and verify that participation on the course does not reduce their availability for work.  In the case of jobseekers benefit, participation on a course does not grant any extension to the normal period for which jobseekers benefit is paid.At present there are no plans to change the qualifying criteria for the BTEA scheme.  However, all employment schemes will continue to be monitored in the context of the objectives of the scheme and the changing economic circumstances.

However, it is important to recognise that the vast majority of people are receiving the entitlement due to them.Fraud control figures are compiled in the Department on a regional basis, not on a county basis. County Meath is included in the Dublin North Region. This region also includes parts of county Dublin and the Social Welfare Local and Branch Offices in Balbriggan, Ballymun, Blanchardstown, Coolock, Finglas, Kilbarrack, Navan Road, King's Inns Street, Swords, Navan, Kells and Trim.The savings resulting from fraud control activity in the Dublin North region for the period January to end of September 2011, are over €11 million. These savings arise from a range of control activities including reviews on social welfare claims in payment, carried out in the Dublin North Region by the Social Welfare Local Offices and Social Welfare Inspectors.This savings figure does not include details from the Special Investigation Unit (SIU) within the Dublin North region, as the SIU savings are compiled separately on a national basis. The savings resulting from fraud control activity by SIU on a national basis, to the end of September is €45.9 million.In addition to these savings figures in the Dublin North region, additional control savings as a result of reviews carried out directly by headquarters offices on customers in Co Meath are not available and are not included here.Control savings are an estimate of the savings from various control activities across the schemes in payment. Control savings are not actual monies recovered by the Department.  If this control work did not take place, social welfare expenditure would increase by this level over time.There are 89 inspectors are in the SIU whose exclusive function is fraud prevention, detection and deterrence. There are currently 47 Social Welfare Inspectors working in the Dublin North Region, which includes those who are assigned to the SIU. All Social Welfare Inspectors have a significant role to play in the control of abuse of the Department's schemes, by preventing fraudulent claims going into payment and by reviewing claims in payment, in addition to carrying out inspections on employers. In addition, all staff working in the Department, including those working in the social welfare local and branch offices in Co Meath, have a significant role in combating social welfare fraud and abuse.The Deputy should also note that I recently launched a new Fraud Initiative (2011-2013) which is aimed at putting in place a range of actions to combat fraud and abuse of the social welfare system and to ensure that the public can have confidence and trust in the system.  As Minister, I am very conscious of the need to protect public money and I am determined to ensure that abuse of the system is prevented and is dealt with effectively when detected.

Given this context, there is a tension between the desire for early intervention and efficiency in the process, including the need to avoid deadweight i.e. avoiding the allocation of scarce resources to interventions with people who would have left the Register without intervention.  Against this background, three months on the Live Register has been identified as an appropriate point in time for unemployed people to be referred to or avail themselves of certain programmes that will provide work experience, guidance, training and/or education that will in turn support them in returning to the Labour Market. At that point, the person will have had the opportunity to search for work and, if unsuccessful, will be supported in avoiding a drift into long term unemployment.  Studies carried out by bodies such as the OECD, ESRI, NESC would generally support this approach.

In excess of 2 million claims each year are processed and over one million people receive a payment each week.  It is important to note that the vast majority of people receiving those payments are fully entitled to them.  Overpayments generally arise as a result of revised decisions on entitlement made by deciding officers.  These officers decide the effective date of a revised decision having regard to the new facts or new evidence and the circumstances of the case.  Payments made to customers of the Department who were later identified to be deceased during 2009 and 2010 amounted to some €7.8m, on a total of  9,850 cases.This Department receives on-line notification of deaths from the General Registrar's Office (GRO) as soon as deaths are registered. The average value of overpaid benefits to deceased customers represents approximately one month's payment.  This indicates that the Department is generally either notified of the pensioner's death by the next of kin within one month, or receives the information from the GRO. As claims are generally being terminated within one month of a recipient's death, any overpayments arising are assessed in a timely manner.The Department is fully committed to recovering 100% of overpayments arising as a result of suspected fraud or error. Effective debt recovery is seen as an integral part of the deterrent to fraudulent claiming.  Debt holders should be aware that a social welfare debt will remain on their records until fully recovered.  This will result in a reduction of all future entitlements up to and including state pension.  Following the death of a customer who owes a debt, the Department continues to have a claim on any estate remaining.  In 2010, the Department recovered overpayments totalling over €7.8m from the estates of deceased pensioners.The Deputy should note that I recently launched a new Fraud Initiative (2011-2013) which is aimed at putting in place a range of actions to combat fraud and abuse of the social welfare system and to ensure there is public confidence and trust in the system.  Given this enhanced approach, the Department plans to increase the level of debt recovery by reviewing the overall approach, particularly in the context of overpayments that have arisen from suspected social welfare fraud.  While the details, including in particular legal requirements, will have to be examined closely, a range of options will be explored under this initiative with a view to both minimising overpayments and increasing recoveries.  The consideration of all options in these areas has, of course, to be balanced, clearly taking into account the core income support and social inclusion purpose of social protection payments.

#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-25 00:00:00	Prelude	758	Better Energy: Warmer Homes delivers a range of energy efficiency measures to households that are vulnerable to energy poverty.  This will enable over 20,000 low-income homes to benefit from energy efficiency retrofit measures this year.  The scheme is managed by the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI) and delivered through a range of Community Based Organisations (CBOs), augmented by a panel of private contractors.  Due to the mixed delivery model and variations across CBOs, the number of measures available to particular homes can vary from region to region.Most, but not all, of these CBOs are in a position to deliver cavity wall insulation (CWI) as well as standard measures under the scheme.  Standard measures include attic insulation, draught proofing, lagging jacket, CFLs and energy advice.  In County Roscommon there are two CBOs operating — one which delivers standard measures only (Mureas) and a second which delivers standard measures plus cavity wall insulation, Roscommon Integrated Development Company (RIDC).  In defined circumstances last year the SEAI allowed RIDC to deliver cavity wall insulation to homes that were allocated to Mureas.  If the Deputy has information that suggests there are homes that were promised cavity wall insulation by Mureas, but which have not yet received it to date, then I will ensure my officials investigate the matter fully.There has been a significant uptake in applications and interest in the Warmer Homes Scheme over the last three years.  SEAI's objective is to maximise the number of vulnerable homes to receive support, in line with budgetary and other resources.  While SEAI advises that surveys are carried out on eligible homes to identify a range of potential measures, lower cost measures are given priority in order to address the maximum number of vulnerable homes within available resources.  Interventions are limited to single visits per home.The SEAI recently held an information day for members of the Oireachtas.  Staff from SEAI were on hand to explain the current range of schemes and programmes and to address any queries.  Queries in relation to individual applications are an operational matter for the SEAI and dedicated hot lines for both schemes are available (Better Energy: Warmer Homes hot line — 1800 250 204 and Better Energy: Homes hotline — 1850 927 000).  In addition, the SEAI has recently established a specific email address for queries from Oireachtas members which can be sent to oireachtas@seai.ie  and will be dealt with promptly.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-25 00:00:00	Prelude	759	The Programme for Government includes a commitment to roll out a Pay-As-You-Save (PAYS) energy retrofit scheme after 2013.  Such a scheme will substitute for Exchequer funding currently being provided.  The 2011 capital allocation is €91.4m.  To date under Better Energy: Homes, efficiency upgrades have been completed in 45,990 homes this year and over 100,000 homes since the programme commenced in 2009.The PAYS concept is an innovative financing mechanism that would allow consumers to finance upgrades directly through the energy savings generated.  My Department has established a project team to undertake the necessary technical and financial analysis of a PAYS model in the Irish context and will submit an initial report to me in the coming weeks.  The potential application of a PAYS mechanism to rental properties is being assessed as part of the analysis.

The Forum is required to meet not less than twice a year.  The first meeting of the Forum took place on 20 October 2011.  The Forum consists of 60 members who were appointed following an open selection process conducted by the Public Appointments Service on behalf of IFI.The Forum includes a broad spectrum of stakeholders in the inland fisheries sector who have demonstrated knowledge or expertise in a number of key sectors including, inter alia, recreational and commercial fisheries, environment, business, tourism, marketing, aquaculture and agriculture.  In appointing members, recognition was given to the importance of a regional dimension to the composition of the Forum ensuring each River Basin District is appropriately represented.I believe that the Forum will provide a meaningful channel of communication between the stakeholders and management of the inland fisheries resource.  I expect that the Forum will provide the various stakeholders with an opportunity to influence policies on how the resource is managed and developed in the current challenging economic climate and into the future.  I would like to put on record of the House my appreciation to the members for the time and attention they have committed to the Forum, noting that the valuable spirit of volunteerism is alive in the inland fisheries sector.

#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-25 00:00:00	Prelude	765	Ireland remains critically dependent on imported fossil fuels, particularly oil and natural gas.  This dependency underlines the immediate and long term imperatives of enhancing energy security, reducing price volatility and ensuring energy sustainability.  National energy policy objectives are in line with overall EU policy objectives and are informed by the critical work of the International Energy Agency (IEA) on all aspects of energy supply.The IMF Economic Outlook, which draws on IEA forecasts and analysis, points to the possibility that global oil markets have entered a period of increased scarcity and concludes that policymakers should strengthen measures to reduce the risks from potential oil scarcity.  The Government is fully committed to delivering national energy efficiency and renewable energy objectives which are aimed at moving the economy away from reliance on imported, carbon intensive fossil fuels.The electrification of transport offers significant potential for Ireland, not just in terms of energy efficiency but also because of the ability to use cheaper grid sourced electricity, an increasing amount of which will be sourced from renewable resources as we progressively deliver on our ambitious target of 40% renewable generation by 2020.  In addition, the Biofuel Obligation Scheme incentivises and enables the sustainable growth of an Irish biofuels market affording opportunities for indigenous biofuel producers and allowing for the displacement of traditional oil products in the transport sector.The Better Energy scheme provides Exchequer supported incentives for energy efficiency and renewable energy upgrades, brings 25 energy suppliers on board as partners to directly offer upgrade services to consumers and supports energy efficiency upgrades in low-income private housing.  Delivery on these commitments will progressively reduce our dependence on imported fossil fuels, while supporting energy competitiveness and security as well as employment and economic activity.

#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-25 00:00:00	Prelude	767	I announced the launch of  Better Energy: the National Upgrade Programme, in May this year as part of the Government’s Jobs Initiative.  Better Energy: Homes encompasses the three established energy efficiency and renewable energy programmes: the Home Energy Savings Scheme (HES), the Warmer Homes Scheme (WHS) and the Greener Homes Scheme (GHS).  Measures supported under Better Energy Programme are those designed to deliver the greatest energy savings, thus optimising the value achieved from the Exchequer funding and the value for the householder.  The measures grant-aided under this strand include roof and wall insulation, high efficiency boilers, heating control upgrades and solar thermal.Support for biomass and wood pellet burners through the Greener Homes Scheme was designed to develop a mature and functioning market, which is now in place.  Having achieved its objectives wood pellet, wood gasification and heat pump technologies are no longer grant aided and the Scheme has now closed.  The Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI) administers Better Energy on behalf of my Department.  Queries in relation to individual applications are an operational matter for the SEAI and dedicated hot lines for both schemes are available (Better Energy: Warmer Homes hot line — 1800 250 204 and Better Energy: Homes hot line — 1850 927 000).  All queries, from scheme applicants and public representatives, on delivery dates for individual households and/or funding arrangements are dealt with immediately.  In addition, the SEAI has recently established a specific email address for queries from Oireachtas members at oireachtas@seai.ie.

#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-25 00:00:00	Prelude	769	Issues relating to television coverage in specific areas of the country are an operational matter for RTÉ.  The Broadcasting Act 2009 provides for RTÉ to rollout a digital TV network to the same extent as the analogue TV network.  RTÉ has informed my Department that the current analogue TV network covers 98% of the population and that its new digital TV network called Saorview will also cover 98% of the population.RTÉ has developed a website providing information on the Saorview service including coverage information and this is available on its website www.saorview.ie.In addition, RTÉ is planning to launch a new ‘free-to-air' satellite service to cover the remaining 2% of the population.  RTÉ is not obliged to provide a satellite service and is doing so on its own initiative.  It is my understanding that, once the satellite service has launched, it will mean that Ireland will have a national TV network covering 100% of the population, for the first time.  RTÉ is currently testing the satellite service to check, inter alia, coverage and other issues and to ensure the availability of satellite receivers, once it launches.  RTÉ considers that the service will be ready to launch in early 2012.

#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-25 00:00:00	Prelude	773	The low income housing / energy poverty strand of Better Energy aims to provide energy efficiency improvements to low-income homes unable to afford the cost of implementing such measures.  ‘Better Energy: Warmer Homes' delivers a range of energy efficiency measures to households that are vulnerable to energy poverty.  The scheme is managed by the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI) and delivered through a range of Community Based Organisations (CBOs), augmented by a panel of private contractors.  Due to the mixed delivery model and variations across CBOs, the number of measures available to particular homes can vary from region to region.To date, energy efficiency improvements in over 73,000 homes have been made under Better Energy: Warmer Homes.  In 2010, 24,291 homes benefitted under the scheme, including 954 homes in County Meath.  13,313 homes have been improved to the end of September 2011, including 238 homes in County Meath.  The measures installed include attic and cavity wall insulation, draught proofing, hot water cylinder lagging jacket and CFLs.  Homeowners are also given energy advice.  In 2011 to date, 225 homes in County Meath received attic insulation, 104 homes received cavity wall insulation and 172 homes received draught proofing.There has been a significant uptake in applications and interest in the scheme over the last three years.  The success of the scheme in 2010 led to increased awareness and demand, and a subsequent increase in waiting times.  There are currently 11,223 homes nationwide on the Better Energy: Warmer Homes waiting list, of which 214 are in County Meath.  While the waiting time for measures may vary, depending on demand and the CBOs and contractor capacity for that particular area, SEAI are working towards a six-month timeframe for service delivery.  SEAI is currently working with the CBOs and private contractors to prioritise delivery in the coming months to those homes which have been waiting for the longest period, subject to resource availability.

#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-25 00:00:00	Prelude	775	As the Deputy may be aware, a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) was signed by the British and Irish Governments on 1 February 2010.  The Memorandum deals with broadcast services and related radio spectrum issues in the context of the provision of digital terrestrial services on the island of Ireland and provides for cooperation between the authorities in both jurisdictions on this issue.  One of the main aims of the Memorandum is to ensure the continued provision of TG4 in Northern Ireland after the switch-off of the analogue broadcast signals on 24 October 2012.  Under the Memorandum, the UK Government has also agreed to facilitate the widespread availability of RTÉ 1 and RTÉ 2 on the Northern Ireland digital terrestrial television network.My Department continues to engage with ComReg, the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland, the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, RTÉ and the Authorities in the UK on these issues and much progress has been made to date.  I can confirm that the UK authorities have made spectrum available in Northern Ireland to facilitate this aim and work in now continuing on the detailed planning and procurement required to make these services available in Northern Ireland by the end of 2012.In addition, the Memorandum has facilitated the development of a coordinated approach on both sides of the border in respect of the roll-out of digital terrestrial television (DTT) and analogue switch-off.  I recently announced Wednesday 24 October 2012 as the official date of completion of the digital TV switchover, when the analogue TV network in Ireland will be switched off. Digital UK also announced that the analogue TV network will also be turned off in Northern Ireland on 24 October 2012, in order to make the transition to digital as straightforward as possible for TV viewers and broadcasters.In addition to the reception of signals from the Northern Ireland DTT network, certain parts of Northern Ireland will continue to receive the Irish channels from ‘overspill', which is when broadcast signals are received outside of the intended coverage area.  This currently happens to an extent with the existing analogue system and will continue to occur after analogue switch-off with the Saorview DTT system.  There are currently no plans, however, for extending the coverage of the services available on Saorview to Britain.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-25 00:00:00	Prelude	776	The Commission for Energy Regulation (CER), which is a statutory, independent body, has, since 2002, been charged with all aspects of the assessment and licensing of prospective operators who wish to develop and/or operate a gas distribution system within the State under the Gas (Interim) (Regulation) Act 2002.  I have no direct statutory function in relation to the connection of towns to the gas network.The development and expansion of the natural gas network is in the first instance a commercial matter for Gaslink, which is mandated under Section 8 of the Gas Act 1976, as amended, to develop and maintain a system for the supply of natural gas that is both economical and efficient.  The CER, in 2006, approved a new network connections policy, which created the opportunity to reassess the feasibility of connecting certain towns to the gas network.  In order for any town to be connected to the gas network, certain economic criteria need to be satisfied as a prerequisite.  The policy allows for the appraisal of a town either on its own or as part of a regional group of towns.This policy ensures that, over a certain period, the costs of connecting the town, or group of towns, to the network are recouped through the actual economic consumption of gas and the associated tariffs.  Otherwise, uneconomic projects will increase costs for all energy consumers.Having regard to the CER policy on new towns connections, Bord Gáis Networks, and more recently Gaslink, have carried out a comprehensive review of towns not connected to the national gas network.  In April 2010, Gaslink published its ‘New Towns Analysis Phase 3' report.  The study is a comprehensive assessment of 39 towns not already connected to the national gas network.  It was approved for publication by the CER following detailed economic analysis based on the criteria outlined in the CER's policy.  The report reviewed the feasibility of connecting 11 towns in the West and North West region which are again the focus of the Western Development Commission paper, ‘Why Invest in Gas'.  However, the Gaslink report found that none of the towns qualified for connection on economic grounds. Consequently, there would appear to be no case for connecting these towns to the network.The analysis by Gaslink supports the results of a feasibility study, commissioned by my Department in July 2004.  That study concluded that the extension of the Galway Mayo pipeline to Sligo and Donegal would require 100% subvention of the capital costs and would also require an annual subvention to offset the operational costs of the pipeline.  Based on this cost benefit analysis, there would appear be no case for the investment of State funds to extend the gas network to the towns examined.  In the meantime, Gaslink will continue to review towns which did not qualify for connection under the Study and other towns on an ongoing basis.  The key factor which would qualify a town or group of towns in any future review would be a significant increase in demand for natural gas, probably resulting from the addition of a new large industrial or commercial facility.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-25 00:00:00	Prelude	777	Since 2002, the regulation of the gas market has been the responsibility of the Commission for Energy Regulation (CER), which is statutorily independent in the performance of its functions. I have no direct statutory function in relation to liquefied natural gas (or LNG) projects, including specific projects like the Shannon LNG project.I understand that Shannon LNG — a wholly owned subsidiary of the US firm Hess LNG — received full planning permission in 2008 for its proposed "merchant" development of a liquefied natural gas (LNG) re-gasification facility near Ballylongford in County Kerry.I also understand that Shannon LNG, among others in the gas industry, currently has an interest in the outcome of a deliberative process being undertaken by the CER in regard to the regulatory treatment of the gas interconnectors with Great Britain.  This issue, currently under consideration, is an extremely complex regulatory question given not least the implications for gas and electricity business and domestic consumers.  The CER's ongoing deliberative process in this regard is at an extremely advanced stage with a decision expected to be made in the next month or so.I strongly welcome Shannon LNG's proposal to construct a merchant LNG re-gasification terminal, as did my predecessor on several occasions.  Within the EU, Member States differ significantly in their reliance on LNG with some states having zero imports while others such as Spain import LNG for the bulk of their gas requirements.The project, should it proceed, would be the first LNG terminal on the island of Ireland.  With 96% of Ireland's gas demand currently being supplied through the interconnectors, the proposed facility would provide additional security of supply, in that it would bring diversity to Ireland's supply sources and bring direct connectivity for the first time between Ireland and the global LNG market.  The prospect of such a facility is therefore a potentially positive step for the island of Ireland in energy security terms.  The employment aspects would also be beneficial were the project to go ahead.While neither I nor my Department have any direct role in regard to the project, pro-active support for the project can be demonstrated by the ongoing engagement by Ministers and Departmental officials with the company.  The CEO of Shannon LNG has been in regular contact with the Department and the CER in regard to the project since its announcement in 2006.  Since assuming office, I have met with senior management in Shannon LNG and Hess LNG and also with a local delegation in regard to the project.

As part of these processes every effort is being undertaken to ensure value for money and achieve cost reductions.Notably, my Department earlier this year, as part of the Croke Park Agreement, has implemented an agreement with the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food to receive a service from that Department for the maintenance of IT helpdesk services and network infrastructure.  This arrangement, which is the first shared service to apply to a full Government Department, will provide long-term savings on licensing and maintenance costs and is likely to be a model for future IT services for smaller Government Departments.  A further shared services initiative has been entered into with the Department of Finance who host payroll facilities for my Department from September 2011.The purchase of IT equipment for Agencies under the aegis of my Department is an operational matter for each Agency and I have no function in that regard.  However, each Exchequer funded Agency makes annual returns to the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform on all ICT expenditure.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-25 00:00:00	Prelude	779	Firstly, I should clarify that Enniskeane, County Cork is not covered by the National Broadband Scheme (NBS).  Outside of the NBS Area, "3" the NBS service provider, operates as a private telecommunications service provider and I have no role in resolving customer dissatisfaction with the service provided.  Where broadband subscribers have complaints or issues relating to the quality and/or consistency of the service they are receiving and have exhausted the Service Provider's (in this case 3's) complaints process, they should refer the matter to ComReg, the independent regulator for the sector.While Enniskeane falls outside the NBS area, the neighbouring Electoral Divisions of Cashel (ED Ref: 47078) and Baurleigh (ED Ref: 47045) come within the ambit of the Scheme.  For residents availing of a service in these NBS areas, the NBS contract guarantees service levels and imposes a service credit regime on "3" with financial consequences in the event that minimum specification service levels are not met.  My Department and its external consultants actively monitor coverage within the NBS areas.  Any NBS customer experiencing problems with the NBS service can contact  3’s customer care centre 24 hours a day, 7 days a week by phone at 1913 (free of charge).My Department has a role when customers have fully utilised 3's established complaints process and consider their complaint has not been resolved.  It operates a dedicated NBS mailbox, which NBS customers can contact by email at nationalbroadbandscheme@dcenr.gov.ie with any comments or complaints they may have about their NBS service.

#PhilipHogan	unknown-#PhilipHogan-party	unknown-#PhilipHogan-dob	unknown-#PhilipHogan-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2011-10-25 00:00:00	Prelude	782	I propose to take Questions Nos. 349 to 351, inclusive, and 382 to 384, inclusive, together.My Department is liaising with local authorities in relation to significant building control issues that have arisen in other multi-unit developments across the country, including the Aras na Cluaine Complex, Clondalkin, Dublin 22 which has already been the subject of court proceedings brought by South Dublin County Council.  Local authorities already have extensive powers of inspection and enforcement under current legislation and have used such powers on a number of occasions where circumstances similar to those at Priory Hall have arisen.  I have urged local authorities to continue to use all of the powers currently available to them to address serious building defects.I attach high priority to consumer protection in the area of quality construction of new dwellings.  That is why, in July 2010, I announced a number of measures to be advanced by my Department and local authorities with a view to improving compliance with, and oversight of, the requirements of the Building Regulations.  In broad terms the measures will involve:-(a) the introduction of mandatory certificates of compliance by builders and designers of buildings confirming that the statutory requirements of the Building Regulations have been met;(b) more efficient pooling of building control staff and resources across the local authority sector to ensure more effective and meaningful oversight of building activity;(c) standardised approaches and common protocols to ensure nationwide consistency in the administration of building control functions;(d) better support and further development of the building control function nationwide.Mandatory certification and improved inspection arrangements are key reforms which will, I believe, have the capacity to improve the quality of buildings and will lead to further strengthening of the regulatory regime as early as possible in 2012.   It is important to note, however, that a robust system of  building control does exist and this is demonstrated by the Priory Hall situation where the local authority is successfully using its powers to make the appropriate party responsible.In relation to further financial assistance and help with mortgage repayments for Priory Hall residents, I understand that Dublin City Council, having moved quickly to make arrangements for the provision of temporary accommodation for affected residents who required it, continues to engage with the residents in order to address and advise them in relation to specific family and individual needs.  I have no function in relation to this aspect of the matter but I have asked Dublin City Council to do all they can to assist the affected residents and see them through this very stressful and distressing ordeal.  I would also urge relevant financial institutions to show similar compassion and understanding in their dealings with affected residents.

My Department is still awaiting the submission to it from Dublin City Council of a cost benefit analysis as well as a full capital appraisal, which when submitted will facilitate a full assessment of the proposal.
#WilliamPenrose	unknown-#WilliamPenrose-party	unknown-#WilliamPenrose-dob	unknown-#WilliamPenrose-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-25 00:00:00	Prelude	784	The Housing Miscellaneous Provisions Act 2009 gives legislative recognition to rental accommodation availability agreements as a form of social housing support. Consequently, since 1 April 2011, RAS tenants are now considered to be in receipt of social housing support and should not generally remain on the housing waiting lists for new applicants for social housing.In recognition that RAS tenants may have had reasonable expectations about retaining access to traditional local authority rented accommodation, guidance issued by my Department in May 2011 this year recommended that there should be a special transfer pathway for RAS tenants to other forms of social housing support. It is my understanding that the members of many authorities have now included a provision of this type in their Allocation Schemes and that such tenants are included on transfer waiting lists. The Housing Agency will shortly issue updated and more detailed guidance to authorities on the matter.RAS tenants obtain significant benefits through being in receipt of social housing support compared to remaining on Rent Supplement. In the first instance, it allows such tenants to take up full-time employment following their move to RAS. Secondly, the housing needs of the tenants become the responsibility of the housing authority, with the added security that implies. Finally, it ensures that tenants do not have to apply for social housing and be assessed under the new Housing Needs Assessment criteria.

The AHP and the CHR have been closed down and the NBA is in the process of being wound down.The Local Government Management Services Board and the Local Government Computer Services Board are merging as the Local Government Management Agency.  Pending necessary legislation, a common board and Chief Executive have been put in place on an interim basis and joint management arrangements are being implemented. The rationalisation process includes the closure of regional offices in Limerick and Waterford and other non-pay savings have been achieved by rationalising the use of products and services such as software licensing, hardware infrastructure, phone systems etc.The Limerick Northside and Southside Regeneration Agencies are being serviced by a single executive, and resources freed up through this are being used to deliver the Phase 1 implementation plans for Limerick Regeneration. (The agencies' roles will be replaced through the development of a joint management arrangement in 2012 for Limerick City and Limerick County Council as a step to the merger of the two Councils);The administrative functions of the Rent Tribunal have transferred to the Private Residential Tenancies Board.The functions of the Fire Services Council are now subsumed into my Department.

#PhilipHogan	unknown-#PhilipHogan-party	unknown-#PhilipHogan-dob	unknown-#PhilipHogan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-25 00:00:00	Prelude	793	The training of fire service personnel is the statutory duty of individual fire authorities under the Section 15.1 of the Fire Services Act 1981.  Fire authorities provide initial recruit training, as well as training in the use of breathing apparatus to an agreed national syllabus, for all entrants to the fire service.  My Department's National Directorate for Fire and Emergency Management provides a Central Training Programme for fire officers which complements and supplements local training programmes through a ‘Train-the-Trainer' model.My Department has published National Guidance to assist fire authorities to provide consistent and safe training in the use of breathing apparatus, which is a basic tool of the firefighter.  In this regard, The Use of Breathing Apparatus in the Fire Service (2007) and Guidance on the Provision and Assessment of Breathing Apparatus Training (2010) are both available from my Department’s website at www.environ.ie.  Initial training in the use of breathing apparatus provides firefighters with the necessary skills and knowledge to use breathing apparatus in a competent and safe manner.  Fire authorities also provide ongoing training, including refresher training on the use of breathing apparatus, as well as training in response to specialist incident types, such as road traffic accidents, hazardous materials, rescues, etc as appropriate to the hazards in their functional areas.The approach to establishing breathing apparatus competency is set out in detail in the Guidance on the Provision and Assessment of Breathing Apparatus Training referred to above.  Breathing apparatus training involves both instruction to impart knowledge and practical exercises to enable learners to apply the knowledge gained in a series of progressive learning activities.  It comprises three separate areas: breathing apparatus wear in scenario based exercises; practical tests, such as user maintenance, and an examination of acquired knowledge, which can be either written or oral. Learners are required to demonstrate competence and knowledge across the range of areas, with marking schemes set out for each.  Learners who may be unsuccessful on a first attempt are afforded an opportunity to repeat the training and demonstrate the required competence and knowledge.

#WilliamPenrose	unknown-#WilliamPenrose-party	unknown-#WilliamPenrose-dob	unknown-#WilliamPenrose-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-25 00:00:00	Prelude	796	In the 1980s the Housing Finance Agency sourced long term fixed rate finance in the form of bond issues on the Irish pound market. These bonds are due to mature in 2018. Funds were on lent by the Agency to local authorities and then by local authorities to individual households at a rate of 10.5%.  The mortgages represented exceptional value at the time and into the early 1990s.However, the structural fall in interest rates since the mid-1990s precipitated a substantial increase in loan redemptions, as borrowers were given the right to prepay these loans without penalty from 1989. While borrowers have had the benefit of penalty-free prepayment the Agency has had to bear the costs arising from the mismatch arising from different amounts still outstanding on the bonds and the mortgages. This amounted to €4.9 million in 2010 and this mismatch will continue to 2018 (when the bonds fall due for repayment).

My Department has not made funds available to finish the construction of housing developments.  An application for funds in respect of the Dun Ri estate in Bunratty, Co Clare to make safe those elements which are deemed a health and safety risk has been received from Clare County Council. The application has been referred back to Clare County Council for additional information to be supplied. On receipt of the data requested my Department will make an allocation based upon the complete application.

The Programme for Government provides for the introduction of a fair funding model to deliver clean and reliable water.  The objective is to install water meters in households connected to public water supplies and move to a charging system based on usage. My Department is currently preparing a strategy to implement these proposals and further details will be announced following the Government’s consideration of the proposals.

I am committed to exploring all options for bringing unsold suitable residential stock into productive use for social housing purposes and am open to proposals in that regard.Any questions regarding compliance with the various statutory requirements, including the planning and building codes, should be directed to Dublin City Council.
#WilliamPenrose	unknown-#WilliamPenrose-party	unknown-#WilliamPenrose-dob	unknown-#WilliamPenrose-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-25 00:00:00	Prelude	801	My Department issued comprehensive guidance to local authorities on the treatment of mortgage arrears in March 2010. That guidance was based on the Central Bank's first statutory Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears to ensure that cases of local authority mortgage arrears are handled in a manner that is sympathetic to the needs of the particular household, while also protecting the position of the local authority concerned.To reflect the content of the Central Bank's revised Code of Conduct — which replaced the previous code from 1 January 2011 and was informed by the deliberations of the Expert Group on Mortgage Arrears and Personal Debt — my Department is currently preparing updated guidance to local authorities in consultation with the City and County Managers Association.
#PhilipHogan	unknown-#PhilipHogan-party	unknown-#PhilipHogan-dob	unknown-#PhilipHogan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-25 00:00:00	Prelude	802	The Rural Development Programme 2007-2013 (RDP) represents a substantial investment in rural areas and plays a significant role in sustaining and creating rural employment.  Axes 3 & 4 (LEADER) of the RDP, for which my Department has responsibility, continue to facilitate access to significant financial resources for rural communities. The main objectives of the RDP are to improve the quality of life in rural areas and facilitate the diversification of the rural economy. The RDP is designed to address directly many of the challenges facing rural communities including the need to increase economic activity and stimulate job creation; improve access to basic services for rural dwellers and encourage rural tourism based on sustainable development of natural resources. The programme is inclusive in its approach to arriving at solutions to such challenges using a "bottom up method" where local communities provide local solutions.Enterprise supports have played a distinct role in successive programmes facilitating rural development in Ireland, including the current and previous LEADER elements of such programmes. The current programme includes significant allocations directly for the creation and development of business ideas (€45.3m) as well as specific support for farm families to facilitate diversification into non-agricultural activities (€15.6m). There is also a specific measure for tourism initiatives which can and does include support for tourism related business ideas (€42.8m).Along with the direct support for enterprise generation and development available through the RDP the programme also provides substantial support for community led initiatives to address issues such as social cohesion and small infrastructural deficits particularly in the context of the promotion of tourism in rural areas. For example the programme supports the establishment and/or renovation of community facilities and the improvement of public amenities in tourist areas, as well as supporting the provision of niche training in adapted and new skills for rural dwellers and communities.The RAPID (Revitalising Areas by Planning, Investment and Development) Programme aims to improve quality of life for residents living in 51 designated disadvantaged areas through the improved planning and co-ordination of state services and through the delivery of new investment in services and facilities. The Programme aims to ensure that priority attention is given to tackling the spatial concentration of poverty and social exclusion within these areas, through targeting of State resources. These services/projects are implemented through prioritisation of national and local agency funding streams and more effective co-ordination of services at a local level. It is a matter for each individual Department to respond to issues of funding within its area of responsibility, including in relation to unemployment.   The RAPID leverage schemes were initiated in 2004 in order to support small-scale projects identified locally in each of the RAPID areas.  These schemes are co-funded by relevant State agencies and support projects focusing on estate enhancement, graffiti clean-up, traffic calming, CCTV, health and sports facilities, and the provision of playgrounds.

The detailed administration of the schemes, and the certification that projects comply with the relevant terms and conditions, are the responsibility of the local authority.The proposal by Cluid Housing Association for 25 units of accommodation to be provided under my Department's Capital Assistance Scheme (CAS) was approved for inclusion in the voluntary housing work programme in February, 2010. Following evaluation of a preliminary proposal, my Department requested Galway County Council to submit certain technical information and a preliminary cost plan for the project. This was received in July 2011. Following a review of the information, my Department recently requested additional detailed specifications, appropriate drawings and a cost plan for the scheme. On receipt of this information, my Department will make a decision with regard to advancing the project through the statutory planning and public procurement stages. A decision on funding will be made following the completion of the procurement stage.

#PhilipHogan	unknown-#PhilipHogan-party	unknown-#PhilipHogan-dob	unknown-#PhilipHogan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-25 00:00:00	Prelude	805	I have received a copy of the motion passed by South Dublin County Council on 10 October 2011.   General purpose grants from the Local Government Fund are my contribution to meeting the difference between the cost to local authorities of providing a reasonable level of day to day services and the income available to them from local sources and from specific grants.  These grants are allocated having regard to a range of factors including the overall funding available for the grants, the cost to each local authority of providing its services, the income available to each local authority from local sources and specific grants, and the need to ensure that each local authority receives a baseline allocation that will provide financial stability.The 2012 allocations will be based on an analysis of these factors at individual local authority level and the level of overall funding available to me. It will be my objective to ensure that General Purpose Grant funding continues to make a significant contribution towards enabling local authorities to continue to provide a reasonable level of services to the public.

A planning authority or the Board is also required, when dealing with a planning application, to carry out a screening for appropriate assessment under Council Directive 92/43/EEC (the Habitats Directive), and to carry out an appropriate assessment where significant effects on a habitat cannot be ruled out.  The planning authority or the Board may not grant permission for a proposed development which an appropriate assessment had determined would adversely affect a European site unless:there are imperative reasons of overriding public interest, andthe Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht considers that compensatory measures proposed are sufficient, andin the case of a priority habitat, the European Commission have been consulted.

To qualify for the vintage rate a vehicle must be constructed more than 30 years prior to the commencement of the period in relation to which the licence is sought.The rates of motor tax were initially set at £10 (€13) for motorcycles and £25 (€32) for all other vehicles.  The current rates are €22 for motorcycles and €48 for all other vehicles, which must be regarded as very favourable rates of tax.The question relating to diesel oil is a matter for the Minister for Finance.

#WilliamPenrose	unknown-#WilliamPenrose-party	unknown-#WilliamPenrose-dob	unknown-#WilliamPenrose-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-25 00:00:00	Prelude	810	Unfair contract terms, as prescribed by the European Communities (Unfair Terms in Consumer Contracts) Regulations 1995 relate to all business to consumer contracts with the exception of specific contract types listed in the Regulations, and of specific terms within contracts.  As such, it is my understanding that mortgage contracts involving local authorities fall within the scope of the Regulations.
#PhilipHogan	unknown-#PhilipHogan-party	unknown-#PhilipHogan-dob	unknown-#PhilipHogan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-25 00:00:00	Prelude	811	Each local authority, in its role as planning authority, may grant or refuse planning applications in accordance with the requirements of the Planning and Development Acts 2000 to 2010 and regulations made thereunder.  Voluntary and cooperative housing schemes are subject to planning requirements in line with standard practice.Local authorities are responsible for the assessment and appraisal of all new voluntary sector projects and ensuring that they are advanced through the planning, procurement and implementation phases in accordance with the requirements of the Capital Works Management Framework for publicly funded capital projects.In the case of new voluntary or co-operative housing developments, it is a matter for the approved housing body, as Contracting Authority under the terms of the funding schemes, to ensure that such developments comply with the relevant statutory planning and building standards.  The approved housing body, as Employer under the terms of the building contract, is responsible for ensuring proper standards of materials and construction.Local authorities also have responsibility for the enforcement of statutory requirements under the legislative codes governing Fire Safety, Building Control and Planning and Development.  Under these legislative codes, local authorities have strong powers to:(i) scrutinise proposals and inspect works in progress;(ii) serve enforcement notices for non-compliance;(iii) institute proceedings for breaches of regulatory requirements;(iv) seek High Court injunctions if non-compliance poses considerable and serious danger to the public.Where a complaint is made in relation to a potential building defect, such as inadequate pipework, the local authority would be expected to examine the matter before deciding what action, if any, may be required.

There is no link between the electoral offence referred to and the reimbursement of a candidate's election expenses.
#WilliamPenrose	unknown-#WilliamPenrose-party	unknown-#WilliamPenrose-dob	unknown-#WilliamPenrose-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-25 00:00:00	Prelude	813	It is open to any person or household to apply to a housing authority for an assessment of their housing need.  It is a matter solely for the housing authority concerned to determine whether an applicant for social housing support is eligible for and in need of that support.  The authority must make its determination in accordance with the provisions of section 20 of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009, and regulations made under that section, primarily the Social Housing Assessment Regulations 2011, having regard to the particular circumstances of the case.  As Minister I am precluded from exercising any power or control in relation to any particular case with which a housing authority is or may be concerned.Regulation 23 of the Social Housing Assessment Regulations 2011 sets out the aspects of a household's current accommodation to which the housing authority shall have regard when determining a household's need for social housing support.  Detailed guidance was issued to housing authorities by my Department at the time the Regulations came into effect.   This guidance includes suggested approaches for authorities when considering applications for social housing support, including situations where the applicant is living in their current accommodation for a period of less than 3 months and situations where the applicant claims it is no longer possible to live in the family home.

This arrangement has been put in place, as an exceptional measure, following consultation with the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine. I am not prepared to consider a further extension to the period for spreading slurry.
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-25 00:00:00	Prelude	816	It is outside the scope of my function to offer an interpretation of the kind sought by the Deputy.
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-25 00:00:00	Prelude	817	Provision for dealing with preliminary matters is set out in section 79, subsections (3) and (3A) of the Employment Equality Acts.  It should be noted that it is only used in cases where the preliminary issue is detachable from the substantive issue and where it would save the parties the need to go to full investigation on that issue. In all cases, where an application is made by the parties for a matter to be dealt with as a preliminary issue, the decision is that of the Equality Officer alone.Statistics on the number of cases in which consideration was given to dealing with specific questions as a preliminary issue are not currently compiled by the Tribunal. Details as requested by the Deputy would require the expenditure of a disproportionate amount of staff time and resources. It is therefore not possible to provide the details sought. However, my Department has been informed by the Director of the Equality Tribunal that, of the 1,043 cases closed in 2010, only seven were the subject of the preliminary issue process.I should stress that the Director of the Equality Tribunal and his Equality Officers are independent in the exercise of their statutory functions and therefore I cannot comment on individual cases. Decisions by the Director or the Equality Officers concerning preliminary issues may be appealed by either the complainant or the respondent to the Labour Court. They may also be appealed on a point of law to the High Court. The Director of the Equality Tribunal is also subject to judicial review by the High Court.There is no provision in the Employment Equality Acts for the Director of the Equality Tribunal to award expenses and costs to either party in a complaint.  I have no proposals to change these provisions of the Employment Equality Acts.
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-25 00:00:00	Prelude	818	I wish to inform the Deputy that when a visa application is received from an applicant, it is routine practice for the Visa Office or Irish Mission concerned to record on the visa page of the applicant's passport the fact that a visa application has been made.  Only in circumstances where the visa is granted will a visa sticker be affixed in the passport over this record.  There is no prohibition on the recording in writing in the passport that a visa application has been refused.As is the case with all refused visa applications, the refusal decision and the reasons for that decision are sent by way of letter to the applicant.  In some instances however, depending on the particular circumstances applying in the country where the visa application is submitted, an alternative method of communication may be used.  For example, in the case of Irish Visa Office, Moscow, the postal service has at times proven to be unreliable. Therefore, persons are informed of a visa refusal, usually by phone or e-mail and a faxed/scanned copy of the refusal letter can be sent to them on request.In relation to all applications refused at the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service headquarters in Dublin, in addition to the customary letter explaining the refusal reasons, the refusal decision and the reasons for that decision are posted promptly on-line (in a format confidential to the applicant).

I am aware that, as facilitated by provisions in the Civil Liability and Courts Act 2004 on the reporting of family law cases, the Family Law Reporting Project carried out between 2007 and 2009 provided a useful insight to family law and its operation in the courts for the public in general.  However, the cost of maintaining the project in the longer term means that it was not sustainable in the light of prevailing economic conditions.  My Department’s review will be considering what further provision can and should be put in place.

There are presently no plans to expand its brief beyond those institutions.Magdalen institutions are not a particularly Roman Catholic phenomenon.  Many such institutions were founded by lay people in the 19th century both in Britain and Ireland to provide a place of refuge or asylum for women.  However at the time the State was established, the 10 Magdalen institutions in the 26 counties were run by Roman Catholic religious congregations.
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-25 00:00:00	Prelude	826	I am advised by the Citizenship Division of the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service (INIS) that a valid application for a certificate of naturalisation was received, from the person referred to by the Deputy, in July 2007.  Applications are processed individually and it is not possible to give an indication of how long it will take to finalise a particular case.  The application from the person concerned is currently being processed with a view to establishing whether she meets the statutory conditions for the granting of naturalisation and will be submitted to me for decision as expeditiously as possible.The granting of Irish citizenship through naturalisation is a privilege and an honour which confers certain rights and entitlements not only within the State but also at European Union level and it is important that appropriate procedures are in place to preserve the integrity of the process.I should remind the Deputy that queries in relation to the status of individual Immigration cases may be made direct to INIS by Email using the Oireachtas Mail facility which has been specifically established for this purpose.  The service enables up-to-date information on such cases to be obtained without the need to seek this information through the more administratively expensive Parliamentary Questions process.

I am also informed that local Garda management advise that no incidents of the type referred to by the Deputy have been recorded in the area.  I am further informed that the area is the subject of regular foot patrols by uniform personnel, supplemented by District and Divisional mobile patrols, including the District Detective and Drug Units and the Divisional Crime Task Force and Traffic Corps personnel.  One member of the local Community Policing Unit is specifically allocated to this area and is in regular contact with local residents.Local Garda management closely monitors and keeps under review patrols and other operational strategies in place, in conjunction with crime trends and policing needs of the communities in the area, to ensure optimum use is made of Garda resources and the best possible Garda service is provided to the public.  Current policing plans in the area are designed to address issues of crime and public order offences.  Community policing is a central feature and core value of policing policy, and current policing strategies are predicated on the prevention of crime, public order offences and anti-social behaviour.

The position remains as stated.The person referred to in the Deputy's Question applied for a certificate of naturalisation in September 2011. This application was considered under the provision of the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act 1956, as amended and it was decided to refuse same. The reason for the decision was disclosed to the person in question in a letter dated 6 October 2011. It is open to the person concerned to lodge a new application for a certificate of naturalisation with the Citizenship Division of my Department if and when they are in a position to meet the statutory requirements.The said Act does not provide for a formal process of appeal on review. However, it is open to the individual concerned to lodge a new application if and when she is in a position to meet the statutory requirements applicable at that time.
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-25 00:00:00	Prelude	830	I can inform the Deputy that, for the most part, the legal services sought by my Department are coordinated and paid for by the Office of the Attorney General and the Chief State Solicitor's Office.  These services are typically sought in the context of the preparation of legislation, legal advice in respect of policy issues and in the management of litigation including judicial reviews.  In a number of instances, my Department has sought and paid for legal advice and services additional to those provided centrally by the Attorney General and the Chief State Solicitor.  As the Deputy will also be aware, the subject matter of the advice, and the advice itself, represent privileged information.I regret to inform the Deputy that the information sought by her is not retained in a fashion which would permit ready extraction.  The level and amount of detail in her request would necessitate the search of a voluminous quantity of files across the entire Department.  This would require the expenditure of a completely disproportionate amount of staff time at inordinate cost to my Department at a time of reducing resources.  I have no responsibility for the nature and/or subject matter of legal advice procured by State agencies as these are matters of day to day administration for the agencies concerned for which they are wholly responsible and accountable.
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2011-10-25 00:00:00	Prelude	831	I propose to take Questions Nos. 406, 407 and 420 together.Firstly, I should say that there has been no ruling that Ireland is in breach of Article 4 of the European Convention on Human Rights for not having legislation to criminalise forced labour.  The Criminal Law (Human Trafficking) Act 2008 criminalises the trafficking of persons for the purposes of labour exploitation (including forced labour), sexual exploitation and exploitation consisting of the removal of a person's organs.  For the purposes of the Act, the term "trafficks" is broadly defined.  For example, the commission of an offence does not require cross-border movement or illegal entry into the State. It includes recruitment, taking a person into one's custody, care or charge, and providing the person with accommodation or employment.  However, the legislation is primarily an anti-trafficking measure and was never intended to address any of the above exploitative phenomena outside the context of human trafficking.This does not necessarily mean that a person subjected to forced labour but who has not been trafficked (or where trafficking is difficult to prove) does not have the protection of the criminal law.  It is likely that activities constituting forced labour could be prosecuted under a range of offences, for example, false imprisonment, blackmail, assault, the coercion offence in the Non-Fatal Offences Against the Person Act 1997, offences under employment law and health and safety legislation, immigration law, etc.Internationally, forced labour covers a diverse range of exploitative behaviours. The extent and nature of the phenomenon in this jurisdiction is unclear.  At the request of my Department and with a view to establishing the exact nature of alleged abuses, the Garda authorities have recently completed an analysis of allegations of forced labour which have come to their attention.  The results of the analysis are currently being examined in my Department so that any legislative and administrative measures required to address deficiencies can be identified.  In the event that a need for additional legislative measures is established, proposals will be brought to Government in the usual manner.

#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2011-10-25 00:00:00	Prelude	833	I propose to take Questions Nos. 409 and 421 together.The wide range of matters raised by the Deputies have been noted in my Department, insofar as they are matters for which I have responsibility.  As the Deputies are aware, family law proceedings in the courts are held in camera.  The making of any false allegations of child sexual abuse would of course be a serious matter, and any person who has knowledge of such false allegations should bring them to the attention of An Garda Síochána.Orders made under the Guardianship of Children Act 1964, as amended, concerning guardianship and custody of, and access to, children, are subject to section 3 of the Act which requires the courts to regard the welfare of the child as the first and paramount consideration.  Any proposal requiring automatic changes in custody arrangements in specified circumstances would not respect this very important principle.In respect of the provision of legal aid in the family law matters referred to, the Legal Aid Board is the statutory body providing civil legal aid in such matters.  The Board has procedures in place, underpinned by legislation, which allow for the termination of a legal aid certificate where it is deemed warranted by a client's behaviour in the conduct of proceedings.  The Board has informed me that it regularly represents both parents in the family law matters referred to and does not in any way discriminate between fathers and mothers in the granting of legal aid or in the conduct of cases.  The Board completely rejects any notion that its solicitors would be in any way complicit in the making of any such false allegations, and I fully support the Board's stance in that respect.
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-25 00:00:00	Prelude	834	I am informed by the Garda authorities that local Garda management is aware of the issues affecting certain city centre areas where drug treatment services are provided through clinics.The Deputy will, of course, appreciate that while the overall aim of the Health Service Executive is to have patients treated in their local communities, wherever this is possible, this is not always feasible and such treatment must be provided in a clinic setting.Having said that, I can inform the Deputy a number of policing initiatives have been put in place by local Garda management to prevent and disrupt criminal behaviour, including the sale, distribution and use of drugs and anti-social behaviour in the locality.  The area referred to by the correspondent is also subject to regular patrols by uniform and plain-clothes units, including the Community Policing and Garda Mountain Bike Units, local Detective and Drug Unit personnel, supplemented as required by the Divisional Crime Task Force and Traffic Corps personnel.I am advised that local Garda management closely monitors such patrols, and other operational strategies in place, in conjunction with crime trends and policing needs of the communities in these areas to ensure optimum use is made of Garda resources, and that the best possible Garda service is provided to the public.  At this time, Garda Management is satisfied that a full and comprehensive policing service is being delivered and that current structures in place meet the requirements of the delivery of an effective and efficient policing service to the residents concerned.In addition, An Garda Síochána continues to liaise with the relevant authorities at the drug treatment centres and with the transport service providers to reduce the opportunity for criminal activity and there is ongoing liaison through the Community Policing Unit with local residents and the business community to further address any issues of concern.  Finally, I am assured by the Garda authorities that the situation will be kept under review.

Following consideration of the report I will make an assessment as to what, if any, action, legislative or otherwise, may be required.  I will, in due course, make known the report's findings and any proposals which may arise.My Department has been in close contact with the Commissioner of An Garda Síochána with a view to monitoring the position in respect to the ‘Cash for Gold' trade.  I can inform the Deputy that the Commissioner has reported that all ‘Cash for Gold' premises in the State have been visited by An Garda Síochána and the operators of such premises have been made aware of their responsibilities and obligations with regard to purchasing gold and jewellery.  In addition, I have been informed that contact information has been provided to ‘Cash for Gold' operators by An Garda Síochána which will facilitate the reporting of any suspicious activity.  The Commissioner has also indicated that any new ‘Cash for Gold' premises that may be identified will be visited by An Garda Síochána.I should inform the Deputy that my Department has no role in relation to the scrap metal industry.  Of course, any reports of robberies of gold or metal should be referred to An Garda Síochána.  With regard to the Deputy's assertion that there has been an increase in the amount of robberies of gold and metal, I have requested the CSO to provide statistics directly to the Deputy.

The scheme is operated by the Property Registration Authority and since it was introduced in 1978, over 80,000 applicants have availed of it to acquire the freehold title to their property.I should point out that a High Court judgment upholding the constitutionality of the ground rents legislation was delivered in early 2006 but was subsequently appealed to the Supreme Court.  That appeal has been heard and the Supreme Court has reserved its judgment.  The operation of the law in this area continues to be monitored in my Department.

Failed asylum seekers will have already had a comprehensive and thorough examination of their asylum claim by the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner and, should they appeal, by the Refugee Appeals Tribunal.  The option is then open to them to apply for Subsidiary Protection in accordance with the European Communities (Eligibility for Protection) Regulations 2006 (S.I. No. 518 of 2006).  If their application for Subsidiary Protection is refused, their file is considered under Section 3 of the Immigration Act 1999 (as amended), and Section 5 of the Refugee Act, 1996 (as amended).  Any representations submitted by them or on their behalf are considered in detail by reference to the criteria listed in Section 3 of the 1999 Act, as well as relevant international human rights instruments and domestic legal provisions, including Constitutional provisions where appropriate.For illegal immigrants who have not claimed asylum or Subsidiary Protection, their file is considered in full in the same way as outlined above for failed asylum seekers under Section 3 of the Immigration Act 1999, (as amended) including any representations submitted by them or on their behalf by reference to the criteria listed in Section 3 of the 1999 Act, as well as relevant international human rights instruments and domestic legal provisions, including Constitutional provisions where appropriate.A Deportation Order requires a person to remove themselves from the State and remain thereafter outside the State.  A person cannot return to the state if a Deportation Order has been issued against them and they have been removed. However, where new information in relation to a person who is the subject of a Deportation Order is brought to my attention by such a person or by their legal representative outlining significantly changed circumstances from those that pertained at the time the Deportation Order was signed, it is open to such persons to apply under Section 3(11) of the Immigration Act 1999 to have their Deportation Order revoked.  Since 9 March, 2011, a total of 725 Deportation Orders have been made.

I will be announcing in the near future, the details of revised structures and processes for co-ordinating, monitoring and implementing the progression of the NDS.  I am confident that the fresh approach which I am introducing, will re-invigorate the implementation of the National Disability Strategy and will assist in meeting the commitment in the Programme for Government.
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-25 00:00:00	Prelude	842	The Deputy will be aware that, under the provisions of the Courts Service Act 1998, management of the courts is the responsibility of the Courts Service and I have no role in the matter.  Section 4(3) of the 1998 Act provides that the Courts Service is independent in the performance of its functions, which include the provision, maintenance and management of court buildings and provision of facilities for court users.However, in order to be of assistance to the Deputy, I have had enquiries made and the Courts Service has informed me that at a meeting on 17 October last the Courts Service Board approved proposals to formally transfer District court business from Kiltimagh and Claremorris to the District Court sitting in Castlebar.  Castlebar will therefore deal with the business previously conducted at the three venues and the Service has assured me that there is sufficient capacity in Castlebar to do this. These changes will take effect early next year.As the Deputy will be aware, an excellent Courthouse is available in Castlebar where a €12 million project was completed in 2004.  This refurbishment saw the number of courtrooms increased to four; additional improved public waiting areas; provision of consultation and practitioners rooms, extended court offices, judges' chambers, universal access and an enhanced sense of privacy and dignity for all court users.  The facilities have capacity for video conferencing and digital recording of proceedings which are requirements of an efficient 21st century court building.The Courts Service has informed me that there are no further plans at this time to close or amalgamate other courthouses in County Mayo during 2012 beyond what has recently been announced.  The Service keeps all venues across the country under constant review to ensure that, insofar as is possible, they meet the standard that court users are entitled to expect and also allow for best use of time and resources. This review is essential when the best use of all of available resources is of paramount concern having regard to the current financial climate and to an increase in court business of 40% nationwide over the past five years.
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-25 00:00:00	Prelude	843	The Deputy may wish to note my response to an earlier Question on the implementation of recommendations relating to prison conditions made by the Inspector of Prisons.I receive regular updates on the implementation of the Inspector's recommendations.  The Inspector himself recognised that in certain areas prisons will not be able to comply with all the recommendations in the short term.  As long as there is overcrowding and limitations on resources there will be difficulties in achieving full implementation.However progress is being made.  To give examples, issues raised by the Inspector regarding the general cleanliness of prisons including the need for broken fittings to be replaced are being addressed by the Governors of each institution.  A programme for painting and cleaning is in place in each prison and those programmes are sufficient to meet the needs of that prison.Areas mentioned by the Inspector include the use of special cells, prisoners' complaints and the procedure to be followed following deaths of persons in custody.   New procedures have been adopted and will be supported by changes to the Prison Rules which have been drafted.  These are being finalised in conjunction with the Office of the Attorney General.The Inspector also referred to minimum standards for prison accommodation and the regimes and services that should be provided.   The Government, as you know, is committed to the elimination of slopping out in prisons.  The upgrade of more than 100 cells at Mountjoy Prison, including the installation of in-cell sanitation, will be completed by the end of this month.  The Irish Prison Service will then consider the feasibility of installing in-cell sanitation in the remaining cells of Mountjoy and to other facilities elsewhere.   The completion of the Midlands Prison extension and the provision of 70 extra dormitory style spaces in the Dóchas Centre will mean that 80% of the prisons estate will have in-cell sanitation by mid 2012.The Inspector also recommended the creation of dedicated committal areas and vulnerable persons units in each closed prison.  The Irish Prison Service is looking at all options available to implement these recommendations where they are not already in place.In relation to the Inspector's recommendation that drug free units be established in each closed prison to accommodate drug free prisoners, I can advise that Arbour Hill, St. Patrick's Institution, the Training Unit and Wheatfield Prison already have drug free wing/landings or areas within their prisons.   A drug free unit in Mountjoy Prison will become operational before the end of the year.  The template developed for the operation of this unit should have application across many of the closed prisons where the development of a drug free unit is warranted.  To this end, the Healthcare Directorate, working in conjunction with prison management, is looking at the options for the development of drug free areas in closed prisons.
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-25 00:00:00	Prelude	844	As with every other public sector organisation, the reality is that the Garda Síochána is going to have to manage with reduced resources.  The Garda Commissioner is therefore quite properly reviewing all aspects of the Garda Síochána's policing model, so as to ensure that Garda resources are managed and deployed in the most appropriate manner to meet existing and emerging policing requirements.The Garda Commissioner's review will examine all aspects of current policing, including the deployment of personnel, the utilisation of modern technologies and the operation of Garda stations.While no decision has been taken, clearly the reduction in public opening hours in some Garda stations, and the closure of other Garda stations, will be issues that the Garda Commissioner will have to address as part of the review.  He may well have to consider whether, in appropriate cases, a better policing service could be delivered to a local community by having Garda members out on patrol rather than in a station.I will very carefully consider the outcome of this review and the Commissioner's policing plan for next year with the objective of ensuring that priority is given to the maintenance of frontline services.The following additional information was provided under Standing Order 40AThe Garda Commissioner has been reviewing all aspects of policing, including the deployment of personnel and the operation of Garda stations.  His objective is to identify efficiencies and savings so that an effective and professional policing service continues to be delivered to the community within the available resources.I understand that each Chief Superintendent in charge of a Garda division has been tasked by the Commissioner with conducting an impact assessment of the demands placed on each Garda station within that division, and that any restructuring of the Garda station network will only arise to deliver greater efficiencies in the deployment of personnel and other resources to the various communities within each division.The manner in which members of the Garda Síochána are stationed throughout the country is by law a matter for the Commissioner, although he must include any proposal to open or close a Garda station in his annual draft policing plan.Turning specifically to the question of consultation in relation to this process, it would not be practical for decisions on Garda stations to be subject to advance discussions with the wide and open-ended range of organisations listed in the Deputy's question.  However, I am informed by the Commissioner that, where a community's policing service is to be delivered through a revised model, which would include any closure of a Garda station, there will be consultation by the Garda Síochána with that community.  While the nature of that consultation will inevitably vary according to  local circumstances, I would certainly expect that any such revised model would be discussed by the relevant joint policing committee, although of course the final decision on the configuration of policing services will be made by the  Garda Commissioner, taking into account overall operational requirements and the need for efficient use of resources by the Garda Síochána in a national as well as a local context.
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-25 00:00:00	Prelude	845	I must presume that the Deputy's question is about diversion as it relates to youth crime. The Diversion Programme operates in accordance with Part 4 of the Children Act 2001, as amended, and under the general superintendence and control of the Garda Commissioner.  The aim of the Diversion Programme is to deal with juveniles who offend, by way of administering a formal or informal caution, thus diverting the offender away from the courts and minimising the likelihood of further offending. The programme embraces, whenever possible, the principles of restorative justice and it pays  regard to the needs of the victims of youth offending. The programme has shown to be successful in diverting young offenders away from crime by offering guidance and support to the young people and their families.In September I published the 2010 Annual Report of the Committee appointed to monitor the effectiveness of the Diversion Programme. This report gives details of the resources deployed by the Commissioner in relation to the programme. There were 7 new Juvenile Liaison Officer  (JLO) posts created in 2010 to bring the total number of JLO posts to 123, comprising 115 Gardaí and 8 JLO Sergeants. It is the responsibility of the Garda Commissioner to decide on the prioritisation and allocation of resources within the force.The work of the Garda Juvenile Liaison Officers under the Diversion Programme is supported by the Irish Youth Justice Service (IYJS) through the funding and oversight of 100 Garda Youth Diversion Projects (GYDPs) across the country. I wish to inform the Deputy that I will continue to maintain responsibility for the diversion and community aspects of the work of IYJS, while my colleague the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs will take responsibility for the Children Detention Schools in Oberstown. I will be consulting closely with my Ministerial colleague and with the Garda Commissioner  in the continuing development of programmes to tackle youth crime.Other Departments do not have a direct role in the delivery of the Diversion Programme, but they can support it indirectly by the provision of services to children in the groups most at risk. The focus of my colleague, the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, is on harmonising policy issues that affect children in areas such as early childhood care and education, youth justice, child welfare and protection, children and young people's participation, research on children and young people, youth work and cross-cutting initiatives for children. An Garda Síochána,  the Probation Service and the Irish Youth Justice Service contribute to this work by membership, where appropriate, of various structures under the umbrella of the Department of Children and Youth Affairs including Children Services Committees and the National Children's Strategy Implementation Group. I also have 2 nominated representatives on the National Children's Advisory Council and a representative of the National Education Welfare Board.

An Garda Síochána is targeting such crime, and burglaries and theft-related crimes generally, through a number of initiatives, including Supporting Safer Communities, which lay particular emphasis on burglary prevention and reduction, and a targeted response to burglary.  Divisional Officers have been advised of measures which can be put in place to prevent and reduce such crime.Such crime can be tackled only by a collaborative effort and a targeted multi-agency response.  An Garda Síochána is in contact with stakeholders particularly affected by this type of crime, including the Irish Farmers' Association, the Electricity Supply Board, telecoms, transport companies and brewing concerns and with local authorities and the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government.An Garda Síochána has undertaken a number of initiatives to raise awareness of metal theft.  One such initiative is the development of advice on farm machinery theft prevention as part of the Garda Supporting Safer Communities campaign in June, 2011.  This initiative provides advice on securing vulnerable farm equipment and is supported by the Irish Farmers' Association.  The advice is available on the Garda website www.garda.ie.
I am informed that a Garda Metal Theft Crime Prevention and Reduction Plan is currently in preparation.

#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-25 00:00:00	Prelude	849	Section 184 of the Criminal Justice Act 2006, which came into operation on 1 August, 2006, inserted into the Criminal Justice (Public Order) Act 1994 provision for a fixed charge procedure in relation to the offences of intoxication in a public place and disorderly conduct in a public place (sections 4 and 5 respectively of the Criminal Justice (Public Order) Act 1994).  The provisions were amended by sections 20 and 21 of the Intoxicating Liquor Act 2008.  The fixed charge is €100 and €140 for offences contrary to sections 4 and 5 respectively, which increases by 50% if not paid within a 28 day period.  A summons issues if the charge is not paid within 56 days.I am informed by the Garda authorities that the following table shows the number of fixed charge notices issued for offences contrary to these sections from October, 2008 to August, 2011.  It is not possible to provide statistics for the number of fixed charge penalty notices issued in 2007 and in 2008 up to October without a disproportionate use of resources.YearNumber of fixed charge notices2011 (to August)3,98520105,34720093,7182008 (from October)344I am informed that it is not possible to provide information on the amount generated to date by fixed charge notices for alcohol related offences without a disproportionate use of resources.I currently have no plans to extend the scheme.

I will be in contact with the Deputy when this information is to hand.
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-25 00:00:00	Prelude	851	The internet is a worldwide phenomenon with no borders and no single organisation controlling it.  There is, however, an existing  self-regulatory framework for internet service providers (ISPs) in operation in Ireland which actively encourages  the adoption of best practice procedures aimed at limiting the proliferation of illegal child pornography content online.  Members of the public may report such material to the www.hotline.ie service of the Internet Service Providers’ Association of Ireland (ISPAI).  If the material is hosted here and deemed to be illegal and in contravention of Irish law,  ISPAI members are obliged to remove such materials.  If the material is hosted in another jurisdiction, it is notified to the internet hotline in that jurisdiction and/or to the relevant law enforcement agencies for follow up, with the aim of having illegal content taken down.At present all of the mobile phone operators in Ireland, under a voluntary agreement brokered by the European Commission with the GSM Alliance Europe, the association representing European mobile phone operators, implement a form of filtering on their mobile internet service, which prevents access to websites which have been identified as containing child pornography content.In a number of EU Member States, a system of internet blocking/filtering has been introduced on a voluntary basis, whereby a "blocklist" of sites containing child pornography is made available by the police or other competent authorities, and is utilised by individual ISPs to prevent access to such content.  It is generally acknowledged that all such internet blocking or filtering systems are not foolproof and can be circumvented in certain circumstances.  However, such filtering systems are understood to be useful in preventing internet users from inadvertently encountering such illegal content. Of course, the key objective from a law enforcement perspective is to achieve the removal of such material from the internet at source.A draft proposal for a Directive on combating the sexual abuse, sexual exploitation of children and child pornography was published in 2010 by the European Commission and is currently being negotiated by the EU institutions.  The draft  Directive contains a proposal which may  require Member States to implement some form of blocking system in relation to websites containing child pornography. Ireland's participation in the adoption and implementation of this Directive has been approved by the Government and the Oireachtas. The Directive is in the course of its final negotiations at EU level and is expected to be adopted in the near future. A two year period from the date of its adoption will apply to the transposition of this Directive into national law and possible further options to combat child pornography online will be considered in that context.

However, her parents have now left the State and she no longer qualifies for residency under EU Treaty rights.I am further informed that this person recently made an application for residency based on being in a de facto relationship with an Irish national.  The application was refused as the couple failed to submit documentary evidence to prove that their relationship had been for a duration of at least two years.They were advised that it is open to them to submit another application when the person in question and her partner can provide evidence that will support her application.

Local Garda management is aware of difficulties being experienced by residents in the area as a result of anti-social behaviour in the vicinity of the premises.Liaison is maintained with the proprietor, management and staff of the premises regarding the difficulties being experienced.  The premises is also subject to regular inspections under the liquor licensing legislation.  Liaison is also maintained by the Community Policing Unit with local institutions and groups, and arrangements are being made to raise awareness of the difficulties caused by anti-social behaviour.The area is the subject of regular patrols by uniform and plain clothes personnel, including the Community Policing Unit and the Mountain Bike Unit, supplemented as required by the District and Divisional Detective and Drug Units.Local Garda management closely monitors and keeps under review patrols and other operational strategies in place, in conjunction with crime trends and policing needs of the communities in the area, to ensure optimum use is made of Garda resources and the best possible Garda service is provided to the public.Current policing plans in the area are designed to address issues of crime and public order offences.  Community policing is a central feature and core value of policing policy, and current policing strategies are predicated on the prevention of crime, public order offences and anti-social behaviour.

To date they are continuing to report to the Bureau as directed.However, there remains the option of applying to me for revocation of the Deportation Orders pursuant to the provisions of Section 3 (11) of the Immigration Act, 1999, as amended. However I wish to make clear that such an application would require substantial grounds to be successful and must be based on new information which was not capable of being presented to me prior to the Deportation Orders being signed.

#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-25 00:00:00	Prelude	858	Total ICT expenditure for the Department and all agencies under the aegis of the Department in 2010, including staff costs, support and maintenance services, hardware, software, and external resources including consultancies, contractors and external service-providers was in the region of €26,445,000.  These figures comprise expenditure for the following areas:1. The Department itself and the bodies/offices/agencies on its IT Shared Service (see full list below)2. Irish Prison Service3. Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service4. Financial Shared Services5. Equality divisions and agencies until their transfer to the Department of Community, Equality and Gaeltacht AffairsThe Department's IT Shared Service, operating since 2003, provides centralised IT services to approximately 2,000 users in the Department and 27 agencies nationally and internationally.  This approach ensures that the Department achieves economies of scale for the provision of these services, whilst reducing administration costs.  Contracts and expenditure are regularly reviewed and suppliers engaged with to ensure that products and services are delivered at the most cost-effective rates.A cross Departmental and cross agency ICT Governance Group, set up in early 2011, which has a remit in relation to the strategic overview and management of ICT developments, now reviews all proposed ICT expenditure to ensure value for money is achieved.List of Departments, Offices and Agencies on the IT Shared Service:Department of Justice and EqualityAnti Human Trafficking UnitCasino CommissionCoroner's ServiceCOSCCriminal Injuries Compensation TribunalCriminal Law CodificationEquality AuthorityEquality TribunalFinancial Shared ServicesGarda InspectorateINISIrish Film Classification OfficeIrish Youth Justice ServiceNational Disability AuthorityNational Property Services Regulatory AuthorityOffice for Internet SafetyOffice for the Promotion of Migrant IntegrationOffice of the Commissioner of Charitable Donations and BequestsOffice of the Data Protection CommissionerOffice of the Inspector of PrisonsOffice of the Refugee Applications CommissionerParole BoardPrivate Security AuthorityReception & Integration AgencyRefugee Appeals TribunalState PathologyVictims of Crime

The Finance Acts are, are course, a matter for the Minister for Finance.With regard to the particular penalties imposed by the Courts in dealing with this offence type,  the position is that the Courts are, subject only to the Constitution and the law, independent in the exercise of their judicial functions and the conduct of any court case is a matter entirely for the presiding judge.It is not open to me to comment or intervene in any way in relation to how particular proceedings are conducted or on the outcome of those proceedings. It is a matter for the court having considered all the circumstances of the case to impose an appropriate penalty.The question of whether there should be further amendments to the penalty provisions applying to these offences is a matter for my colleague Mr. Michael Noonan TD, Minister for Finance.

At operational level the implementation of specific measures to deal with criminal gangs and their criminal activities is a matter for the Garda Commissioner.I also wish to make it clear that when it comes to the general allocation of financial resources to An Garda Síochána the Government is committed to maintaining frontline services.  I will, of course, continue to engage with my colleague the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform regarding the Garda budget for 2012 and beyond.Garda management closely monitors the allocation of resources, including transfers and retirements, in the context of crime trends, policing needs and other operational strategies in place on a District, Divisional and Regional level, to ensure optimum use is made of Garda resources, and the best possible Garda service is provided to the public. Senior Garda Management is satisfied that a full and comprehensive policing service continues to be delivered and that current structures in place meet the requirement to deliver an effective and efficient service to the community.
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-25 00:00:00	Prelude	862	I am informed by the Garda authorities that resources to ensure that Information and Communications Technology (ICT) is used effectively by An Garda Síochána will continue to be made available to the greatest extent possible.  Over the past number of years there has been considerable progress in the delivery of new ICT solutions to support An Garda Síochána.  These include major initiatives such as the deployment of a Digital Radio System and an Automated Fingerprint Information System.
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-25 00:00:00	Prelude	863	I understand that the Deputy is referring to the number of individuals who are in custody for non payment of fines, debtor offences and contempt of court.  The numbers of such individuals in custody on 30 September, 2011 is set out in the table below.TotalFines Offences13Debtor Offences0Definite contempt of court5Indefinite contempt of court3It is not possible to provide the information requested on the number of persons in respect of whom warrants have been issued and are outstanding in respect of criminal offences   without the manual examination of the numerous records concerned.  This would require a disproportionate and inordinate amount of staff time and effort which can not be justified in current circumstances where there are other significant demands on resources.The Deputy will appreciate that in cases involving persons being held in contempt of court, the ongoing detention of the person concerned is a matter for the Courts.  Consequently it is not open to me to intervene in this matter.  I might also mention that the Fines Act 2010 introduces a number of measures to prevent the automatic imprisonment of fine defaulters.  In particular it has provisions dealing with capacity to pay, payment by instalments, recovery by appointment of a receiver and community service in default of payment of a fine.  I intend to introduce further measures which will allow recovery by means of attachment of earnings orders.
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2011-10-25 00:00:00	Prelude	864	I propose to take Questions Nos. 445 and 448 together.Tackling serious crime remains a key ongoing priority both for the Government and for An Garda Síochána.The Policing Plan of An Garda Síochána for 2011 sets out the commitment of An Garda Síochána to pro-actively target groups and individuals engaged in organised criminal activities.Accordingly, the Garda Commissioner has put special measures in place to combat criminal gangs. These measures include the deployment of significant resources with a number of operational approaches, including a multi-agency approach and the use of intelligence-targeted operations.The lead role in this approach is being undertaken by  the Garda Organised Crime Unit which targets organised criminal gangs.  The Unit works in conjunction with other Garda national units such as the Emergency Response Unit, the Bureau of Fraud Investigation and the Criminal Assets Bureau.All of these units  cooperate very closely and as a result of targeted Garda operations in this area a number of persons (including members of criminal groups) are before the Courts charged with serious offences.Through this work the monitoring of organised criminal gangs is ongoing and is kept under constant review.The Deputy will also be aware that the criminal law targeting organised crime has, in recent times, been the subject of significant amendment, primarily with the introduction of the Criminal Justice (Amendment) Act 2009 and other related pieces of legislation including the Criminal Justice (Surveillance) Act 2009 with regard to covert surveillance, and the Criminal Justice (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009 with regard to the use of weapons.As I have indicated previously to the House, it is my intention to keep under review the question of whether any further improvements could be made to the overall legislative framework in this area to render it more effective.  In this regard, I have recently written to the Garda Commissioner to ascertain his views on the operation of this body of legislation and, in particular, the operation of the 2009 Act.   In addition, in accordance with the commitments contained in the Programme for Government it is my intention, in due course,  to bring forward legislative proposals which will serve to strengthen the powers of the Criminal Assets Bureau in relation to forfeiting the proceeds of crime.
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-25 00:00:00	Prelude	865	The Criminal Justice (Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing) Act 2010 replaced the money laundering provisions of the Criminal Justice Act 1994 and transposed the requirements of the third EU Money Laundering Directive.The Act strengthens Irish legislation on money laundering by creating broader money laundering offences and extending anti-money laundering regulatory systems.The scope of the offence of money laundering was broadened substantially under the Act and now includes any concealment, conversion, handling etc. of property where a person knows, believes, or is reckless as to whether property represents the proceeds of "criminal conduct".  Criminal conduct is defined (in section 6) to include any conduct that constitutes an offence, whereas formerly the definition was confined to indictable (serious) offences.The Act provides that a "designated person" is required to carry out what are known as customer due diligence measures.  These include verifying the identity of customers and monitoring their transactions in order to detect money laundering. Section 42 of the Act requires a "designated person" who knows, suspects or has reasonable grounds to suspect, on the basis of information obtained in the course of business, that another person has been or is engaged in money laundering or terrorist financing to report this to the Financial Intelligence Unit of the Garda Bureau of Fraud Investigation and the Revenue Commissioners.The Act defines a "designated person" to include a credit or a financial institution, an auditor, external accountant or tax adviser, a relevant independent legal professional, a trust or company service provider, a property service provider, a person who directs a private members club at which gambling activities are carried on, a person trading in goods in respect of transactions involving the receipt of cash of at least €15,000 or any other person of a prescribed class.   The Act provides for designated persons to be supervised as regards their money-laundering prevention responsibilities by a relevant competent authority. Banks and other credit and financial institutions are supervised by the Central Bank, accountants by their relevant designated accountancy body, solicitors and barristers by the Law Society and Bar Council respectively and any remaining designated persons are supervised by an authority prescribed by the Minister. The Act for the first time designated the Minister for Justice and Equality as a competent authority for a number of sectors that were previously unsupervised for this purpose.
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-25 00:00:00	Prelude	866	The Irish Prison Service provides a range of rehabilitative programmes which have the dual purpose of providing prisoners with purposeful activity while serving their sentences and encouraging and equipping them to lead productive lives on release.   The full range of services is available to all prisoners, although prisoners on shorter sentences may not be able to complete the full range of coursework and programmes.   Staff however have a wealth of experience in tailoring programmes to suit both short term and long term prisoners and endeavour to provide as complete a regime as possible within the time available.Programmes provided include healthcare, psychiatric, psychological, educational, work and training, vocational, counselling, welfare and spiritual services.  These are important in addressing offending behaviour, drug and alcohol addiction, missed educational and vocational opportunities, anger management, and self management in the interest of encouraging positive personal development and preparation for re-integration and resettlement on release from custody.Educational services are available at all institutions and are provided in partnership with a range of agencies including the VECs, Public Library Services, Colleges and the Arts Council.  The Department of Education and Skills provides an allocation of 220 whole-time teacher equivalents which has remained unaltered since 2007. Literacy, numeracy and general basic education provision is the priority and broad programmes of education are made available which generally follow an adult education approach.  During 2010, approximately 35% of the prison population attended classes.   A significant expansion and development of vocational training programmes has taken place in recent years with over 90 workshops in place capable of catering for in excess of 800 prisoners each day.    874 prisoners attended such courses last year, up from 376 who participated in 2009.The Psychology Service offers group and individual interventions to all prisoners.  Group interventions include programmes on motivational enhancement, relapse prevention, anxiety management, dialectical behaviour therapy, stress management, enhanced thinking skills and anger control.  A particular emphasis has been put on the development of programmes for prisoners convicted of sex offences and violent offences.  Individual interventions comprise therapeutic work focusing on mental health care and offence-related issues, motivational and crisis counselling.  Progress is also being made on the development of programmes based on risk assessment and rehabilitation needs.The Probation Service also helps prisoners to maintain links with family and community agencies, encouraging them to address their offending behaviour, and engaging prisoners in individual counselling and group counselling programmes such as offending behaviour, addiction, violence and sex offending.
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-25 00:00:00	Prelude	867	The management and administration of the courts, as the Deputy will be aware, is a matter for the Courts Service.  The allocation of the business of the courts, scheduling of court cases and the management of court lists are matters for the judiciary and the Presidents of the courts. The Deputy will also be aware that judges are, subject to the Constitution and the law, independent in the exercise of their judicial functions.I am informed that the judiciary monitor waiting times and backlogs of court cases on an ongoing basis to ensure that delays are kept to a minimum.  Measures introduced by the President of the High Court have resulted in marked improvements with many cases now receiving trial dates within a single legal term. Additional judges are assigned by the Presidents to Circuits and to Districts to assist with the disposal of cases where backlogs have arisen.  The Courts Service works with the judiciary to ensure that all cases are dealt with and disposed of as speedily as possible.Notwithstanding this I intend to take action, within my area of responsibility as Minister, to seek to address particular problems as they arise. For example, following a judgment last year of the European Court of Human Rights I recently established an Expert Group under the chair of Mr. Paul McDermott, SC to consider, inter alia, how delays might be alleviated and I look forward to considering their report when it is to hand.As the Deputy will be aware, an area of particular concern is the backlog at Supreme Court level which currently stands at 37 months.  The Government is committed to establishing a court of appeal and in this regard my Department is further considering the report of the Working Group on a Court of Appeal. My Department, also, is in the process of finalising the Heads of a Mediation and Conciliation Bill that will provide a more structured approach to mediation in the legal system and will assist in removing the pressure on court time and the courts.

In view of the gravity with which this type of criminal activity is viewed, the penalty was increased to 15 years by the Criminal Justice (Amendment) Act 2009.The Gardaí rigorously enforce the provisions of the law relating to witness and jury intimidation and, of course, will continue to do so.

As such it would seldom arise that the Department procures the services of external solicitors and barristers directly.    In 2007 McCann Fitzgerald solicitors were contracted, through a competitive tendering process, to provide legal drafting, research and advice services in relation to the drafting of new Rules and Procedure and Court Martial Rules following the enactment of the Defence (Amendment) Act, 2007.  A payment for this service was made in 2008 to the value of €53,845 which included VAT.  No legal firm was involved in the preparation of the tender documents.The Defence Forces Canteen board has procured legal advice from B.P. McCormack & Son, Solicitors. The only payment made in the years listed was a payment of €5,505.50 in 2008 in relation to two cases. Firstly, advice was sought concerning the amendment of regulations and, secondly, legal advice was sought in a case taken by an employee of the Board.In 2011, AL Goodbody Solicitors were paid €21,168.75 for their work in relation to a conciliation hearing between the Department and a building contractor. No competitive tender competition was held due to the short timescale available between notification of the requirement for legal advice and the date of the conciliation meeting.  AL Goodbody was selected to provide this service on the basis that they had been engaged by the Department of Finance to provide advice on the contract documents that were the subject matter of the hearing.

This application was selected for and was the subject of a Ground Eligibility/Cross Compliance Inspection.During this visit discrepancies were found in relation to a number of parcels. As a result of these discrepancies the claimed area of 20.56ha was reduced to 19.4ha. Under EU Regulations if the total area found is not sufficient to support the number of entitlements held penalties will be applied per the Terms and Conditions of the scheme. In this case the number of entitlements held by the person named is 20.24. As the difference between the area declared and the area found is more than 3%, under EU Regulations, the difference between the area found and the area claimed is doubled and deducted from the area found. As a result the area put forward for payment under the Single Payment Scheme was 17.72ha.Formal notification of these results will be forwarded to the person named in writing. If the person named is not satisfied with the results of the inspection, he may seek a review by contacting his Local Office. He also has the right to appeal the outcome of any such review to the Independent Agriculture Appeals Office.

#SimonCoveney	unknown-#SimonCoveney-party	unknown-#SimonCoveney-dob	unknown-#SimonCoveney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-25 00:00:00	Prelude	908	The size of the overall national herd and its various components is primarily a function of market forces; the allocation of economic resources is underpinned by the relationship between supply and demand with price and, ultimately, profitability reflecting the interaction of these factors. The operation of these dynamics is clearly illustrated in the current market situation at domestic level.The latest analysis of the national and international beef markets undertaken by Bord Bia indicates that Irish beef production in 2011 is expected to fall by about 8% on 2010 levels because of the strong live export trade and lower calf registrations in recent years. To date this year, cattle supplies at meat plants are over 4% or some 54,000 head lower than in 2010. As a result, average carcase prices for cattle to date this year are between 15% and 18% higher than for last year depending on the category and quality of the animal.It must be acknowledged that the Government has already channelled significant funding to the suckler cow sector. Payments to farmers by my Department under the Suckler Cow Welfare Scheme amounted to €113.5m since its introduction. Approximately €20.5m has been paid through the scheme in respect of animals born in 2010 and, depending on the number of successful applicants, this figure could potentially reach €25m by the end of the year.Furthermore, my Department and its agencies engage in a range of activities that provide a sound framework for the future development of the beef sector. These include the advisory and research output of Teagasc, Bord Bia's Quality Assurance Scheme and its promotional work in expanding beef sales at home and abroad together with the Beef and Sheepmeat Capital Investment Fund for the processing industry. My Department also makes a significant contribution to the Irish Cattle Breeding Federation which plays a critical role in improving genetic quality in the suckler herd. In addition, my Department is continuing its efforts to facilitate market access for Irish beef in a range of third countries that can offer alternative outlets to exporters along with real potential for expansion. All these investments and services serve to underpin the suckler cow herd.While the increased output value of stock is welcome news for producers, I recognise that direct supports under the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) are crucial to the future of the livestock sector and I have repeatedly stated my commitment to protecting the level of supports available to farmers under the CAP post-2013 regime. In this regard, I will use my best endeavours to shield and defend Irish agriculture generally, including suckler cow production, in the forthcoming negotiations on the CAP reform proposals.
#SimonCoveney	unknown-#SimonCoveney-party	unknown-#SimonCoveney-dob	unknown-#SimonCoveney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-25 00:00:00	Prelude	909	Under Single Market rules Member States are precluded from interfering with free trade in animals except on animal health grounds and all animals moving in intra community trade must be certified as complying with EU animal health requirements. In the case of bovines, this means that they must be certified as free from TB/Brucellosis and EBL in accordance with Community legislation as appropriate.  In addition, all ruminants imported to Ireland from beyond the UK must be certified as compliant with Community Bluetongue provisions. As an additional precaution, my Department continues to test all ruminants imported for BT, which exceeds the provisions of Community BT legislation.As a further precaution, all cattle (including calves entering the State from areas other than Northern Ireland) are subjected to a precautionary treatment against Warble Fly by my Department within days of import.I am aware that some 2,500 calves were imported into Ireland in the three months between 1 July and 30 September and my Department is fully aware of the need for continual vigilance in maintaining the highest level of disease free status in Ireland. The importer also has a critical role in ensuring that no diseases are introduced to Ireland that might jeopardise the good standing of Ireland the Food Island.

No. 94 of 2000, as amended, and who sold his/her quota under the 2000, 2001 or the 2002 Milk Quota Restructuring Scheme,OR(ii) a person who sold his/her quota under the 2003-2006 Milk Quota Restructuring Schemes, or the 2007/2008, 2008/2009 or 2009/2010 Trading Scheme.2. Producers With "Lost Lease" EntitlementsThe remaining quota after allocation in accordance with 1 above is available for allocation to producers who had taken out a land and quota lease before 1 April 2000, which has expired.  The net entitlement to quota is based on the following criteria:Producers whose land and quota leases expired on 31 March 2011 and/or expired on 31 March 2010, or earlier, on the following basis:(a) 2/3  of milk quota leased with land where the lease expired on 31 March, 2011 and which has not been or will not be renewed,and/or(b) 1/3 of milk quota leased with land where the lease expired on 31 March 2010 and where permanent allocations from previous Restructuring or Trading Schemes have not satisfied the full entitlement arising from the lease,and/or(c) any previous entitlements arising from land and quota leases that expired on 31 March 2009, or earlier and which have not already been satisfied by permanent allocations under previous Restructuring or Trading Schemes.The quota remaining in the Priority Pool after the allocation of quota in accordance with 1 and 2 above is allocated on a distribution ratio of 3:2 between:3. New And Recent Entrants To Dairying Under 35 Years Of Age on 31st March 2012 (including those who have obtained quota from the Scheme for New Entrants to  Dairying but who have not yet commenced production).4. Category 1 Producers/New And Recent Entrants To Dairying Over 35 Years of age on 31st March 2012 (including those who have obtained quota from the Scheme for New Entrants to Dairying but who have not yet commenced production).Category 1 Producers are defined as existing producers whose total permanent quota does not exceed 350,000 litres.Access to quota from the priority pool for categories 3 and 4 expires when the applicant's total permanent quota reaches 350,000 litres.The processing of applications is on-going; therefore I am not yet in a position to comment on the numbers of applications received in the four priority categories for this stage of the Trading Scheme. I intend to announce the results of the scheme in early December and the figures will be available at that time.

However, as the Deputy will be aware the Bill is a complex one and will require extensive work in conjunction with the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel to complete the required legal drafting. Once a complete draft is available I intend to publish the Bill. The issue of fur farming is being examined in the context of the ongoing drafting of the Bill. I have also established a group within my Department to review all aspects in relation to fur farming and I anticipate that their review will be completed in the near future.

It should be borne in mind that the number of applicants under the Scheme is determined by the classification of the land declared; however, as there are annually some 5,000 applicants with eligible land who do not satisfy the minimum stocking density requirement (0.15 livestock units per forage hectare), the payable number, both nationally and per county, will inevitably ultimately be somewhat lower than the figures for number of applicants quoted above.

During these checks a query arose in relation to the re-digitisation of land parcels for AEOS purposes.  This particular problem has now been addressed with a view to issuing payment as quickly as possible.An application under the 2011 Single Payment Scheme was received from the person named on 12 May 2011.

#SimonCoveney	unknown-#SimonCoveney-party	unknown-#SimonCoveney-dob	unknown-#SimonCoveney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-25 00:00:00	Prelude	925	The total IT expenditure for my Department in 2010 (including staff costs, support and maintenance services, external support etc.) was circa €27,200,000.My Department provides a robust and resilient ICT infrastructure to customers, staff, agents and partners including shared service offerings to state agencies and other Government Departments.  The ICT operations within my Department are a fundamental part of the payment systems for the Single Payment, REPS and other systems.  The ICT system is also a key element of our animal health and animal traceability systems which are crucial to our ability to export.  In addition it also supports a wide range of modern and efficient IT systems that underpin the Department's critical business processes.  Savings are achieved on an ongoing basis by leveraging maximum value from existing investments, negotiating reductions on contracts and software licences, and careful management of external resources for software development.As part of the Croke Park Agreement, a minimum of 5% saving in IT expenditure will be achieved in each year from 2012 to 2014.  In relation to agencies under the aegis of my Department,  the budgets and procedures in place for the purchasing of IT equipment for each State agency is an operational matter for the agencies themselves.
In order to provide the Government with a comprehensive set of decision options to meet the funding constraints in the National Recovery Plan, 2012-2014, the Department has carried out a comprehensive review of both current and capital expenditure.  This Review which covers all areas of the Department's activities will be considered as part of the overall pre-budget deliberations and the 2012 Estimates process of the Government.
#SimonCoveney	unknown-#SimonCoveney-party	unknown-#SimonCoveney-dob	unknown-#SimonCoveney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-25 00:00:00	Prelude	926	The pig industry is a valuable component of the overall agri-food sector, and has a farm gate value in excess of €300 million.  The sector supports approximately 7,000 jobs including production, slaughter, processing, feed manufacture and services and these are dispersed around the country.  Production, prices and exports grew significantly during 2010 and the impact of this growth was felt at all levels of the production cycle.  Prices during 2011 have remained higher than in both of the previous years and currently stand at €145.94/100 kg, some 9.2% ahead annually, while production has increased by over 8%.Exports for the first six months of 2011 reached almost 84,000 tonnes, an increase of 23% compared to the same period in 2010.   The value of this trade, at some €196 million is 18% ahead year on year.  All markets have registered an increase with trade outside of the EU more than doubling.While there has been a significant increase in prices and export volumes in 2011, high feed costs, most notably cereals and compound feed remain an issue.  Pig producers are especially affected by the increase in cereal prices since June 2009, given that cereals account for 75% of feed.Prices of pigmeat and of course feed are ultimately determined by demand and supply considerations.  For my part, I will continue to press the European Commission to make use of all the available market supports when circumstances require it, to ameliorate the worst effects of price volatility.  Indeed the Aids to Private Storage Scheme introduced for pigmeat earlier this year played a significant role in putting a floor under pigmeat prices at that time.From a National perspective, the ‘ Food Harvest 2020 Report’, which was published in July 2010, sets out the vision for the future of the food industry including the pig sector.  The Report targets a 50% increase in the value of output by 2020.  This is a target set by the industry for itself.  I am personally chairing a High Level Group to ensure that the steps necessary to facilitate the development of the sector are taken.  My Department and its agencies will, along with industry, play a central role in this regard.For example Teagasc, through its Moorpark pig research facility, the provision of FETAC courses in pig production and benchmarking pig herd performance, plays a critically important role in improving productive capacity at farm level.In so far as international trade in Irish pigmeat is concerned, I have been extremely active in developing relationships in new and expanding markets in order to build the kind of confidence in Irish production and control systems that provide a platform for long term trading relationships in the future.  As part of that effort, I hosted a visit from the Chinese Vice-Minister for Agriculture earlier this year, and signed a mutual co-operation agreement in the agri-food sector.  In addition, my Department has this year hosted inspection visits from Australia, the Philippines, South Korea and China, with a view to opening new markets and expanding the presence of Irish pigmeat in existing markets.  And of course Bord Bia continues, through its marketing and promotional activities, and through the pigmeat quality assurance scheme, to consolidate the position of Irish pigmeat on the domestic market and to expand its presence on EU and third country markets.I can assure the Deputy that my Department and its agencies will continue to work closely with the industry to ensure that it can continue to develop and grow in accordance with the targets in the Food Harvest 2020 Report.

Funding is administered to the Youth Centre by the City of Dublin Youth Service Board (CDYSB)In determining allocations to initiatives and schemes in 2011 my Department has made every effort to minimise the impact of the reduction in the Youth Affairs budget on front line youth work services.  In light of continuing budgetary constraints, the Youth Affairs budget in 2012 will again require careful management with a focus on prioritising existing youth service provision and protecting jobs and pay in so far as is possible.  Officials from my Department are in contact with representatives of the youth sector, including the City of Dublin Youth Service Board, on an ongoing basis to ascertain the sector's views on how best to minimise the impact of these budgetary constraints.  Every effort will be made to notify the various youth work organisations and administering agencies, in this instance, CDYSB, of their 2012 allocations as speedily as possible.

This support includes financial assistance for national and major regional youth work organisations under the Youth Service Grant Scheme (YSGS) and targeted youth work responses for young people through the Special Projects for Youth Scheme (SPY).Through the Youth Service Grant Scheme, grant-in-aid funding is provided on an annual basis to 31 voluntary national and regional youth work organisations.  These organisations provide universal youth work opportunities for young people aged between 10 and 21 that are educational and elective, structured and systematic and which aim to improve young people's life chances and experiences.  Funding is provided to the national structures of these organisations to support work with young people at regional and local level.  In particular, organisations such as Ógras, the Irish Girl Guides, Foróige and Youth Work Ireland are active in the Co. Meath area.In addition under the Special Projects for Youth Scheme, my Department provides funding to Meath Youth Together on an annual basis.  In 2011, a grant of €106,506 has been allocated to this Navan-based project which is affiliated to Youth Work Ireland.  This project provides a range of programmes services for some 7,000 young people on an annual basis.

#KathleenLynch	unknown-#KathleenLynch-party	unknown-#KathleenLynch-dob	unknown-#KathleenLynch-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-25 00:00:00	Prelude	941	As indicated by the Deputy, the funding of disability services by the Department of Health is the subject of a detailed Value for Money and Policy Review as part of the Government's Value for Money Reviews for the period 2009 to 2011.As part of the overall VFM review, a separate Expert Reference Group on Disability Policy was established to look specifically at existing disability policy and whether it needs to be changed to better meet the expectations and objectives of people with disabilities.  As part of this review, a public consultation process on existing disability services was also undertaken which confirmed that people with disabilities and their families, more than anything else, are looking for more choice in the services they receive and more control over how they access them.The report proposes a very significant reframing of disability services towards a model of individualised supports, underpinned by mainstreaming of all public services. On this basis, State funding would be allocated based on an independent assessment of individual needs. Following the needs assessments, individual support plans would then be drawn up and individualised budgets allocated from which the supports and services needed would be purchased.A number of mechanisms are proposed to achieve this, including a broker system where the person, or his/her family, has the choice and control but the broker administers the budget and commissions supports and services on their behalf, or direct payments where the person or family manages the budget and purchases the supports themselves. This process should, over time, result in a rebalancing of resources from the services which are less effective to services which support the achievement of  quality outcomes within a value for money framework.The Expert Reference Group's Report has now been released for the public and interested parties to have their say and I would encourage all those with an interest in this area to make their views on the future direction of disability services known.The VFM exercise is due to be completed by year end and it is then my intention in conjunction with Minister Reilly to ensure that proposals for the future of our disability services are brought to Government.

My Department receives regular updates from the Australian Embassy as to the progress of this legislation, which is currently being debated in the Australian Senate. It should be noted, however, that on June 27 2011, Philip Morris Asia (PMA) initiated legal action against the introduction of this legislation.  The company announced that it had served a notice of claim on the Australian Government, stating its intention to pursue legal action over plans to introduce plain packaging in Australia for tobacco products.With regards to the possibility of introducing plain packaging here in Ireland, I believe it is one of a range of measures under consideration by the Tobacco Policy Review Group (TPRG).  I anticipate that the report of the TPRG will be completed in the coming months and I will consider the recommendations therein with a view, thereafter, to bringing the Review outcomes to Government for consideration.I am also aware that plain packaging is being considered in the context of the possible revision of the Tobacco Products Directive and I await with anticipation the Commission's legislative proposal in this regard which is due in the first half of 2012. The outcome of this forthcoming revision of the Tobacco Products Directive and the outcome of the Australian litigation will further inform future policy in this area.

#DrJamesReilly	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-party	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-dob	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-25 00:00:00	Prelude	945	In March 2010, the European Court of Justice ruled that Ireland, by imposing minimum retail prices for cigarettes, was in contravention of Article 9(1) of Council Directive 95/59/EC of 27 November 1995 on taxes other than turnover taxes which affect the consumption of manufactured tobacco. The revised draft Regulations have now been forwarded to the European Commission to ensure that they align the Irish legislation with Article 9(1) of  the Directive.As a consequence of the Court judgement, Ireland can no longer set a mandatory pricing level below which cigarette prices cannot be lowered, as this would be restricting the freedom of industry to make effective use of competitive advantage. However, the regulations do contain a range of measures to ensure that quantitative rebates, which are outside the scope of the Directive and are unrelated to cost differences, are prohibited.

In this regard I have established the Special Delivery Unit (SDU), which will work to unblock access to acute services by dramatically improving the flow of patients through the system, and by streamlining waiting lists, including referrals from GPs. The SDU is working closely with its partner agencies — mainly the HSE and the NTPF.As a priority, public hospitals have been instructed to ensure that, by the end of 2011, they have no patients waiting more than 12 months for treatment.  Where they fail to do so, the NTPF will source the necessary treatments elsewhere and an appropriate budgetary adjustment will be made.As this is a service matter, it has been referred to the HSE for direct reply. Should the patient's general practitioner consider that the patient's condition warrants an earlier appointment, he/she would be in the best position to take the matter up with the consultant and facility involved.

This commitment was clearly shown in the Programme for Government which provides for the ring-fencing of €35 million annually from within the overall health budget to develop community mental health services and to implement Reach Out. This is currently being considered as part of the Estimates process for 2012 and future years.  Any increases in funding for the National Office for Suicide Prevention (NOSP) will be decided in this context.

The Medical Council is the statutory registration authority for medical practitioners in Ireland. The Council regulates doctors to practise medicine in the State. Its statutory role, as outlined in the Medical Practitioners Act 2007, is to protect the public by promoting and better ensuring high standards of professional conduct and professional education, training and competence among registered medical practitioners.  One of the key responsibilities of the Medical Council is the setting of good medical practice, and medical practitioners must demonstrate a commitment to fulfilling professional responsibilities by adhering to the standards specified in the Council's "Guide to Professional Conduct and Ethics for Registered Medical Practitioners". Doctors must always be guided by their primary responsibility to act in the best interests of their patients.
#DrJamesReilly	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-party	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-dob	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-25 00:00:00	Prelude	960	The total number of surgical procedures carried out under the National Treatment Purchase Fund (NTPF) to date is 163,315. The NTPF does not normally send patients for treatment outside Ireland. The Fund has, where particular circumstances warranted it, sent a small number of patients abroad for treatment. For example, the Fund has arranged for patients living in border counties to be treated in private facilities in Northern Ireland. Of the 163,315 total surgical procedures carried out over 95% were treated in Ireland, 0.5% were treated in England (2002-2008), 0.02% treated in USA (2004-2006), 3.9% were treated in Northern Ireland (2002 to date Sept 2011). The number of surgical procedures undertaken by the NTPF, broken down by year, is set out in the table below.YearTreated20021,92020037,832200413,627200514,580200616,931200722,069200823,927200922,370201024,1182011 total to end Sept 201115,941Total163,315The Government is embarking on a major reform programme of the health system.  The aim of this reform is to deliver a single-tier health service, supported by universal health insurance, which will ensure equal access to care based on need, not income. A key immediate priority was the establishment in June of the Special Delivery Unit (SDU), to drive down waiting times for patients and a lot of work has already been undertaken in that regard.   The resources of the NTPF will be refocused to align with the work of the SDU, and crucially, will allow for a progressive improvement in the performance of the acute hospital system.

The new building, which has single en-suite rooms and isolation rooms, will play a vital role in the treatment of patients with cystic fibrosis and a range of other conditions.Cork University Hospital has the second largest adult cystic fibrosis (CF) centre in Ireland. The CUH centre currently caters for the needs of 145 adult patients attending from the Munster region.In September 2007, Dr. Barry Plant was appointed as the Director of the adult cystic fibrosis programme at CUH.  Since his appointment, Dr. Plant has worked closely with various HSE services, philanthropic organisations such as Build4Life and CFAI, and scientific research agencies in advancing the needs of these patients. In June of 2008, Dr. Plant, in consultation with the CF Multi Disciplinary Team and the CF community locally, submitted a ‘Statement of Need' for CF services to the Executive Management Board of Cork University Hospital.  This document, which was approved by the Board, outlined a strategic plan to develop CF services in the hospital, including the provision of day and inpatient facilities.CF Day CentreThe CF Day Centre, which opened in CUH in May of this year, caters for most clinical needs of CF patients. It includes five isolation rooms, a dedicated CF gym, a multidisciplinary team room and consultant rooms.  The capital costs for this development were provided through a partnership approach between HSE South and the Build4Life organisation.Inpatient Isolation and Bed Facility:Currently, Dr. Plant is working with the Executive Management Board of the CUH to develop a designated inpatient unit, with en-suite rooms for CF patients.  A location has been identified for a combined designated adult inpatient facility and respiratory unit. This is in a vacated ward on the CUH campus.  Provisional plans and costings have been made, with an estimated build cost of approximately €3m.The hospital is working in partnership with Build4Life to co-fund this development.  To date, Build4Life has raised over €2m to support CF capital developments at CUH.  HSE South is examining ways to secure additional capital funding to complete the unit, in the context of decreasing capital budget allocations in the present stringent climate.  The need to develop the adult in-patient facility remains a Board and HSE South priority and the HSE will continue to work with Build4Life to complete this project.I recently met with the Cystic Fibrosis Association of Ireland and I am keenly aware of the needs of people who live with CF.I am actively considering a Lotto application from Build4Life and will make a decision shortly and will inform the Deputy and Build4Life when I have done so.

A further €111,000 was allocated to the centre this year by the HSE, as part of its range of supports for community and voluntary provision in the area of drugs education and prevention.    Due to the challenging economic environment, the funding available to Drugs Task Forces has been reduced in recent years.   In line with Government policy, Drugs Task Forces have been requested to avoid impacting on front line services as far as possible.  Similarly, the HSE has sought to manage the impact of reductions through prioritising direct services to those individuals and families directly affected by drug misuse.   Funding in relation to 2012 will be determined in the context of the estimates process taking into account the need to protect front line service provision.

#KathleenLynch	unknown-#KathleenLynch-party	unknown-#KathleenLynch-dob	unknown-#KathleenLynch-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-25 00:00:00	Prelude	977	The level of funding available for the health budget is being considered as part of the Comprehensive Review of Expenditure and Estimates process for 2012 which is currently underway. Deliberations by the Government on the expenditure allocations for next year are likely to continue up until Budget time and it would not be appropriate for me to comment further at this stage pending the outcome of those deliberations.  The very difficult financial position facing the Exchequer will obviously require very careful management across all areas of expenditure.A major priority for the Government in the coming months will be to finalise the current Value for Money and Policy Review of Disability Services to ensure that existing funding for people with disabilities is spent to best effect. It is now more important than ever that large scale spending programmes of this nature are subject to detailed periodic review. The VFM Efficiency and Effectiveness Review will make recommendations that will ensure that the very substantial funding, €1.5 billion, provided to the specialist disability health sector is used to maximum benefit for persons with disability, having regard to overall resource constraints which affect all sectors at this time.As Minister for Equality, Disability, Mental Health and Older People I am committed to ensuring that the needs of our citizens who have a disability are addressed across the whole of Government.

It was originally a Tuberculosis clinic opened in 1935.  There are 80 residents currently at the facility. There is also a day centre at the front of the main building providing a service to older persons from the local community.   The HSE decided to close the home and transfer the majority of services to the new modern purpose built unit at Hollybrook Community Nursing Unit at Inchicore.  The new CNU at Inchicore has a total capacity of 50 beds.  It has not been opened to date due to the current constraints on staffing.As capacity of the new CNU is less than that at the home referred to by the Deputy the proposal also envisages that some staff and residents will transfer to other public units.  This will provide the HSE with an opportunity to reopen beds that are closed at these facilities.I would like to reassure the Deputy that the residents will remain our primary concern.  Selection of alternative placements will be informed by the medical and care needs of each resident as evaluated by clinical staff.   It is important to emphasise that no resident will be placed in a more costly financial position because of the move. I understand that the indicative timescale for the transfer is between 3 and 6 months.   The Deputy will be aware that the Health Service Executive has sole operational responsibility for the delivery of health and social services, including those at this facility, accordingly, the matter has been referred to the Executive for direct reply.

This is currently being considered as part of the Estimates process for 2012 and future years.  My priority as Minister of State with responsibility for Mental Health will be to further advance the implementation of A Vision for Change.   I have asked the HSE to prepare an implementation plan, which will identify specific areas of priority that can be progressed over the next three years, with timelines, detailed costs, structures and identifiable person(s) responsible for driving the change including delivery on the commitments in our Programme for Government. Issues related to staffing levels particularly in community mental health teams will also be examined in this context.

I understand that arrangements, which include staff redeployments and a communications plan, are being put in place by the HSE in relation to this change.The HSE does not anticipate that this change will have an effect upon the number of patients awaiting admission to an in-patient bed in Cavan General Hospital as the patients treated in the MIU are patients with minor injuries only and would not  require admission to an in-patient bed.In relation to meeting with the Clones Town Council, they should communicate their request to my Department and it will be considered in the usual manner.
#DrJamesReilly	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-party	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-dob	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-25 00:00:00	Prelude	1000	Beaumont Hospital is one of the 6 specialist centres that provides services to adults with cystic fibrosis.  In the 2008 Budget, a special allocation of €2.5m capital funding was provided to enable the hospital to provide facilities for ambulatory care of people with cystic fibrosis.  This new facility opened on 26th October 2010 and provides a significantly enhanced service to adult patients with CF.This enabled the provision of the new dedicated outpatient facility for patients with CF. This Unit facilitates a comprehensive range of services from the multidisciplinary teams. These services include outpatient clinics, a drop in centre/base for clinical assessments with medical consultants and nurses, and the provision of treatments that otherwise may have required hospitalisation.The new consultation and treatment rooms have an air filtration system which facilitates 12 air changes per hour, approximately three times the average rate in a normal room.  This reduces the time needed between patients for the purposes of infection control.At present there are four dedicated en-suite isolation rooms for the CF Service in Beaumont Hospital. The CEO, Beaumont Hospital, is aware of the requirement to increase capacity and is committed to identifying the additional facilities and resources required to meet the increased demand.With priority access to a number of en-suite inpatient rooms, the need for an adult with CF being admitted as an inpatient via the Emergency Department is now a rare occurrence.The Deputy will also be aware of the development of the new 100 bed Unit being built at St Vincent's Hospital which encompasses both in-patient and day care facilities for patients with Cystic Fibrosis.  It represents a major improvement in the care of Cystic Fibrosis patients in Ireland.  The development at the hospital will provide a state of the art clinical building which will include up to date isolation facilities with accommodation for people with cystic fibrosis.This 100 inpatient bed unit (in single en-suite rooms) will accommodate the needs of patients with cystic fibrosis and many other patients whose medical requirements necessitate single en suite facilities.  One ward (20 beds) in the new Unit will be dedicated for use by cystic fibrosis patients.  Twenty per cent of the beds on each of the 5 wards will be isolation rooms. This represents best practice in terms of infection control. It will also provide 10 single day treatment rooms with en-suite sanitary facilities.The Government is acutely aware of the challenges that people with cystic fibrosis and their families face in managing their condition and fully acknowledges the need for and support the provision of dedicated accommodation in an environment which allows appropriate isolation for improved infection control.  The Government supports the continued roll-out of regional services for patients with cystic fibrosis.
#KathleenLynch	unknown-#KathleenLynch-party	unknown-#KathleenLynch-dob	unknown-#KathleenLynch-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-25 00:00:00	Prelude	1001	As the first part of the Deputy's question relates to service matters I have asked the Health Service Executive (HSE) to outline the services and supports provided for people with neuromuscular conditions directly to the Deputy.Medical CardsThe Health Act of 1970 provides the legal basis for awarding a medical card. The legislation requires the HSE to have regard to the person's overall financial situation. All persons seeking a medical card are assessed by the HSE as to their ability to arrange GP services without undue hardship. There are no plans to provide for the granting of medical cards to any particular group of patients with specific medical conditions. However, the HSE does look beyond the applicant's financial situation and has regard to other matters they consider appropriate in assessing a person's individual circumstances for a medical card. This assessment can address individual circumstances, including an illness or medical circumstances that result in financial hardship, or the costs associated with the provision of medical treatment. Those who are not eligible for a medical card may still be able to avail of a GP visit card, which covers the cost of general practice consultations.Long Term Illness SchemeUnder this scheme patients with a prescribed disease or illness of a long-term nature are provided with medicines and medical and surgical appliances without charge.  While people with muscular dystrophy are eligible for the Long Term Illness Scheme there are no plans to extend the list of conditions covered by the Scheme. However, the terms of the scheme will be reviewed in the context of the Government's proposals for Universal Health Insurance and free GP care at the point of delivery.

No external consultants are being used for this process. Consultation covering all the key stakeholders including patients and public representatives, will be an integral part of the process and plans for the consultations required are currently under development and are expected to be completed shortly.  The three hospitals in the region (St. Michael's, St. Columcille's and St. Vincent's) are working together with the HSE to ensure that the appropriate level of service is provided in the best location to ensure clinical safety, quality and patient safety and to manage risk.  No downgrading of the emergency department at St. Columcille's hospital has been announced. Work has been ongoing for a number of months and transfer of services from one site to another will not occur until all patient safety issues and clinical issues are fully considered. Any future changes will take place within the context of the Clinical Programmes and the developing Framework for smaller hospitals.

The SDU is working closely with its partner agencies — mainly the HSE and the NTPF.As a priority, public hospitals have been instructed to ensure that, by the end of 2011, they have no patients waiting more than 12 months for treatment.  Where they fail to do so, the NTPF will source the necessary treatments elsewhere and an appropriate budgetary adjustment will be made.As this is a service matter, it has been referred to the HSE for direct reply.

Under the Framework Agreement, service providers can be asked to source and supply either senior interim managers or more long-term senior management candidates.  At present, the HSE is focussing on getting senior interim managers in place.Following a tender process, a Framework Agreement, involving five companies, was established in September 2011.  In October 2011, the five companies were invited to participate in a mini-competition to source and propose candidates for an Interim Management Support Structure for HSE West.   The competition has closed and the proposals are being evaluated. As this process is still underway, it would be inappropriate for me to comment any further on it at this stage.Under these arrangements it is planned to recruit a Chief Executive Officer for the Galway University Hospitals Group. It is also intended to strengthen management capacity in the HSE Mid-Western region by putting in place a similar Interim Management Support Structure.It is envisaged that existing managers in these locations will benefit from a transfer of knowledge and skills while working alongside these senior interim managers resulting in the further development of the management and service delivery capability.    The information and consultation mechanism used in the context of the planned Interim Management Support Structure for HSE West was in line with the terms of the Public Service Agreement.  The HSE engaged with the relevant staff representative body at both a national and local level.The number of management posts vacant in other regional hospitals other than in the HSE-West is not immediately available.  I have asked the HSE to collate this information and reply to the Deputy directly.

Deliberations by the Government on the expenditure allocations for next year are likely to continue up until Budget time and it would not be appropriate for me to comment further at this stage pending the outcome of those deliberations.  The very difficult financial position facing the Exchequer will obviously require very careful management across all areas of expenditure.The Health Service Executive will continue to fund Muscular Dystrophy Ireland  subject to any overall resources limitations that may arise for all service providers in the disability sector generally.

The planning, design and implementation of individual road projects such as the N17 Claregalway Bypass is a matter for the National Roads Authority (NRA) under the Roads Acts 1993 to 2007 in conjunction with the local authorities concerned.  Within its capital budget, the assessment and prioritisation of individual projects is a matter in the first instance for the NRA in accordance with Section 19 of the Roads Act.  Noting the above position, in reference to national roads, I have referred the Deputy's question to the NRA for direct reply.  Please advise my private office if you do not receive a reply within 10 working days.Regarding regional and local road expenditure to date on the Claregalway (Baile Chlair) inner relief road project, €71,852 was spent in 2009 under the RLR Strategic Road Grants Scheme towards the planning and design stage of this project.  Galway County Council have been allocated €100,000 towards the design of this project in 2011.  As the Deputy is aware, the improvement and maintenance of regional and local roads is the statutory responsibility of each local authority, in accordance with the provisions of section 13 of the Roads Act 1993.  Works on these roads are funded from local authorities own resources and are supplemented by State road grants.  The initial selection and prioritisation of projects to be funded is also a matter for the local authority.

#LeoVaradkar	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-party	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-dob	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-25 00:00:00	Prelude	1032	In September of this year, following the expiry of the term of the original Board of the Road Safety Authority, I appointed a new Board consisting of a mix of experience from the previous Board and some new members.  The new Board consists of the following (reappointed members are marked with a *): Mr. Gay Byrne* (Chair); Ms Áine Cornally*; Dr. Áine Carroll; Mr. Seán Finan; Ms Myra Garrett*; Mr. Aaron McHale*; Mr. Ronan Melvin; and Mr. Edward Rock.  The appointment of the Chair is subject to his appearance before the Oireachtas Committee. I understand that Mr. Byrne is scheduled to appear before the Committee on 15th November 2011.The driving test is a legal requirement in order to receive a full driving licence, and requirements for the test are set out in law rather than as a matter of RSA policy.  Details of the test requirements are set out in Regulation 26 of the Road Traffic (Licensing of Drivers) Regulations 2006 (S.I. No. 537 of 2006).  Learners must hold a learner permit for at least six months before taking the test and, as of April 2011, new learner car drivers must also undertake mandatory lessons before being allowed to take the test.The RSA, as part of its work, engages with key stakeholders through a variety of means on many matters.  Any forum operated by the RSA is the responsibility of the Authority itself.  I have, therefore, referred that part of the Deputy's question, relating to a learner drivers forum, to the RSA for direct reply.  I would ask the Deputy to contact my office if a reply has not been received within ten days.

The existence of a recognised standard, through the regime of registering Approved Driving Instructors (ADIs) is also beneficial for the industry and ensures that rogue operators are kept out of the system.  The existing standards and requirements for ADIs, which were introduced in 2009, are, of course, open to consideration and review.  Following a process of examination of how these standards are operating, the Road Safety Authority, which is responsible for overseeing the ADI system, has recently made a number of proposals to adjust and improve the system.  My Department is examining these proposals at present and I expect to be in a position to decide on them in the near future.I consider it important that systems such as  the ADI regime should be subject to periodic review and I remain open to considering other adjustments to the system as and when they may become necessary.

The initial selection and prioritisation of projects to be funded under these grants is also a matter for the local authority.I understand that Mayo County Council wrote to the National Roads Authority seeking additional funding for the Bridge at Turlough, Co. Mayo, however all of the 2011 regional and local road grants have now been fully allocated and there are no further funds available from which an additional allocation could be made.  It is however open to the council to include this project among its applications for consideration for funding under the Specific Improvement Grants Scheme in 2012.In relation to the traffic calming measures at Ballyvary Co.

#LeoVaradkar	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-party	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-dob	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-25 00:00:00	Prelude	1035	Under the Road Safety Authority Act 2006 (Conferral of Functions) Order 2006 (S.I. No. 477 of 2006) the Road Safety Authority (RSA) has overall responsibility for the operation, oversight, development, quality assurance and delivery of vehicle testing arrangements.The testing function is currently carried out by Applus+ under a contractual arrangement with the RSA, who exercise a supervisory role to ensure that the service provided by Applus+ conforms to the conditions of that contract. The RSA continuously monitors Applus+ performance and has regular meetings with them to ensure compliance with contract requirements. To assist the RSA in carrying out this role, the Authority has appointed external contractors to monitor performance by Applus+, and to report regularly to the RSA.I understand from the RSA that Applus+ has confirmed to them that booking slots have not been reduced to 20 minutes. The shortest slots are in large volume centres and have an average duration of 28 minutes. Activity at some NCT test centres declined during the current quarter due to a drop in demand allied to an increase in the number of  owners failing to keep appointments ("no shows").This situation arises every year and, as in previous years, Applus+ has increased the average number of appointments at 7 centres to minimise its impact. In these centres the time allocated per slot, for a test with an average duration of 20 minutes, has been reduced from 35 minutes to 32.5 minutes. Time slots at other centres are unaffected and those in the affected centres will revert to 35 minutes in January when demand increases and the number of "no shows" decreases.Internal human resources are a matter for Applus+ and the RSA in relation to the performance of the NCT contract.  However, I understand that a number of human resource matters are due to be heard by the Labour Relations Commission.
