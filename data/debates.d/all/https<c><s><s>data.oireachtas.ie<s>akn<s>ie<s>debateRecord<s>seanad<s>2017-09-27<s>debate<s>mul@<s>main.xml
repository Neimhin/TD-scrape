            <p eId="para_14">I thank the Minister of State for attending today.</p>
            <p eId="para_15"> I welcome the commissioning of the review by the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government into funding for Traveller-specific accommodation and the implementation of the Traveller accommodation programmes. It followed a very useful meeting that we had, and I thank the Minister for acting upon that. I understand that the housing agency report has been complete since July but it remains unpublished, and I rely on leaked information from <i>The</i>
							<i>Irish Times </i>article published on 14 September which reported that Traveller accommodation targets have not been fully met at any point since they were made mandatory on local authorities 18 years ago. The article in <i>The</i>
							<i>Irish Times </i>goes on to say that the leaked report concludes that anti-Traveller prejudice at local authority level may be hampering progress. If the intention of Government policy and the current legislation is that targets for Traveller accommodation would be met in full and that things would improve it is clearly failing. It is failing Traveller women, children and men. The report commissioned by the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government finds that more than €55 million provided for Traveller housing remains unspent since 2000, and just 68% of promised Traveller accommodation units have been provided. All the while, Travellers continue to live in shocking conditions, which I have seen myself at first hand. </p>
            <p eId="para_16"> There is unacceptable overcrowding on halting sites. Figures from the Department show that the number of Traveller families in need of accommodation since 2000 has more than doubled. In this new leaked report, local authorities agreed that overcrowding was an issue, leading to health and safety concerns. All stakeholder groups agreed that the future assessment of the needs for Traveller families was unfit for purpose. The second anniversary of those who died in the Carrickmines fire is coming up. More people will die in tragedies if these concerns are not addressed. People will continue to live shorter lives and suffer from housing related ill-health. I ask the Minister of State what will be done about all of that.</p>
            <p eId="para_17"> According to the 2016 census, the Traveller homelessness rate is 11 times higher than the general population. In the last five years the rate of Traveller homelessness has tripled.</p>
            <p eId="para_18">The leaked report also finds that the private rented accommodation provisions are extremely difficult for Traveller families to access. Often discrimination and prejudice are getting in the way. People are rejected based on their names alone. It is a landlord's market, as the Minister of State knows, yet some local authorities use private rented accommodation as the alternative to staying on waiting list for Travellers seeking access to Traveller-specific accommodation. Figures show a rise from 162 families in 2002 to 2,222 in 2016. This has rendered increasing numbers of families homeless, further fuelling the crisis. Most Traveller-specific housing and social housing in general is provided by local authorities using the Part VIII planning process but the leaked report further found that the most significant obstacle to the delivery of Traveller accommodation is the planning process itself, particularly objections from settled residents and elected representatives, as the Minister of State well knows.</p>
            <p eId="para_19"> I note and welcome the Minister's decision to review the Housing (Traveller Accommodation) Act 1998. However, there must also be a review of legislation that affects Travellers in order to alleviate the crisis. For example, the recent amendment to the Planning and Development (Housing) and Residential Tenancies Act 2016, which facilitated developments of more than 100 accommodation units being dealt with directly by An Bord Pleanála without going through local planning processes, could also include Traveller accommodation. Legislation should be introduced immediately to implement this change and decisions to approve specific proposals for Traveller-specific accommodation should be taken away from the local political system and vested in An Bord Pleanála.</p>
            <p eId="para_20"> There is, at best, systemic apathy and, at worst, prejudice in terms of meeting the accommodation needs of Travellers. An indication of the apathy towards Travellers and their accommodation is reflected in the participation in this leaked review, as the Minister of State knows, where only 26 out of the 31 local authorities responded to the survey and only 22 submitted with sufficient detail across all questions. Significant gaps were found in local authority reporting and inadequate data-keeping. In some cases, there were no standardised recording, reporting and monitoring mechanisms. Indeed the deadline for reporting to the Housing Agency, which the Minister commissioned, was extended twice to facilitate poor responses. Will the Minister of State tell us when the Housing Agency review will be published and his plans to address the issue raised in the report and the major crisis for Travellers and their housing needs?</p>

            <p eId="para_21">I thank Senator Kelleher for providing me with the opportunity to update the House on the Traveller accommodation programme, TAP, review which was recently completed and provided to the national Traveller accommodation committee, NTACC. A Programme for a Partnership Government commits to establishing a special working group to audit the current delivery and implementation of local authorities' Traveller accommodation plans and consult stakeholders on key areas of concern. This commitment was underpinned in Rebuilding Ireland - Action Plan for Housing and Homelessness which provided for the commissioning by the Housing Agency, on behalf of the Department, of an expert, independent review of expenditure on and delivery of Traveller accommodation to underpin the work of the special working group.</p>
            <p eId="para_22"> In 2016, the Housing Agency commissioned the review, which examined capital and current funding for Traveller-specific accommodation for the period 2000 to date, having regard to the targets contained in the local authority TAPs and actual units delivered. It also examined the current status of the accommodation funded and the funding provided for accommodation maintenance and other supports. Where targets in the TAPs have not been met, the review included an analysis of the underlying reasons to identify the particular challenges that need to be addressed to underpin future progress.</p>
            <p eId="para_23"> The final report was completed and submitted to the Housing Agency in June and it, in turn, submitted the final report to my Department in July. It was circulated to the NTACC members, considered by a subgroup of the NTACC and discussed at the most recent meeting of the NTACC on 28 August. At this meeting, the NTACC agreed to advise me to establish an expert group to examine and make recommendations on issues regarding Traveller accommodation policy, strategy and implementation. This is in keeping with the commitment in A Programme for a Partnership Government, and I have agreed to proceed with the establishment of this expert group. I have also agreed that a review of the Housing (Traveller Accommodation) Act 1998 should be part of the work of the expert group. The composition and terms of reference and methodology of this expert group are being formulated with a view to it being in place as soon as possible. My Department is making arrangements for the recently completed review to be made available on the Department's website within the next week.</p>

            <p eId="para_24">I have two questions. One of them was answered by the Minister of State, namely, when the report will be published. It will be published within the next week. I will monitor that and look forward to seeing it. While the expert group is welcome, it cannot be a delaying tactic or a way of kicking this urgent issue to touch. Over the past 18 years since the legislation was introduced, the targets have never been fully met. Local authorities are sending money back. They are not even making their returns to the review. I would like to hear more specifics from the Minister of State, and not simply the date when the review will be published, which is welcome, and the establishment of an expert group. I would like to know what the Minister of State is going to do about this urgent issue of life and death for Traveller families.</p>

            <p eId="para_25">I assure the Senator that it is not a delaying tactic. I only inherited this role a few months ago. There is no agreement on the best way to spend this money. I am not happy in the same way as the Senator is not happy that the money is not being spent where it should be. There are accommodation issues. The budget has increased over the past year. We made sure of that as well. My job as Minister of State is to make sure it is spent.</p>
            <p eId="para_26"> I will not comment on the review because it is not published yet. I will have no problem commenting on it when it is published next week but, as a habit, I do not comment on leaked documents. We can discuss it in greater detail when it is published next week. Again, it highlights many of the issues that need to be addressed. We must find ways of spending this money. When the committee agrees who will be on the expert commission, I hope it will involve some international experts to find ways of making sure we honour our commitments because it is a priority for Government. We are putting the money back where it should be. I agree with the Senator that if one analyses many of the local authority waiting lists, one sees there is a difficulty for people from Traveller backgrounds, so we need to address that. Likewise, they have different issues as well. Some of them want to live in different places, so we need to accommodate that as best we can. There is no excuse for money not being spent. Along with the review and the report of the commission, I will try to engage with local authorities to make sure the money is spent this year and in the year ahead.</p>

            <p eId="para_31">I appreciate that. The Minister of State is very familiar with this issue. I know he has visited Donegal a number of times and met affected families. He knows it very well at this stage. Even though it had limited terms of reference, the expert panel report, which was published almost four months ago, clearly demonstrated that there was a profound failure in State oversight of the manufacturing of concrete blocks. There was also a failure in building control regulations. Looking at the eight recommendations, it can be seen that they clearly point to a failure in State oversight. What does that mean? According to this report, and based on my own evidence in Donegal, it means that thousands of families in Donegal were profoundly failed by the State. The biggest investment a family will make is, of course, the purchase and securing of the family home through a mortgage or loan. It is a huge investment. They have been left not just with unsafe homes but also with this financial distress. It is deeply distressing for the families. This expert panel report was delayed by one year. This is another year of distress, worry and not knowing what is going to happen. We are now a further four months down the line. All I am asking is that the families affected in Donegal and Mayo receive the same support from this State as did families in Dublin and north Leinster who were affected by pyrite. We are just asking for equality of treatment and equality of support from the State.</p>
            <p eId="para_32"> There is no more time for dragging heels. The Minister of State knows what needs to be done. We need a redress scheme in order that families can make their homes safe. I have spoken to families in Donegal who are worried that the bison concrete slabs between their floors could come down on top of them. They are worried that their gable could collapse. The Minister has heard these stories as well. We must do something about this. There must be financial supports for families who are already paying a mortgage. They have seen their houses devalued profoundly, so in the vast majority of cases they do not have the financial capacity to do it themselves.</p>
            <p eId="para_33"> The State needs to step up here. It failed in its responsibilities. The concrete block is the core component of the family home in Ireland. Not ensuring those blocks were manufactured to a proper safe standard and that building control measures were right and proper was a huge failure. It is a collective failure of our State and we need see collective responsibility being taken. Now, four months after the publication of this report, I urge the Minister of State, please, to put in place a redress scheme for the families in Donegal and Mayo who desperately need the Government's help.</p>

            <from>Deputy Damien English<recordedTime time="2017-09-27T10:50:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_34">I thank both Senators for raising this important issue. It is one that affects many people and one that has been raised weekly by colleagues from all parties. I reiterate that it is important we realise it is an issue which we must all work together to resolve as best we can.</p>
            <p eId="para_35"> I acknowledge the very difficult and distressing situation that certain home owners in Donegal and Mayo face on account of damage to the structural integrity of their homes. I have seen some of these damaged homes first-hand and have met home owners in both Donegal and Mayo and understand what they are going through. The will is there to try to help people through this difficult phase.</p>
            <p eId="para_36"> I understand clearly the difficulties they face. I firmly believe the parties responsible for poor workmanship and the supply of defective materials should face up to their responsibilities and take appropriate actions to provide remedies to affected home owners. The Senators may reread the report and see what it says exactly because it does refer to defective materials. That is the root cause of this problem. The expert panel on concrete blocks was established by my Department in April 2016 to investigate problems that have emerged in the concrete block work of certain dwellings in counties Donegal and Mayo. I will not go through the panel's terms of reference again but it was about trying to establish the number of houses in question. We now know roughly the breakdown in Mayo and Donegal. Much good work has been done by the different action groups in gathering that information and sharing it with the expert panel. I ask people to continue to do that and to identify themselves if they have properties in which they believe mica or pyrite is present, because that helps us formulate our plans. A major part of the work of the expert panel and the reason it took time was to work out a process on how best to address these houses and remedy the problems, including the technical solutions involved, which is the key part. Most of the residents who have engaged with it understand the process. We are all annoyed that it took longer than we had hoped, but we understand the processes we had to go through. The Senator referred to other schemes, and similarly there were formulas used there.</p>
            <p eId="para_37"> I received the report of the expert panel in June 2017. It is comprehensive and addresses all areas of the terms of reference. On 13 June 2017, I published the report. It has eight recommendations. My Department has already taken action to implement recommendations 1 and 2 as priorities. Having spoken to the residents of affected houses, they understand the process and that recommendations 1 and 2 are key to their situation. The others apply more to the future but are not the main issues for the residents currently affected. We had to prioritise recommendations 1 and 2, so that is what we are doing.</p>
            <p eId="para_38"> With regard to recommendation 1, the testing and categorisation protocol, the National Standards Authority of Ireland, NSAI, technical committee, established to scope and fast-track the development of a standardised protocol, held its inaugural meeting on 11 September 2017 and has scheduled several further meetings for the coming weeks. I am pleased to hear its work is progressing well.</p>
            <p eId="para_39"> With regard to recommendation 2, competent professional oversight, my Department has been in contact with Engineers Ireland about the establishment of a register of competent engineers for home owners' or affected parties’ reference. Engineers Ireland provided assurance that it will collaborate with the Department, the NSAI and others on measures to establish such a register.</p>
            <p eId="para_40"> On 19 July 2017, I visited Donegal and met key stakeholders. Many public representatives from all parties attended that meeting. I met affected home owners and members of groups working with them and other interested parties. We discussed the publication of the report and its recommendations. I explained the importance for me as a Minister of State in this area of the priority in implementing recommendations 1 and 2. Regardless of how these solutions will be funded or who will step up, and I referred from the start to the many stakeholders involved in this, we must establish the protocols to do this properly. That is the number one issue. The residents understood that, as did the local councillors. We are doing this as quickly as possible. I also visited Mayo some weeks later and had similar discussions with stakeholders there and urged all the various groups to come forward with their plans in order that we can identify the numbers.</p>
            <p eId="para_41"> I fully appreciate and understand the urgency of this matter. I understand that some people have suffered a lot in recent years and that they want solutions, but I want to be clear that as a Department, we are on this matter. We are implementing recommendations 1 and 2 and will then consider how best we can drive this on and solve the matter. The first thing is to identify the technical solutions and the process. I cannot emphasise this enough. I will not jeopardise this by making a commitment that they will be finished in a week when it will take a few months but the expert panel is there from the NSAI and there are good people with experience on this matter dealing with it. I am happy we will move this on quite soon.</p>

As the Minister of State knows, I and Senator Mac Lochlainn have been working on this matter for several years. However, it is not about us. It is about the home owners.</p>
            <p eId="para_44"> Did the Minister of State ask the Minister for Finance for a line in the budget to provide for these homes? I fully understand that the Minister of State cannot yet quantify the amount that may be necessary, but while he says the home owners understand the delays, they do not. What they do understand is that if the Minister of State has requested a line in the budget to provide for the homes affected by pyrite, they do not expect him to have a whole figure. That said, they want a gesture of an amount that would show his and the Government's solid intention to address this in an equitable way, as it was the case for the eastern side of the country.</p>

            <p eId="para_46"> I disagree with the Senator that people do not understand. The home owners I met who are affected by this understand that I have to go through a process. I explained to them that if I do not follow the process indicated in the recommendations, it could jeopardise any funding to resolve the matter. There has to be a logical way to address this with technical solutions, and then the money can be put behind it. I will repeat what I said. There are many stakeholders involved in the process. There were defective materials and the matter needs to be addressed. My job is to ensure we find a solution for the residents. That is my commitment and I will continue to work towards it.</p>

            <p eId="para_60">No, we will take two minutes each or as near we can. I welcome the Minister of State to the House. On behalf of the Fianna Fáil Senators and councillors, it is with a heavy heart we meet. There was a time that when Ministers gave a commitment, it meant something. Unfortunately, the Minister of State presides over what is now the Department of broken promises. During the Fine Gael leadership campaign, the then Minister for Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government, Deputy Simon Coveney, sat where the Minister of State sits now and promised councillors €5,000 in expenses annually and a pay increase of €1,000 starting on 1 July. He was adamant about it at the time. We were told it was written into legislation. The Minister of State will be aware this has not happened.</p>
            <p eId="para_61"> I appreciate that the Minister of State has only got his feet under the desk and we wish him the best in his role. I am aware of his previous work and I know he is a hard worker and comes with that reputation. I have great hopes. I implore him to give me a date for when the pay increase will start. That is the simple question he is here to answer today. When will the expenses kick in and will there be back pay to the date from which the increases were promised?</p>
            <p eId="para_62"> We are haemorrhaging talent from councils. In the Minister of State's electoral area, a Fianna Fáil councillor was replaced in recent days. In my own county of Westmeath, there was a Fianna Fáil co-option in the previous week.</p>
            <p eId="para_63">The week before that there was a Fianna Fáil co-option in Offaly. Those are only three of which I am aware. I am sure it has happened in other parties too. I implore the Minister of State to take a stand on this issue in his new Department. I ask that he would hold his head high when he leaves office and say he did the right thing by councillors.</p>

            <p eId="para_64">I, too, welcome the Minister of State to the Chamber. It is disappointing in many ways that we are back here discussing this same issue despite the promise that was made about its resolution, as my colleague, Senator Davitt, outlined. I am sure the Minister of State will agree we are fortunate to have so many hard-working local authority members throughout the country. The problem is due to changes made by Mr. Phil Hogan when he was a Minister. The workload of county councillors and the geographic area which they have to cover is now, despite their best efforts, nearly impossible. In my constituency of Cavan and Monaghan, in the past 18 months to two years we have had a turnover of three or four councillors. All of them cite the same reason, which is that they simply cannot do the work of a local authority member properly and hold down a job at the same time. I am sure this does not come as a foreign language to the Minister of State. I am sure he has the finger on the pulse himself and that he knows what I am saying is correct.</p>
            <p eId="para_65"> We are less than 18 months away from the next local elections. I believe I speak on behalf of all local authority members and Senators when I plead that the issues alluded to by my colleague, Senator Davitt, should be grappled with once and for all. Otherwise we will continue to lose good people. As a former local authority member, I am convinced there is no element of democracy closer to the public than the county councillor. Unless we do something to address the issue, we will lose more people. I spoke to many county councillors who are seriously considering their position because they cannot afford to do the work and travel to regional and local meetings while holding down a job at the same time. I therefore request earnestly that the Minister of State grasp the issue and address it once and for all.</p>

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government (Deputy John Paul Phelan)<recordedTime time="2017-09-27T11:00:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_66">This is a good opportunity to outline the current position with regard to councillors' pay and conditions. I thank Senators Davitt and Gallagher for raising it. I think Senator Davitt was a little melodramatic in calling the Department the Department of broken promises. A commitment was given and it is still intended that it would be honoured. There was a time not that long ago when the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government, as it is now called, would be able to make the decision itself, but now it requires joint approval with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform. That is where the issue rests at the moment. In terms of dates and times, it is my intention that it would be finalised before Hallowe'en and that it will be backdated to when it was originally due to be implemented.</p>
            <p eId="para_67"> The Senators are correct in terms of councillors leaving office. I have come across it myself. It is occurring much more regularly in recent years. The major contributor is the workload involved while trying to continue with a full-time job or rearing a family. These are huge issues. I recently met Women for Election with a view to looking at some of the examples that were mentioned, and I also met some councillors in my constituency. Senator Davitt mentioned the retirement of Councillor Anne Ahern in Carlow, who received a significant promotion. I am not sure she would have been able to continue anyway. However, I acknowledge her work in Carlow County Council over many years. She was a very effective councillor.</p>
            <p eId="para_68"> Senator Gallagher raised the anomaly between city councillors and county councillors. It is proposed that the city councillors will get the same increase as county councillors.</p>
            <p eId="para_69"> Effective local government structures are an essential part of our democracy. I was a child councillor myself 20 years ago. In turn, effective local government cannot be achieved without the hard work and commitment of elected members in service of their communities. A range of financial supports are in place to assist councillors in their work. These include the representational payment, fixed annual expenses, a travel and subsistence allowance, a mobile phone allowance, a retirement gratuity and conference and training provision. A Programme for a Partnership Government includes a commitment to review the supports provided to councillors in consultation with representative bodies. The former Minister, Deputy Simon Coveney, met representatives of the Association of Irish Local Government, AILG, and the Local Authority Members Association to discuss the view of their members that positive consideration should be given to improving the range of supports available.</p>
            <p eId="para_70"> In January this year, taking account of the considerable additional workload councillors have experienced since 2014 and the reforms of local government, the former Minister announced two important changes to support councillors in their role as public representatives. First, a new allowance of €1,000 per annum is to be introduced in recognition of the work councillors undertake in carrying out their reserved functions at municipal district level, and second, a new vouched annual expenses allowance of up to a maximum of €5,000 is to be introduced, which councillors may choose to opt for in place of the existing unvouched rate of approximately €2,500. It is proposed that the allowable expenditure categories and documentation requirements of this new vouched system would be aligned, as appropriate, with the arrangements in place for Oireachtas Members. While it was intended that these new measures would be implemented with effect from 1 July, the Association of Irish Local Government requested that further consideration be given to the terms and conditions that would apply. I subsequently met a delegation from the AILG shortly after I assumed office myself to understand its views on the matter. A particular concern raised, which I acknowledged, was to ensure appropriate recognition of the workload of all councillors at sub-county level throughout the country.</p>
            <p eId="para_71"> As Senators will appreciate, the introduction of measures of this kind requires the amendment of regulations made under section 142 of the Local Government Act 2001, which requires the consent of the Minister for Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform. Draft amending regulations have been prepared and are under consideration between the two Departments. While the matter is taking longer than intended, it is important that the measures are implemented from the outset in a manner that is fair to all councillors.</p>
            <p eId="para_72"> I thank the Senators for raising this matter and ask for their continued patience while procedural matters associated with the measures outlined are finalised. I reiterate the intention that this will be resolved before Hallowe'en.</p>

He has given us a timeframe, which we did not have before now. We were in the dark. I know the Minister of State met representatives from the AILG and that they found the meeting quite productive. We welcome the commitment to introduce it by Hallowe'en. It would be great if it happened. We certainly would welcome it. We are delighted to hear about the backpay as well and that expenses will be examined. Will the anomaly between county councillors and city councillors be sorted out in the same timeframe?</p>

            <p eId="para_83">I thank the Minister of State for attending to deal with this matter. I have raised this issue with regard to junior doctors consistently over the past four to five years.</p>
            <p eId="para_84">In 2012, I conducted a survey of people doing their final medical examinations in Irish universities. It indicated that more than 60% of them did not intend to work in Ireland once they had finished their internship. A survey published in recent days indicates this number may very well have increased to 80%. While we have had various reports going back to 2003, including the MacCraith report and the second MacCraith report, which dealt with training for junior doctors, we do not seem to be making any progress.</p>
            <p eId="para_85"> I had to leave a meeting of the health committee with the Minister, Deputy Harris, to come here. The committee received a report on training and development in the HSE for the first six months of 2017, which showed we are underspending by approximately 36% on training and development. This concerns me because we want to retain junior doctors and we do not seem to be proactive in dealing with this. I made the point at the committee that the HSE has recruited more than 2,000 administrative and managerial staff in two years. We now have 17,000 managers and administrators in the HSE but, at the same time, we seem to have done nothing for the people working at the coal face, namely, junior doctors. We have a major problem with smaller hospitals, which are finding it extremely difficult to recruit senior house officers, registrars and senior registrars, particularly in places such as Letterkenny, Sligo, Castlebar, Clonmel, Waterford, Tralee and even Limerick. We need to address this issue, and it is for this reason I have tabled this question. We need major reform in how we provide for this category of personnel in the HSE at front-line level.</p>

            <p eId="para_86">I thank the Senator who has been very consistent, dedicated and committed to this cause. I commend this and I thank him for raising this important issue. As a country, we invest considerable resources in training our non-consultant hospital doctors, NCHDs. As recently as Tuesday this week, a report published by the RCSI highlighted that more than 80% of trainee doctors have said that working conditions, training opportunities, and work-life balance are factors that would influence their decision to leave Ireland. Last Saturday, the Minister, Deputy Harris, attended for the second time the annual medical careers day, where he was struck by the enthusiasm of the students. It is vital that we continue to foster a positive attitude and support these medical students during their time in training.</p>
            <p eId="para_87"> National Doctors Training and Planning, NDTP, in the HSE funds postgraduate training for trainees through service level agreements with each individual training body for the various specialties. It also provides financial supports to NCHDs through two separate funding schemes for the costs involved in undertaking exams and courses. The first of these is the clinical course and exam refund scheme. NDTP provides funding of €450 for mandatory courses or exams undertaken in Ireland and €650 towards exams taken outside of Ireland. It is recognised though that sometimes the costs of courses or exams will exceed this amount. The second scheme is the higher specialist fund. This fund is available to higher specialist trainees, including GP registrars. In total there are approximately 1,500 of these trainees. Trainees are entitled to €500 per year of higher specialist training. This equates to €2,500 for those on a five year training programme. The total number of trainees is now more than 3,700 and this number has grown in recent years. In addition, the number of NCHDs who do not occupy training posts is growing. The total number of NCHDs has increased by more than 1,000, to approximately 6,000 in the past three years. While this increase is welcome, it must be recognised that the budget available to NDTP has to cover more trainees than previously.</p>
            <p eId="para_88"> The strategic review of medical training and career structure working group, chaired by Professor Brian MacCraith, published three reports in 2013 and 2014, and made 25 recommendations. The need to support NCHD training was highlighted by the group. I will mention some particular successes already achieved in implementing the MacCraith group’s recommendations, including the appointment of lead NCHDs. This role involves representing all NCHDs in their dealings with clinical directorates and hospital management. There is also the improvement of the work-life situation of NCHDs. The HSE has agreed to double the number of family-friendly training places over a three-year period, and the recruitment of additional NCHDs has meant significant reductions in working hours. The Department remains committed to the full implementation of the recommendations of the group. This includes recommendations relating directly to NCHD training needs and assisting in the recruitment and retention of key medical staff. On this basis, it was agreed earlier this year that management and the Irish Medical Organisation would undertake a review of the continuing education requirements of NCHDs. This review is due to commence in the near future and will be undertaken under the auspices of the Workplace Relations Commission. It is important that we continue to improve the working conditions of NCHDs and support their training needs to the maximum extent possible.</p>

            <p eId="para_89">I thank the Minister of State. I fully accept a serious effort has been made with the MacCraith report, but I am very concerned that while the report set out a huge number of recommendations, it is not clarified how many of the 25 recommendations have been implemented. Perhaps we could get answers to this. I thought the MacCraith report would resolve many of the issues, but we are not resolving them and, in fact, we are going backwards. I am extremely concerned.</p>
            <p eId="para_90"> Another issue which has arisen to cause further problems is the number of doctors coming from abroad is not as plentiful as what it used to be because Ireland is no longer seen as an attractive training location for junior doctors from abroad. They have other choices such as Australia, Canada and New Zealand and we are not competing for them. We have a major challenge. If we want to reduce hospital waiting lists we need to have enough people at the front line to be able to do so. We have a problem with junior doctors, and because we have a problem with them we now also have a problem with recruiting consultants. This is something that needs to be given priority by the Department.</p>

          <p eId="para_93">I refer to cancer services. Cancer Week 2017 runs from 25 September until 1 October. Since 1996, when the first cancer strategy was launched, Ireland has prided itself on providing a world-class cancer service which adheres to international guidelines and best practice. However, we are hearing reports of a deterioration in the service, with delays in the commencement of chemotherapy programmes, at a time when we know that time is of the essence for oncology patients. I have also learned of shortages of radiographers in St. James's Hospital which are resulting in surveillance scans such as MRI or PET scans to monitor the progression of cancer patients not being performed. The scans were previously conducted on cancer patients on a quarterly basis to determine whether their treatment was working and whether they should continue with their chemotherapy programmes. As such programmes are very tough on the body, this situation is both infuriating and stressful for families. Many of the issues arise from staff shortages in the public sector, a matter I have raised in the House previously. There are staff shortages in the armed forces, mental health services and so on. The Public Sector Pay Commission recommended that an expert be appointed to address the shortages, but, to date, no one has been put in place and no solutions have been offered to the problem of staff shortages in the public sector. Will the Leader ask the Minister of Health why this has not happened and to clarify whether targets for cancer patients are being met.</p>
          <p eId="para_94"> Another issue which comes up time and again is the unfair income thresholds for receipt of the fuel allowance. Many constituents presented at my office during the summer who were above the threshold by as little as €1 or €2. Some suffer from health issues such as COPD or emphysema. The home of one man is not insulated. He suffers from COPD and can barely breathe during the winter because of the cold. As he is above the income threshold by €6, he is not entitled to receive the fuel allowance or any of the ancillary benefits that accrue to those in receipt of it, including the opportunity in some areas to have one's home insulated. The weather is turning and, given increases in the price of fuel and electricity, I ask the Minister for Finance to consider increasing the threshold for receipt of the fuel allowance or inserting into the legislation a special stipulation in order that the Department can exercise discretion in certain circumstances.</p>

          <p eId="para_95">I do not have a specific request for the Leader, but I wish to refer to a very important news item. Ireland has been named as the country with the most secure food in the world. This was announced yesterday at the launch of the sixth annual global food security index and is a remarkable achievement. The news was published in the newspapers yesterday and again today. The index measures improvements in food affordability, availability, quality and safety. Ireland finished with a score of 79 out of 100, just ahead of Austria which had a score of 77. The United States of America which had previously topped the list finished fourth. France and Germany came third and fifth, respectively. This remarkable story must be acknowledged. The detailed reports contain a very interesting analysis and emphasise that Government support for agricultural research weighed heavily in Ireland's favour. In that context, I refer to Bord Bia's food strategy, Making a World of Difference. Bord Bia does great work and its strategy is outlined in a booklet which was published in 2016. I am delighted to say it is also included in the programme for Government. A lot of emphasis is placed in Origin Green on food security and organic production in the meat sector, as well as the vegetable and horticulture sectors. We must acknowledge and celebrate this great achievement, particularly in the context of Brexit, as well as the great opportunities it presents on the island of Ireland, North and South. We must harness the opportunities for major expansion in organic production in the Republic of Ireland and across the island. I ask the Leader to pass on the good wishes of the House to the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine and those involved in rolling out the strategy, particularly in Bord Bia. They are on the right track. It constitutes international validation of what they are doing and should be acknowledged. I say, "Well done," to all involved.</p>

          <p eId="para_96">I have just come from the launch of part of Sinn Féin's pre-budget submission on tackling the health crisis which lays particular emphasis on the need to invest in home help and home care packages. The inhumane cuts to the numbers of home help hours and home care packages initiated by Fianna Fáil and continued by Fine Gael have left the service in crisis which is not just manifest in rural Ireland but also in urban Ireland. The nonsensical Fianna Fáil policy of allocating just 30 or 45 minutes to households and elderly vulnerable persons and the drive towards privatisation mean that there are swathes of rural Ireland without a service. In some cases, home help packages are being allocated, but the necessary personnel are not available to provide the service because it has been privatised. This is an essential service, as acknowledged in many Government policy documents. Home care packages need to be delivered in the home and the community. In the forthcoming budget Sinn Féin proposes an increase in the number of home help hours by 20%, which would result in an additional 2.1 million home help hours being made available. We are keenly aware that families have a variety of needs and that the provision of home care packages is essential. In that context, we propose an increase in the number of home care packages by 15%, or 2,485.</p>
          <p eId="para_97">These measures would constitute an investment of €72.65 million in older people and would go some way toward delivering for them and their families and ensuring they can live with the dignity and respect they have earned and deserve. Not only are the measures the fair and decent thing to do, they also make sense financially as well as having the knock-on effect of alleviating pressure on acute hospital services through beds being freed up and thus the reduction of the trolley and waiting list crises. Older people deserve such measures and Sinn Féin is on their side and is making it a priority for budget 2018. I would like the Minister to come to the House to deal with some of the issues in relation to home care, home care packages, these not being a Government priority and there not being the personnel in many parishes in rural Ireland to deliver services to ensure elderly and vulnerable persons have the choice of living in their own homes. It makes social and economic sense to deal with these issues.</p>

          <p eId="para_98">It is a pleasure to be back in the House after a busy and productive recess. I add my voice to those of fellow Senators on the transformation of the Chamber. I say well done to all involved and I thank the National Museum for hosting us. However, I echo another sentiment aired yesterday by Senators Alice-Mary Higgins and McDowell. This day next week will be the fourth anniversary of the referendum on the abolition of the Seanad. My party and I opposed that abolition and the referendum was defeated by Irish citizens who looked to the Government to provide meaningful reform of this institution, whether it wished to do so or not. Since then, a Seanad reform Bill was introduced and passed Second Stage almost immediately, followed by a Government commitment to convene a committee on Seanad reform. Nothing has since been done. In spite of numerous calls for it to meet, the committee has not been convened, the Seanad Reform Bill has not been advanced to the next Stage and-----</p>

          <p eId="para_101">-----there is continued resentment of the Seanad's lack of democratic input. The old Seanad Chamber might be undergoing renewal but there is absolutely no sign of a similar renewal for this institution. Senator McDowell's Seanad reform Bill which I was proud to co-sign would invigorate future Seanaid by giving them the democratic mandate and expertise the institution was always meant to embody. It would guarantee one person, one vote for the election of the majority of Senators and thus end the injustice of some people having as many as seven votes while the majority have none. It would ensure the Chamber would be made up of real experts in their fields and provide a clear line of difference between this House and the Lower House and would give representation to the thousands of Irish abroad who are denied representation in either their new or original homes, in contravention of international democratic norms.</p>
          <p eId="para_102"> I ask the Leader for clarification on several points regarding this issue. When will the Government convene the committee on Seanad reform? What will its remit be? What will be the timeline for its work? How will it be resourced? Who will be the Chair of the committee? Will the Government agree to engage with the committee in the spirit of reform and constructive engagement engendered by the result of the referendum four years ago? Will the Government specifically focus on the Seanad reform Bill that remains on the Order Paper or a wider remit? Is it the Government's intention to slow the process yet again and wait it out until the next election and the convening of yet another report to tell us what we already know? I ask the Leader to indicate which Minister is responsible for the Bill and if that Minister will come before this House as soon as possible to tell Senators of the process?</p>

          <p eId="para_103">I rise to raise a very sensitive issue and one which all Members should be in a position to support, which is cardiac care in Ireland and how children are dealt with. I request that we facilitate a debate in the House on this issue. I had a discussion with the parent of a child who passed away last February. The boy's name was Gavin Coyne and his mother's name is Maria. Gavin suffered from a condition known as dilated cardiomyopathy. His mother has concerns about his treatment in Crumlin children's hospital and in the Mater hospital and also the treatment of her family when they relocated to Newcastle for further treatment. She is not asking for anything for her family now as nothing can be done for Gavin, he having passed away at ten years of age. He leaves behind a grieving family, classmates and friends. However, his mother has questions in relation to how the entirety of care for children with such illnesses is handled in Ireland. I ask the Leader to facilitate a debate in the House on cardiac care for children. I ask that the Minister for Health, Deputy Harris, come to the House to speak not just to this issue and case but the general issue of the service that is available for such children. I will write to ask the Minister to meet with the family but in the House it is more appropriate to address the general issue. A young child has died and possibly unnecessarily so. This case leads me to believe that further investigation is needed into how we care for children who suffer from these serious ailments and I make that request of the Leader.</p>

          <p eId="para_104">A very important issue for Cork currently is that of local government structures. An ongoing debate has been taking place in Cork city and county in recent years if not decades regarding whether there will be an extension to the boundary. The issue has rumbled on over the past four or five years and there have been three or four reports expressing different views. There have been many columns on the issue in newspapers over the past few months. It has been very unhelpful to Cork and its development. The issue needs to be sorted out and a conclusion reached one way or another because, unfortunately, the continuous debate and commentary on whether there should be one local authority, whether it should be a large city or what is to happen to the region of Cork has taken away from its development. We need to move forward and have clarity. The Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government, Deputy Murphy, needs to move swiftly to ensure that whatever decision he makes is made in the next few weeks. We cannot have another situation where councils write letters and send section 29s to each other or that mayors continue to have public spats. It is not good for the region, the local authorities or the image of local government in Cork.</p>
          <p eId="para_105"> I hope that the Minister or the Minister of State, Deputy Phelan, can come to the Chamber as soon as possible to bring the needed clarity to the issue. A decision is needed. We do not want more debate or reports. We want the Minister to come forward with a conclusion so that we can move forward because at this stage it is stalemate in Cork. The region is not developing because all we are really doing is tearing each other apart and the knock-on effect is that the communities we serve are not being served because it is a power game at the moment. That is not good for the locality. I suggest to the Leader that the Minister come to the House to bring clarity to this issue. It is the biggest issue in Cork at the moment and needs to be sorted out once and for all for the second city and its region.</p>

          <p eId="para_109">I regret that I was not here yesterday. I was a member of the British-Irish Parliamentary Assembly committee on Brexit, led by Andrew Rosindell, MP, joint chair of the British-Irish Parliamentary Assembly and also chair of that committee. We spent a number of days in Brussels. We are preparing a report for the October session of the British-Irish Parliamentary Assembly, which is being held in Liverpool. We have representatives of the Dáil, Seanad, the House of Commons, the House of Lords, the Scottish Parliament, Welsh Assembly and the Northern Ireland Assembly. We were there to try to ensure the best arrangement we could to influence negotiations between the European Union and UK.</p>
          <p eId="para_110"> One thing is missing. We have no democratically elected Executive in Northern Ireland. It is vital that the Executive is formed to represent the people of Northern Ireland in Brexit negotiations. I appeal to the Democratic Unionist Party and Sinn Féin. I see the Democratic Unionist Party would prefer to run the show from London. It has a £10 billion fund to distribute and divvy out. That is the way that I see things going. The DUP is also going to have influence on the final negotiated settlement. We discussed whether there is to be a border or customs border of any sort, whether electronic or otherwise. Is it the 500 km Border or is it a border in Larne and Belfast on the Irish Sea? This is the point that comes across clearly at the moment. The European Union is not that helpful. It says that it is not its problem but that it is the UK's problem because it has decided to leave. We in the Republic will be the ones who will experience collateral damage because we are not at the negotiating table. We have no direct representative. We are represented by one of the 27. The point is that Britain is represented by the British Government and the Democratic Unionist Party has a say in that Government. Bear that in mind. I ask the Leader if he will arrange an update on the position and enable discussion of these matters among a very representative Seanad, representing all the parties and Independents, to update people on what is happening in Brussels.</p>

          <p eId="para_111">We should all welcome the decision by Saudi Arabia to allow women to drive. We could see it as a small step for man, perhaps, but a giant leap for womankind. We should not speak too soon, however. I recall the late Libyan dictator, Muammar Gaddafi, when he arrived in Italy some years ago, seeing himself as a self-styled emancipator of women, with an all-female bodyguard. He asked to meet about a thousand Italian women leaders in the world of culture and politics. When he was asked about the ban on women driving in Islamic states, he got polite applause for asking why these women should have to apply to the head of state for the right to drive a car. Then he went and ruined it all by saying that it was a matter for women's husbands or brothers to decide. We will just have to wait and see what happens in Saudi Arabia.</p>
          <p eId="para_112"> A more credible voice for human rights and equality is John Pittock, the former chairman of Deloitte, who has resigned his membership of the audit committee of the Department of Children and Youth Affairs. He has done so because he does not want to be associated with the contradiction of having a Minister for Children and Youth Affairs who is radically in favour of repealing the eighth amendment. He said</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_113">The tiny baby girl or boy needs to be protected by our laws just like every other member of society. Unborn children should not be discriminated against and suffer child abuse but should be given the choice of a happy life. In England and Wales, where they brought in the killing of unborn babies, which was legalised in 1967, supposedly on restricted grounds, we now have a situation where one in every five unborn babies is killed.</p>
          <p eId="para_114"> The eighth amendment protects the lives of pregnant women and allows our doctors to perform all necessary life-saving care. John Pittock said it was a disgrace that the person to whom the Government had bizarrely given responsibility for safeguarding and protecting children should promote the killing of unborn babies.</p>

          <p eId="para_125">I rise briefly today to discuss, once again, another European issue. Every time we talk about Europe at the moment, it relates to Brexit, and rightly so. While the negotiations are ongoing and the British prepare to leave the European Union, Europe itself is preparing to change. We need to discuss it in much greater detail and depth and be aware of it because if we start to take our eye off the ball, we could pay a price in years to come. Last night, the French President, Emmanuel Macron, gave a lengthy two-hour address laying out his vision for the future of Europe in response to the European Commission White Paper. He raised many sensible suggestions but also suggestions that might be in the interests of Europe and of Ireland as a whole, such as tax harmonisation, a European military and a European border force. I call on the Leader to call in the Minister of State, Deputy Helen McEntee, to have a detailed, lengthy debate on the future of Europe in this House.</p>

          <p eId="para_126">On the debate on Brexit, I want to note that the British Labour Party's shadow Secretary of State yesterday endorsed the view that special European status should be given to the North. That is in line with the findings of Oireachtas reports and a vote in the Dáil. I would like our Government to put that proposition much more firmly in future. It is clearly a common sense proposition that is gaining ground. I note that very welcome development from the potential next British Government and potential next Secretary of State in making that declaration yesterday.</p>
          <p eId="para_127"> On Seanad reform, we have a lovely new room for now but we need a lovely new Seanad. We have legislation from the Manning report. Those involved were kind enough to draft the legislation. It does not require a constitutional referendum. It is not all that Sinn Féin would seek but we see it as a massive step forward in winning the hearts and minds of Irish people, including not just those living on this island but also those living abroad. I cannot understand why that legislation is not being progressed by Government. I hope that we will see it advance in this term and made law so the next time Members of the Seanad are being elected, the people will vote for them directly and we will have a truly representative Seanad. Hopefully, we can achieve that.</p>
          <p eId="para_128"> My final comment today is on the issue of flooding in Inishowen. I ask the Leader to note this. My hometown is Buncrana. Two issues there have really devastated and will continue to devastate our community. We have lost our key community amenity, called Swan Park. It was a beautiful riverside walk but it has been destroyed. The estimated cost to restore it is €1 million to €2 million. It will be closed for the foreseeable future. It is a huge loss to my community. Cockhill Celtic is a major junior football club in Donegal. Over 300 people of various ages utilise its various facilities. It has eight teams. Two of its three pitches have been utterly destroyed and cannot be played on. Hundreds of thousands of euro worth of damage has been done. In those two instances, we have not got clarity from Government on the financial relief that is going to be required. I urge the Leader to raise these issues with his colleague, the Minister of State with responsibility for sport, and indeed, the Minister, Deputy Michael Ring. We need clarification from Government that those two key amenities will be restored. I appeal to the Leader to get that clarification.</p>

          <p eId="para_129">I refer to an article about the business of this House that appeared in <i>The Sun </i>newspaper. It is grossly inaccurate and misleading, and it is under the headline "'Special' allowance call. Taxpayer faces €1m bill after David Norris get initial green light for Senators to blitz college graduates with leaflets." It continues in the usual media fashion of fake arithmetic. It says that there is going to be a bill of €1 million after I requested money to cover postage so that we could send newsletters to 161,000 former students.</p>
          <p eId="para_130">With stamps now €1, the newspaper multiplied the number of leaflets by that cost and said that it will cost €300,000 a year and €960,000 for the National University of Ireland. It is absolute total rubbish. It will cost the taxpayer nothing at all. I was making an argument about the allowances we are given, which are now monitored, taxed and have to be vouched and so forth. The major allowance is restricted to hiring public relations firms, expense account lunches and things like that. It is complete nonsense. We used to be able to send out newsletters because we got an allowance, in the beginning, of nearly 3,000 envelopes, which is now down to a couple of hundred a month. It simply cannot accommodate the sending of newsletters. The situation is that I am just seeking that the allowances which are already granted by the Oireachtas, which would not cover a mass newsletter, be allowed to do so. I am just suggesting that the allowances we already have, which the taxpayer has accounted for, should be allowed to be used for that purpose. </p>
          <p eId="para_131"> One other amusing thing it said was that I was elected with an insignificant vote of in the region of 4,700. That is approximately what a Senator receives. One would be damn lucky to get that many first preferences in a Dáil election. Anyway, <i>The Sun</i> is not noted for accuracy, although regrettably it does come up every day.</p>

          <p eId="para_133">I would like to briefly refer to the Valentia Island ferry. This is something which has been there for the last 21 years. Five families are involved in it. As we know it links the Victorian capital of Knightstown with the mainland. It is a five minute crossing. It is very important for tourism in the south west and, indeed, the local economy. In 2016 the ferry handled 250,000 passengers and 100,000 cars. The traffic handled by the 15-car capacity ferry has now reached a stage where more capacity is needed. The demand is huge. This is an old vessel. It is nearly 50 years old. It needs a modern, efficient replacement which will be able to take coaches.</p>
          <p eId="para_134"> Some research has been done on this issue. The new vessel would cost €2.83 million. It was thought it could be financed by a Fáilte Ireland grant but, unfortunately, EU state aid rules would not deem assistance to this ferry allowable. I know the Minister, Deputy Ross, met with the directors some time back. In view of its importance, the directors are prepared to raise €1 million locally to surpass this roadblock. In the overall scheme of things the balance is not huge. As it is such an important proposal for tourism and the south west, I urge the Government and the Minister to bridge the gap, so to speak.</p>

          <p eId="para_137">I would like to raise the issue of the report from the review group set up to examine the issues around granting access to the Workplace Relations Commission and the Labour Court to representative bodies of members of An Garda Síochána - both the Garda Representative Association, GRA, and the Association of Garda Sergeants and Inspectors, AGSI. I echo their calls this morning outlining their disappointment at the fact that they will be excluded from both bodies, which is a very retrograde step. We saw what happened last year when we were held almost at gunpoint, one could say, when gardaí threatened industrial action. All of a sudden, all the industrial relations mechanisms available to the State were rolled out in order to address that impasse. We certainly do not want that situation to arise again and it is something that needs to be grasped.</p>
          <p eId="para_138"> If one looks at how members of An Garda Síochána are treated, one would be even more disappointed if one looked to members of the Defence Forces. They were not even granted access to this review group, which is very disappointing and highlights a total lack of respect for members of the Defence Forces and for their representative bodies, the Permanent Defence Force Other Ranks Representative Association, PDFORRA and the Representative Association of Commissioned Officers, RACO. I ask the Leader to invite both Ministers to the House so that they can outline how issues affecting the welfare of members of both organisations, who serve this State so well and who deserve special recognition for the work which they do, are going to be addressed.</p>

          <p eId="para_139">I had to attend a meeting of the Joint Committee on Education and Skills yesterday during the Order of Business, so I would just like to congratulate Birdhill on winning the Tidy Towns competition and Limerick on receiving its first bronze medal. It is a big boost to all the volunteers who are out weekly cleaning the streets and so on.</p>
          <p eId="para_140"> The main issue I want to raise today is the overcrowding at University Hospital Limerick. I know we are having a debate in the afternoon on the mid-term capital review, but I think it is time we called in the Minister for Health because, not only is this issue affecting Limerick, but it is affecting the mid-west region as well. The highest amount of overcrowding is in University Hospital Limerick. The new accident and emergency department only opened in May of 2017 and yet there were 22 people waiting for admission to beds in wards and almost 40 people on trolleys who were treated in the new accident and emergency department. There are so many people dependent on this hospital. It is time that the beds which are so necessary to expand services for the region be put in place as a matter of urgency, both in University Hospital Limerick and in St. John's Hospital, Limerick.</p>

          <p eId="para_141">I echo the inquiries made of the Leader by Senators Grace O'Sullivan and Padraig Mac Lochlainn in respect of the Seanad reform process. We need some clarity on this issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_142"> The main thing I want to say is that I echo what Senator Neale Richmond had to say about the need for this House to have a really good debate on Ireland's approach to the future of Europe. When one looks at Emmanuel Macron and his words yesterday, most of what he is proposing is deeply hostile to Ireland's interests. It is about time people started saying so in public. There are such-and-such class battleships and such-and-such class destroyers. I refer to him and some other Heads of State as Bambi-class politicians. They are photogenic and seem to be cleaner than clean, but they come from nowhere. He is an accident of the French political system. Were it not for the fact that the front runner for the Republicans in France made an absolute mess of his campaign, Emmanuel Macron would never have surfaced. When push came to shove, his views on Europe were a minority view in France. Some 80% of the votes cast in the primaries for the French presidential election were cast for people who radically disagreed with his agenda for Europe - the extreme left candidate and the two other candidates, including Marine Le Pen. </p>
          <p eId="para_143"> It is about time that we stand up to the European federalists who are trying to push Europe down the road to a united states of Europe. Guy Verhofstadt has written a book which says that we need to create a united states of Europe with a single army and a single this and a single that. The great majority of Irish people are wholly opposed to these kinds of proposals. Our Constitution prohibits us from participating, for instance, in European defence. Let us get real for a change. Let us have a real debate in this House, not a Punch and Judy show where those who are totally against Europe and those who are totally for a federalist Europe knock holes in each other, but a debate for the great majority of decent, sensible people who realise that Europe should continue as an intergovernmental partnership of nation states and who realise that is the model we want. Let us have an opportunity for Members on every side of this House to express their views honestly on these issues rather than keeping ourselves, through some process of self-censorship, enthralled to people who have extremist views of a federalist kind.</p>

          <p eId="para_144">I have just come from the Youth Work Changes Lives showcase in the Mansion House where the Minister, Deputy Zappone, addressed the crowd. The Minister concluded her remarks referencing how proud the First Dáil would be of the young people in Ireland today. The youth population is growing and their needs and aspirations are changing. They have expectations in areas such as equality, social justice, the rights of women and on the abortion issue. GCN conducted a poll of 565 young people between the ages of 13 and 24 and 85% of individuals stated they wanted to repeal the eighth amendment, 10% did not know and 5% would vote "No". Some change is inevitable. I wonder, however, if Ireland can move to a place of economic equality that supports our young people to prosper to achieve their full potential. Employment, education, social protection supports, housing and mental health are all issues raised by organisations under the umbrella of the National Youth Council of Ireland today. Their message, in the Mansion House this morning, was invest in our youth population and value their place in society.</p>
          <p eId="para_145"> Eleven thousand young people are long-term unemployed. Mental health waiting lists are up 40% on last summer. The poverty rate among young people is double the overall rate and 800 of those who are homeless are between the ages of 18 and 24. We have to move to a place where young people have housing as of right, and have to respond to that right.</p>
          <p eId="para_146"> In the NYCI pre-budget submission, the total investment requested was €153 million, all aimed at enhancing youth work services, halving long-term youth unemployment, equality for young jobseekers, tackling youth homelessness and greater investment in mental health supports. The youth population will increase by 11.6% by 2025. Investment in young people would not only make a difference now but would generate a social and economic dividend in the coming decade. One million young people will live in this State come 2025.</p>
          <p eId="para_147"> I would encourage all Senators to visit the Mansion House. The atmosphere is electric and young people are there to tell their own stories. I would encourage all Senators to attend.</p>

          <p eId="para_148">I would like the Minister for local government to come to the House. I spoke at length recently about paid parking in towns and villages, out-of-town shopping centres, and giving planning permission for out-of-town shopping centres and filling stations. As far as I can see, it is unfair competition for those who are trying to run their businesses in the centre of towns and it is to the detriment of the centre of towns. As I stated previously, they made the same mistake in England 15 or 20 years ago where it ruined the inner cities of Manchester and London. We are putting shopping centres on the outskirts of big towns and villages and I have no problem with these coming along. I note Aldi and Lidl are planning extensions. I have no problem with them, but we have to think of the traders in the middle of these towns and villages who have customers coming to their shops who have to pay anything from €1 to €2 for the privilege. Then these traders are paying high rates. I have a simple way of solving this problem. If the local authority gives planning permission for out-of-town shopping centres or out-of-town filling stations, they should scrap the parking charges - it is unfair competition - and let the multiple that is coming in subsidise the paid parking in the middle of the town. That is the way they do it in England. We need a debate on this issue or we will close down rural Ireland and the centre of small towns and villages.</p>

          <p eId="para_151">I support Senators Richmond and McDowell in their call for a debate soon on the future of Europe and our part in that future. I say to Senator McDowell one need not go to mainland Europe to come across Bambi-class leaders. We ourselves have one of them in this country where the colour of his socks seems more important to him than policies and improving the well-being of the community that he is supposed to be leading.</p>
          <p eId="para_152"> I would welcome a debate on Seanad reform. We have before us a number of proposals, including, at Second Stage, those of Senator McDowell and his colleagues. However, we need to do this in a reasoned manner. Just to put it on record here, every one of us in this Chamber is democratically elected under the Constitution. While we agree there is need for reform, that reform should be meaningful, and if it requires constitutional change then I suggest we should take our time and do it properly.</p>
          <p eId="para_153"> Finally, there is a joint Oireachtas committee established to look at proposals regarding the eighth amendment that came from the Citizens' Assembly. However, I note already, in this House and in the Lower House, conditioning from one side seems to be going on. Let us leave the committee to do its business or let us have a full debate here on the eighth amendment and get all the views of this House.</p>

        <speech by="#JerryButtimer" eId="spk_85">
          <from>Senator Jerry Buttimer<recordedTime time="2017-09-27T12:10:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_154">I thank the 18 Members for their contributions to the Order of Business.</p>
          <p eId="para_155"> I will begin with Senator Ardagh. I join the Senator and all Senators in collectively working to ensure that we reduce the incidence of cancer among citizens, friends and family members. It is important that we work together in the national strategy. Whether it is breast cancer, cervical cancer or colorectal cancer, survival rates are improving. I would ask all Members to look at the national healthcare quality reporting system survey for this year which points to the improvement. There have been significant improvements in cancer screening and treatment services. However, I agree with the Senator that we cannot be complacent. If there are gaps or deficiencies then we must immediately fill those posts.</p>
          <p eId="para_156"> Senator Ardagh makes reference to public service appointments. As the Senator spoke, the Minister of State at the Department of Defence, Deputy Kehoe, was announcing permanent recruitment in the Defence Forces. The previous Government ended the moratorium on employment in the public service. The Government is employing people. We have reopened Templemore. We are hiring more gardaí, doctors, nurses and special assistants. There is a need to do a lot more, obviously, but it is important that we continue.</p>
          <p eId="para_157"> Regarding the fuel allowance, Senator Ardagh makes a good point. I would hope that in the budget in a couple of weeks' time we will see an increase in the fuel allowance. Senator Ardagh is correct that it is a 26-week payment to some of the most vulnerable in society who require to have their houses heated and who want, even in the month of July or August, to have heating on. The Minister, Deputy Regina Doherty, has made changes to the fuel allowance where one can have it paid in two lump sums. There are 410,000 people in receipt of the fuel allowance at a cost of €229 million per year. It is a matter on which we need to see further changes. I am sure the Senator will join me in welcoming the changes made by the Minister in regard to the fuel allowance.</p>
          <p eId="para_158"> Senator Boyhan complimented Bord Bia on its food strategy. The remarks the Senator made show that the country, when it is focused, determined and committed, can do quite well. Ireland had a score of 79 out of 100. Bord Bia deserves to be complimented and praised for its work on global food security. I would be happy to have the Minister, Deputy Creed, come to the House in regard to the matter the Senator raised.</p>
          <p eId="para_159"> Senator Conway-Walsh made reference to the need for more home care packages. The Senator will find agreement from all sides of the House that there must be investment in home care packages, whether it is home help hours or a combination of what the Senator spoke about. All of us in politics recognise the importance of keeping people in their homes in their community and being treated at home, and the Senator will find no opposition from this side of the House in that regard. None of us, certainly on this side of the House, wants to see a privatisation of the service.</p>
          <p eId="para_160">As our spokesperson on social protection, Senator Butler has been very strong in advocating on behalf of us with the Minister. The point Senator Conway-Walsh makes is a valid one and I would be happy to support her in that regard. </p>
          <p eId="para_161"> Senators Grace O'Sullivan, Michael McDowell, Diarmuid Wilson and Pádraig Mac Lochlainn referred to Seanad reform. I discussed it yesterday. There is no ambiguity regarding the Government position. The former Taoiseach set up the implementation group. There has been an acceptance by the Government of the need for Seanad reform. There is a school of thought that, as eminent as Senator McDowell is, his Bill is flawed. </p>

          <p eId="para_163">Senator Mac Lochlainn used the words "kind enough." Well Senator McDowell jumped on the horse. As I said yesterday, his very fine newsletter, which is being circulated to the Members in Dublin Bay South, speaks about what we can do regarding Seanad reform. I am very committed to bringing about Seanad reform. What Members with different viewpoints must recognise is that we live in a democracy and we are democratically elected - regardless of whether Members opposite like it or not. The question of whether we broaden the franchise from the NUI and Trinity College is a matter on which Senator Mullen and Senator McDowell might have different views. Senator Norris has a different view from that held by Senator McDowell but I am happy to have the debate on Seanad reform. I have not blocked Senator McDowell in any way, shape or form. As I said yesterday, the Taoiseach will be in contact with group leaders. He has committed to coming to the House to have a discussion on it and I very much welcome that. I will not be found wanting in that regard. I think Senator McDowell should recognise that this is not about one person's view or one person having an opinion; it is about the country having an opinion.</p>

          <p eId="para_173"> I thank Senator Grace O'Sullivan in her absence, for which she apologised as she had to leave, for her very nice postcard over the summer to all Members of the House. I thought it was a very personal touch and assured us even in a small way the importance of the post office and the stamp. </p>
          <p eId="para_174"> Senator Ó Ríordáin raised the very sensitive and tragic issue of the sad passing of Gavin Coyne and the issue of cardiac care of children. I would be happy to have that debate in the House. I sympathise with the family and I am sure we will all join in the debate so that we can improve the services and situation regarding young children in particular. </p>
          <p eId="para_175"> Senator Lombard raised the issue of the structure of local government in Cork. All of us from Cork recognise the importance of the Mackinnon report. I would be happy to have the Minister come to the House. Where we all find agreement is on the need to have the Mackinnon report acted upon, to reach an agreement on what is best for the city and county of Cork and to progress the structure of local government in a way that is beneficial to the development of Cork city and county. Nobody wants to see an escalation or continuation of the debate. What we need now is pragmatic compromise and discussion in a meaningful, polite and respectful manner whereby we can put aside our individual or personal differences and recognise the importance of Cork for its people and as a region of growth, employment, tourism and business. I hope we can do that in a sensible and very formal way. </p>
          <p eId="para_176"> Senator Leyden raised the very important issue of Brexit and the Northern Ireland Executive. I would be very happy to have that debate. Regarding the Senator's point about the Executive, I certainly hope the DUP and Sinn Féin can agree on going back into government. We have been without an Executive for too long. I very much hope that Deputy Adams's remarks at the weekend where he said that Sinn Féin are open to going back into government were not just rhetoric but were meaningful and that we can get both sides, who have been engaged in talks in the background, to come to the table with a final result because it is important. As Senator Leyden rightly noted, now that we are entering into the critical part of Brexit talks, it is vital that the voice of people in Northern Ireland is heard by democratically elected politicians. I know Senator Conway-Walsh will bring those remarks back. </p>
          <p eId="para_177"> Senator Mullen referred to Saudi Arabia. We all welcome the movement towards equality in all parts of the world and I am glad that the Senator is now very able to articulate the views of women in Saudi Arabia.</p>

          <p eId="para_180"> Senator Mullen raised the resignation of John Pittock from the audit committee of the Department of Children and Youth Affairs. It goes back to Senator Wilson's point. Can we stop introducing red herrings in the debate? Senator Mullen knows that I am on the Joint Committee on the Eighth Amendment of the Constitution, as is he, and he recognises that I am reasonably open-minded and fair and want to see a balanced debate referred to Senator Wilson. There is conditioning on both sides, regardless of whether or not the Senator likes it. Each side is particularly good at whipping up levels of activity and rhetoric. Regarding the resignation of Mr. Pittock, the audit committee has no relationship with the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs. It has no function regarding Government policy or the views of the Minister so if we could-----</p>

          <p eId="para_193">Senators Richmond, Wilson and McDowell also raised the issue of the future of Europe. I would be very happy to have that debate and it is important that we have that debate. I agree wholeheartedly with Senator McDowell in the context of some of the "Johnny come latelies" and the movement towards federalism. The Senator is right. The remarks of President Macron on Monday were very hostile to what we stand for and what we want to see in this country in terms of the EU. I agree with the Senator on a personal level. I very much want to have that debate. I think Senators Wilson and Richmond are right. I would be very happy to invite the Minister of State, Deputy McEntee, to come to the House to discuss that issue separately from the issue of Brexit. It is a debate that we should have in the short term.</p>
          <p eId="para_194"> Senator Mac Lochlainn raised the issue of flooding in Donegal. I again thank the emergency services, the first responders and the local communities in Donegal for their response and their work regarding the desperate plight of many residents in Donegal. Of course, things can be done better, as the Minister of State, Deputy McHugh, said in the Dáil last night, but the Government responded and was very proactive regarding the issue of flooding. I would be very happy to take Senator Mac Lochlainn's comments back but I reiterate that there are schemes available for home owners, community groups and sporting and voluntary organisations. The closing date for applications for funding is 30 September. The point made by the Senator is that irrespective of politics, we need to see how we can respond better in all situations to tragedies.</p>
          <p eId="para_195"> Senator Norris referred to the issue of entitlements, expenses, letters and envelopes. This is an issue for the Houses of the Oireachtas Commission and the Seanad CPP, so I will leave it at that. </p>
          <p eId="para_196"> Senator Coghlan raised the issue of the Valentia Island ferry. He might be best placed to raise it as a Commencement matter but I would be happy to allow for the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport to come to the House.</p>
          <p eId="para_197"> Senator Gallagher raised the issue of the report of the review group on industrial relations structures in An Garda Síochána, which was presented to the Government this week. The Government has considered the report and has approved the drafting of legislation that will, when internal industrial relations mechanisms are in place, give the Garda associations access, by right, to the Workplace Relations Commission and the Labour Court. It will be a priority for the Government. The issue of Garda strikes is a contentious and sensitive one. My personal view is that gardaí should not be allowed to go on strike; they are defenders of the State. I would, however, be happy to have the Minister for Justice and Equality to come to the House to discuss the legislation when it is ready. I commend the working group chaired by Mr. John Murphy, which made a number of recommendations on the future of industrial relations for An Garda Síochána. </p>
          <p eId="para_198"> Senator Maria Byrne congratulated Birdhill on its success in the all-Ireland TidyTowns competition. We all join her in congratulating Birdhill. I congratulate Carrigaline and Douglas on their final results in the competition and I commend all who were involved in it. It is volunteers who go out on many a wet and horrible morning cleaning, planting and tending to local public spaces. I commend them on that.</p>
          <p eId="para_199"> I would be happy to have the Minister for Health, Deputy Harris, come to the House regarding University Hospital Limerick, which has grown exponentially. Senator Maria Byrne has raised this on many occasions here.</p>
          <p eId="para_200"> Senator Warfield asked for a debate on youth and their future role in our country. I would be happy to have that. I commend all those who work with youth groups. Unfortunately, we could not get to the Mansion House this morning to the showcase on youth work. The Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Deputy Katherine Zappone, was in attendance. I commend all who were involved and thank them for their work.</p>
          <p eId="para_201"> Senator Butler raised the very important issue of the growth of shopping centres and white goods stores on the peripheries of towns and urban areas, including Cork city. The Senator has made a very good point in that we need to incentivise people to come into our large towns and cities, such as Cork city. Cork City Council has incentivised parking for the period up to Christmas, whereby we will see free car parking in certain cark parks in the morning and also late at night. There will also be a park-and-ride facility for six weeks. Senator Butler is correct that there needs to be a progressive campaign to attract people back into our large towns, which were the heartbeat and hub of rural Ireland. Unfortunately, in some cases, because of planning, we have allowed shopping centres to emerge on the peripheries. I would be happy to have the debate.</p>
          <p eId="para_202"> I thank the Senators for their contributions. We have many requests for debates and we will endeavour, in the coming weeks, to have them put on the clár.</p>

          <p eId="para_204">I welcome the opportunity to address the Seanad in its new surroundings. Now that Senators are here, possession is nine tenths of the law. In fairness, it is a beautiful room and I compliment whoever organised it during the summer and everybody who worked on it. However long or short it is intended that the Seanad will located be here, I wish Senators the best of luck.</p>
          <p eId="para_205"> Included in A Programme for a Partnership Government is a commitment to increase public capital investment in the remaining period of the capital plan to 2021, to be allocated on the basis of the outcome of a review of the capital plan. In my contribution I will outline the process that has taken place as part of the mid-term review, the main themes and findings the analysis has produced and the next steps in developing a longer-term ten-year national investment plan. I would also like to discuss the efficiency of capital investment in Ireland and how we can ensure value for money will be achieved from the investments made. This is an issue that is all too often forgotten but which is of critical importance in delivering the infrastructure our society and economy so badly needs.</p>
          <p eId="para_206"> The mid-term review of the capital plan was launched in January and conducted over the course of the year. Its objective was to provide a robust evidence base that would guide and inform the decisions made on capital allocations at budget time in October. It will also be an important input to the long-term ten-year national investment plan which will be finalised before the end of the year. It has now been published and provides a detailed evidence base for the allocation of the €4.1 billion of additional funding available in the period to 2021 and subsequently the new ten-year national investment plan in the light of the infrastructural deficits identified through the analysis undertaken in the review.</p>
          <p eId="para_207"> The evidence base for the review includes detailed submissions by Departments and offices, an extensive public consultation process and an infrastructure capacity and demand analysis completed by the Irish Government Economic and Evaluation Service, IGEES, in the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform. It is important to note that in terms of the conduct of the review, it was a matter, in the first instance, for each Department to identify its sectoral priorities and specific projects. Departmental submissions were received by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform earlier this year and these recommendations will play an important role in ensuring the additional funding will be aligned with the relevant sectoral priorities. The review examines a number of key issues relating to public capital investment in Ireland such as the rationale and objectives of public capital investment, the efficiency of public capital investment and steady State funding and the sustainability of increased public capital investment.</p>
          <p eId="para_208"> Based on all of the evidence and analysis, the review of the capital plan identified a number of key sectoral infrastructural priorities, including, in transport, the maintenance and upgrading of the road network, as well as public transport; in education, higher education and the schools building programme; in health, subject to further analysis, the totality of health capacity and infrastructure; and, in housing, on the basis of the review of the action plan for housing and homelessness. The Government will make final decisions on the allocation of the additional capital resources in advance of publication of the Estimates for 2018.</p>
          <p eId="para_209"> Following the allocation of funding for increased capital investment in the 2018 Estimates, a new ten-year national investment plan will be published before the end of the year for the period 2018 to 2027. The key priority for the ten-year plan will be to secure the coherence of long-term and strategic sectoral objectives with the planned new spatial configuration in the national planning framework. Drawing on key strategic sectoral objectives outlined by Departments and in line with international precedents, the longer-term focus of over five years will be largely thematic. The ten-year national investment plan will also include proposals for structural reform of public investment in the planning, selection and delivery of capital projects. It will be informed by the public investment management assessment, PIMA, undertaken by the International Monetary Fund, IMF, in July 2017. An IMF PIMA evaluates the design and effectiveness of the institutions that shape decision-making at the three key stages of the public investment cycle - planning investment, allocating investment to the right sectors and implementing investment. All of this work being carried out by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform will ensure the additional capital resources available will be targeted at the priority public capital infrastructure required to support Ireland’s medium-term growth potential and underpin social cohesion.</p>
          <p eId="para_210"> Based on previous discussions, I expect all those present to agree that increasing capital investment in public infrastructure in the coming years is crucial for Ireland’s future development. It is, therefore, a moot point to a certain extent. However, simply increasing capital expenditure will not, in itself, result in all of the infrastructure deficits being addressed in the short term. Clearly, there are constraints on the economy’s capacity to deliver capital infrastructure in a given year. Increasing the efficiency of public investment will allow us to deliver greater levels of infrastructure. It is critical that we plan and prioritise our investment in a sustainable manner based on robust research and evidence, something that has not always happened in the past. In the period to 2008, capital investment was ramped up to unprecedented levels. Research from the ESRI has called into question the efficiency of the investment in that period and whether value for money was achieved, given the overheating and price inflation in the construction sector. Since that time the Office for Government Procurement has been established, the Government’s economic and evaluation service has been established and the public spending code has been developed. The recent publication of a capital projects tracker on the website of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, alongside the capital review, will also help to bring to the public greater transparency and certainty on the major projects planned for delivery. Furthermore, the Government’s intention to develop a long-term approach to capital investment will provide clarity, confidence and certainty for the construction sector to plan for providing the capacity and capability required to deliver the infrastructure on a value-for-money basis in the coming years.</p>
          <p eId="para_211"> It is very important in examining capital investment that we shift the debate away from an exclusive focus on individual projects. To make better use of the resources available for public capital investment we must support the continued development of a culture of evaluation in which projects will be subject to a full project appraisal consistent with the requirements outlined in the public spending code. This was a key theme in the submission made by the Committee on Budgetary Oversight on the capital review. The mid-term review of the capital plan was a detailed and comprehensive process. It provides us with an evidence base to debate and, I hope, come to some conclusions on what sectors of investment merit prioritisation in allocating the additional funding available.</p>
          <p eId="para_212"> The review of the capital plan also highlights some key themes that will closely inform and be incorporated into the analysis leading to the finalisation of the new ten-year national investment plan. A discussion of these themes may also be beneficial. They include confirmation of the central role of public capital investment in underpinning the economy’s long-term growth potential and addressing overheating risks, as well as supporting social progress; the need to align public capital investment priorities with the changing demographic profile; the critical importance of public capital infrastructure in meeting the essential requirement for balanced regional growth and promoting the societal transformation required to achieve climate action objectives; the mechanisms through which public investment can strengthen the economy’s resilience to major risks such as Brexit; the central importance of robust mechanisms to support the efficiency of public capital investment to ensure the public infrastructure and services delivered through capital expenditure will be secured on a value-for-money basis; and the strong business case for ensuring public capital spending will be balanced between new projects and maintaining the quality and capacity of existing public capital infrastructure.</p>
          <p eId="para_213">As a Government, we are very interested in listening to the perspective of all Senators here today about these critically important issues. I look forward to a constructive session ahead.</p>

          <p eId="para_216">-----as soon as possible. I welcome the opportunity to speak on the mid-term review of the plan. It was announced with much fanfare in 2015 about the period from 2016 to 2021. We are only one year into it. It is probably not really a mid-term review, but a review of the early part of the term. Unfortunately, the announcement in 2015 did not say much. There was much fanfare but unfortunately the substance has not yet been delivered. The Government would like us to believe that it is the saviour of capital investment but, unfortunately, nothing could be further from the truth. The Government has much spin and so on involved, but we need to look at what is happening on the ground.</p>
          <p eId="para_217"> Capital expenditure has suffered extensively from austerity, as we know. It was only last year that capital expenditure exceeded the level of 2000 and 2001. Meanwhile, our secondary and minor road network is at breaking point, our national broadband roll-out is faltering and we have a crippling housing crisis. A whooping €4.5 billion in capital, to be fair, has been allocated to housing, yet very little has happened and very little has been delivered. It is true to say that units do not appear overnight and we all understand that, but we need to address it in a speedier fashion. The Government needs to return to building social and affordable housing as it has over many generations, including in many times in the past when we did not have many resources.</p>
          <p eId="para_218"> There is hardly a debate in this Chamber that does not involve the mention of Brexit. Brexit is certainly a very important consideration in the context of the mid-term capital review. It is one of the most significant geopolitical challenges that we have ever faced. Rural areas, particularly in the Border and midland regions, face very real threats as a result of a potential hard Brexit. While we all wish for there to not be a hard Brexit, it is very hard to reconcile the idea of not being in the customs union and yet wanting to have no border. Everybody says that they want no border, but I think it would be very difficult for us to have no hard border while simultaneously having the UK leave the customs union.</p>
          <p eId="para_219"> It is fair to say that we have had a two-tier recovery in Ireland and that parts of the country have done better in the last number of years than others. It is vital that both the national planning framework and the capital plan reflect this and help to drive development in the regions. As somebody based in Dublin who was a councillor for many years in Dublin but who has four country grandparents, it is not in Dublin's interests for everything to happen in Dublin. It adds to further congestion and pressure on prices of housing and services generally, including schools, green areas, sports clubs and so on. As many other speakers will allude to better than me, rural areas simultaneously face population decline and it is difficult to maintain services, schools and roads with a falling population.</p>
          <p eId="para_220"> Capital investment since 2008 has been abysmal and it has not met demographic needs or demands. Over the next decades, Ireland’s population is expected to reach unprecedented levels with some predicting a population of over 8 million by 2040. Fianna Fáil believes that the national planning framework and the capital plan should be integrated better to meet the needs of the country. The Government plans to release the national planning framework and the capital review at the same time. We believe that the national planning framework should provide the overarching objectives for the country and the capital plan should feed into those objectives. Further, we believe there should be a national infrastructure commission that would prioritise major capital investment in the context of the objectives outlined in the national planning framework. This would ensure that all aspects of Government policy go in the same direction. Both the national planning framework and the capital plan must have a balanced regional perspective. This means spreading economic development throughout the country. It is fair to give credit today when the M18 is opening and acknowledge that work is being done. We are more than willing to acknowledge the work that is being done when it is being done but we also point out that we need more.</p>
          <p eId="para_221"> In Ireland, we have had a two-tier recovery. It is not good for urban areas and it is very poor for rural areas. Rural areas are crying out for fear of their population and it is important that we try to give those areas a lift and to give them the advantages that they need to compete for investment. Of course, one is not necessarily going to get Google, Facebook or eBay in a small rural town, but we need to try to get more employment opportunities outside the greater Dublin area, as well as ensuring that we strengthen Dublin, which I will address in a moment. Commuting and travel times represent one of the most practical and quantifiable measures under which the greater Dublin area can improve its international offering. To reduce congestion in Dublin, metro north and DART underground need to be advanced and prioritised. A brand new town in Clonburris is proposed. It is going through planning at the moment. It is near Clondalkin. Equally, Cherrywood strategic development zone, SDZ, in my former county council area of Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown is progressing but major infrastructure is needed to accommodate 8,000 homes, with almost 20,000 people living in both areas. They need to be given the quality of life that they deserve for the 21st century town that we are building. It is a great opportunity but we need to ensure that the required capital investment is there. I mentioned before to the Minister that the Minister of State, Deputy O'Donovan, formerly worked with, Deputy Shane Ross, that the Luas green line is fairly full most of the time at Cherrywood already, and that we are going to put 20,000 people at the end of it. When he was last in here, the Minister said that it could be addressed, but there is nothing concrete.</p>
          <p eId="para_222"> Page 63 of the capital plan review addresses the Minister of State's former Department. I am not saying this because of Deputy O'Donovan; it is really in reference to the Minister, Deputy Shane Ross. The part on transport, tourism and sport is full of vague aspirations. There is nothing concrete or solid in it. There is about half a page on page 63 about an overall package of measures, "which focuses on areas that are supported by direct Exchequer investment", but nothing concrete about what we are doing or how. We need to face up to the challenges of congestion, not just with regard to quality of life, but the fact that we need to be able to get people to move around efficiently. The Dublin Chamber of Commerce made a very detailed and comprehensive submission to the mid-term review of the capital investment plan. It is over 18 pages. I am sure the Minister of State has had a chance to study it. It talks about a new approach to capital expenditure and Ireland's long-term needs, both for urban and rural Ireland, the short-term investment priorities and so on. I am sure it will be taken into account in the overall production of the mid-term review, but there is a lot of very good stuff in it and I think we need to make sure that we include many of its points because they are very well made.</p>
          <p eId="para_223"> I saw that Senator Kieran O'Donnell was here earlier and he never misses a change to mention the M20 and the proposal for it. I am sure he will mention it if he is back later. It is very important that we connect our second and third largest cities with a quality road network. Broadband is also a huge issue. It is a much bigger issue for areas outside of Dublin than it is in Dublin. The recent withdrawal of SIRO from the tender process further undermines whatever planning we had for the roll-out of broadband.</p>
          <p eId="para_224"> We should also mention public private partnerships, PPPs. We had Andrew McDowell at the finance committee. He is somebody the Minister of State would be very familiar with. He is the vice-president of the European Investment Bank. He talked about how it had money there, ready to go, but that we had limits on how many PPPs we could have. That is restricting the amount of money available for investment. We need to have more projects. We can look at whether PPPs work. Some work and some did not work so well but the concept should not be thrown out entirely. We must make sure that we have more growth and more ambition. The 10% rule makes it very difficult. Conor O’KeIly of the National Treasury Management Agency, NTMA, indicated that the use of public private partnerships can lock in exceptionally low interest rates for a long period of time. We also need to look at the Juncker plan and the European Investment Bank, as I mentioned. It is available and willing. Its representatives came into our Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, and Taoiseach and said that the funds are there and that we just need to harness them at relatively modest interest rates.</p>
          <p eId="para_225"> We also have Ireland Strategic Investment Fund, ISIF, with over €6 billion in foreign investments. Perhaps we could divest ourselves of some of those foreign investments and redirect that money into our own economy. We could then have further improvements in our infrastructure.</p>
          <p eId="para_226"> There are other issues that we could cover and I am conscious of the time. We need to make sure that the European fiscal rules are adjusted. We should say that productive capital investment is not the same as giving everyone revenue bonuses and so on with regard to current spending. We need to tackle the infrastructure crisis. We need to make sure that we deliver on behalf of all of our citizens and that our country is ready for the population growth we have, for the fact that people are living longer and that our population is growing very significantly. There are difficulties in schools, roads and so on. I welcome the review today. It is timely that we are here. Some progress has been made but we have a lot more to do. We wish the Minister of State the best with it.</p>
          <p eId="para_227">The regions and Dublin need very significant investment in the future.</p>

          <p eId="para_229">I am standing in for my colleague, Senator Paddy Burke, who will be here later. I also recognise the former Senator, Michael Mullins, in the Chamber.</p>
          <p eId="para_230"> The Minister of State has outlined the capital review and the next steps. We are down to kernel of the matter, namely, what our priorities will be for the €4.1 billion additional investment in capital spending which will be available between 2018 and 2021 and what the focus will be for the next ten years under the capital investment plan. It is about priorities. It exists in tandem with the new national planning framework which is still in draft form but we expect will come into existence by the end of the year. </p>
          <p eId="para_231"> I will outline an approach I believe would be helpful to simplify and achieve the Government's objectives outlined by the Minister for Finance in his introductory statement to the mid-term capital review. In his address he referred to balanced regional development and said this mid-term capital review was essential. Thanks to policies pursued by the Government, we are in a totally different economic space. There is the issue of responding to demographic change and why the population is declining in certain areas. Much of the elbow power which the Government has is in its capital expenditure along with other policies such as the Action Plan for Jobs, agencies and so on. The most significant way of shaping the country comes from the capital investment programme.</p>
          <p eId="para_232"> All things are not equal in the country. I agree there has been a two-tier recovery. Looking back to the last national spatial strategy, it had some good objectives and it identified some good things. Among many areas which are quite far behind, it is not the case that they have been left behind or have not experienced the recovery. We have seen a significant drop in unemployment, but these groups did not experience any investment under the national spatial strategy which was at least 15 years ago. They have been coming from behind and this is compounded because some areas which had capital investment in roads, broadband and so on can now rise more easily and are more able to attract private and public investment. </p>
          <p eId="para_233"> As priorities are being considered for 2021, and in ten years' time, these areas which did not experience delivery should be on the top of that list. These are predominantly rural areas. The west and north west is a unique region - I understand there may be areas of Kerry and west Cork whose experience may be similar - where there is no major interurban routes, no high-speed trains and no major ports in the north-north west. It has not had the delivery. </p>
          <p eId="para_234"> The report highlights historical investment. Can we have figures for historical capital investment in the regions, not only under the current and previous Governments but the one before? Based on looking at things on the ground, I am sure there is an anomaly and there has not been balanced regional development. We will not achieve our objectives for rural Ireland, with all the fine plans, such as the action plan for rural Ireland, the regional action plan for jobs, unless at a strategic level we invest in this infrastructure. It is not all equal on the table. There are figures, and I am asking the Minister of State for them. It cannot be like before when one project is cherry-picked and another is not. There is a case to be made and I am asking for the data for previous levels of capital investment. The national primary roads into these areas should be invested in.</p>
          <p eId="para_235"> On the objective of renewing rural Ireland, the current economic model from which we work will continue to work against rural Ireland unless we change it. That is reflected in the national planning framework which has been published. It clearly envisages growth in cities. We recognise that but that is happening everywhere, it is in Ireland, the UK, Europe and around the world. People are drawn to the cities for work. Let us say there are two reasons someone would choose to work in an area, because it is an attractive area and there is work available. Rural Ireland is a fantastic place to live, I live there. There has been massive investment by the Government, including the sports capital grant administered by the Minister of State in his previous role from which we see the finest sports facilities around. We see great community effort and great clean places to live which are aesthetically pleasing. We have schools and empty houses. We have schools that need more pupils or will lose a teacher, yet there is the opposite problem in the cities where they are seriously congested. We must take a holistic look at the problem. The economic model we have where we identify something that is needed in an area is just a short-term response. There is rural decline. Populations have declined in Donegal and Mayo in the last census. It is the young people who have gone to the cities. These people are looking for housing in the cities. They want their children to go to school and cannot get places for them and the list of problems goes on. The challenge is for us to encourage the idea that rural areas are areas to invest in and then there will be more work. </p>
          <p eId="para_236"> The report refers to rates of return economically and socially. This argument that there will not be critical mass is one I often here from Dublin economists, but there will not be critical mass in rural Ireland because people cannot live on fresh air. It is beautiful but one cannot live on that, especially when one is a young person. We all know about the problems of young people being unemployed and it is the same where the Leas-Chathaoirleach is from. The north-north west is in a difficult situation unless something radical is done. I am glad that my fellow county man, Deputy Michael Ring, has been appointed the new Minister for Rural and Community Development and I do not doubt his intention to get something done, but he cannot do it by himself. There has to be fresh thinking. I agree that we need to see research and evidence but I ask the Minister of State to tell us the historical investment in the region. What is the <i>per capita</i> investment compared with that of the tax take of the region. I believe there is proportionately less investment compared with the taxes paid in the north-north west. We need data on this. I have not been able to get data.</p>
          <p eId="para_237"> An organisation that has been identified as being in a position to advise the Government on policy is the Western Development Commission. It is on the ground supporting businesses and doing great work but it does not have the wherewithal to come up with its own data, do economic analysis and give a perspective on economics that is not Dublin-centric. That is what is going on. I ask that it be charged with doing this and feeding in information and data such as how much investment the region is getting compared with tax paid, how much capital investment it has enjoyed, and then we can put all this information into the mix.</p>
          <p eId="para_238">At the moment, we need this sort of arm. As well as having the Minister and our action plan for rural Ireland, we need an overarching input and a change from the mindset which is prevalent and which I have encountered on panel discussions. It is a mindset that says "sure, we haven't got the population in rural Ireland. What are you doing that for?" and then they all come to the cities. Are we really going to change it or is just tourism? I believe there is great potential, including on the IT and life sciences side. I know the Minister will be familiar with them but there needs to be some further measure or what is happening at the moment will continue, which is migration to the cities and an undermining of rural Ireland. </p>

          <p eId="para_245">The Acting Chairman is always trying to be helpful. It is very interesting when a Government colleague stands up and tells the Minister of State straight that what the Government is doing is not working, that what it has done previously has not worked, that rural Ireland is left behind and that this capital review needs to do something drastic and needs a new approach. I certainly agree with that. In fact, I think it needs a new Government to deliver it but that is for another day, hopefully, not before too long.</p>
          <p eId="para_246"> Every single expert who has expressed a view has said that the State is in need of a massive capital investment programme. We are coming from a very low base so the Government should ensure that whatever fiscal space that might exist is not frittered away on tax cuts but put to good long-term use in extra capital spend. Unfortunately, the stated position of those in power is that rather than invest, they think we can spare a good chunk of the fiscal space towards tax cuts.</p>
          <p eId="para_247"> When the Minister was appointed, he received a brief from Department officials which stated clearly with regard to the capital plan:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_248">Many commentators criticised what they saw as an insufficiently ambitious programme. If the economy grows continuously over the next several years, pressure on economic infrastructure will increase and there may be merit in reviewing these plans. The overall housing supply challenge is certain to lead to demands for increased levels of capital and current expenditure investment in social housing. We would support additional resources for housing and housing related infrastructure. </p>
          <p eId="para_249"> The same year, the global competitiveness report ranked inadequate supply of infrastructure as the most problematic factor for doing business in Ireland. That was the challenge put before the Minister and the Government but they have not risen to it. The Minister can spin figures all he likes but the fact remains that this Government is putting tax cuts above the long-term investment the country requires. Its policies are precisely the type of short-term thinking that will lead to another mess. Both the Seanad and the Dáil debate Brexit a lot. The one thing that is completely within our control in order to fend off the challenge of Brexit is to invest - that is the one tool we have - yet it is bottom of the list. Long-term economic visions do not win votes. This is the blunt and short-sighted calculation being made by this Government. </p>
          <p eId="para_250"> The Government's capital investment plan puts capital investment at just 2.16% of GNP for 2018, which is a shockingly low level of capital investment and both reckless and unsustainable. It will also ensure that our capital investment remains one of the lowest in the EU. The Government will spin that this new programme will move us up that list. Well, this is exactly where we need to be anyway; we have a younger demographic profile than many other countries. The lack of ambition in the capital plan programme is a lack of ambition for the country. It is literally putting a cap on how much growth we can achieve.</p>
          <p eId="para_251"> I welcome the review of the capital programme. Sinn Féin's manifesto represented a substantial plan for the coming years. I accept some more money is going to go into capital but we must remember that the interpretation of the fiscal rules allows for smoothing of some capital spend over four years. That is all the more important in a tight year for fiscal space like this one. When the Minister stands before us in October and announces tax cuts, we must recall that every euro in tax cuts he announces amounts to €4 that could be spent next year on our schools, hospitals or roads. That is the Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil choice and it is the wrong one. The fiscal rules are a bad idea and are now, as Sinn Féin said they would, preventing necessary investment in our country. Has the Minister even raised the need for an exemption for Ireland for at least capital spending over the coming years, including the repayment of the €64 billion that was taken to fund the banks? This should be argued for anyway but especially so in light of Brexit. However, how can we argue for that in Brussels when it sees the Government giving out tax cuts when it could be spending four times that amount on investment?</p>
          <p eId="para_252"> The Government plans to spend €70 million on flood defences next year increasing to €100 million by 2021. Is this the type of thing that can wait? The pre-fab replacement scheme could be accelerated so that our children are not taught in rundown schools. I could go on. Regional imbalance must be addressed. In the past number of weeks, we saw the example of the regional hospital in Galway and the department where all procedures had to be cancelled because a roof fell in. Anyone who has visited the regional hospital in Galway knows that staff are doing Trojan work but the infrastructure is falling around them and is not fit for purpose. Again, we see the opportunities relating to Ireland West Airport Knock that are lost without proper investment in the airport. Broadband is another example. We can see the jobs and opportunities for the west of Ireland that are lost. Roads are a further example. I know there was an announcement of more LIS funding for roads at the National Ploughing Championships but when one breaks that down, it breaks down to about two roads for every councillor in a 100-mile radius. The extension of the greenways is another example. Capital investment is needed in all these areas to generate jobs and regenerate our rural economy. The negative consequences of the "start-stop" approach to many infrastructure projects are not the way forward - things being announced, re-announced and re-announced. The people in rural Ireland and Ireland as a whole are fed up waiting for vital infrastructure. It should be provided for under this plan. </p>

          <p eId="para_253">I welcome the Minister of State to the House. I regard this as a very important and critical debate. We have come out of a period of great difficulty where our country was bankrupt and where we were effectively borrowing to keep the lights on. We have now reached a stage where we are returning to full employment. We must get back to what would be the normal levers of Government, one of those being putting capital projects in place. I have a small bit of housekeeping first. In his speech, the Minister of State said that a new ten-year national plan for 2018 to 2027 will be published before the end of the year. Could he indicate when he expects that to happen? Will it be part of the budgetary process to be announced on budget day? Alternatively, will it be a separate announcement?

          <p eId="para_256">All help would be welcomed.</p>
          <p eId="para_257">I looked at the submissions made in the context of the mid-term review and a substantial proportion of them referenced the M20 project. Coming from Limerick, the Minister of State will know just how important that road project is in having an Atlantic corridor which links Cork, through Limerick, with Galway as a counterpoint to Dublin. The new Tuam-Gort bypass is being opened today, which is very welcome. We see it as another link. It should be possible to travel from Cork to Limerick in an hour and also from Limerick to Galway in an hour. Therefore, the journey from Cork to Galway should take no longer than two hours. A substantial part of the planning process was completed by November 2011 and preliminary work by Transport Infrastructure Ireland, TII, is ongoing, which will allow the project to advance. I hope that in the new plan to be announced following the mid-term capital review the M20 project will be a priority. The work could be done on a staged basis. In 2011 the preferred route was via Croom, Charleville, Buttevant and Mallow. The section from Limerick to Mallow is key and should be stage one. The M20 project is critical from the point of view of connectivity. It is also critical from a safety perspective because there are fatalities on the N20 far too regularly. If we are to speak meaningfully about the need for balanced regional development, we cannot do so without the M20 being in place. </p>
          <p eId="para_258"> While the new emergency department in University Hospital Limerick is very welcome, there is a hospital beds capacity issue. When the reconfiguration took place, the emergency departments in Ennis, Nenagh and St. John's hospitals were closed, which meant that 50 beds were taken out of the system. As part of the reconfiguration, a new 138-bed unit was to be built via a public private partnership on the grounds of University Hospital Limerick, but it never came to pass. We have secured funding through the HSE to progress the design phase for a 90-bed acute unit alongside the emergency department. I would like to see that unit progressed under the capital plan. I would also like to see the maternity hospital moved from the existing site to the grounds of University Hospital Limerick. </p>
          <p eId="para_259"> I would like to see the three projects mentioned - the M20, the 90-bed acute unit in University Hospital Limerick and the relocation of the maternity unit to the site of University Hospital Limerick to improve the cohesiveness of the care provided - included in the new national plan. When is it expected that announcements will be made on the new capital plan? Will they form part of the budget day announcements?</p>

          <p eId="para_262"> I welcome the Minister of State. Tá fáilte roimhe. Labhróidh mé i mBéarla cé go bhfuil mé níos compordaí, b'fhéidir, ag labhairt i nGaeilge. </p>
          <p eId="para_263"> First, we must look at where we have come from, as Senator Kieran O'Donnell said. We have come from a situation where a few years ago we had a 14.5% unemployment rate. It now stands at around 6%, which represents a very significant improvement. We are, therefore, very close to full employment. It is said an unemployment rate of around 4% or thereabouts represents full employment. </p>
          <p eId="para_264"> The books are reasonably well balanced again. Therefore, where do we go from here? The economic reports I have read and the economists to whom I listen, although sometimes we should not listen to as many as we do, are urging caution. We, therefore, need to be careful and must be prudent about capital expenditure, to which there are two parts - revenue and capital. During my time as Chairman of the Oireachtas Committee on the Future Funding of Domestic Water Services the big issue was on and off-balance sheet expenditure. I learned an awful lot about the public finances, although I would have known a little about private investment and business. Off-balance sheet expenditure is really important and very significant. If we can create a situation where a lot of our capital expenditure is paid for or supported by off-balance sheet funding, it will support a lot of the capital expenditure about which my colleagues have spoken on hospitals in Galway and the Limerick to Cork and Limerick to Galway roads, projects I strongly support. As capital expenditure is a long-term investment, I urge prudence in that regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_265"> Another important factor to bear in mind is that EU regulations stipulate the degree of flexibility we have in any budget which is based on income. It is a multiple of the revenue the Exchequer receives. I ask the Minister of State to correct me if I am wrong, but I understand the position in 2018 will be pretty tight from a budgetary perspective. Things will loosen again in 2019 because we will be working with a greater revenue cashflow from the Exchequer's perspective. Again, I caution the Government not to spend money we do not have and not to spend money that will be on-balance sheet. We should try to work off-balance sheet to a proper ratio or degree.</p>
          <p eId="para_266"> In the context of the mid-term capital review, I live in Spiddal in Connemara. It can take me an hour and a half to travel about five miles from Spiddal to Galway racecourse, from where I can get to the M50 in the same amount of time. The roads in Galway are absolutely killing the people and the local economy. If we had a good hospital, that would be fine, but we cannot get to it on time. A very good friend of mine from Oranmore died recently of a heart attack. If it had happened at 4 p.m. rather than at 4 a.m., it would have taken an hour and a half to get him to the hospital. Access is absolutely critical. I, therefore, urge the Minister of State to look at providing an outer bypass in Galway and to do whatever he can to get that project moving. It would also support Senator Kieran O'Donnell's very well made point about the western corridor to join Cork, Limerick and Galway and, I hope, places further north such as Ballina and Sligo.</p>

        <speech by="#PaudieCoffey" eId="spk_131">
          <from>Senator Paudie Coffey<recordedTime time="2017-09-27T14:40:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_267">I welcome this timely debate on the national capital expenditure plan. We need to debate the issue in the context of where the country is at and from where it has come in recent years. We must acknowledge that there were serious reductions in capital expenditure and infrastructural investment owing to the state of the economy from 2007 until recently. However, I must give the last Government credit for continuing to invest in schools, in building new schools, continuing the prefab replacement scheme and building school extensions all over the country. We have almost eradicated the use of prefabs, although there is still some work to be done in that regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_268"> In 2015 a new capital plan was announced in which housing was prioritised, an in which I had a role. Over €4 billion was provided for various schemes throughout the country. That sum has been expanded since, with €5.5 billion being provided for housing. It is no good, however, just having the money in place. We need to get building under way. With the restoration of our economic fortunes, the country can once again provide for capital investment. However, as the Minister of State outlined, we need to undertake such investment in a coherent, logistical and transparent way. </p>
          <p eId="para_269"> I was somewhat bemused to hear a Sinn Féin representative criticise the Government when members of that party speak out of both sides of their mouths. In Northern Ireland Sinn Féin will not take responsibility to govern. In most local authorities the party will not take responsibility for voting on a budget, but its members still look for all services.</p>
          <p eId="para_270">Even recently, in the Joint Committee on the Future Funding of Domestic Water Services of which I was a member, where investment is critically needed in water infrastructure, its members did all in their political power to undermine capital investment by the populist stances that they take. That is typical of Sinn Féin.</p>
          <p eId="para_271"> We in government focus on the positive ways in which the economy can provide for the communities into the future and that is why a new national development plan 2040 is due to be announced shortly. It is vital that the capital plan is linked intrinsically and strongly to that new national development plan 2040 because that will outline the vision for economic growth in this country and it is critical that investment is made in tandem with that.</p>
          <p eId="para_272"> At present, Dublin is a vortex of economic activity. It is overheating. However, we have cities around the country that are capable of providing for the economy and driving the regions in which they are. The national spatial strategy was a good strategy at the time but it failed miserably. It failed because cities, such as Waterford, the area that I come from, did not have the capital investment infrastructure that it required and that went with the status that it was given. Now we have a unique opportunity to put that right with the new national development plan and the new capital investment plan.</p>
          <p eId="para_273"> Using the example of the south east and Waterford, where it is envisaged that we want to grow that city to almost double in population terms, it is critical that we invest in essential infrastructure. The north quays in Waterford are similar to a mini-docklands and there is huge potential for the city to grow in that area. There is interest in investing over €300 million of private investment to provide housing, commercial activity, tourism-related activity and a strong retail offering for a city that should be attracting people from around the entire south-east region. This development will require substantial Government investment that can return to the Exchequer solid taxes and income. It will require in the order of €60 million of investment. I have already spoken to the Minister for Finance and Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Donohoe, regarding the critical need for this investment and I am certainly hopeful it will be a strong part of the announcements of the capital plan over the coming months.</p>
          <p eId="para_274"> Other areas that require investment in the region are regional infrastructure such as University Hospital Waterford, which is a level 4 acute hospital. It is getting a new palliative care unit with a five-storey building that will certainly help in regard to beds but there is a strong need for a €3 million investment in a regional emergency cardiac care service to bring it up to a 24-7 service. I will continue to voice that need for my region here in the national Parliament.</p>
          <p eId="para_275"> I am not being parochial here. These are all regional needs I am outlining. If we are going to have a strong country, we must have strong regions. We need a technological university for the south east. I am glad to report that WIT and Carlow IT are now working together. For that to progress, it will require capital investment.</p>
          <p eId="para_276"> Senators spoke about the roads and road safety. That is an area that fell behind considerably during the dark days of the recession. The rural and regional roads need investment. The road between my city and the Minister of State's, the N24 from Limerick to Waterford, is probably the worst national road in the country. I would urge the National Transport Authority and everybody involved in policy making on roads to look at that road with regard to an upgrade. If we must have strong regions and inter-connectivity between the cities, that is one road that needs work.</p>
          <p eId="para_277"> I could go on forever on areas such as broadband and next generation investments in information technology. Climate change will be a significant challenge for this country and we will need investments in renewable energies. All of the regions can contribute positively in that respect and that is why we need a coherent vision for this country with the plans and the infrastructure, and the expenditure, to make it happen.</p>

          <from>Senator Joe O'Reilly<recordedTime time="2017-09-27T14:50:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_278">I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy O'Donovan. It is my first opportunity to congratulate him in public on his appointment as Minister of State. Knowing Deputy O'Donovan, as I do, over a number of years, he brings great ability and energy, and high principle to the office and I wish him well in it.</p>
          <p eId="para_279"> Through a lot of hard work, great effort and great courage on the part of the previous Government and this one, we have come to the point that we can have this discussion, that we can have a balanced budget, that we are significantly reducing national debt and that we are now in position where we have credibility from a borrowing perspective to get attractive interest rates, and that we are now in a position to engage strategically in capital investment. I suppose there are a couple of big objectives that we need to achieve through the capital investment. The Minister of State, as a former teacher like myself, will be familiar with long-term and short-term objectives in teaching plans. The biggest long-term objective we have is to maintain sustainable populations in rural Ireland and maintain a balance, to deal with what Senator Coffey aptly describes as the "vortex" that is Dublin at present and to get a level a decentralisation in terms of population and sustainable communities throughout the country. With that in mind, the commitment to road infrastructure and transport infrastructure is a vital one, both in terms of achieving inward investment in rural Ireland and in terms of its development and quality of life, and attractiveness to live there.</p>
          <p eId="para_280"> In the county that I and the distinguished Acting Chairman, Senator Wilson, come from, we do not have railways. We do not have immediate access to local airports, etc., and we depend on the road infrastructure in a big way. For that reason, the road infrastructure is vital. In that context, I would commend two projects in County Cavan to the Minister of State that are relevant to both Cavan and Monaghan. The first is the east-west link, linking Dundalk to Sligo. That goes through the critical towns of Shercock, Cootehill and Carrickmacross throughout my constituency. That project is so important because we have the large employer, Carton, in Shercock, employing 600 to 800 local people in a place one would not necessarily have food processing where one would not readily attract alternative employment, and Abbott in Cootehill. That east-west link is critical. I commend that project to the Minister of State. It will stand up to any analysis and any objective scrutiny. I would also commend the extension of the M3, with the bypassing of Virginia to Cavan town as a critical piece of infrastructure for that region. I would appeal to the Minister of State to look seriously at those in the context of transport.</p>
          <p eId="para_281"> The Minister of State has a commitment professionally, as I and virtually all of us in the House have, to the regionalisation of education. Indeed, I note the Acting Chairman is highly involved in that project at home too. We are committed to getting the new third level campus, the post-leaving certificate college, to Cavan. It is committed to in the capital plan. In his response, I would like the Minister of State to restate his public commitment to it. It would mean so much to people. It is a vital, long-awaited project up there. That is a necessary exercise, if we have any genuine commitment to regionalisation and to maintaining sustainable communities outside of Dublin.</p>
          <p eId="para_282"> I agree with all the points the Minister of State makes in his address around structural reform, planning, procurement and good value for money. That is prudent and right. What people want with their hard-earned success is that it would not be squandered. Of course, I agree with those and I will not labour them, but the Minister of State would be the first to agree that we need inward investment in rural areas. I cannot go about attracting inward investment to, and we cannot have successful trade mission for, a place such as Cavan until one gets the infrastructure. Crucial to that infrastructure are the roadways, the college and, as referenced by Senator Coffey, broadband. Broadband is most crucial. I accept it is a different debate in the sense it is the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment, Deputy Denis Naughten's, specific responsibility, but it is enormously vital.</p>
          <p eId="para_283"> My colleague, Senator Mulherin, opened with the contention that we have to achieve with this capital plan viable communities around this country, particularly in the disadvantaged areas of the Border region and the mid-west that have suffered hugely. The Border region, in my area, has suffered enormously down the years. We have to right that wrong and correct that imbalance. I appeal to the Minister of State to see that happens. It is a great and exciting opportunity for the Minister of State and for all of us to put something right here, to make it likely that people will want to live in counties such as Cavan and Monaghan and right through the west of Ireland, and that we will get those in the aptly described "vortex" or population centre that is Dublin to choose other centres.</p>
          <p eId="para_284"> Of course, there must be a match between the capital plan and the spatial strategy into the future. I contend that the projects that I have mentioned will so do.</p>

          <p eId="para_285">I welcome the Minister of State. I thank him for his speech that outlined his thoughts and plans.</p>
          <p eId="para_286"> The regions have been spoken about an awful lot and my colleague, Senator Kieran O'Donnell, referred to the M20, which is very important. I shall return to what Senator Coffey said in terms of regional development. I, too, would like to support the M20 and the connection with Waterford. I know the Government has a big commitment to the area outside of Dublin and job creation. A commitment has been given to create over 60% of jobs, etc., outside Dublin. I agree that the Government must focus on and develop the regions. Senator Coffey is right that there is a big connection between the different cities and towns located in the regions. Limerick is very lucky to have Shannon Airport on its doorstep because many companies have located their businesses in the region thus leading to job creation. Education has also been included and highlighted in the Minister of State's report. We must invest in education in the regions in order to assist businesses to grow. I shall refer to the Minister of State's <i>alma mater</i>. Mary Immaculate College has a library facility for 700 students but in actual fact it has close to 5,000 students attending the college. Therefore, students lose out in terms of access to the library and research facilities.</p>
          <p eId="para_287"> Recently I visited the Monaleen national school, which comprises of eight classrooms and 16 prefabs. The school has been in the building programme for a long number of years. There must be investment in local schools and colleges. Such investment is an investment in our future and that leads to job creation in the regions. </p>
          <p eId="para_288"> This morning on the Order of Business I mentioned the overcrowding at University Hospital Limerick. I know that Senator Kieran O'Donnell referred to the matter earlier. I believe that there must be investment in extra beds at both University Hospital Limerick and St. John's Hospital. They are not just hospitals for Limerick city; they are hospitals for the region. University Hospital Limerick has the highest level of overcrowding in the region. The figures have been consistent for quite a while in terms of the highest level in Ireland. For an initiative to work and have a positive effect on the region there must be investment in both hospitals.</p>

          <p eId="para_289">I welcome the Minister of State to the House. I also welcome the opportunity to say a few works on the mid-term review of the capital plan 2016-2021. First, I wish to compliment everybody involved in getting this Chamber to its current state when it was opened yesterday. I can remember well two years ago, as Cathaoirleach of the Seanad, when I visited this room. I can assure Members that it was not in the same state that it is in today. The room looked as if a reception had taken place a number of nights beforehand and quite a number of wine and champagne glasses were strewn around the room. In the far corner was the Sam Maguire Cup. I did not think it would hang around the capital ever since. I compliment everybody, including the Ceann Comhairle, and everybody involved in the project.</p>
          <p eId="para_290"> I shall make a few points about the mid-term review of the capital plan. I am delighted that the Minister of State has given us an overview of where things are at the moment and where we can reach. Every area has a project. Like everybody else, there are quite a number projects in the west and the north west. During the Celtic tiger years the region did not get its fair share of capital spending and, thus, fell very much behind other regions. That fact can be seen quite effectively. The last census shows that a declining population exists in counties Mayo and Donegal. I ask that the Minister of State take a serious look at the population census for 2016. I ask him to take the data into account when allocating funding to projects throughout the country.</p>
          <p eId="para_291"> I shall name a few projects. Ireland West Airport Knock is central to the prosperity of the region as it is an international airport. I ask the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport and the Minister for Finance and the Taoiseach to take a close look at the airport as it needs capital investment and hangarage. The airport is a vital piece of infrastructure for the western and north-western region. People from the region can now commute to London on a weekly basis. In fact, people who work in London during the week can fly home and arrive in the western area quicker than if they travelled by car from Dublin. The airport also allows people to travel to the Algarve, Spain and Germany. The airport is a vital infrastructure that allows people who invest in the region, and to move in and out of the region. The airport is also very important from a tourism point of view as tourists from Germany and various parts of Europe can travel to the region.</p>
          <p eId="para_292"> The N5 and N26 roads were neglected during the Celtic tiger years. I ask that the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport fast forward capital for the N5. All of the planning stages have gone through and the fencing has been completed. The N5 project is ready for completion and ready to go to tender. I ask that the N5 project be placed high on the agenda when deciding terms and projects for the capital plan 2016-2021. There are a number of projects in the western region. In Mayo, in particular, there are the N5, N26 and the Ireland West Airport Knock and I ask that the Minister of State prioritise these projects.</p>

        <speech by="#JerryButtimer" eId="spk_135">
          <from>Senator Jerry Buttimer<recordedTime time="2017-09-27T15:00:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_293">I welcome the Minister of State to the House for this important discussion. I say so not least because, as he said in his speech and rightly so, that we consider the capital plan in the context of individual projects and how best to grow and develop all regions of this country. We must also be mindful that we draw a line beyond the M50 and Red Cow roundabout so that we can ensure that priority is given to the regions, that there is investment and that capital infrastructure takes place.</p>
          <p eId="para_294"> We all have a list of individual projects that we want to see prioritised and completed. As the Minister of State said in his speech, the Government does not have an infinite amount of money to spend on a wish list. He comes from County Limerick so he will recognise that the Cork-Limerick motorway can act as a catalyst for change and investment in the Cork-Limerick region. It is important that we learn from the debacle that was the decentralisation policy by a past Government. We must ensure that we give autonomy to the regions and that we allow for a strategy that will empower the regions to grow.</p>
          <p eId="para_295"> I was very much struck by the joint presentation that we received from Cork County Council and Cork City Council about Cork 2050. The presentation recognised and emphasised what the region needs to reach its full potential. Whether one comes from the north, south, east or west it is critical, in whatever decision is made by Government, that there be a process that allows for the country as a whole to benefit. That is why this debate is important. We can all produce a wish list. I could talk about Cork-Limerick, the M28 and the need for a second hospital in Cork. I could list a whole plethora of projects that are important for the Cork area. What is important is that the allocation of money is done in a way that promotes investment, secure jobs and retains jobs. </p>
          <p eId="para_296">It would ensure that Ireland, which will be the only English-speaking nation left in the European Union, will be open for business, which it is.</p>
          <p eId="para_297"> In a recovering economy the key factors, as mentioned by the Minister of State, are transport, education, health and housing. The kernel of what we must do is recognise the need for investment in capital infrastructure such as the pressing and urgent need for housing and the provision of schools, hospitals and roads and balance that against the services people require in their day-to-day lives such as care for the elderly or disabled and the recruitment of more gardaí, nurses or teachers. We must try to balance those needs. Those in Opposition who come out with grandiose plans must recognise that this must be about how the people and the country can benefit. It is not just about making connections locally and internationally but also ensuring an opportunity for the country. The Government and Fine Gael have always focussed on the country and the people. For the five years during which some Members of the Opposition could not decide to cross the road, the Government took decisions to ensure the country recovered and that we are on the cusp of a funding model that will ensure a benefit. The Government has much interaction with the European Investment Bank in terms of the provision of moneys. It is important that we invest in infrastructure.</p>
          <p eId="para_298"> The situation post-Brexit will be challenging for many parts of the economy. Senator Paddy Burke referenced the issue of air travel. The issue of tourism, for which Minister of State had a very strong and supportive role in his previous Ministry, must be addressed to determine how the regions can counteract Brexit. The southern region has experienced a sharp decline in visitors from the United Kingdom since the Brexit vote although that has been mitigated by direct flights from Cork Airport to Providence which have led to an increase in North American visitors. The balance has to be gotten right for the way forward.</p>
          <p eId="para_299"> The national planning framework, Ireland 2040, is due to be published soon. It explores how we can plan for the future in the context of expanding cities and counties. Cork city and county local governance structures were discussed during the Order of Business. That needs to be gotten right and resolved in order that we ensure that Cork city and county prosper and develop.</p>
          <p eId="para_300"> I thank the Minister of State for his attendance. It is important that we get this right and have investment but it is also about people and being able to attract investment and retain jobs.</p>

        <speech by="#PatrickODonovan" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Public_Expenditure_and_Reform" eId="spk_136">
          <from>Minister of State at the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform (Deputy Patrick O'Donovan)<recordedTime time="2017-09-27T15:10:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_301">I thank the Senators who have attended this important debate. One would have imagined there would be a bigger interest, in particular from some Opposition groups. I am very disappointed by the attendance. I do not know if another event is taking place. I was looking forward to contributions from both sides of the House. The Senators who attended made some interesting contributions, much of which I agree with and much of which I do not. One would imagine there is no more important issue than the preparation and planning for the future development of Ireland, the children yet to be born, the roads yet to be driven and the schools yet to be attended. We cannot live in the past but must try to plan for the future. I thank Senators who turned up and showed an interest in such an important issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_302"> Senator Horkan is correct that a lot of catching up needs to be done. He identified a number of issues and I will not get into the specifics of all those projects as that would not be appropriate because there is a fairly large shopping list from the Seanad. The Senator failed to mention that the State was banjaxed in 2011 and was a borrower of last resort, that the economy had no money and was running on empty and the Government did not know if it would be able to keep the doors of the country open. It needs to be said on the record that the transformation of the Irish economy in a short period of time on the back of the efforts of the Irish people has been enormous. There are commentators who said a second bailout would be needed, that the State would have to go cap in hand to look for it and that all the policies pursued by the Government were wrong.</p>
          <p eId="para_303"> One political party opposed everything the Government did during the previous Dáil just for the sake of it. Its deputy leader said of its leader that anyone could fumble a figure. It was not the first time that Deputy Adams fumbled a figure in the hundreds of millions. I take particular issue with Sinn Féin's record on economic policy and where they were and are <i>vis-à-vis</i> the economic collapse. First, it has absented itself from any decision making on the island of Ireland and, secondly, it has decided to oppose for opposition's sake anything done by either the previous Fianna Fáil or Fine Gael-Labour Governments or the current Fine Gael-Independent minority Government supported by Fianna Fáil. If everything we did was wrong, we would not be in the position four years later of having a balanced budget and being able to talk about fiscal spending space. If we did as Deputy Adams suggested and told the European Union to take its money and go, and one must remember Sinn Féin has opposed every EU treaty since 1973 for the sake of it, where would we be? Where would we now be if we had taken the advice of Sinn Féin in 2011? We would be on a one-way ticket to the stone age and would not have to worry about class sizes, roads or the future development of the hospital network. The country would be akin to a modern-day basket case. Rather than saying everything the Government did was wrong or coming forward, as it did last year, with proposals that would have meant that every single person who avails of a tax credit they pay into a pension would see a cut of €800 in his or her annual take-home pay, it would be nice to see costed proposals from a party that just opposes everything.</p>
          <p eId="para_304"> That is the type of make-it-up-as-you-go along economics of which I am tired. I admire Opposition politicians such as Senators Ó Céidigh and Horkan who make proposals based on circumstances that bear some resemblance to the economic reality of the State. However, that is not the case for a party that continues to have no regard to either the past or the present in relation to where the economy was, where it went or the policies pursued by successive Governments to do what we believed was right and resulted in us being on a trajectory to virtual full employment from an unemployment rate of 16%. We are on the way to a balanced economic budget and do not need to worry about a lender of last resort. We are on the way to being able to look after our citizens as any sovereign government should without going cap in hand to anybody. Where would we be if we followed the alternative? All Members know where we would be.</p>

          <p eId="para_310">I am doing so. Many worthy projects were identified by Senators, some of which are in my own region. The projects include the M29, Limerick Regional Hospital, Ireland West Airport Knock, the Luas cross-city which will soon be opened and the Newlands Cross flyover which was built at a time of economic collapse. All of those things can only be done if there are the building blocks of a sound economy. One cannot have such building blocks if one makes it up as one goes along in some sort of <i>Alice in Wonderland</i>-type fairy tale. He might not be great at the figures. We know he is not great at the figures and he should stay away from them. It is no wonder that a party that can try and suggest that the country can somehow just decide it is going to run around on empty, tell the EU, IMF and the troika to get out, vote against every EU treaty and pretend it is going to be all right on the night does not want to be in government in Northern Ireland, take its seats in Westminster, be in government in this jurisdiction nor be in power in any local authority in the country because that would involve making a decision.</p>
          <p eId="para_311">The first decision Sinn Féin had to make in the Northern Ireland Executive was to send the devolved powers with regard to social welfare back to Westminster because it involved making a tough decision that might make it unpopular. We have done the right thing by this country since 1922 and we will continue to do so. The main Opposition party has, by and large, always done what it believes is right. We might disagree with it politically, as we might with the Labour Party, the Green Party and the Independents who come from a variety of backgrounds, but I will not sit here and listen to this type of thing we must also listen to in the other House, where a Senator can stand up and say it is time we rise to the challenge.

          <p eId="para_346">I move amendment No. 2:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_347">In page 6, after line 37, to insert the following:</p>
          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_348">“ “investigating authority” shall include any body which has the responsibility and/or the statutory power to investigate and/or prosecute a criminal offence;”.</p>
          <p eId="para_349">I wish to be brief so I will not go on at any great length on the Bill noting its current state. I will take Members through the rationale behind the proposal. Article 4 of the victims directive, on the right to information, provides that all victims of crime have a right to certain information on first contact with the competent authority. The competent authority is not defined by the directive but the European Commission justice guidelines give an indication as to who should fall within this definition. The Criminal Justice (Victims of Crime) Bill 2016 only applies to the investigations conducted by the Garda or Garda Síochána Ombudsman Commission. Such a restriction prevents victims from accessing information in any other form of prosecution or investigation. Any statutory authority with the potential power to prosecute a criminal offence would fall under the remit of Article 4 of the directive, on the right to information.</p>
          <p eId="para_350"> There is a significant list of bodies falling within the remit, including but not limited to the Health and Safety Authority, HIQA, Tusla, the Health Service Executive and ComReg. These bodies have the power to investigate and prosecute criminal offences. Victims who are natural persons should be provided with information from these prosecuting authorities in accordance with Article 4 of the directive. Similarly, where a competent authority is investigating or prosecuting an offence, it should be obliged to provide all the necessary information, support and protection that would otherwise be provided by An Garda Síochána if it prosecuted. That is the rationale and I would like to hear the Minister of State's comments. I hope we can have some support for it.</p>

I thank all the non-governmental organisations that have engaged with us, the Minister of State and his officials in the time between Second and Committee Stages. I support what Senator Boyhan said and my amendment No. 3 seeks to do something similar. It is a matter I raised on Second Stage and I am grateful to the Victims' Rights Alliance and others for raising this issue with me and others. We were concerned the Bill did not cover other prosecuting authorities or persons with functions related to the investigation or bringing of the prosecution of an offence conferred by enactments. That would include, for example, the Health and Safety Authority and other bodies. I know the Victims' Rights Alliance shares our view that victims of crime may be victims of offences prosecutable by other entities and agencies. They should not be excluded from the remit of the Bill. That is the intention behind the amendment and I ask the Minister of State to consider it. As it was raised on Second Stage, I hope the Minister of State has had the chance to consider the matter at least. I look forward to his response.</p>

          <p eId="para_353">I support the amendments. It seems that the Bill should not be restricted to the Garda Síochána, particularly when there are other agencies, such as Tusla and the Health and Safety Authority etc., which can be involved in these prosecutions. It seems clear these provisions should extend to them. There is also the matter of the right to information. It is very important for the proper conduct of any kind of trial or legal process that the parties involved should have the maximum possible information.</p>

          <p eId="para_354">I thank Senators for their work on this. This Bill is quite unusual in that it focuses squarely on the victims of crime rather than the perpetrators. For the first time in legislation, it sets out the rights of victims and focuses on the victims as individuals with different needs and vulnerabilities. The rights provided for in this Bill are valuable and practical rights which would make a real difference to the experience of victims in the criminal justice system. Keep the victims in mind.</p>
          <p eId="para_355"> We contend that what the Senators proposed in their amendments would significantly expand the scope of the Bill to a range of bodies outside those intended by the EU directive. The Bill focuses primarily on applying the provisions of the directive to victims of criminal offences that are reported to the Garda Síochána. There are, of course, other agencies and bodies which have been mentioned that are investigative and also prosecute, such as local authorities, some Government Departments and specialist authorities such as the Revenue Commissioners, the Health and Safety Authority the Consumer Protection Commission and the Director of Corporate Enforcement. No obligations have been imposed on such bodies in the Bill since the offences they prosecute are mainly of an administrative or regulatory nature. It is principally on the basis that in the context of the directive, there is generally no direct victim of such offences. The victimisation for such offences is often indirect and impersonal, for example tax evasion will affect all tax payers. </p>

          <p eId="para_360">I am dealing with what is before me.</p>
          <p eId="para_361"> Amendment No. 3 aims to apply all the provisions of Part 2 to an authorised person on whose functions relating to the investigation or bringing the prosecution of offences or both are conferred by an enactment. The definition proposed is overly broad, capturing all statutory bodies with a power to investigate and prosecute any offence including those of a regulatory nature, offences that would clearly follow the scope of criminal offences as intended in the EU directive. The difficulty lies in the fact that Ireland does not have a legal distinction between criminal offences and administrative or regulatory offences as exist in most EU countries. The precise scope of the amendment is unclear in that it provides no definitive list of persons or bodies captured. Consequently a victim will not be able to readily identify whether an authority with which he or she is interacting is covered by the Bill. Equally, where it is intended to place statutory responsibilities on a body, those bodies should be clearly identified and identifiable.</p>

        <speech by="#IvanaBacik" eId="spk_186">
          <from>Senator Ivana Bacik<recordedTime time="2017-09-27T15:40:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_362">I listened to the Minister of State's response and thank him for it. He was not critical of the drafting of amendment No. 3 for which I thank him and thank Mr. Finbarr O'Malley who carried out the drafting with me of that amendment.</p>
          <p eId="para_363"> I would say with respect that there are contradictions in the Minister of State's response. First, he said the other authorised body or person, such as the Health and Safety Authority or the Director of Corporate Enforcement, are effectively only bringing investigating and prosecuting offences that are regulatory in nature while later correctly saying that in Ireland we do not have a formal distinction between criminal offences generally and administrative or regulatory offences. There is no such formal distinction. There is a long, if not proud, history in Ireland of bringing prosecutions for so-called regulatory offences, such as breaches of health and safety Acts, for offences which might be prosecuted as corporate manslaughter in other jurisdictions. I am thinking of cases such as Zoe Developments where we saw a very large fine imposed on a construction company in respect of breaches of health and safety legislation as a result of which it appeared that an employee had been killed. There is a contradiction there. If our amendment would bring other bodies charged with prosecuting offences into the ambit of the Bill, that was our intention. There is no formal distinction between bodies between the kinds of offences they prosecute and those prosecuted by the DPP. There is no formal categorical distinction of that kind.</p>
          <p eId="para_364"> The Minister of State also made the point that for many of those so-called regulatory or administrative offences, there is no direct victim. That is true. I accept there may not be a victim in the way that there is a victim of a burglary or assault but if that is the case there should be no worry or concern about bringing those bodies within the ambit of the legislation. If there is no identifiable victim in respect of a large group of the offences which are prosecuted by those authorised persons then the Act will not be effective in that way so there should be no concern about that. </p>
          <p eId="para_365"> Our definition seeks to provide to bring within the ambit of the Act other bodies that may have a statutory function of bringing prosecutions of offences and that where there are offences and where there is a victim identifiable, then whether we call those offences regulatory or criminal those victims should be entitled to the protection of the Act. That is envisaged by the directive, that it would be broader than simply offences prosecutable through the normal mechanism of criminal offences through the Garda Síochána or the DPP.</p>

          <p eId="para_367">I do acknowledge that there are other bodies that investigate and prosecute. There are many of these, about 30 altogether. The majority investigate and prosecute offences of a more regulatory nature which, as the Senator said, do not have direct victims in the same way as offences investigated by the Garda Síochána. The approach we are taking in this Bill is to focus on offences commonly understood to be criminal in nature, which are primarily investigated by the Garda Síochána. This approach is in line with the spirit of the EU directive and will provide rights to the vast majority of victims.</p>
          <p eId="para_368"> Regardless of the view that the scope of the Bill should be broadened to cover other bodies with investigative prosecutory functions, it could not be done by way of a general amendment. Each individual body with relevant investigatory or prosecutory functions would need to be identified and appropriate provisions made to apply the necessary sections of the Bill to that body, taking into account the powers, functions and organisational structures of the individual organisation. One would have to be very specific, and the amendment is not. </p>
          <p eId="para_369"> The law must be clear. The Bill imposes statutory responsibilities and it must be clear on whom those responsibilities are imposed and that they are the appropriate persons in any relevant authority, taking into account their particular roles and functions. This clarity cannot be achieved by a general provision such as that proposed in amendment No. 3.</p>
          <p eId="para_370"> I am sorry but I cannot accept the amendments for those reasons.</p>

          <p eId="para_371">The Minister of State has said that there is a range of bodies. It is worth saying that it is not only bodies such as the Health and Safety Authority but also the HSE, HIQA, ComReg and so on also have functions here. There are some cases where there will be direct victims, that they would be excluded from the ambit of the Act if an amendment such as this was not accepted. I would have been open to an amendment to my amendment, or a different kind of an amendment that named a group of authorities and put them in a schedule to the Bill, for example. According to what the Minister of State says, that would have been a preferable approach. What I do not hear from the Minister of State is a principled objection to expanding the remit of the legislation to cover other prosecuting bodies where there is a direct victim.</p>
          <p eId="para_372"> It seems to me there could be a way of crafting an amendment that deals with the issues he raises and that names specific bodies in a schedule. It is unfortunate that at a very late date our schedule was altered so that we are taking Committee and Report Stages together today. This seems to be the sort of situation where we could usefully have had a dialogue between Committee and Report Stage on how we might encapsulate the spirit behind my amendment and that of Senator Boyhan and place it in a format that is more narrow and meets the issues raised by the Minister of State and his officials.</p>

          <p eId="para_373">I am a little concerned to realise that both Committee and Report Stages are being taken together today. It is very bad parliamentary practice. I am not blaming the Minister of State for that but it is bad parliamentary practice for the reasons adumbrated by Senator Bacik.</p>
          <p eId="para_374"> I am not fully sure why all the bodies should be specifically named and listed. We often hear in this House that when one does that kind of thing, it is bad practice because the list may turn out to be not exhaustive and complete. The phraseology of investigating authority could include anyone who has statutory, and-or statutory power to investigate, and-or prosecute a criminal offence and covers the material quite satisfactorily.</p>

          <p eId="para_375">I endorse what Senators Bacik and Norris have said. It is disappointing.</p>
          <p eId="para_376">The Government has a number of amendments here. It did not seek amendments in this regard. I do not think it was anyone's intention to exclude the Health and Safety Authority, the Health Information and Quality Authority, HIQA, Tusla, the HSE, ComReg or any others. I take on board what Deputy Stanton said about the definition, but he is the Minister of State. He could have engaged or created a situation where we could have amended amendments but he did not do so. It is on his watch. He is the Minister of State. If he is committed, is he happy that groups such as the Health and Safety Authority, HIQA, Tusla and the HSE are excluded? That is what it amounts to. Is Deputy Stanton, as Minister of State, happy to preside over that? If he had concerns, surely he and the Department would not have a problem? By his own actions and the fact he has not brought in a proposal here, it is difficult at this late stage, as Senator Bacik said, for us to tweak it now.</p>
          <p eId="para_377"> We have to be mindful of the Minister of State's advice. If it is necessary, I am happy to withdraw the amendment, but I do not really want a load of people running up the stairs and voting, as they will, with the Government on this. I say to the Minister of State that it is disappointing that he did not see fit to take on board the spirit of this. Forget about who is proposing, who has seconded or who is speaking on it. I do not think anyone really envisaged a situation where we would exclude these particular bodies from this legislation. I want to put that on the record and would like a response from the Minister of State about it.</p>

          <p eId="para_378">Without extending the debate unnecessarily, I should have said that there is at least a debate to be had about the definition of the original EU directive. I am grateful to Maria McDonald and the Victims' Rights Alliance for the information they have supplied us with on this. Their point is that "competent authority", the term used in article 4 of the victims directive, is broader than a law enforcement authority. It envisages that authorities beyond the Garda or the Garda Síochána Ombudsman Commission would be covered. It is clearly up to each national jurisdiction to decide what a competent authority would be. It seems that, at the very least, some sort of consideration should have been given to what competent authorities might, in Ireland, have prosecuting functions that would affect individual victims beyond the mere regulatory offences of the sort that we talked about with the health and safety legislation, although there are many cases where we have seen direct victims even in what we might call technical offences.</p>

          <p eId="para_379">I note that this Bill has not completed its journey, given the large number of Government amendments and that we know it is going back to the Dáil. Perhaps the Minister of State might indicate if he would seek to pursue something such as an amendment of the Schedule of relevant bodies in the Dáil. I am sure we would be able to expedite a return to the Seanad to confirm that. I recognise a very generous offer was made by my colleague, Senator Boyhan, with regard to not pressing it. We could argue that it would be better to have erred on the side of inclusion rather than on the side of omission and that we should seek to include all these investigating authorities and then if that needed to be narrowed in any appropriate way, it could be done in the Dáil. Alternatively, perhaps the Minister of State has ideas as to what he might put forward with regard to an attached Schedule in the Dáil. Will he indicate that to this House?</p>

          <p eId="para_380">I thank the Senators for their sincerity, work and thinking on this matter. I am always open to considering what the last speaker has suggested. There are other issues. This is focused on offences that are criminal in nature and are investigated by the gardaí. We are focusing on this where there is a clear victim. We also have to think about the structures, powers and capacities of the various bodies that have been mentioned and whether it is appropriate to have them in the first place. I will take on board the last suggestion but I do not want to promise that we will do something. We will certainly consider it further. I am anxious to get this moving and to get it done. It is very important for victims. The Minister and the previous Minister for Justice and Equality have engaged with victim support groups throughout the development of this Bill. Much work has gone into it and all these points were considered, but it was not agreed to name all of those bodies, for the very good reasons that I have outlined. I accept the sincerity of Senators and it is an important debate to have but it is going to make it overly broad and bring in bodies that do not have the structures, powers, capacities or functions to do what we are talking about. We need to have a focus on the gardaí and on the ombudsman, and also on the individual victims of crime - people, not bodies, as such. It should be nothing too broad. That is why I am not accepting these amendments, but I welcome the debate. It is important.</p>

For example, in the case of the Health and Safety Authority and the instance that was referred to by Senator Bacik, Zoe Developments, in which an employee was killed, that is a victim. It is a fairly extreme form of victimhood when one loses one's life. That seems to me to be an argument that is in accordance with the Minister of State's suggestion that it should be concentrated on victims.</p>

          <p eId="para_391">I draw the Minister of State's attention to something in the Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Act 2017. It is, by and large, a reasonable Act, particularly in the provision for children, but in the section which criminalises the purchase of sexual services, I warned at the time that it was highly dangerous and would lead to an increase in violence against women and an increase in disease. A report was recently published which shows that there has been an increase of 61% over the last year in acts of violence against women who provide these sexual services. That is a matter of real concern. I ask the Minister of State to ask the Government to move forward the review of this Bill, which will not take place for three years. It is urgent that it takes place now.</p>

          <p class="indent_3" eId="para_414">"(g) any summary of the reasons for a decision under any one or more of subparagraphs 2(c), (d), (e) and (f) in this section shall contain sufficient information to enable the victim to decide whether to request a review of the decision, in any case in which such a review is possible;".</p>
          <p eId="para_415">I thank the Minister of State for bringing forward this Bill and the Rape Crisis Network of Ireland for its help in trying to ensure this Bill works as best as possible, as the Minister of State said, for the victims of crime. I also thank the other Senators who have co-sponsored the amendments I have put forward. Senator Higgins rightly pointed to the fact that there is considerable interest in this and effort being made. It is disappointing to see debate truncated in this regard given the amount of work we have put into it and the interest there is in it.</p>
          <p eId="para_416"> The amendments proposed are measures to support in particular, as the Minister of State rightly said, the victims of the crimes of rape, sexual assault and sexual violence, which are crimes particularly but not exclusively experienced by women. They are horrible life-altering crimes that, as recent media commentary and commentary by Members of these Houses shows, at best are often misunderstood. At worst, such commentary betrays conscious or unconscious deep-rooted and deep-seated misogyny, and this can rear its head in all parts of our public system, among gardaí, the Director of Public Prosecutions and the courts. These are crimes in which, uniquely, the victim can be blamed for the awful thing that happened to her. We rightly do not blame the frail pensioner for being robbed on his or her way home from the post office and we do not blame children for being victims of child abuse. Why do we still continue to blame victims of the crimes of rape, sexual assault or sexual violence and insinuate or infer that they are somehow to blame for the crimes that have been forced upon them against their will? The amendments I have put forward are about supporting the victims after they come forward to have a reasonable experience and a fair trial and not to be on trial.</p>
          <p eId="para_417"> Speaking directly to amendment No. 6, the Director of Public Prosecutions does not prosecute the majority of sexual crimes identified in the Garda files it receives. At present, victims of sexual crime receive only a very brief and general letter from the Director of Public Prosecutions in response to their request for reasons the decision not to prosecute was made. There is no reference to the individual circumstances of their case. This cannot be said to be sufficient information for victims to decide whether to request a review of the decision. This amendment seeks to ensure victims get sufficient information to enable them to decide whether to request a review of the decision in any case in which such a review is possible. I ask the Minister of State to consider that.</p>

          <p eId="para_418">I agree with what Senator Kelleher has said. Often victims get a very bland and general letter from the legal authority, the Director of Public Prosecutions, and it does not address the particular circumstances of the case, as has been said. That cannot be construed as sufficient information for them to decide whether to seek a review. The practicality of this can be illustrated by the fact it can be done without infringing the right of others such as the accused, and it is already being done, for example, in England and Wales where victims of sexual crime and other victims entitled to enhanced measures can request a face-to-face meeting with the representatives of the Crown Prosecution Service to question the prosecuting authorities as to the reasons for their not proceeding. They are very often not successful. Only about 10% lead to a review, but that is an important illustration and example from an adjoining jurisdiction on which we model quite a lot of our legislation. I would put that point to the Minister of State.</p>

          <p eId="para_420">I appeal to the Minister to consider this amendment carefully because, as my colleague rightly described, this is an area of crime in which there can be a revictimisation and very negative experiences and insinuations made. If, for example, the reason a prosecution is not proceeding is a purely technical one or relates to evidence or some other legal reasons, it gives people peace of mind if they know the reason a prosecution is not being proceeded with or pursued. It is important in terms of people being able to move forward in their lives after such an experience. It is also important that there would be no suggestion made and that people would have a clear defence against any suggestion or insinuation that their experience, or what happened to them, was not valid and that they were not victim of a crime.</p>
          <p eId="para_421"> I am sure the Minister of State can imagine the peace of mind a clearer letter could give to a victim of crime. It could help make them decide if they wished to pursue the case further in terms of a review, but it would also give them a sense that they were being heard and that their particular experience was being recognised. As amendments have been brought forward and the Bill will go back to the Dáil, I urge the Minister of State to consider taking this amendment on board.</p>

          <p eId="para_422">I also appeal to the Minister of State to take this amendment on board. I acknowledge the work that the Victims Rights Alliance has done on this. It has been engaging with parliamentarians in both Houses on these important and serious matters. We are talking about victims of crime, which is a very serious issue. Most of the work that has been done on these amendments has come from advocacy groups, from people who have had personal experience and people who have been involved in groups. Any of the amendments that have been put before the Minister of State today have not being done lightly. They have been given a great deal of thought. That point is worth saying.</p>
          <p eId="para_423"> It is worth recapping this amendment. It is proposed that where a victim of an alleged offence has been assessed under section 14 and the Garda Síochána or the Garda Síochána Ombudsman Commission, as the case may be, has identified specific protection needs relating to the victim, which are special measures within the meaning of this section, the prosecutor shall inform the court of the outcome of the assessment and, importantly, at the beginning of the trial of the offence at the latest. That is very important. That was not simply made up. It is something about which a number of people communicated with our office and with other Senators. This is an important amendment. All the proposed amendments are important. The Minister of State should give this amendment serious consideration.</p>

          <p eId="para_425">I reiterate the calls from my colleagues for the Minister of State to consider this amendment, not just because of the spirit in which it is offered up but also because of the very positive, practical change that it could bring about for people who have been victims of sexual crime.</p>

          <p eId="para_426">I thank the Senators for their thoughts on this. The impact or the effect of the amendment would be to require that sufficient information be given to a victim to allow him or her to decide whether to request a review of any decision not to proceed with or to discontinue an investigation, not to prosecute or to discontinue a prosecution or a decision to deal with a person other than by trial. These are the four areas that are referred to as subparagraphs 2(c), (d), (e) and (f) in the amendment itself. The challenge with this is that it is very subjective. It would require An Garda Síochána, the Ombudsman Commission or the Director of Public Prosecutions to know what information would, in any particular case, be "sufficient" for the individual victim to decide whether he or she wishes to request a review of the decision in question. What would be sufficient for one person might not be sufficient for another. It is very subjective. Who decides what is sufficient?</p>
          <p eId="para_427"> Quite apart from the fact the relevant authority may not know what information would be sufficient in any given case, it is only a decision not to prosecute which may be reviewed. There is no right to a review of other decisions included in the amendment. In respect of a decision not to prosecute, a summary of the reasons on which this decision was made is the appropriate information to give to a victim in the circumstances and will provide a sufficient basis, in the vast majority of cases, upon which to decide whether to seek a review. </p>
          <p eId="para_428"> The challenge here is that the amendment is very subjective. One person's sufficient is not another person's sufficient. Who decides what is sufficient information? Furthermore, the amendment only pertains to decisions not to prosecute. For these reasons, we are not in a position to accept the amendment. If the Senators think about this, they will see that our reasons for not accepting it are valid. The amendment, if accepted, would cause major difficulties. </p>
          <p eId="para_429"> The other issue that arises is technical in nature. The amendment is not inserted in the correct position in the section. It has been placed within the list of information which a victim may request. It would need to be a new subsection in the section rather than a new paragraph in the list. If Senators look at what is actually qualifying the section here, all the subsections are qualified earlier on and it would not make sense to insert the amendment here. Thus, from a technical perspective it is wrong but more importantly, it is completely unworkable. Who decides what is sufficient? The amendment is unworkable from that point of view.</p>

          <p eId="para_430">I simply do not agree with the Minister of State that the amendment is too subjective. In a situation where information is requested, it should be perfectly clear to any reasonable person what is the sufficient information required. The other point I would make is that there is not a limitless mass of information available in any case. The information could be relatively restricted. It is incorrect to say that there would be a vast amount of information out there that had to be sifted through to determine what is relevant. Any reasonable citizen would be in a position to judge what is or is not sufficient. I do not think it is a matter of subjective judgment to any significant degree.</p>

          <p eId="para_431">It takes enormous courage for a person to come forward, particularly in a case of rape or sexual assault. There can be valid reasons for the DPP not being in a position to prosecute but the victim should go away with very firm knowledge of that and an understanding of why that is the case. That is the issue that victims of these types of crimes are raising with us. They are not getting sufficient information. It is subjective from the point of view of the DPP to decide what is sufficient information. The DPP is making these decisions. It takes a subjective overview in terms of saying that it cannot prosecute. There can be a valid basis for that but the decision is made by a person and is, therefore, subjective. In light of the courage it takes for people - women in particular - to come forward, they should go away feeling that they were heard and respected but that the case could not proceed because of X, Y or Z. Women are telling us that is not the case. The issue of sufficient information must be considered further and I hope the Minister of State is open-minded enough to do so.</p>

          <p eId="para_432">The Senator makes the point for me in many ways by saying that a person in an office will make the decision and that is sufficient information. I would hope that he or she would be encouraged to give as much information as is needed to a victim in the circumstances to enable the victim to decide whether to seek a review. That is what we are talking about here. It would be impossible for somebody to decide what somebody else might think is sufficient. What the Senator is now saying is that a person in an office, whether that be in An Garda Síochána or the DPP, should decide what is sufficient, which makes the amendment irrelevant in many ways, if that is the case, but we are not even saying that. We are not saying who decides. We are saying "sufficient information" and leaving it hanging there, so who makes the decision? Is it the victim? Can the victim say that he or she did not get sufficient information? One victim might say that the information received is sufficient while another might say that it is not. We have not defined it and do not know what it is. The Senator has been suggesting that it is somebody in an office who decides that the information is sufficient. I think it is unworkable as it stands and would ask that the amendment not be pressed. I am anxious to move on because this is very important legislation. There are 16 different subsections in this section dealing with information and it is quite detailed. The spirit of the Bill is that sufficient information will be supplied to enable victims to make a decision, which is what the Senator is seeking. I do not believe it is even necessary to insert this amendment into the legislation because the spirit of the Bill is to open the process up for people and to provide sufficient information. I cannot accept the amendment, not only because it is in the wrong place but also because it is so subjective that it would be unworkable. I ask that the Senators would withdraw the amendment so that we can move on and get the Bill through the Houses because people are waiting for this legislation.</p>

          <p eId="para_433">I do not want to prolong things either and would commend Senator Kelleher and Rape Crisis Network Ireland for their work on these amendments, which I am delighted to support. Having listened to the dialogue, I take the Minister of State's point that there are technical reasons he is against this particular amendment, No. 6. However, a very important principle has been expressed to him, which is that victims of crime are simply receiving what one might call a generic response currently in terms of decisions not to prosecute. I know, as does Senator Kelleher, from speaking with victims and survivors of sexual abuse or rape that we have a very high level of attrition between the reporting of the rape or sexual offence and the decision to prosecute it. In a large number of cases a decision not to prosecute is taken and it is extremely frustrating for victims to receive what they would see as a very generic reason or explanation for that. That is the spirit behind this amendment. Perhaps the wording "sufficient information" is not, in itself, sufficiently precise but the spirit of this amendment requires greater consideration. It should be possible to draft an amendment that requires that the victim be provided with information specific to his or her case to facilitate him or her in making a decision to request a review. It is information that is tailored to the individual case that is sought and not just a generic reason of insufficient evidence to proceed or that the DPP was of the view that a prosecution would not succeed, or something of that nature.</p>
          <p eId="para_434"> The issue here is the spirit of the amendment. I am sorry that there will not be any time between the Committee and Report Stages to enable consideration to be given to a better or more precise form of drafting. We all agree that this is very welcome legislation. We all note that people have been waiting a long time for it. I know that, as do all of us here, but we have a lack of legislation in the Seanad for this week and next and could easily have given a day or two, or even a week, between Committee and Report Stages-----</p>

          <p eId="para_441">Traditionally, not only in questions of sexual matters but in any prosecution, it has been the case that where the person involved wanted to find out the reason, the Office of the Director of Public Prosecution would not give him or her the reason. That was the traditional stance of the DPP. The argument that it is technically in the wrong place could be resolved. The Minister of State could very easily table an amendment and move it. It would not be a difficult manoeuvre. On the definition, something on the lines of providing information germane to the question of whether or not to appeal would define it.</p>

          <p eId="para_442">I am open to any other suggestions. However, section 7(2)(d)(i) and (ii) state that information shall be provided in relation to a decision not to prosecute a person for the alleged offence and that a summary of the reasons for the decision must be given. It also refers to information regarding the victim's right to request a review of the decision referred to in section 7(2)(d)(i) and the procedure for requesting the review. It is quite comprehensive. One would expect that every effort would be made to give as much information in the summary of reasons for the decision as is necessary. I would expect that to be the case because this Bill changes the whole tone and approach to victims.</p>
          <p eId="para_443"> The issue here is that the word "sufficient" is too subjective to put into legislation, and I think Senator Bacik agrees with me, that one could not work it. I take the spirit of what is intended. Senators want as much information as possible to be made available so that when someone is making a decision on whether or not to request a review of the decision not to prosecute, he or she would have as much information as he or she needs. The spirit of the legislation flows from that anyway. I will reflect on this a little but I am not sure how we would make that change or add something because it is implied that it is there already. If someone has something more specific, perhaps we can do it, but at this Stage I would ask the Senator to withdraw it and we can move on and get the rest of it done. Many of the amendments are very technical so it should not take long.</p>

We are happy to try to find a legislative approach on that and a wording that will work but there may also be scope in the language used for the reasons. It seems to be the case that people receive letters with the result of the decision but they are not informed about the reasons behind it. That is in there but it is important to make that clear and for the Minister of State to make that clear that his understanding is that the DPP's office does not simply state that it has decided not to prosecute because of insufficient evidence, but that it may give specific reasons.

It is about strengthening the perspective of the victim and making sure that all the relevant information relating to the victim, particularly if he or she has protection needs, is salient to any considerations to be made in the courtroom.</p>

          <p eId="para_453">Amendment No. 7 provides that the prosecutor shall inform the court of the outcome of an assessment where the assessment has identified special protection needs. It is not entirely clear what is meant by the outcome of the assessment. If the outcome of the assessment is understood as the report of the results of an assessment and that report were to be given to the judge, there would also be an obligation to disclose it to the defence. Assessments will frequently contain sensitive and confidential personal information regarding the victim and his or her personal circumstances, including vulnerabilities to victimisation and intimidation. I am sure Senators would agree that it would be highly inappropriate for such information to be disclosed to the defence. The Bill has been drafted very carefully to prevent assessment reports from becoming part of the criminal proceedings to prevent disclosure to the defence and any possible cross examination of the victim regarding its contents. Assessments may also contain information on previous offences or other previous conduct by the accused which pose a risk to the victim. If the case were a summary case, it could be prejudicial to the rights of the accused as the judge would have been provided with detailed information on the victim, the offender and the offence from the victim's perspective.</p>
          <p eId="para_454"> If outcomes are intended to be limited to the details of the special measures which have been identified as being of benefit to the victim, this would need to be clearly defined in the amendment. In any case, it is difficult to see what benefit there is to the victim if the details of the special measures, but not the reasons the victim might needs them, are provided to the court. It would be impossible for the court to make a determination on whether the measure was required without further details. In addition, many of the special measures concerned require an application by the prosecution so that the court would not be in a position to act on the assessment in the absence of such an application.</p>
          <p eId="para_455"> This amendment, while well intended, lacks clarity and carries a significant risk of curtailing the assessments themselves and requiring the release of sensitive personal information to the defence which includes potentially prejudicial information to the court. We have to be very careful and this Bill have been very carefully drafted. There are huge risks in this amendment even though it is well intended. I know what the intention is but it contains massive risks. Again, I ask the Senators to reconsider pressing the amendment.</p>

          <p eId="para_456">I hear what the Minister of State is saying about the process, but the absence in court of information on a victim needing protection, particularly where the defendant is the person against whom protection is needed, represents a huge gap and a lack of knowledge in ensuring court proceedings are reasonable and fair, with the victim being protected.</p>

          <p eId="para_457">With respect to the Minister of State, there is a blurring of lines in that what he has described is not what the amendment is putting forward. It is very clear in the amendment that it is a question of the outcome rather than the reasons for the assessment, about which we have just had a debate. It is simply a matter of whether the person needs protection. The decision is made by a separate body, separate from the court. An Garda Síochána and the Garda Síochána Ombudsman Commission identify that there are specific protection needs and examine whatever evidence or sensitive information might be relevant, as the Minister of State suggested. They come with an outcome based on the procedure followed in the case, not evidence. They are not stating it is evidence in the case. Nobody is suggesting the assessment would be presented as evidence in the case. They would simply be saying it was relevant information in how the court was processing the case where there was a need for protection. That is a very clear and separate process. Anybody going into something like this may have other needs such as a need for translation services. It is a matter of the processing of the case and the assessment would not be offered as evidence. I am not a lawyer - there are esteemed lawyers in the House - but I do not understand why this would require disclosure of the process used in the assessment of the outcome. It is simply a safety consideration made by a separate body and the information is offered to the court. It does not involve sensitive information on either an accused or the defence and the information would not be presented as evidence. Considering that the information is procedural, there may have been confusion on the Minister of State's part about what he believed was actually being suggested. To my mind, it seems to be very clear. I do not see the confusion the Minister of State suggested.</p>

          <p eId="para_458">In a way, we are back to the same argument the Minister of State made about matters being subjective. I do not see how this concerns matters from the victim's perspective only. What we are dealing with are objective facts that have been established. There is nothing that comes directly from the victim's perspective; they are matters of fact established by the proper authority.</p>

          <p eId="para_459">I note from the amendment that the prosecutor "shall inform the court of the outcome of that assessment at the beginning of the trial of the offence at the latest". There would be no choice. It would have to happen. Section 18 provides that the prosecution shall have regard to the assessment report in determining what, if any, special measures to apply for. The prosecution will be in a position to determine, in all the circumstances at the time of the trial, whether the special measures identified in the assessment are in the interests of the victim and, if so, what information the court needs to be aware of to support the application for a particular special measure. The Bill has been very carefully drafted to maintain a separation between the assessments and the court to ensure the assessments can comprehensibly assess the needs of the victim without any fear of sensitive personal information being released to the defence or potentially prejudicial information being given to the court. These are serious matters. The legislation has been drafted in a very careful way to protect the victim. If the Senators are insisting that the prosecutor "shall" inform the court of the outcome of an assessment, it would be giving a lot of information to the defence which it might not be in its bests interest to have. It could be detrimental to the prosecution and the victim and end up doing the opposite of what the Senators intend. As this is very serious, I ask the Senators not to press the amendment in order to allow the prosecution to have a free hand in making decisions. I ask them not to impose what they propose in this legislation because, let us not forget, the prosecution will be acting on behalf of the victim. The prosecution has to be free to decide what the court needs to be aware of and to support the application for a particular special measure.</p>
          <p eId="para_460"> It is not clear what the words "outcome of that assessment" mean. Do they mean a special protection measure is being put in place? What is the particular protection measure? Why is it being done? One is into all kinds of stuff that one does not really need to be into. We want to keep the matters separate. I, therefore, plead with the Senators to have second thoughts on the amendment.</p>

          <p eId="para_475">On the section. I have tabled an amendment to the section seeking to have the establishment of an ombudsman for victims of crime provided for. It is unfortunate that it has been ruled out of order. I accept the Leas-Chathaoirleach's ruling as I must, subject to all provisos. Senator Norris has already raised the nature of those rulings and the rule itself.</p>
          <p eId="para_476"> The concept of an ombudsman or one-stop-shop to which victims of crime could have recourse is provided for in recital 62 of the directive, which states that member states should consider developing sole points of access or one-stop-shops to address victims' multiple needs. Over many needs, we have seen a very patchy network of victims' support services across Ireland. We carried out some research on this in Trinity College some years ago. There is real inconsistency in terms of the supports available to victims. This legislation will do a lot to help that but we felt, and were supported by the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission in this regard, that the idea of an ombudsman for victims would be a worthwhile one to include in a Bill of this kind.</p>
          <p eId="para_477"> In its observations on this Bill, the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission recommended a single point of contact for victims to register a complaint about their treatment in the criminal justice system and argued that this would assist in securing great transparency, consistency and foreseeability of treatment.</p>
          <p eId="para_478"> While the ruling has been made and we cannot debate the amendment itself, I again ask the Minister to consider the concept of the establishment of an ombudsman for victims. It should also be noted that part of our amendment also referred to reporting on general and specialist training, which is an issue dealt with in amendment No. 41 tabled by Senator Boyhan, which has been accepted, so I know we will be dealing with some of the issues that were raised in amendment No. 14 when we get to amendment No. 41.</p>
          <p eId="para_479"> I thank the Leas-Chathaoirleach for his latitude in allowing me to speak me to an amendment that was ruled out of order.</p>

          <p eId="para_483">I move amendment No. 15:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_484">In page 30, between lines 20 and 21, to insert the following:</p>
          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_485">"(ii) by the insertion of the following words after "the relevant offence": "or was under 18 years of age at the time that he or she made a formal statement to a member of An Garda Síochána in respect of a relevant offence,".</p>
          <p eId="para_486">The rationale behind this amendment is the fact that this Bill does not include any universal right to give evidence by video link for victims over the age of 18 who do not have a mental disorder and who made a complaint to An Garda Síochána while they were under the age of 18. Victims who were over 18 at the time of the trial but who made a formal complaint while under the age of 18 should retain the right to give evidence by video link. My colleagues and I propose that section 13 of the Criminal Evidence Act be amended to allow this provision to be afforded to prosecution witnesses who are over 18 at the time of the trial but who made a formal complaint while under the age of 18 so that they retain the right to give evidence by video link.</p>

          <p eId="para_492">I am not sure where that came from. It certainly did not come from me. I am happy to accept any amendments that I can accept and if I am persuaded that they will not pose difficulties or that they are necessary.</p>
          <p eId="para_493"> Amendment No. 15 is to be inserted into section 13 of the Criminal Evidence Act. However, it is not exactly clear where it is supposed to go. The words "the relevant offence" do not appear in the section and if the text is inserted as "a relevant offence", it does not make any sense. It is not, therefore, clear as to what exactly this amendment should apply.</p>
          <p eId="para_494"> It may be that the Senators are seeking to extend the presumptive right to give evidence via live television link, which currently applies to children, to any person who is under 18 at the time of making his or her complaint. I can see merit in that proposal. However, there is a risk that it may result in persons of the same age and in the same circumstances being treated differently by the courts merely on the basis of the date on which a formal complaint was made.</p>
          <p eId="para_495"> While there are clear reasons to treat those who are children at the time they are giving evidence differently to adults, which has been upheld by the courts as proportionate, it is not at all certain that the same could be said for treating some adults differently to others depending on how early each person made a complaint. One has two adults and one is saying that one of them has to have video link because he or she made a complaint ten years ago while the other cannot have video link because he or she made a complaint two months ago. That is what the Senators are saying.</p>
          <p eId="para_496"> This could result in older adults being given greater protection than younger adults just because it took longer for one victim to come forward than another. It may also have the effect of putting pressure on a child victims to make a formal complaint at an earlier time than they are ready in order to avail of the enhanced rights. Senators should think about that for a minute. That is a serious point as well.</p>
          <p eId="para_497"> Amendment No. 34 seeks to extend provisions allowing video-recorded statements to be admissible in court to persons over the age of 18. As with amendment No. 15, I see merit in what is being proposed but this is a significant shift away from established practice. The protections are considered proportionate on the basis of the particular vulnerability of, and the need to safeguard, children. Extending this particular right to adults bears the risk of an unfair interference in the rights of an accused person to face his or her accuser and would need to be carefully examined from a constitutional perspective.</p>
          <p eId="para_498"> I also point out that the amendment is technically flawed in that it applies to any case in which this part applies. That language has been removed from the Criminal Evidence Act by this Bill in order to extend certain other provisions of the Act to victims of all offences. The amendment also fails to make consequential amendments to section 15 of the Criminal Evidence Act which would be required if this amendment was accepted. They are just technical issues. </p>
          <p eId="para_499"> As I have said, these amendments have merit and are worthy of consideration. However, as drafted, they would lead to inconsistent treatment of people in the same circumstances and would require careful consideration to avoid the risk of unintended consequences or unconstitutionality. There may be a need to re-examine the Criminal Evidence Act in a more comprehensive way to look at many of the points raised in this area during the progress of this Bill and I will certainly give a commitment to look into that.</p>
          <p eId="para_500"> For the reasons outlined and because of the technical flaws in the amendments, I am afraid I cannot accept them. The issue of video link concerns children and once people go over a certain age, they are no longer a child even though they might have made a complaint earlier on. There are serious issues around this and I again ask the Senators not to press the amendments.</p>

          <from>Senator Alice-Mary Higgins<recordedTime time="2017-09-27T16:40:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_501">With due respect, these amendments do affect children because if people are children when they go to make a complaint to An Garda Síochána, that is when they are initiating their concern around a potential criminal action against them. In respect of the experience of children as they seek to navigate our legal system and our courts, we see a huge fall-off where people drop out of the system. We see this in the case of sexual assaults, certainly for women, and we believe it is true for children. I do not have the figures to hand but I know they are also high.</p>
          <p eId="para_502">People start a prosecution and drop out because they are frustrated by delays or obstructions in the legal process. It becomes a weapon that can be used effectively by somebody and it can be a form of revictimisation, as delaying a case can ensure a child will pass the threshold of 18 and have to give evidence in person. The distress created by the person knowing he or she may pass the threshold of being 18 and be forced to testify is distress that is visited upon a child. There is concern. The example the Minister of State gave was one of a case going to court ten years after somebody went to a garda versus someone who went last year. I hope those who make statements to gardaí in respect of being victims of crimes as children are not, as a standard practice, waiting ten years. I hope the more normal practice is that the procedures flow from the initial statement to the Garda. There is a concern about distress, potential disadvantage and perhaps a disincentive to pursue justice being visited upon children by the fact they are perhaps 16 or 17 and they may hit the age of 18 before the case and they could lose the right to video testimony.</p>
          <p eId="para_503"> With respect, I suggest that if technical issues about exactly where this is placed have been identified as concerns they are to be fixed on Report Stage in the Dáil. They are minor technical matters regarding the exact section. We see these as procedural changes. The Government has very often had to make adjustments on Report Stage. If we had a separate Report Stage debate it would be an opportunity for any such tidying. We cannot allow ourselves to lose the substantive points because of such technicalities. It is something for the Department to address as it navigates the next Stage of the Bill.</p>

          <p eId="para_504">The Minister of State has been very cogent in explaining his reasons for not accepting amendment No. 15 and I accept his argument. With regard to amendment No. 34, the Minister of State said it would stop the accused facing his or her accuser, but I understand the evidence will be given by the complainant on a live TV or video circuit. This means they would be able to confront them. As I understand it, and the Minister may correct me on this, the accuser could be cross-examined by TV or video link.</p>

          <p eId="para_505">The Minister of State has given a very cogent response, but there is a bigger issue as Senator Higgins has pointed out. The bigger issue is the need to look beyond our current adversarial system in terms of protections for vulnerable witnesses. We see in other jurisdictions such as England and Wales, which have a traditional adversarial system, recognition we do need to put in place more protections for vulnerable witnesses beyond those who are under 18. We need to be more radical in our thinking and our approach to criminal evidence. I speak as somebody who practised as a criminal defence barrister for years. Aggressive and hostile cross-examination of witnesses, particularly in sexual offence cases, is a real problem, as the Minister of State is well aware, in our criminal justice system. These amendments are really designed to try to put more protections in place for vulnerable witnesses beyond those who are under 18 at the time of the trial. It is great to see protections being put in place for child witnesses, but we also need to think about the need to constrain our style of aggressive cross-examination of vulnerable witnesses beyond those who are under 18 at the time of the trial.</p>

          <p eId="para_506">I have listened carefully and I do think the amendments have merit. They are worthy of consideration and there is no doubt about that. However, as drafted, there is a risk they could lead to inconsistent treatment of people in the same circumstances. We must give a lot of consideration to avoid unintended consequences or even the constitutionality of it. A better place to look at this would be in the criminal evidence Bill, and examine in a comprehensive way the points raised here, including those by Senator Bacik. The Senators have raised some very interesting points but they need to be teased out more. We will do this and examine it. I am not making a big issue of the technical flaws but they are there. At this stage, I cannot accept the amendments because of this.</p>
          <p eId="para_507"> The main points we make are the unintended consequences and treating people in the same circumstances in different ways, whereby we have two adults of the same age and one can give evidence by video link and the other cannot. There are issues that need to be thought through and teased out. I take the points Senator Higgins made very well, and I thank her for them, with respect to children reaching 18, but there is also the point that before they are ready to come forward pressure is put on child victims to make a formal complaint at an earlier time in order to avail of the enhanced rights. There might be something also happening on that side of it. This is complicated enough. I thank the Senators for raising the issue and debating it, but we need to come back to it in the criminal evidence Bill.</p>

          <p eId="para_508">I have heard what the Minister of State has said. He has been here for approximately an hour and according to him everything has merit. He came here with 40 amendments and he was aware of all of our amendments. One has to ask what are we doing in Seanad Éireann. I have been here for a year and a half. Are we wasting our time? The Minister of State has had the advantage of the experts, specialists and consultants. He is on top of his brief. He is a very pleasant man. It is very hard to disagree with a very pleasant man who is an able and competent Minister of State, and I do not say this in a patronising way. He knows this business very well. He has come in here and kept talking about the amendments having merit. Can we hear something more positive? When we come back after tea, are we to sit here for another hour and hear the same old story about merit? Will the Minister of State give us any solace or support for anything we propose? It is quite depressing. I ask the Minister of State to see it from the other side of the House. I know the amendments are technical. I take this on board and I withdrew the first one, but this is worth putting on the record. The Minister of State had the advantage of coming here with amendments and stating there are technical reasons, good reasons or unintended consequences that mean they should be accepted. However, I am coming up with another proposal, which the Minister of State has not considered, and this is disappointing, particularly when the Minister of State has the resources, capacity and people at his back to do so. We are here because we have been asked to do a lot of this by other groups and I want to push this to a vote.</p>

          <p eId="para_513">The Senator is right when he says we have the privilege of having expert analysis from the Department, the Office of the Attorney General and beyond. The expert advice to us is not to accept these amendments for the reasons given. This is the expert advice. I will be more than happy to accept amendments if I am advised otherwise, but I am advised by the Office of the Attorney General and beyond that there are risks and dangers and that the amendments require further consideration. I must point out to the Senator I spent 15 years in opposition drafting amendments, and very often amendments are very useful for debating purposes to raise issues, debate issues and highlight issues. If we get advice from senior legal sources that there are risks and challenges and even dangers in some amendments we must take this advice. I cannot come in here and accept amendments for the sake of accepting amendments. I have consistently acknowledged the work the Senators have done in raising these issues and debating them. If an amendment is tabled that I can accept I certainly will do so. I will be more than happy to do so, and I have done so in the past in this Chamber. Unfortunately, the amendments today, for the reasons I have outlined, demand further debate and further consideration and I do not want to delay the Bill any further. I have tabled 30 amendments today and I know many of them are technical. We have been working on this.</p>

          <p eId="para_564"> Cuirim céad fáilte go dtí an Teach nua atá againn roimh an Aire Stáit. Tá súil agam go mbainfidh sé sásamh as. Tá go leor cainte tarraingthe le seachtain anuas ag an ábhar seo. Níor thuig mé go raibh sé chun a bheith chomh tráthúil mar bhí an tábhar roghnaithe againn sula raibh a fhios againn go raibh na hainmniúcháin ó thaobh bhord an údarais le tarlú an tseachtain seo. Leis an mBille atáimid ag tabhairt chun cinn, táimid ag iarraidh athruithe a thug duine de na daoine a chuaigh roimh an Aire Stáit, an t-iar-Aire, an Teachta Dinny McGinley, isteach a iompú ar ais. Ag an am sin cuireadh deireadh leis na toghcháin dhíreacha go dtí bord Údaras na Gaeltachta. Leis an mBille seo táimid ag iarraidh, agus tá súil againn go mbeidh tacaíocht againn ón Seanad ar fad, an nós a bhíodh ann ó aimsir 1979 ar aghaidh a thabhairt ar ais, is é sin, go mbíodh toghcháin dhíreacha go dtí bord Údaras na Gaeltachta le comhaltaí ó na ceantair Gaeltachta ar fad. Táimid ag iarraidh an guth daonlathach sin a thabhairt ar ais do phobal na Gaeltachta.</p>
          <p eId="para_565"> Agus mé ag breathnú siar ar chuid den stair a bhaineann le toghcháin Údaras na Gaeltachta, tháinig mé trasna ar fhoilseachán darbh ainm <i>Carn</i>, a bhí an-suimiúil. Is éard a bhí ann ná irisleabhar a cuireadh le chéile idir na tíortha Ceilteacha. Bhí píosa scríofa ag Seán Mac Mathúna ag déanamh cur síos ar an chéad toghchán d'Údaras na Gaeltachta in 1979. Dúirt sé:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_566">The elections for this Authority, Údarás na Gaeltachta, were held on 11 December 1979. The campaign was, on the whole, low-key and fought mainly on local issues. It did, however, receive quite an amount of publicity from the media, especially when one recalls that the total electorate was 55,644 people.</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_567">The election attracted a total of 34 candidates, 15, 11 and 8 candidates in the Connacht, Munster and Donegal constituencies respectively.</p>
          <p eId="para_568">Dúirt sé níos deireanaí: "30,619 people voted in the election: this gave a percentage poll of 55.6%, 0.6% of which were spoiled." Agus dúirt sé: "The main criticism which Conradh na Gaeilge and other groups made of the type of Authority which was being set up was that it would simply be a reconstituted and revamped version of Gaeltarra Éireann (The Industrial Development Agency for the Gaeltacht)."</p>
          <p eId="para_569">Dúirt sé: </p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_570">The Authority lacks power over areas such as planning, as well as the purchase and sale of land in the Gaeltacht. Powers such as these would be necessary for the preservation and development of the Gaeltacht as a Gaeltacht.</p>
          <p eId="para_571">Críochnaíonn an t-alt leis sin:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_572">In its statement prior to the elections Conradh na Gaeilge deplored in particular the clause in the Act which established Údaras na Gaeltachta and which imposes under pain of expulsion a guarantee of secrecy on members of the Údaras. The Conradh claimed that this was designed to prevent the elected representatives from publicly expressing dissatisfaction with any aspect of the Authority's activities.</p>
          <p eId="para_573"> Sílim go léiríonn an pointe deireanach sin, ar luaigh an tUasal Mac Mathúna san eagrán sin de <i>Carn</i> ó1980, ceann de na rudaí faoina mbíonn daoine ag clamhsán liomsa ó thaobh bhord Údaras na Gaeltachta, is é sin, go n-aithníonn siad nach gcloiseann muid mórán faoi céard atá ar siúl ag an údaras ó cuireadh an tathrú i bhfeidhm. Bhíodh díospóireachtaí i bhfad níos poiblí maidir leis an obair ar fad atá ar siúl ag Údaras na Gaeltachta. Bhraith daoine go raibh tionchar acu ar na hionadaithe tofa. Bhíodar ábalta bualadh leo ag cruinnithe poiblí. Bhíodar ábalta caint agus plé leo ar na hábhair a bhí ag déanamh tinnis dóibh. Bhí an glór sin á thabhairt chun cinn ag bord an údaráis.</p>
          <p eId="para_574"> Tá súil agam go mbeidh tacaíocht againn ó na páirtithe éagsúla agus ó na Baill Neamhspleácha. Tá mé sásta go leor faoi sin. Tá a fhios agam nach mé féin an t-aon duine atá ag rá gur cheart go mbeidh na tóghcháin dhíreacha ar ais ag bord Údaras na Gaeltachta. Tá sé ráite ag an Teachta Éamon Ó Cuív, a bhí ina iar-Aire le freagracht as an Ghaeltacht, go raibh Fianna Fáil ar a shon. Bhí díospóireacht ar an raidió ar maidin. Bhí Seán Ó Neachtain, iar-Fheisire Eorpach agus iar-chathaoirleach ar bhord an údarais, ag rá go gceapann sé gur chóir na toghcháin a thabhairt ar ais. Luaigh Séamus Breathnach, nach bhfuil roghnaithe go huile agus go hiomlán fós ó Chomhairle Chontae na Gaillimhe le bheith ina bhall de bhord an údarais, go mbraitheann sé féin gur chóir go dtabharfaí ar ais na toghcháin. Ar ndóigh, bhí sé ina pholasaí de Shinn Féin an t-am ar fad gan fáil réidh leis na toghcháin agus go mbeifí in ann iad a thabhairt ar ais. Táimid sásta go bhfuilimid ag fáil an deis seo é a thabhairt chun cinn arís.</p>
          <p eId="para_575"> Is fiú breathnú ar chomhdhéanamh an bhoird agus cén fáth a gceapaimid go bhfuil deacracht leis an leagan amach i láthair na huaire. In 2005, bhí 20 duine ar bhord Údaras na Gaeltachta. Ag an am sin bhí 11 duine ag an Rialtas as an scór. Bhí os cionn leath ag an Rialtas so bhí móramh aige. Bhí ceathrar ag Fine Gael agus bhí cúigear ann a bhí neamhspleách nó ina mbaill de páirtithe beaga, is é sin 25%. Bhí cothromaíocht réasúnta ansin ach bhí móramh ag an Rialtas. Bhí naonúr acu sin ó Fhianna Fáil, beirt ó na Progressive Democrats, ceathrar ó Fhine Gael, triúr neamhspleách, duine ó Pháirtí an Lucht Oibre agus duine ó Shinn Féin ag an am. Nuair a bhreathnaítear ar an bhord nua a tháinig chun cinn tar éis na ceapacháin in 2012, bhí 12 duine ar fad air. Bhí 75% acu ainmnithe nó ceapaithe ag an Rialtas agus bhain siad le páirithe de chuid an Rialtais. Bhí duine amháin ó Fhianna Fáil agus bhí beirt neamhspleách. Chuir sé sin an tromlach ar an mbord - 75% de na baill - a bhí uilig ar son polasaí Rialtais. Is dóigh nach mbeifí ag súil go mbeadh mórán cainte acu siúd nó aon cháineadh le deánamh acu ar an Rialtas reatha. Ní dóigh liom go bhfuil sé sin folláin, is cuma cén páirtí atá sa Rialtas. Ba chóir go mbeadh deis ag na baill a bheadh ar bhord Údaras na Gaeltachta.</p>
          <p eId="para_576"> Ar ndóigh, is eagraíocht Údarás na Gaeltachta a d'fhás as an ghluaiseacht um chearta sibhialta na Gaeltachta agus as an bhrú pobail a bhí ann chun cur i gcoinne an meath ó thaobh cúrsaí fostaíochta agus ó thaobh cúrsa daonra sna ceantair Ghaeltachta. Troideadh go láidir le go gcuirfí a leithéid ar bun. Tá tograí an-fhiúntach ar bun ag Údaras na Gaeltachta ach níl aon dabht go bhfuil cúlú déanta de bharr easpa acmhainní agus easpa tacaíochta ón Stát le riar maith blianta anuas, roimh réimeas Rialtas Fhine Gael chomh maith céanna. Tá riar ceisteanna ann le cúig bliana anuas gur chóir iad a bheith ardaithe agus pléite. Tá cuid acu ardaithe agam féin.</p>
          <p eId="para_577"> Bhí fochomhlachtaí ag Údaras na Gaeltachta, Arramara, mar shampla. Bhí go leor daoine an-amhrasach maidir le díolachán Arramara. Ba fhochomhlacht iomlán de chuid Údaras na Gaeltachta é ansin agus tá sé díolta le comhlacht príobháideach anois. Bhain go leor rúndacht leis an gconradh agus leis an socrú a rinneadh ansin maidir leis an airgead agus mar sin de. Chonaic muid, i ndiadh an chomhlachta sin a bheith ceannaithe, go ndeachaigh iar-fhostaithe ó Údaras na Gaeltachta ag obair leis an gcomhlacht a cheannaigh Arramara. Bhí ceisteanna ag daoine faoi sin agus faoin chaoi ina bhféadfadh sin a tharlú.</p>
          <p eId="para_578"> Tá ceisteanna faoi Muintearas. Tá siad sin ardaithe agam i bhfochoiste Oireachtais anseo. De réir mar a thuigim, tá tuairisc bainistíochta ar siúl ó thaobh Muintearas de maidir le deacrachtaí atá san eagraíocht áirithe sin. Bhí an tuairisc sin le bheith foilsithe san earrach. Níor chuala mise go bhfuil sé foilsithe agus rinne mé fiosrúcháin faoin uair a bheadh sé le fáil. Dúradh liom go dtiocfaí ar ais chugam ach níor tháinig. Táimse imníoch faoi na himpleachtaí a bhaineann leis an bhfiosrúchán áirithe sin. Dar liomsa, dá mbeadh níos mó oscailteacht ó thaobh bhord Údaras na Gaeltachta go bhféadfaimis ceisteanna mar sin a bhrú le chéile.</p>
          <p eId="para_579"> Tá mé féin agus mo chomhghleacaí, an Teachta Peadar Tóibín, i láthair na huaire ag dul ar chuairt ar na ceantair Ghaeltachta le bualadh le muintir na Gaeltachta. Níl aon dabht faoi gurb é an cloch is mó atá ar phaidrín daoine ná cruthú fostaíochta i láthair na huaire - jabanna sna ceantair Ghaeltachta. Tá siad míshásta go leor chomh maith maidir le cúrsaí pleanála teanga sna ceantair Ghaeltachta atáimid tar éis dul ann, mar gur cuireadh go leor dua sa trí phlean teanga a d'fhoilsigh agus a d'fhógair an tAire Stáit an tseachtain seo caite. Cuireadh buiséad, airgead agus costais leis na pleananna a bhí beartaithe, ach tá Údaras na Gaeltachta tar éis iompú timpeall agus a rá gur cuma cén plean atá ann, ní bheidh le fáil ach €100,000 in aghaidh na bliana. Tá daoine beagáinín oibrithe faoi sin.</p>
          <p eId="para_580"> Tá Comhlachas na gComharchumann Gaeltachta tar éis ceist na ndeontas reachtála a íoctar leis na comharchumainn a ardú. Rinneadh slad orthu sin le linn na géarchéime eacnamaíochta. Tá sé an-deacair do na comharchumainn maireachtáil. Tá drochchás amach agus amach ag Comharchumann na nOileáin Beag atá lonnaithe i gceantar an Aire Stáit féin. Tá an deontas reachtála atá aige chomh beag go bhfuil sé i mbaol dúnta mura gheobhadh sé tacaíocht breise. D'iarrfainn ar an Aire Stáit breathnú ar sin. Tá an-obair ar bun ansin ag eagraíochtaí eile, ar nós Comhar Naíonraí na Gaeltachta, arís atá ag maireachtáil ar a ngannchuid ach atá ag déanamh scoth na hoibre ar fud na Gaeltachta. Caithfidh mé ardmholadh a thabhairt don obair atá ar bun ag Ealaín na Gaeltachta. Sílim go bhfuil ardobair ar bun aige sin agus go bhfuil sé tar éis cuir le cúrsaí ealaíne sa Gaeltachta. Teastaíonn tuilleadh tacaíochta dó.</p>
          <p eId="para_581"> Má bhreathnaímid ar Údaras na Gaeltachta, sílim go bhfuil an pictiúr an-lom ó thaobh cá raibh sé in 2006 agus cá bhfuil sé i láthair na huaire. Má bhreathnaímid ar na deontais a bhí ceadaithe ag Údaras na Gaeltachta sa bhliain 2006, cheadaigh sé luach €16 milliún de dheontais. Sa bhliain 2015, an bhliain is deireanaí a bhfuil cuntais againn di, ceadaíodh €2.4 milliún. Chuaigh sé ó €16 milliún síos go €2.4 milliún. Ó thaobh an deontais a íocadh amach in 2006, d'íoc an t-údarás €9.5 milliún amach. In 2015, níor íocadh ach €924,000. Níor íocadh milliún féin amach. Is titim ollmhór é sin ó thaobh an tacaíocht a bhí Údarás na Gaeltachta ag tabhairt do dhreamanna éagsúla sna ceantair Ghaeltachta.</p>
          <p eId="para_582"> Maidir le h-infheistíocht i scairchaipitil, ceann de na bealaí a bhíodh ag an údarás tacú le comhlachtaí ná go mbíodh sé ábalta scairchaipitil a cheannach. Sa bhliain 2006, rinne an t-údaras infhestíocht de €4.26 milliún i scairchaipitil. Sa bhliain 2015, bhí an figiúr sin ag €445,000 - titim mór arís. Ar ndóigh bhí bac ar earcaíocht in Údaras na Gaeltachta le riar maith blianta. In 2006, bhí 113 daoine ann a bhí ábalta cuid mhaith oibre a dhéanamh. Bhí an figiúr sin titithe go 79 in 2015. Níl mé cinnte cé mhéad atá ann i láthair na huaire, ach b'fhéidir go mbeidh an tAire Stáit in ann é sin a insint don Teach. Tá sé deacair an obair a chur chun cinn nuair a táthar gann ar fhostaithe. Ó thaobh fostaíochta lánaimseartha, caithfear a rá go bhfuil moladh réasúnta maith tuillte ag an údarás sa réimse sin. Is é an méid daoine a bhí fostaithe i gcomhlachtaí faoi scáth Údarás na Gaeltacht ná 7,953. Bhí sé níos lú in 2015 ach caitear an méid gearradh siar a rinneadh ar na deontais, an easpa foirne agus mar sin de a chur san áireamh. Bhí sé titithe go 7,268, ach i bhfianaise an méid a bhí caillte ag an údaras ó thaobh acmhainní de, rinne sé réasúnta maith.</p>
          <p eId="para_583"> Is cuimhin leis an Aire Stáit féin go ndearnadh tuarascáil Indecon a léirigh, má bhíothas ag iarraidh cur le fostaíocht sa Ghaeltacht seachas titim a bheith ag teacht air, go dteastódh €10 milliún breise sa mbliain d'infheistíocht. In 2006, bhí caiteachas ar fhoirgnimh de €12 milliún ag an údaras. Bhí €4 milliún caite aige in 2015. Bhí tionscnaimh chultúrtha imithe ó €4.6 milliún in 2006 síos go €3 milliún agus bhí na deontais do thionscail agus caiteachas caipitil imithe ó €27 milliún síos go dtí €6.6 milliún sa tréimhse céanna sin. Léiríonn sé sin domsa gur baineadh na putóga as Údarás na Gaeltachta. Tharla sé sin sin sula raibh Rialtas Fhine Gaeil i gcumhacht.</p>
          <p eId="para_584">Bhí sé ag tarlú le linn réimeas Fhianna Fáil chomh maith céanna. Níor chualamar gíog ná míog, i ndáiríre, ó bhord Údarás na Gaeilge. Dar liomsa, sin ceann de na cúiseanna is mó a dteastaíonn uainn dul ar ais agus bord tofa a bheith againn ar Údarás na Gaeltachta, na daoine sin a bheith ag teacht ó phobal na Gaeltachta agus iad roghnaithe ag an dream atá siad ag seasamh ar a son. Tá súil agam go mbeidh an tAire Stáit ag tacú leis an mBille inniu.</p>

          <from>Senator Niall Ó Donnghaile<recordedTime time="2017-09-27T17:30:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_585">Gabhaim mo bhuíochas leis an Aire Stáit as a bheith linn don phlé tábhachtach seo. Seolaim comhghairdeas le mo chomghleacaí, an Seanadóir Ó Clochartaigh, as an Bhille a chur os ár gcomhair inniu. Mar a dúirt sé, is Bille thar a bheith tábhachtach agus thar a bheith simplí é chomh maith ó thaobh na cuspóirí atá leagtha amach sa Bhille seo inniu.</p>
          <p eId="para_586"> Mar is eol don Aire Stáit, le cúpla bliain anuas chonacthas an brú ar féidir pobal na Gaeltachta agus pobal na Gaeilge araon a chur ar údaráis agus Rialtais chun a gcearta a éileamh. Tá an brú seo cumhachtach, spreagúil agus éifeachtach. Le blianta beaga anuas, is é an t-aos óg is minice atá chun tosaigh sna feachtais seo agus feictear seo sna mórshiúlta dathúla beomhar a bhíonn ar ár sráideanna. Is cuimhin linn uilig na "crogaill" mhóra a bhuail an bóthar cúpla mí ó shin agus iad dearg le fearg mar gheall ar mhasla Arlene Foster i leith na teanga agus lucht a labhartha. Ach ní fiú faic an brú sin mura gcloistear é san áit a bhfuil an cumhacht polaitiúil, mar a ndéantar na cinntí móra. Sin is cúis leis an Bhille atá romhainn inniu: an nasc sin a chur ar bun arís.</p>
          <p eId="para_587"> Ó thosaigh an ghéarchéim pholaitíochta sna Sé Chontae aimsir na Nollag na bliana seo caite, is é pobal na Gaeilge é féin a tháinig le chéile agus a sheas an fód ar son chearta lucht labhartha na Gaeilge. Bímis cinnte faoi seo. Labhair an pobal leis na páirtithe polaitiúla sna Sé Chontae agus ba ríshoiléir an teachtaireacht a bhí acu. Is é sin go bhfuil cearta de dhíth mar bhunús le haon chomhréiteach nua. Sheas mé féin ar thairseach na gcéadta teach le linn na dtoghchán i mbliana, agus ag mór chuid dóibh dúradh liom an fód a sheasamh maidir le hAcht na Gaeilge aonarach a bhaint amach. Sin pobal na Gaeilge ag rá go díreach le polaiteoir seasamh faoi leith a ghlacadh maidir leis an Ghaeilge agus gan géilleadh. Deirim an méid seo uilig mar tá sé soiléir go gcaithfear an nasc sin idir muintir na Gaeltachta, ar daoine iad a chaitheann a vóta de ghnáth, agus na polaiteoirí féin a bheith láidir agus a bheith soiléir. Mura bhfuil an pobal sásta, ba cheart an rogha a bheith acu an polaiteoir sin a chaitheamh amach. Dar ndóigh, ní chuirfeadh muidne stad nó bac ar bith air sin. Is é sin bunphrionsabal de dhaonlathas ar bith.</p>
          <p eId="para_588"> Mar a bheadh ar eolas ag cuid mhaith de na Seanadóirí anseo, tá ceathrú Ghaeltachta bhríomhar fhuinniúil againn in iarthar Bhéal Feirste. Aithnítear é mar cheantar faoi leith a bhfuil an Ghaeilge agus oidhreacht na Gaeilge faoi bhláth agus ar marthain i saol na ndaoine a chónaíonn ann agus a thugann cuairt uirthi chomh maith. Rinneadh an cuid is mó dá bhfuil ann faoi láthair mar gheall ar an phobal féin ag teacht le chéile ag tráth a raibh nimh san fheoil ag údaráis halla na cathrach ar gach rud a bhí Éireannach nó Gaelach. Ní chuirfeadh sé iontas ar dhuine ar bith go bhfuil siad thar a bheith cosantach agus bródúil fosta, dar ndóigh, as an cheantar sin. Caitheann daoine vótaí sa cheantar seo mar gheall ar an seasamh atá ag iarrthóir nó an páirtí i leith na Gaeilge agus forbairt na ceathrún Gaeltachta féin. Tá sé aisteach, mar sin, gur féidir le duine i mBéal Feirste nó i nDoire a rá gur féidir leis vóta a chaitheamh bunaithe ar dhearcadh an iarrthóra i leith na Gaeilge ach nach féidir le duine i nGaoth Dóbhair nó i gConamara a bheith cinnte an bhfuil Gaeilge ar bith ag an té a roghnófar le dul ar bhord an Údaráis.</p>
          <p eId="para_589"> Freagracht atá de dhíth. I gcás Údarás na Gaeltachta, caitear na milliúin euro achan bhliain. I gcásanna mar seo, is mó fós an gá atá le freagracht. Caithfidh muinín a bheith ag an phobal go bhfuil an t-airgead ag dul san áit cheart. Tá an Bille seo ag iarraidh an chumhacht a thabhairt ar ais chuig mhuintir na Gaeltachta in am atá cinniúnach di. Luaigh an Seanadóir Ó Clochartaigh é ach tá a fhios againn uilig an titim mhór a tháinig ar chaiteachas caipitil an údaráis a thit ó €26 milliún go €6 milliún agus é ag titim i gcónaí.</p>
          <p eId="para_590"> Ar bhealach tá na Gaeltachtaí uirbeacha i bhfad níos folláine mar gheall go bhfuil na háiseanna uilig i ngar dóibh, go háirithe fostaíocht. Ach ní hionann sin agus an scéal sna Gaeltachtaí imeallacha. Sin is cúis leis an údarás sa chéad áit: fostaíocht a chruthú sna Gaeltachtaí imeallacha chun gur féidir le daoine fanacht mar a bhfuil siad agus mar a bhfuil an Ghaeilge beo. Cás faoi leith atá ann mar is buile tubaisteach do thodhchaí na Gaeltachta mar bhíonn ar fiú teaghlach amháin a bhogadh amach de bharr easpa fostaíochta. Tá ról i bhfad níos tábhachtaí ná comhairlí contae ag Údarás na Gaeltachta ach faoin chóras nua tá an Rialtas agus, caithfimid a rá, Fianna Fáil ag caitheamh leis mar thuath beag dóibh féin le dáileadh amach ar a gcuid cairde.</p>
          <p eId="para_591"> Is cuimhin liom in 2005 nuair a toghadh Gráinne Mhic Géidigh mar an chéad bhall tofa de chuid Shinn Féin ar an mbord. Chuir sí an fhostaíocht chun tosaigh. Cheistigh sí agus chíor sí na figiúirí a bhain le cúrsaí fostaíochta agus níor sheachain sí an focal géar i leith faillí an údaráis féin. Sin an rud atá ag teastáil ó chomhaltaí úra an údaráis, daoine a chuirfidh an brú ar an Údarás agus ar an Rialtas i gcoitinne thar cheann na ndaoine a thug vóta dóibh. Sin muintir na Gaeltachta iad féin. Faoin chóras mar atá sé anois, is minice go dtaobhaíonn comhaltaí an bhoird le seasamh an Rialtais seachas le mianta agus riachtanais phobal na Gaeltachta.</p>
          <p eId="para_592"> Impím ar achan Sheanadóir tacú leis an Bhille fíorshimplí seo. Lig do phobal na Gaeltachta guth a bheith acu ar an bhord a dhéanfaidh na cinntí móra ina leithse. Is é pobal na Gaeltachta a bheidh ag maireachtáil sa Ghaeltacht. Murach iad, ní bheidh plean, pobal ná teanga. Tabhair guth do phobal na Gaeltachta. Tabhair guth suntasach láidir dóibh.</p>

        <speech by="#MauraHopkins" eId="spk_289">
          <from>Senator Maura Hopkins<recordedTime time="2017-09-27T17:30:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_593">Cuirim fáilte roimh an Aire Stáit. While we in Fine Gael will be opposing the Bill, it is important that we use our time to highlight the work of Údarás na Gaeltachta as an organisation that begins a new era under the newly appointed CEO, Mike Ó hÉanaigh. I wish him all the best in his five-year term and pay tribute to former CEO, Steve Ó Cúláin, for his dedication to the organisation during his time as CEO. The role of Údarás na Gaeltachta in supporting Gaeltacht areas cannot be underestimated. It is positive that the new CEO has confirmed his commitment to increasing the number of Údarás na Gaeltachta backed jobs in Gaeltacht regions to 8,000 by 2020. In this regard, his focus will be on renewable energy, sea and seashore related industry and tourism.</p>
          <p eId="para_594"> Since its inception more than 30 years ago, Údarás na Gaeltachta has been creating employment and has introduced various initiatives to support the linguistic, economic, cultural and social development of the Gaeltacht. Through its implementation of the 20 year strategy for the Irish language up to 2030, Údarás na Gaeltachta has an incredibly important role in stopping and reversing the erosion of the Irish language, which has been evidenced in Gaeltacht areas for some time. Tá trí chuspóir ag Údarás na Gaeltachta mar a bhaineann sé le cúrsaí geillegair. Tá tionchar suntasach á imirt ag an eagraíocht i réimse leathan tionscnaimh turasóireachta, iascaireachta, bia, na n-ealaíon agus na lámhcheirdeanna. Tá tacaíocht Údarás na Gaeltachta ag imirt tionchar dá réir ar gheilleagar na Gaeltachta agus na tíre. Ó thaobh chúrsaí cultúrtha, tá an teanga lárnach agus tá ról tábhachtach ag an údarás mar a bhaineann sé leis an teanga. Tá Údarás na Gaeltachta an-tábhachtach freisin ó thaobh tacaíocht a thabhairt do ghrúpaí sóisialta.</p>
          <p eId="para_595"> In reference to the specific proposal by Sinn Féin, the reintroduction of elections for members of the board of the organisation is unnecessary. In 2012, with the introduction of the Gaeltacht Act, such elections were abolished. As part of the wider reform of Údarás na Gaeltachta, the 2012 Act reduced the number of board members from 20 to 12. Five persons may be nominated to the board, four of which are nominated by each of Donegal, Mayo, Galway, and Kerry, with one person to be nominated from Cork, Waterford and Meath on a two-year rotational basis. The remaining seven persons are appointed by the relevant Minister through the utilisation of the Public Appointments Service. Under the 2012 Act, appointments to Údarás na Gaeltachta were brought into line with similar organisations. More than €1 million has been saved since 2012 with these changes. This is further added to by salary savings related to the reduction in the number of board members.</p>
          <p eId="para_596"> The reforms introduced in 2012 have not affected the ability of Údarás na Gaeltachta to undertake its work. The nominations by the local authorities have ensured local representation is the key component of the board. If we compare Údarás na Gaeltachta to similar State organisations, it is clear that a board membership of 12 is more than appropriate for an organisation of its size. As Údarás na Gaeltachta enters a new era under its recently appointed CEO, it is well equipped to promote the Irish language and Gaeltacht areas. The organisation has done great work to date in terms of supporting the creation of jobs in the Gaeltacht area, and the commitments in this regard from the CEO are positive.</p>

Má achtaítear an Bille, déanfar toghcháin dhíreacha Údarás na Gaeltachta a thionól arís, rud nár tharla ó bhí Fianna Fáil in oifig go deireanach. Sa bhliain 2012, chuir an Rialtas a bhí faoi cheannas Fhine Gael deireadh le toghcháin dhíreacha chuig Údarás na Gaeltachta leis an Acht Gaeltachta.

          <p eId="para_599">Agus Sinn Féin. Ceart go leor. Gabhaim mo bhuíochas leis an Seanadóir.</p>
          <p eId="para_600"> Ba ionsaí ar an daonlathas é nuair a cuireadh deireadh le toghcháin dhíreacha. Bhain sin an chumhacht ó mhuintir na Gaeltachta agus thug an iomarca smachta don Aire. Meallann Údarás na Gaeltachta infheistíocht chuig an Ghaeltacht agus baineann sé é seo amach ach réimse dreasachtaí airgeadais agus neamhairgeadais a chur ar fáil d’fhiontair nua agus d’fhiontair atá bunaithe cheana féin sa Ghaeltacht. Soláthróir tábhachtach fostaíochta is ea Údarás na Gaeltachta agus a bhfuil suas le 400 cliant-chuideachta aige a chuireann fostaíocht ar fáil do bhreis is 7,000 duine ar fud na Gaeltachta i réimsí ar nós bith-leigheas, teicneolaíocht, cumarsáid, turasóireacht, próiseáil éisc agus próiseáil bia.</p>
          <p eId="para_601"> Tá sé ar cheann de chuspóirí Fhianna Fáil ó thráth a bhunaithe an Ghaeilge a chur chun cinn mar theanga bheo i measc na ndaoine agus cearta na ndaoine a labhraíonn an teanga a chosaint. Tá an teanga náisiúnta ar sheoda cultúir na tíre seo agus ní féidir cur síos ar an tábhacht chinniúnach atá léi dá réir. Agus 100 bliain caite ó tharla Éirí Amach na Cásca, is ríghéar an gá borradh agus brí a chur an athuair sna hiarrachtaí úsáid na Gaeilge a bhuanú agus a fhorbairt. Seasann Fianna Fáil, go deimhin, leis an Straitéis 20 Bliain don Ghaeilge, faoi mar a thug an páirtí chun cinn agus é sa Rialtas, agus lena chur i bhfeidhm. Thug an páirtí Acht na dTeangacha Oifigiúla 2003 isteach chomh maith faoina ndearnadh bonn reachtaíochta a chur den chéad uair faoi na cearta maidir leis an teanga atá ina ndlúthchuid den Bhunreacht.</p>
          <p eId="para_602"> Is díol trua nach raibh aon dúthracht maidir leis an teanga ná le cearta teanga a chosaint ag rith dáiríre leis an Rialtas roimhe seo faoi cheannas Fhine Gael. Ní mór ceannródaíocht leanúnach agus cistíocht ionas go mbeadh rath ar an Straitéis 20 Bliain don Ghaeilge a thabhairt i bhfeidhm. Anuas air sin, leagadh amach mar ghealltanas i gclár an Rialtais sa bhliain 2011 smaoineamh ar dheireadh a chur leis an nGaeilge éigeantach san ardteistiméireacht, léiriú eile ar mheon Fhine Gael. Baineadh geit asainn agus ba ábhar mór díomá dúinn gur cuireadh laghdú 9% ar mhaoiniú caipitil Údarás na Gaeltachta don bhliain 2017. Chuir an ciorrú sin uafás orainn agus chuir Fianna Fáil feachtas ar bun ag iarraidh cistí breise. D'éirigh linn €1.5 milliún breise a aimsiú d'Údarás na Gaeltachta i rith na bliana 2017 sna Meastacháin Fhorlíontacha. Ní mór don Rialtas breis maoinithe a chur ar fáil d'Údarás na Gaeltachta agus d'Fhoras na Gaeilge in 2018, mar atá á éileamh ag Conradh na Gaeilge, agus ní mór don Rialtas seasamh leis an socrú muiníne agus soláthair.</p>

          <p eId="para_603">Déanaim comhghairdeachas leis an Aire Stáit, an Teachta McHugh. Seo an chéad uair deis a bheith agam comhghairdeachas poiblí a dhéanamh leis sa Teach tar éis dó a bheith ceaptha mar Aire Stáit. Ní hamháin go bhfuil sé freagrach as cúrsaí Gaeilge ach tá sé ina shuí ag bord an Rialtais mar PhríomhAoire an Rialtais. Is mór an buntáiste é sin do chúrsaí Gaeilge mar anois tá glór ag leibhéal ard ag an Ghaeilge agus ag cúrsaí Gaeltachta. Tréaslaím leis faoin obair atá ar bun aige. Tá a fhios agam go bhfuil go leor deontas ceadaithe aige. Cuirim fáilte roimh na deontais sin go léir mar tá siad tábhachtach. Tréaslaím go háirithe leis an Aire Stáit faoin airgead atá ceadaithe aige do ché Machaire Rabhartaigh. Is éacht é sin. Déanaim comhghairdeachas leis faoin obair sin. Is cinnte an rud é go gcuideoidh sé sin le cúrsaí Gaeilge agus Gaeltachta agus, go háirithe, leis na hiascairí agus an pobal ann fosta.</p>
          <p eId="para_604"> Agus muid ag caint ar chúrsaí Gaeilge agus Gaeltachta, tá a fhios agam go bhfuil deacrachtaí ann ach, ag an am céanna, tá go leor buntáistí ann fosta. Caithfimid a bheith ag comhoibriú chomh maith agus is féidir leis na buntáistí sin a bhaint amach agus iad a chur chun cinn. I dtaca leis an Bhille anseo tráthnóna, a dhéanfaidh leasú ar Acht na Gaeltachta, beidh mise ag tabhairt tacú dó. Measaim gur Bille tábhachtach atá ann. Tá cuimhne maith agam ar an lá a raibh an Seanadóir Ó Clochartaigh, mé féin agus daoine eile i mbun díospóireachta - Dinny McGinley a bhí sa chathaoir an lá sin sa Seanad nuair a bhíomar san áit eile - agus muidne i gcoinne na hathruithe a bhí leagtha amach d'Údarás na Gaeltachta de bhrí go rabhadar ag cur deireadh le toghcháin Údarás na Gaeltachta. Cím go mb'fhéidir go mbeidh an tAire Stáít ag úsáid na hargóinte chéanna inniu agus a úsáideadh ag an am agus é sin go raibh sábháil airgid de €500,000 nó mar sin i gceist muna mbeadh toghcháin ann. B'fhéidir go bhfuil sé sin ceart ach b'fhéidir nach bhfuil. Níl a fhios agam na figiúirí. Tá rud amháin cinnte, áfach. Dá mbeadh toghcháin Údarás na Gaeltachta á reáchtáil ar an lá céanna le toghcháin áitiúla, toghchán ginearálta nó le reifreann, ní bheadh aon chostas sa bhreis ar an Stát. Mar sin, ní ghlacaim leis an argóint sin.</p>
          <p eId="para_605"> Címid go bhfuil an bord íslithe ó 20 comhalta go dtí dhá dhuine déag. Glacaim gur sábháil airgid é sin. Tá sé sin cinnte. Thugamar tacaíocht don chéim sin. Níl aon cheist faoi sin. Bhí mise ar an bhord ó 1999 go dtí 2012. Tá obair Údarás na Gaeltachta fite fuaite le todhchaí cheantair Ghaeltachta. Tá sé fíorthábhachtach agus ní hamháin do chúrsaí eacnamaíochta ach le cúrsaí sóisialta agus cultúrtha chomh maith. Tá obair iontach déanta ag Údarás na Gaeltachta. Aontaím go bhfuil ardleibhéal scileanna ag Mike Ó hÉanaigh, atá anois ceaptha ina príomhfheidhmeannach. Measaim go bhfuil na scileanna éagsúla ag Steve Ó Cúláin agus ag foireann Údarás na Gaeltachta leis an Údarás a thiomáint chun tosaigh san am atá amach romhainn. Ní ceist í seo faoi fhoireann an Údaráis, faoin executive nó faoi struchtúr an Údaráis. Is ceist í seo faoin daonlathas taobh istigh den Údarás. Beidh a fhios ag an Aire Stáit é seo fosta, ach nuair atá na daoine tógtha ón pobal aníos, tá dualgas orthu dul ar ais go dtí an pobal le tuairimí a fháil agus a nochtú. Muna bhfuil siad ag déanamh an jab ceart, caithfear amach iad ag an chéad toghchán eile. Tá sé sin tábhachtach. Níl an ceangal sin ann anois. Níl an remit nó an láidreacht - strength - ag na comhaltaí dá bhrí sin agus toisc nach bhfuil siad in ann dul go dtí cruinnithe de chuid an Údaráis agus iomlán ionadaíocht a dhéanamh don phobal ina bhfuil siad ina gcónaí ann. </p>
          <p eId="para_606"> Tá a fhios agam go raibh rí-rá agus conspóid i dtaca le Comhairle Contae Dhún na nGall agus cad a tharla an tseachtain seo. Botún mór é sin. Tá súil agam go mbeidh an chomhairle contae in ann é sin a cheartú. Is droch-chomhartha é nuair nach bhfuil an chomhairle contae atá le cúrsaí toghchánaíochta a thiomáint sa chontae na vótaí acu féin taobh istigh den chamber a chuntais. Is droch-chomhartha amach is amach é sin agus iad ag cur toghcháin ar bun ar fud an chontae. Tá ceist mhór ansin ach sin ceist do lá éigin eile. An pointe ná go haontaím go huile is go hiomlán leis an Bhille. B'fhiú smaoineamh air seo agus toghcháin a reáchtáil, más féidir.</p>
          <p eId="para_607"> Guím gach rath ar an Aire Stáit. Conallach cosúil liom féin é. Obair thábhachtach atá ar bun aige. Tá sé tabhachtach go mbeadh gach píosa oibre déanta le tacaíocht a thabhairt do phobal na Gaeltachta.</p>
          <p eId="para_608">Mar fhocal scoir, mholfainn don Aire Stáit, nuair atá géarchéim tithíochta sa tír agus nuair atá daoine óga i gceantair Ghaeltacht ag iarraidh teach a thógáil dóibh féin, breathnú ar an dheontas tithíochta do dhaoine atá ag iarraidh tithe a thógáil agus a chóiriú suas a thabhairt ar ais arís más féidir. B'fhéidir gur brionglóid é sin ach, ag an am céanna, is fiú breathnú air agus tá a fhios agam go ndéanfaidh an tAire Stáit é sin.</p>

          <from>Senator Grace O'Sullivan<recordedTime time="2017-09-27T17:50:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_609">I welcome the Minister of State. I am from the other end of the country, down in Contae Phort Láirge. I support this Bill. I welcome the work which Senator Trevor Ó Clochartaigh has done on it. The maintenance, good governance and support of Ireland's Gaeltacht regions are of extreme importance. They require reforms to the current structure of Údaras na Gaeltachta. As I see it, there are currently a number of problems with the structure of that body, some of which are addressed in this Bill. It focuses primarily on the composition of the body rather than on its operations. I have a number of concerns around this. First, Údaras na Gaeltachta has a proud record of achievements in terms of delivering employment. It supports the economic, social and cultural basis for the sustainability of the Gaeltacht regions in Ireland. Gaeltacht areas, such as my colleague, Senator Alice-Mary Higgins's native area of Connemara, Galway, and my own area of Ring in Contae Phort Láirge, have been offered lifelines through sectoral employment schemes and targeted State-led economic activity.</p>
          <p eId="para_610"> Occasionally, however, we have seen decisions which have given a wide berth to such activities, such as the sale of the State-run Arramara seaweed harvesting company to a Canadian multinational company in 2014. That sale, which was for an undisclosed sum as per the terms of the sale, was met with much concern at the time, particularly due to the lack of information about the conduct and terms of the sale and the potential effect on those engaged in the hand-harvesting of this important marine resource. Senator Ó Clochartaigh himself spoke out about the issue, as did Senator Conway-Walsh. I suspect Sinn Féin's interest in amending the governance of the body was influenced partly by this affair, but addressing only the composition of the body will not, in itself, correct these issues.</p>
          <p eId="para_611"> I am also concerned that Údaras na Gaeltachta should not be seen as a party political prize, as so many other bodies of this nature are. We saw a fight between Sinn Féin and Fianna Fáil just this week in Donegal over an appointment to Údaras na Gaeltachta. I am not always against party politics but I am not hopeful that it can have a significant positive effect on the good governance of a body such as this. A non-partisan governing structure should be considered if we are to amend the founding statutes of the authority. That is of course not a reason not to support the Bill before us.</p>
          <p eId="para_612"> Lastly, I have a remaining concern about the proportions of seat increases on the board proposed by this Bill. I am unclear as to why Senator Alice-Mary Higgins's Galway Gaeltacht region, as fine as it is, should receive such a disproportionate increase over all the other regions in Ireland. That it is the largest area involved and deserves the most representation goes without saying, but to have six representatives when An Rinn in County Waterford, for example, has only one seems disproportionate. Nonetheless, I commend the Senators' work on this Bill and I look forward to it progressing to Committee Stage.</p>

          <from>Senator Rose Conway-Walsh<recordedTime time="2017-09-27T17:50:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_613">Cuirim fáilte roimh an Aire Stáit. Tá brón orm ach níl ach beagán Gaeilge agam - níl me líofa - so I will address the Minister of State as Béarla. I just want to say a couple of things. My colleagues have done all the heavy lifting on this Bill. Last week we had to make a decision as to what our priority for our Private Members' time would be, bearing in mind that we only have two slots before Christmas. We felt that the importance of this Bill and progressing it through the Oireachtas took precedence over the many, many urgent issues which need to be addressed. The reason for that is that we know people in the Gaeltacht areas have been left behind. I myself live in a Gaeltacht area, as do some of my colleagues. It is hugely important that this Bill is supported through the Oireachtas. The situation in areas such as Mayo, where there is a huge geographical spread, means that having county councillors decide who will represent the Gaeltacht areas is not the best way forward. We have seen that in terms of the reduction in investment into the Gaeltacht areas and the different occurrences over the year. People within Gaeltacht areas deserve to have somebody to represent them.</p>
          <p eId="para_614"> I take on board my colleague's remarks in terms of the board being party-political. I believe the people in the Gaeltacht areas will decide cross-party and vote cross-party because they know the urgency of addressing their needs. That is why we need to reinstate direct elections for people living within the Gaeltacht so that they can choose who they want to represent them, regardless of what party, if any, they are from. They can then be part of the decision-making process and hold their representatives accountable. </p>
          <p eId="para_615"> The Mayo Gaeltacht is even more isolated than others. Employment and basic services are a necessity. I hear time and time again - I heard it from a Minister earlier today - that we are now in full employment. Overall Government policy is aimed and formed on the basis that we are living in a situation of full employment, but we are not. There are areas in Mayo and the Mayo Gaeltacht with unemployment rates of 30% or more. That is notwithstanding the huge emigration which has also savaged these areas. In fairness to the Minister of State, he has been to all of these areas and has shown a keen interest in what is happening there. He will have seen for himself that, looking around, one sees no young people. Senator Ó Clochartaigh and myself will soon be the youngest people in the Gaeltacht areas in which we live. That is not a good sign. They young people are not there anymore because the career prospects which need to be there are not. There is also the issue of isolation. Those young people cannot live in the Gaeltacht areas and are therefore forced to emigrate. They cannot have their families there and elderly people are left living on their own. </p>
          <p eId="para_616"> The Minister of State will know of the centres which Údaras na Gaeltachta has in Gaeltacht areas, such as in Aughleam, Tourmakeady and Carratigue in my own constituency, or Comhlacht Forbartha Áitiúil Acla. He will know of the good work which they do in these community projects, as well as in servicing the language need for the employment base in those areas. He will also know of the difficulties with Leader programme funding and the lack of feedback to the údaras. This is leading to more unemployment. This feedback needs to get back to Údarás na Gaeltachta. That is why a direct voice from the Mayo Gaeltacht is needed. I am very concerned that, in a few months time, Mayo will be left without any representative at all. </p>
          <p eId="para_617"> In respect of the stipulation that no one can serve more than two terms on the board of Údaras na Gaeltachta, can the Minister of State explain whether anybody who has been on the board for a number of terms, including before the changes were made, is excluded from going forward again? </p>
          <p eId="para_618"> The Minister of State will also know that the language plan currently being put together for Mayo needs adequate funding. The plans have been published, but not enough people are employed to implement them. The Mayo Gaeltacht area is geographically spaced out and remote and it is vital that these resources are given. We have many lessons to learn from the North in terms of the Líofa programme and the many innovative things which can be done in the Gaeltacht areas if they are resourced properly. I know my colleagues, Deputy Tóibín and Senator Ó Clochartaigh, are currently on a tour of the Gaeltacht areas.</p>
          <p eId="para_619">They, as well as I, consistently hear that employment and, therefore, Údarás na Gaeltachta are the most important factors in the viability of the Gaeltacht. I therefore ask the Minister of State to resource Údarás na Gaeltachta properly and to reintroduce the democratic process into it. Let people in the Gaeltacht area decide who they want to represent them and let us have viability and vibrancy within the Gaeltacht areas again to enhance and add value to the wonderful volunteer work that is being done in Gaeltacht communities. These are resourceful communities and we are very proud of them. They deserve to have priority, which is why we selected this Bill for Private Members' business tonight, that is, it is so hugely important.</p>

          <from>Minister of State at the Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht (Deputy Joe McHugh)<recordedTime time="2017-09-27T18:00:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_620">Gabhaim mo bhuíochas le Seanadóirí fá choinne an seans labhairt leo inniu. Tá lúcháir mhór ormsa, mar Aire Stáit don Ghaeilge agus don Ghaeltacht, a bheith anseo inniu agus táim buíoch as ucht an deis atá tugtha dom a bheith páirteach sa díospóireacht ar Bhille um Údarás na Gaeltachta (Leasú) 2017. Gabhaim buíochas leis na Seanadóirí a chur an Bille seo ar an gclár. Táim cinnte de go mbeidh plé stuama agus tairbheach faoin ábhar. Is dóigh gur fiú léargas gairid a thabhairt ar ról agus ar thábhacht Údarás na Gaeltachta mar a bhaineann sé le leas na Gaeltachta agus na Gaeilge. Is fiú chomh maith céanna léargas a thabhairt ar fhorálacha Acht na Gaeltachta 2012 mar a bhaineann le bord an údaráis. Ina dhiaidh sin, beidh deis ag comhaltaí an Tí seo a gcuid tuairimí a nochtadh agus plé a dhéanamh faoin ábhar.</p>
          <p eId="para_621"> Mar a bhaineann sé le ról an údaráis, níl aon amhras ach go bhfuil obair thábhachtach déanta ag an údarás anuas tríd na blianta ar mhaithe le saol eacnamaíochta, cultúrtha agus sóisialta phobal na Gaeltachta a chur chun cinn. De thoradh na hoibre atá ar bun ag foireann dhíograiseach an údaráis ar son na Gaeltachta ar bhonn leanúnach, tá deiseanna fostaíochta agus fiontraíochta cothaithe agus cruthaithe ag an údarás i gceantair nach bhfaigheadh na deiseanna sin murach gur ann don eagraíocht. Is cinnte gur éirigh leis an eagraíocht infheistíocht shubstaintiúil a mhealladh chun na Gaeltachta ón uair a bunaíodh í. Ní gá a rá go bhfuil an obair atá déanta agus idir lámha ag an eagraíocht thar a bheith tábhachtach chun pobal bisiúil na Gaeltachta a chaomhnú agus a chothú.</p>
          <p eId="para_622"> Is ábhar sásaimh é, mar shampla, gur éirigh leis an údarás 559 post a chruthú anuraidh agus go raibh 80 duine breise fostaithe i gcuideachtaí Údarás na Gaeltachta ag deireadh na bliana 2016 thar an méid a bhí fostaithe sa bhliain roimhe sin. Bhí 7,963 post i gcliant-chuideachtaí an údaráis ag deireadh na bliana. Maidir le tacaíocht mo Roinne don údarás, ní miste dom a lua go bhfuil allúntas breise ar fiú €1.5 milliún in airgead caipitil curtha ar fáil agam don údarás i mbliana, chomh maith le €2.4 milliún anuraidh. Fágann sé sin go bhfuil €3.9 milliún sa bhreis ar an mbunlíne curtha ar fáil don údarás thar dhá bhliain anuas, idir 2016 agus 2017. Táim sásta go gcuirfidh an soláthar breise seo ar chumas an údaráis tuilleadh chun cinn a dhéanamh ar roinnt tograí caipitil atá ar na bacán acu le tamall, rud a chiallaíonn go gcuirfear ar a chumas na poist atá cruthaithe ann cheana féin a chosaint tuilleadh chomh maith le breis fostaíochta a chruthú. Tuigim go bhfuil sé mar aidhm ag an údarás 500 post nua a chruthú sa Ghaeltacht sa bhliain reatha.</p>
          <p eId="para_623"> Maidir leis an Straitéis 20 Bliain don Ghaeilge, tá cur i bhfeidhm an phróisis pleanála teanga faoi Acht na Gaeltachta 2012 i gcroílár chur i bhfeidhm na straitéise mar a bhaineann sé leis an nGaeltacht. Tá dul chun cinn suntasach déanta ag an údarás maidir le cur i bhfeidhm an phróisis sin go dtí seo, i gcomhréir lena gcuid freagrachtaí ina leith, mar a leagtar amach iad faoin Acht. Ag an bpointe seo, tá an próiseas chun pleananna teanga a ullmhú ag leibhéal an phobail tosaithe i ngach aon cheann den 26 limistéar pleanála teanga Ghaeltachta atá leagtha amach faoin bpróiseas agus obair idir lámha ag an údarás chomh maith chun go dtosóidh an próiseas sa Chlochán Liath agus i mBéal an Mhuirthead chomh luath is féidir. Ó thosaigh cur i bhfeidhm an phróisis, tá allúntas airgid curtha ar fáil go bliantúil ag mo Roinn don údarás chun cúram a dhéanamh de agus tá an t-allúntas sin ardaithe gach bliain as a chéile. Mar a bhaineann sé leis an mbliain reatha, tá allúntas ar fiú €735,000 curtha ar fáil chun cabhrú le feidhmiú rathúil an phróisis.</p>
          <p eId="para_624"> Ba mhaith liom díriú anois ar Acht na Gaeltachta agus an dá chuspóir go príomha a bhí ann lena achtú cúig bliana ó shin. Ba iad na cuspóirí sin ná bunús reachtúil a thabhairt do phróiseas pleanála teanga, a bhfuil tagairt déanta agam dó, ar mhaithe le tacú tuilleadh leis an Ghaeilge mar theanga phobail agus teaghlaigh sa Ghaeltacht. Ba é an dara cuspóir ná leasú a dhéanamh ar an chaoi a roghnaítear comhaltaí bhord an údaráis chomh maith le leasú a dhéanamh ar chomdhéanamh an bhoird ó thaobh an líon comhaltaí a bheadh air. Mar cheann de phríomh-leasuithe a rinneadh san Acht mar a bhaineann le bord an údaráis, cuireadh deireadh leis an gceanglas i ndáil le toghcháin phoiblí dhíreacha chun an bhoird. Chomh maith leis sin, rinneadh laghdú ar an líon comhaltaí ar an mbord ó 20 comhalta do dtí dhá dhuine dhéag. Faoin Acht, ceapann an tAire seachtar de na comhaltaí seo, an cathaoirleach san áireamh. Ina theannta sin, ainmníonn na húdaráis áitiúla, a bhfuil ceantar Gaeltachta ina ndlínse faoi seach, an cúigear comhalta eile don Aire i gcomhair ceapacháin. I gcás comhaltaí a ainmnítear don bhord i gcás Chomhairle Contae na Mí, Phort Láirge agus Chorcaí - áit a bhfuil na ceantair is lú Gaeltachta i gceist - is tréimhse dhá bhliain a bhíonn ag na comhaltaí sin faoi seach. Is é an tAire Stáit ag an am, a chinn, trí chrannchur in 2012, an t-ord ina gceaptar comhaltaí thar ceann na n-údarás áitiúil sin. I gcás nach féidir le comhairle contae duine dá comhaltaí tofa a ainmniú ar chúiseanna neamh-infhaighteachta nó mí-oiriúnachta, féadfaidh an chomhairle contae sin duine seachas ionadaí tofa a ainmniú. Ní gá go mbeadh an té a cheapfaí ina chónaí sa Ghaeltacht. I mbliana, ag deireadh mí an Mheithimh, bhí 86 fostaí ag an údarás agus, i mo thuairimse, beidh an bord níos éifeachtaí, níos teinne agus níos éifeachtúla.</p>
          <p eId="para_625"> Is mian liom a chur in iúl don Teach seo go bhfuil cinneadh glactha ag an Rialtas cur i gcoinne an Bhille atá os comhair an Tí seo inniu ar roinnt cúiseanna. Ar an gcéad dul síos, tagann deireadh le tréimhse an bhoird reatha ar 19 Mí na Samhna 2017. Mar a mbeifí ag súil leis, dá réir, tá tús curtha ag mo Roinn cheana féin leis an phróiseas chun comhaltaí a cheapadh don bhord nua. Mar chuid den obair ullmhúcháin sin, seoladh litreacha chuig comhairlí contae na Gaillimhe, Dhún na nGall, Mhaigh Eo agus Chiarraí faoi seach ar 21 Iúil 2017 ag tabhairt cuireadh dóibh duine a ainmniú chun a bheith ceaptha ag an Aire ar bhord nua an údaráis. Mar atá a fhios ag na Seanadóirí ó pháirtithe Shinn Féin agus Fhianna Fáil, bhí an toghchán nó comórtas poiblí sin i nDún na nGall an Luan a chuaigh thart. Tuigtear dom, go deimhin, go bhfuil comhairlí contae tar éis ainmniúcháin dá gcuid a sheoladh chuig mo Roinn cheana féin.</p>
          <p eId="para_626"> Ina theannta sin agus mar a bhaineann sé leis an chaoi a roghnófar an chuid eile den bhord, tá obair idir lámha ag ma Roinn i gcomhar leis an tSeirbhís um Cheapacháin Phoiblí maidir leis an seachtar comhalta atá le ceapadh ag an Aire. Faoin socrú seo, fógrófar go poiblí, i gcomhréir leis na cleachtais reatha atá i bhfeidhm maidir lena leithéid, go bhfuil bord úr le roghnú. Tabharfar an deis go poiblí d’éinne gur spéis leo a bheith san áireamh chun críche ceapacháin chuig an mbord. Tá bailchríoch á cur faoi láthair ar an obair seo i dtreo a bheith in ann iarratais a lorg go poiblí gan mhoill.</p>
          <p eId="para_627"> Mar thoradh ar an laghdú ar líon na gcomhaltaí ar an mbord ó scór duine go dtí dhá dhuine dhéag, chomh maith le cur i bhfeidhm an phrionsabail duine amháin, tuarastal amháin de chuid na Roinne Caiteachais Phoiblí agus Athchóirithe a tháinig chun cinn in 2011, tá sábháil airgid ar fiú tuairim is €180,000 á giniúint don Státchiste in aghaidh na bliana. Lena chois sin, ós rud é nach bhfuil toghcháin phoiblí á reáchtáil a thuilleadh gach cúig bliana, tá an costas a bhíodh bainteach leo, ar fiú thart ar leath mhilliún €500,000, á sheachaint. Fágann sé seo go bhfuil caiteachas de tuairim agus €1.9 milliún d’airgead an cháin-íocaitheora sábháilte ó tháinig an tAcht i bhfeidhm in 2012. Is beag duine a d’easaontódh liom nuair a deirim go bhféadfaí an t-airgead seo a chaitheamh ar bhealach a rachadh níos mó chun sochair do phobal na Gaeltachta seachas trí thoghcháin a reáchtáil. Ní léir dom gur imir an laghdú a rinneadh ar líon an bhoird ó 20 go dhá chloigeann déag aon droch-thionchar ar chumas an bhoird iad féin chun a gcuid oibre a dhéanamh go héifeachtach ar leasa an údaráis ó tháinig an socrú i bhfeidhm. Ní léir dom ach an oiread gur chuir an socrú nua isteach ar ábaltacht na heagraíochta iad féin, a cuid dualgas ar fad a chomhlíonadh go héifeachtúil agus go héifeachtach.</p>
          <p eId="para_628">Ní miste a rá go léiríonn taighde idirnáisiúnta agus taithí ón iliomad boird Stáit in Éirinn go gcuidíonn sé le bord a bheith ag feidhmiú ar bhonn éifeachtach má bhíonn líon na gcomhaltaí réasúnta teoranta - idir deichniúr agus 12, nó mar sin.</p>
          <p eId="para_629"> Cinntíonn ceapacháin na seachtar comhalta a thagann tríd an tSeirbhís um Cheapacháin Phoiblí, chomh fada is féidir, go bhfuil daoine cumasacha le saineolas agus scileanna cuí i réimsí gnímh an údaráis á gceapadh ag an Aire ar an bhord. Ba mhaith liom a lua fosta go mbíonn ar gach duine a cheapfar a dheimhniú don Aire go bhfuil taithí acu, nó go bhfuil cumas léirithe acu, i ndáil le nithe a bhaineann le feidhmeanna an údaráis, lena n-áirítear an cumas chun a bhfeidhmeanna a chomhlíonadh go héifeachtach i nGaeilge, rud atá thar a bheith tábhachtach.</p>
          <p eId="para_630"> Sa chur chuige seo uile, tá bunphrionsbal an daonlathais fite fuaite tríd an bpróiseas sa mhéid is gur féidir le húdaráis áitiúla, a bhfuil limistéir Ghaeltachta faoina gcúram, líon áirithe comhaltaí a ainmniú don bhord. Lena chois sin, faoi mar atá léirithe agam, tá an deis ag saoránaigh na tíre a bhfuil an spéis agus na scileanna acu, in ann iad féin a chur chun tosaigh chun a bheith san áireamh chun críche ceapacháin don bhord, rud a thagann go hiomlán le bunús an daonlathais agus a luíonn isteach leis na dea-chleachtais reatha mar a bhaineann siad le ceapacháin do bhoird Stáit.</p>
          <p eId="para_631"> Dá mbeimis chun dul ar ais chuig seanchóras na dtoghchán, a bhí amscaí agus costasach, agus líon na gcomhaltaí le hardú, d’fhágfadh seo go mbeadh ar an údarás na costais reatha bhreise a sheasamh as an soláthar atá acu agus, mar thoradh ar sin, bheadh gá le ciorrú a dhéanamh ar an soláthar atá in úsáid ag an údarás do sheirbhísí tús-líne, seirbhísí atá i bhfad níos tábhachtaí ná aon cheo eile mar a aithneoidh an Teach. Anuas air sin, bheadh ar mo Roinn a dhéanamh amhlaidh maidir le costas na dtoghchán ag am a bhfuil éilimh ar leith ag teacht ó phobail na Gaeltachta ar mhaoiniú ó mo Roinn.</p>
          <p eId="para_632"> Táim sásta mar sin go bhfuil an chaoi ina roghnaítear an bord faoi láthair sásúil agus go dtagann sé le gach dea-chleachtais mar a bhaineann sé le ceapacháin boird Stáit, go bhfuil an cur chuige reatha ag imirt dea-thionchar ar fheidhmíocht an bhoird agus ar ábaltacht na heagraíochta a cuid dualgais ar fad a chomhlíonadh go sásúil, go bhfuil comhdhéanamh an bhoird ó thaobh an líon comhaltaí air comhréireach le feidhm agus toirt na heagraíochta, agus go bhfuil an cur chuige reatha éifeachtach ó thaobh chostais de.</p>
          <p eId="para_633"> Gabhaim buíochas leis an Teach as an deis chun páirt a ghlacadh sa phlé maidir leis an mBille seo agus go bhfuil léargas tugtha agam faoin gcúis go bhfuil an Rialtas i gcoinne an leasaithe ar Acht na Gaeltachta atá faoi chaibidil tráthnóna.</p>

          <p eId="para_638">In welcoming an tAire Stáit ba mhaith liom cúpla focal a rá mar gheall ar an ábhar tábhachtach seo. In wanting to speak I am cognisant of the fact there are far more eminent people from the Gaeltacht present, but as someone who has a Gaeltacht region in his county, who recognises the importance of our language and who tries to use it uaireanta sa Teach seo, agus tá díomá agus brón orm nach bhfuil Gaeilge líofa agam, I recognise the great challenges we face as an island nation with our own distinct language and culture. Recently I took umbrage at the decision of Bank of Ireland regarding its new ATMs. I was struck both by the number of people who made contact to criticise the decision because of the connection they have with the language, particularly through their children going to Gaelscoileanna, but also by the number of people who thought it was not an important topic and that we should not be discussing it.</p>
          <p eId="para_639"> In saying that, this motion is welcome. I would look at what has happened since we changed the structure of Údarás na Gaeltachta. Employment in Gaeltacht companies is at a seven-year high. We have seen investment and business growth and development. If one takes 2016, for example, we saw the creation of 550 new jobs. Senator Ó Clochartaigh and I have in common that there has been net growth in the Gaeltacht regions of our counties, Cork and Galway. I know it is not just about creating employment but about making a strategic decision. If we are to be honest, the current structure of the board does not constitute a democratic deficit. There are elected positions and there is a rotation between Cork and Waterford. Seven people are appointed. I am certainly of the view that our Gaeltacht regions benefit from these strategic appointments. If we look at the way in which we have changed the summer colleges sa Ghaeltacht and the bean an tí model, there are now more people going to the Gaeltacht over the summer to learn Irish because of the importance of our language.</p>
          <p eId="para_640"> I am not saying that Senator Ó Clochartaigh is doing this with his Bill, and I welcome the opportunity to speak on it, but I would be afraid that we are going to politicise the board and our Gaeltacht structures again. I spoke to Senator Ó Donnghaile on the Order of Business yesterday about the importance of the Irish language in the North of our country. The Minister, Deputy Coveney, has been very strident in this regard, as has the Government. The Minister of State, Deputy McHugh, in coming back to the Department, brings back a learned example of what many of us experience with our language. I would hate for us to dilute our language and our culture but I would worry that the unintended consequence of this Bill would be to mitigate what we are trying to do, which is to promote investment and jobs and make our Gaeltachtaí living areas where people want to live and raise their families. If one looks at what is happening in many parts of the Gaeltachtaí, that is not happening. I complimented Senator Grace O'Sullivan this morning on the Order of Business. The small act of Senator O'Sullivan sending a postcard to all of us over the summer epitomised the importance of our post offices as hubs of our communities. Similarly, our language is important in many parts of our country.</p>
          <p eId="para_641"> I was very proud that the Minister of State, Deputy McHugh, recently announced that he was designating Cork city as a Gaeltacht area in terms of being able to promote the language because there are people in pockets of the city of Cork and in other parts of our country who want to be able to speak as Gaeilge. I am one of them. I probably use more Irish abroad than I do at home because my partner has fluent Irish and we communicate through Irish because it is our language. It is about promoting the culture of our language. It is a badge of pride that we have our own distinct language and culture. Senator Warfield can do that if he likes.</p>

          <p eId="para_643">I will finish on this as I am digressing a bit, but the caretaker in the John F. Kennedy Presidential Library and Museum in Boston is from the heart of Dingle and he was very impressed that there were two guys speaking as Gaeilge in the museum. He was thrilled. Similarly, we met a woman on the underground, the T, in Boston, who was delighted that there was people from her own homeland speaking as Gaeilge. Tá díomá orm nach bhfuil Gaeilge flúirseach agam. I would encourage us to have a further debate on this rather than divide the House and put it to a vote because I believe we should not do that. I recognise Senator Ó Clochartaigh's right to do so.</p>
          <p eId="para_644"> This is an important debate. It is about the structure, and about how we can locate our Gaeltachtaí strategically within the heart of Government. I believe we have done so, and what an iar-Aire, an Teachta McGinley, did has been a success. The proof is in the number of people now back at work in our Gaeltacht regions.</p>

          <p eId="para_645">Is dóigh liom go bhfeádfainn cur síos ar fhreagra an Rialtais ná go bhfeiceann sé an costas atá leis an toghchán ach ní bhfeiceann sé an luach. Sílim gur thagair an Seanadóir Ó Domhnaill don daonlathas agus do chearta daonlathacha ó thaobh daoine agus na cinntí atá á ndéanamh. Tá na staitisticí lom go leor. Rinne Donncha Ó hEallaithe tráchtaireacht agus anailís ar na figiúirí daonáirimh ar son <i>tuairisc.ie</i> tamaillín ó shin. Dúirt sé, agus é ag breathnú air ó thaobh na príomhcheantair Ghaeltachta, go bhfuil, "laghdú suntasach tagtha ar dhaonra chuid de na ceantair Ghaeltachta i gCatagóir A, na ceantair is láidre ó thaobh úsáid na Gaeilge sa tír – Iorras Aithneach (-8.7%), Ceantar na nOileán (-6.4%) agus Camas/Ros Muc (-4.9) i gConamara agus, i nDún na nGall, an ceantar láidir Gaeltachta thart ar Ghaoth Dobhair agus Gort an Choirce ar a dtugaim Iarthuaisceart Dhún na nGall (-6.6%)".</p>
          <p eId="para_646">Cinnte go bhfuil meath mór daonra sna ceantair Ghaeltachta. Tá go leor daoine imithe ón aois-ghrúpa 18 go 40. Teastaíonn a leithéidí Údarás na Gaeltachta atá maoinithe go maith agus atá ag feidhmiú mar is ceart le fostaíocht a chruthú don aois-ghrúpa áirithe sin. </p>
          <p eId="para_647"> Feiceann muid arís na ciorruithe agus cuid de na botúin atá déanta ó thaobh an infheistíocht a bhí á dhéanamh. Mar shampla, in earnáil an bhia in 2006, bhí €7.7 milliún á infheistiú. Tá sé sin laghdaithe in 2015 go dtí €1 milliún. Sin laghdú de 87%. Bhí €3.059 milliún á chaitheamh ar acmhainní nádúrtha ach bhí sé sin síos go dtí €83,000 in 2015. Sin laghdú de 97% san infheistíocht san earnáil sin. B'fhéidir ceann de na hearnálacha is mó a bhfuilimid ag brath air sa Ghaeltacht ná seirbhísí. Bhí infheistíocht de €12.2 milliún á dhéanamh in 2006 ach bhí sé sin síos go dtí €3.2 milliún in 2015. Sin laghdú de 75%. Teastaíonn an infheistíocht den chineál sin uainn sna réimsí sin leis na daoine sin a choinneáil sa gceantar.</p>
          <p eId="para_648"> Caithfimid smaoineamh ar an acmhainn daonna. Fáiltím roimh an gceapachán nua mar phríomhfheidhmeannach ar Údarás na Gaeltachta agus guím gach rath ar Míchéal Ó hÉanaigh. Táimid buíoch de Stiofán Ó Cúláin atá imithe as oifig agus de chuile dhuine atá ag obair san Údarás. Tá aithne phearsanta agam ar go leor leor daoine ann. Tá a lámha ceangailte ar go leor bealaí, áfach. Má bhreathnaíonn muid siar ar chuid de na cláir a bhí ag feidhmiú in 2016 i gcomparáid le 2015, bhí 270 duine páirteach sa gclár foghlamtha fadsaoil ach níl tagairt dó i dtuairisc 2015. Bhí 13 duine ag staideanna éagsúla den scéim printíseach ag an am sin ach 68 duine atá i gceist in 2015. Bhí 55 duine agus 22 fochéimí ar thaithí oibre mar pháirt den scéim forbartha bainistíochta ach 30 duine atá páirteach ann in 2015. Maidir leis an scéim do bhainisteoirí cúnta a bhí ag feidhmiú faoi scáth na gcomharchumann, bhí dhá dhuine déag páirteach agus cúigear acu le comharchumainn oileánda, ach tá an scéim sin imithe in 2015. Bhí seirbhísí scoileanna ar nós gairmthreoir, scileanna staidéir, ceardlanna físeáin, comórtas fiontraíochta ar bun. Ó thaobh na hollscolaíochta de, tá gearradh siar mór déanta ansin. Bhí ocht gcúrsa lánaimseartha agus 6 chúrsa páirtaimseartha le 93 duine lánaimseartha i gceist ach tá sé sin gearrtha siar. Tá na haerstráicí díolta. Chonaic muid an raic a bhí ansin agus na deacrachtaí a bhain le conradh Aer Árann dá bharr. Bhíodh €250,000 ag baint leis an togra Gníomh don Ghaeltacht a thug an-mhisneach agus an-tacaíocht do na heagraíochtaí pobail ach tá sé sin imithe. Sin €250,000 eile imithe ó na ceantair sin. Ba fhoinsí airgid ansin uilig a bhí thar a bheith tábhachtach agus thar a bheith luachmhar. Tá gá leis na hacmhainní sin a thabhairt ar ais. </p>
          <p eId="para_649"> Ní ghlacaim leis na hargóintí maidir leis an gcostas a bheadh ar an toghchán. Dá bhféadfaí é a reáchtáil an t-am céanna leis na toghcháin áitiúla, bheadh sé indéanta. </p>
          <p eId="para_650"> Ó thaobh chás na gcomhairleoirí contae, cén fáth gur chóir go mbeadh duine atá lonnaithe, mar shampla, i gContae na Gaillimhe, atá in ann dul go Baile Átha Cliath níos sciobtha ná tá siad in ann dul siar go Carna, b'fhéidir go bhfuil eolas níos fearr aige nó aici ar Bhaile Átha Cliath, cén fáth go mbeadh sé nó sí ag roghnú duine le dul ar bhord Údarás na Gaeltachta. Go minic sna comhairlí contae, níl ach duine nó dhó le Gaeilge gur féidir a roghnú. Cuireann siad an "token Gaeilgeoir" ar bhord Údarás na Gaeltachta seachas duine ón bpobal atá gníomhach sa bpobal a roghnaíodh ón bpobal. </p>
          <p eId="para_651"> Beidh muid ag brú an rud seo chun vóta. Tá sé fíorthábhachtach. Fáiltim roimh an Aire Stáit eile. Tá mé ag ceapadh go mb'fhéidir go dtacódh an tAire Stáit eile dá bhfaigheadh sé deis cainte ar an ábhar seo leis an mBille atá muid ag cur chun cinn. Tá muid buíoch de na dreamanna eile atá ag tabhairt tacaíochta dúinn ar an ábhar seo. Nuair a thiocfaidh sé chun vóta, beidh muid ag iarraidh an vóta a bhrú chun cinn. Tá súil agam go dtiocfaidh muid tríd na staideanna eile, má éiríonn linn, chomh luath agus is féidir. Le tacaíocht traspháirtí, féadfadh muid é seo a chur i bhfeidhm. </p>
          <p eId="para_652"> Bhí an tAire Stáit ag labhairt faoi na hainmniúcháin a bheith tagtha isteach. Tá Comhairle Chontae na Gaillimhe iontach sciobtha leis an gcomhfhreagras. Bhí neart amanna eile, áfach, a raibh Airí Stáit agus na litreacha céanna suite ar an mbord ar feadh míonna sular cheap siad aon duine. Níl aon duine ceaptha ar bhord Údarás na Gaeltachta go fóill. Níl aon deifir leis. Dá gcuirfí an reachtaíocht tríd go sciobtha, d'fhéadfadh muid dul leis na toghcháin arís an bhliain seo chugainn agus síneadh a chur leis an tréimhse atá ar an mbord reatha.</p>

          <p eId="para_699">This is a large and very important group of amendments but the majority are of a technical nature. As all Members know, the Bill was published in December 2016. Two months later, in February 2017, the Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Act 2017 was enacted. Among the wide-ranging provisions introduced in the Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Act were changes to the Criminal Evidence Act 1992 which overlapped with changes to that Act that are contained in this Bill. The purpose of most of the amendments in this group is to update the text of the Bill to reflect the changes introduced in the Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Act 2017. The substance of the changes introduced in that Act and the substance of the amendments in this Bill as passed by Dáil Éireann are retained.</p>
          <p eId="para_700"> A small number of amendments in this group will make a material change to the provisions concerned. The language relating to the use of screens to prevent a witness seeing an accused while giving evidence is being changed to refer to a screen being placed in an appropriate location in the courtroom rather than the witness giving evidence from behind the screen. This will allow the screen to be placed either in front of the witness or the accused person depending on the layout of the courtroom, thus ensuring the provision is operable in different settings.</p>
          <p eId="para_701"> Also to ensure the greatest flexibility in the operation of the provision, the requirement that the accused be able to see the witness is being removed by amendment No. 29. The provision contains an "interests of justice" text to ensure that it may not be used if it would unfairly disadvantage the accused.</p>
          <p eId="para_702"> Amendment No. 31 replaces the new section 14AA which sets out the matters the court has to have regard to in deciding whether a victim should give evidence via a live television link, with the use of a screen or through an intermediary. The amendment will simplify the provision because concerns were raised that the current wording could require the prosecutor to prove elements of the case prior to the special measures being implemented. This is not the intention and would undermine the purpose of the special measures. The wording proposed in the amendment mirrors provisions currently in the Criminal Procedure Act 1967 and will address these concerns.</p>
          <p eId="para_703"> One final change to the substance of section 29 is made by amendment No. 37. The amendment concerns section 19 of the Criminal Evidence Act which provides that a person with a mental disorder shall be entitled to the same protections as a child under various provisions of the Criminal Evidence Act. It will limit the sections under which a person with a mental disorder is treated as a child to those sections where no additional protections are available to adults. If an adult can avail of a protection on the basis of his or her personal needs and characteristics then an adult with a mental disorder will be treated in the same way as any other adult and the protection will be assessed having regard to his or her personal capacity and needs.</p>

          <p eId="para_704">My colleague, Senator Kelleher, had hoped to speak on this area and I will be very brief. Some concern has been expressed. Most of the amendments are very practical and make a lot of sense and I am very happy to support them. However, perhaps the Minister of State could elaborate on the change in language in amendment No. 31 because concerns have been expressed that there may have been stronger language in the original formulation of the Bill. I ask that he explain the rationale for the changes in amendment No. 31, which deals with matters that should be taken into account. Could he very briefly say what the concern was in that regard?</p>

          <p eId="para_705">It is about a victim giving evidence through a live television link. That is the first subsection, as the Senator can see. Subsections (b) and (c) state: "whether, under section 14(1A), the interests of justice require that it direct that questions be put to the victim through an intermediary, or (c) whether, under section 14A(2), the interests of justice require that it direct that a screen or other similar device be positioned, in an appropriate place, so as to prevent the victim from seeing the accused when giving evidence". It is self-explanatory in many ways. It continues: "shall have regard to the need to protect the victim from secondary and repeat victimisation, intimidation or retaliation, taking into account - (i) the nature and circumstances of the case, and (ii) the personal characteristics of the victim.”,”. It is self-explanatory. It is has to do with natural justice and protecting the victim from secondary and repeat victimisation, intimidation or retaliation through the use of screens or video links.</p>

          <p eId="para_706">That is fine and it is a positive amendment. However, based on feedback Senator Kelleher and I received I understood that the original formulation was perhaps a little better. In the absence of Senator Kelleher, I will not oppose the amendment.</p>

          <p eId="para_714">I thank the Senators for this amendment. Since 1992 it has been possible to use intermediaries in certain court proceedings to facilitate the questioning of witnesses. This Bill will extend that possibility, subject to the decision of the court, to all child victims. However, the use of intermediaries has not become common practice in the years since the statute was enacted. While there is no established current practice and no community of practitioners with whom to engage in developing best practice, I would be reluctant to expand the use of intermediaries to include not just questions but also the responses of witnesses, particularly as this issue is quite complex, given it seeks to balance the rights of a victim to give evidence and an accused's right to a fair trial.</p>
          <p eId="para_715">It is my hope that an extension of the scope for intermediaries in this Bill will spark renewed interest in this service. Once some practice develops, I would be willing to revisit the expansion of the functions of intermediaries in the manner proposed here. I suggest that any such expansion of functions would be best examined in the wider context of the development of best practice guidance for such services.</p>
          <p eId="para_716"> On a technical note, the amendment seeks to expand the functions of intermediaries with regard to non-relevant offences but has not made a corresponding amendment with regard to relevant offences. These offences are more serious under the existing Criminal Evidence Act and include sexual violence or threatening offences and human trafficking offences. It appears to me to be inappropriate to expand the functions of intermediaries only for those offences where they are least likely to be of value. I hope that helps colleagues.</p>

          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_730"><b>36.</b> Within 60 days after the end of each calendar year those responsible for the training within An Garda Síochána, the Ombudsman Commission, the Director of Public Prosecutions, the Irish Prison Service, the Court Service, the Bar of Ireland, the Law Society of Ireland and the Judicial Studies Institute shall publish in written form a report of any general and specialist training which has been provided in accordance with the provisions of this Act and Directive 2012/29/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 25 October 2012 establishing minimum standards on the rights, support and protection of victims of crime, and replacing Council Framework Decision 2001/220/JHA.”.</p>
          <p eId="para_731">The rationale for this amendment is that it is vital that full implementation of the training obligations as set out in Article 25 of the EU Directive 2012/29, establishing minimum standards on the rights, support and protection of victims of crime, should be monitored.

          <p eId="para_732">I support Senator Boyhan. Training so that the practice that we have matches the policy is crucial. We have already heard today about how sometimes something in policy seems fine and clear if one reads it but that the experience victims have is that the interpretation and understanding of those who enact that policy is perhaps not what it could be and should be. All of those involved should be trained so they understand, for example, decisions about what might be necessary or appropriate information to share with victims or necessary reasons. They would also understand experiences and choices people might be making with regard to choosing to stay within a process which can, in some cases we were talking about earlier, be traumatising when victims go through a legal and criminal process. Staff understanding that, fully understanding the needs of victims, and what responsibilities they have will be made a reality by practice. I would like if the Minister of State could offer or indicate, on this legislative basis or otherwise, that there will be some report on the training provided to take the laudable overall spirit of this Bill into real effect.</p>

          <p eId="para_733">It is an interesting amendment and debate. At present, training has been provided to all State solicitors. Both administrative and legal staff of the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions have received training. An Garda Síochána and prosecutors nationwide have received training. The Irish Prison Service and the Courts Service have also undergone training to enable greater support for victims of crime. Training has been given to a number of non-governmental organisations involved in assisting victims of crime, for example the Victims of Crime Helpline, the Rape Crisis Centre and Advic. These organisations are to receive further training from the DPP's office following the finalisation of this Bill and we are all anxious that it be enacted as soon as possible. Furthermore, An Garda Síochána has specially trained personnel working in its victim services office in each division and 474 trained family liaison officers working to support victims of crime.</p>
          <p eId="para_734"> In many ways, this is a new dawn for victims. Detailed information of the training provided by many of these organisations is already published on their websites, for example, by the Garda Síochána, the Garda Ombudsman Commission and the Courts Service. It is clear that training is being provided and information about it is being published by all relevant authorities.</p>
          <p eId="para_735"> I wish to raise concerns about this specific amendment.</p>
          <p eId="para_736">It appears to require certain non-statutory bodies to report on training in accordance with the provisions of this Act and the EU directive. However, there are no provisions in this Act and the provisions of the directive do not require such bodies to provide this training.</p>
          <p eId="para_737"> Article 25.3 of the directive requires member states to recommend to those responsible for the training of lawyers to make available general and specialist training to increase the awareness of lawyers to the needs of victims. This has already been done. I want to take this opportunity to re-echo that request and recommendation here.</p>
          <p eId="para_738"> There is no provision in the Bill that requires this training so it is hard to see what training requirement the amendment is based on. Senators may not have been aware that a lot is already happening. I take on board the importance of training. I thank the Senators for the opportunity to highlight the importance of training and of making available on websites what training has taken place. That is already happening and, therefore, there is no need for this amendment. I will not be accepting the amendment.</p>

          <p eId="para_739">Again, I am disappointed but not surprised. The Minister of State has not supported any amendment today - not one - yet he tabled 30-odd amendments himself. I repeat again that he had full notice of what would be put before him. Does he see any merit in that? He did not say my amendment had merit unlike the rest of them. That is the way it is but it is hard to believe. I would be very disappointed if I was involved in one of the advocacy groups that had taken the time to engage with people. I take this opportunity to thank the few Members who took the time and trouble to table amendments. I spoke to someone on the telephone when I left earlier for my tea. The person said they came in here and saw politics in action. Those who gave a commitment to do something or attempt to do something did so. In regard to those who undertook to do something but did nothing, the record speaks for itself. The Minister of State's response is disappointing. I will put the amendment to a vote and, again, it is for the record. I am disappointed that the Minister of State has rejected every single amendment tonight.</p>

          <p eId="para_748">Fair enough. There is huge frustration in terms of the substance of what we are trying to do, with Senator Boyhan, which was to reflect concerns and issues that have been raised with us by people who work on the front line with people who are victims of crime, particularly issues relating to people who try to make complaints and get justice for sexual crimes. I am disappointed with the whole process. I am disappointed that we have not been really heard and I feel that I have let people down today. I just wanted to put my views on the record. I hope that the Minister of State will reflect on these things and on the sincerity, substance and principles of the amendments, even though maybe not all the technicalities or words were quite right.</p>

          <p eId="para_749">My party has tabled a similarly worded amendment that is scheduled to be discussed next. The amendment is very similar to the amendment tabled by Senator Boyhan.</p>
          <p eId="para_750"> I am a practising solicitor and deal with people who are involved in the courts system. Even outside the criminal justice system, in other areas, the experience can be very stressful. I refer to far lesser court processes. For example, in the civil and family courts it is far more difficult to deal with the criminal justice system. Quite frankly, full training is required for many people across the process and not just the people who have been mentioned. There is no point having training if there is no one to monitor and receive feedback. An amendment, therefore, should be accepted in this regard, whether it is a Fianna Fáil amendment or that of Senator Boyhan.</p>

          <p eId="para_751">Maybe I did not explain things properly and I am sorry if I came across a bit indistinct. I am informed that training is provided to all State solicitors, the staff of the DPP, the Garda, prosecutors nationwide, the Irish Prison Service and the Courts Service. That covers most of what is in the amendment. Training is already happening. Not only that, but three of the bodies - the Garda, the Garda Síochána Ombudsman Commission and the Courts Service - have published details, I am told, of their training on their websites. Organisations are already doing this.</p>
          <p eId="para_752"> One of the problems we have is that non-statutory legal professional bodies have been mentioned in the amendment. I am advised that placing any such requirements on them would not be appropriate without very careful consideration of the issue. The status of these bodies differs from conventional organisations. One body has recently been compared with a private members' club in a High Court decision. For that reason and other stated reasons, I am afraid that I am not in a position to accept the amendment.</p>
          <p eId="para_753"> I make the following point again. The Senators are right to highlight the importance of training. However, training is already happening, the details have been published and people can see the information. I am not sure if the Senators are aware of that situation. Training is happening and we want more of it to happen. As I said, the Office of the Chief State Solicitor, the Garda, the DPP, the Prison Service, prosecutors and the Court Service have all undergone training in order to provide greater support to victims of crime. Training already exists and is there to be seen. As Senator Clifford-Lee said, training can be examined and monitored. The Senators can look at the information themselves and go through same. The committees of the Houses can invite some of these agencies in to discuss what is available on their websites. Training already exists and I expect that it is of a very high standard. As I said, we want this to move forward.</p>
          <p eId="para_754"> There is an issue with some of the non-statutory agencies mentioned in the amendment. Do some of them have the structures to provide training? It has already been advised. It has been recommended in the directive that other bodies responsible for the training of lawyers would make available general specialist training to increase the awareness of lawyers to the needs of victims. I agree fully with the Senators but there is no need for the amendment which contains an issue that causes problems.</p>
          <p eId="para_755"> The Government has accepted many Opposition amendments to this legislation in the Dáil. In fact, so many amendments were accepted in the Dáil that there was nothing left to be changed in a really substantial way. We listened in the Dáil to what people brought forward.</p>
          <p eId="para_756"> I am anxious, and I know everyone here is as well, to get the legislation on the Statute Book. As with many of the other discussions we have had here today, it should be possible to amend legislation. It is early days for the legislation. It is possible to amend, change and improve the legislation as we go along, under other statutes. Unfortunately, for the reasons that I have outlined, I am not in a position to accept the amendment. </p>

It is about time we had people on the record in terms of this democratic process. The reality is the Minister of State has accepted no amendments today, a fact that speaks for itself. There will be more opportunities to debate this legislation. We have colleagues in the other House, so the Minister of State will have to deal with this legislation again. It is important that Ministers are challenged. Senators will have failed their job if we do not question the <i>status quo</i>, the establishment, the Minister of State, his Ministry and his advisers. As he said earlier, he was a member of the Opposition for 15 years and was terribly frustrated by the process.</p>

          <p eId="para_805">I pay tribute to the Minister of State, his officials and all those Members who took a keen interest in what is exceptionally important legislation. For too long victims of crime have not received the recognition they should receive. While this legislation will not be the panacea for all of the challenges and difficulties victims of crime face, it is certainly a significant incremental step in the right direction. As my party's spokesperson on justice and on behalf of Fine Gael, I pay tribute to everyone involved and thank him or her for his or her co-operation.</p>

          <p eId="para_806">I thank the Minister of State and his officials. It has been a good evening. We have had a conversation about and highlighted some genuine issues and the Minister of State acknowledged that he was sympathetic. There is a lot of merit in the legislation, but we need to look at how the democratic process works. The Minister of State has a track record in that regard, but I thank, in particular, all of the people who engaged in the process, those outside politics who wrote to us and lobbied us. They told us harrowing stories and said they wanted change. Senator Colette Kelleher suggested we had let people down, but we have not. Politics is a tough business, but we have done a good day's work. I ask the Minister of State to take on board the sentiments expressed in some of the amendments, even though they have not ended up being inserted into the legislation, but they are, nevertheless, important. I acknowledge the Senators who took the time and trouble to prepare for the debate on the legislation. Some amendments were ruled out of order, sometimes for legitimate reasons, but I thank Senators for engaging in the process and working very hard on their amendments.</p>

          <p eId="para_807">As I said earlier, this is groundbreaking legislation which represents a new dawn for victims. It has been about four years in the making and there has been huge engagement on it with various victim support organisations, including the Victims Rights Alliance and others, which I thank for their work. We included a lot of their suggestions in the legislation, although not all. We are anxious to get the legislation into the Statute Book and have listened carefully to the points made. Every piece of legislation requires to be tweaked, improved and updated and what has been said today has been taken on board. We wish the agencies which will operate the legislation well. They are anxious to start work under it as soon as they can. I thank all Senators for their valuable contributions on the Bill and in other areas. When I chaired the committee, we did a lot of work in the relevant area and it is nice to see it being brought to fruition at long last.</p>
