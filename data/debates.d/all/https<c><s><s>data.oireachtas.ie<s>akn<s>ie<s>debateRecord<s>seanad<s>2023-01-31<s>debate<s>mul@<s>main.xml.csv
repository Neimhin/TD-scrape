I have received notice from the following Senators that they propose to raise the following matters:Senator Maria Byrne - The need for the Minister for Finance to make a statement on the extension of the 9% tourism VAT rate.Senator Aisling Dolan - The need for the Minister for Transport to provide an update on the roll-out of the Connecting Ireland rural mobility plan.Senator Aidan Davitt - The need for the Minister of State with responsibility for local government and planning to update the allowable expenses categories for the local representation allowance to include home security systems.Senator Victor Boyhan - The need for Minister of State with responsibility for local government and planning to make a statement on the urban regeneration and development fund and proposals to ask local authorities to buy vacant and derelict properties in town centres.Senator Mary Seery Kearney - The need for the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage to make a statement on the Government's view and intentions for Iveagh Markets in Dublin 8.Senator Lynn Boylan - The need for the Minister of Enterprise, Trade, and Employment to make a statement on the reallocation of network costs back to large energy users from domestic accounts.Senator Joe O'Reilly - The need for the Minister for Defence to make a statement on the current status of the 15 Army Reserve centres, excluding military barracks or military camps, to outline staffing, training nights held and the centres in use. Senator Marie Sherlock - The need for the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage to make a statement on plans to abolish build-to-rent planning regulations.Senator John McGahon - The need for the Minister for Education to make a statement on the upgrading of the science laboratories in De La Salle College, Dundalk, County Louth.Senator Tim Lombard - The need for the Minister for Education to increase both the access to and the number of school National Educational Psychological Service assessments.Senator Robbie Gallagher - The need for the Minister for Health to make a statement on the introduction of measures to improve response times relating to the National Ambulance Service.Senator Barry Ward - The need for the Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth to increase provision for anti-racism measures. Of the matters raised by the Senators suitable for discussion, I have selected Senators Maria Byrne, Dolan, Davitt and Boyhan and they will be taken now. I regret that I had to rule out of order the matter raised by Senator Seery Kearney on the ground that the Minister has no official responsibility in the matter. The other Senators may give notice on another day of the matters that they wish to raise.

Coming from a small business background and with my family having been in the hospitality trade for many years, I am well aware of the issues faced by people in that trade. I have received local communication from the chair of the Shannon hotels group, which operates in the mid-west, the Irish Hotels Federation , the Restaurants Association of Ireland and small businesses.There is growing concern among small businesses after Covid. The hospitality industry may have been the worst hit during the pandemic. They were closed for quite a while, opened for a short period and then closed again. Many of them are only beginning to come back now. Having spoken to people involved with small businesses, and especially restaurants and hotels, I am aware that some are not opening on Mondays, Tuesdays or Wednesdays. This is how serious the situation is. In addition, they have been hit with increased energy costs. My understanding concerning hotels is that there has been a reduction of up to 57% in tourists from the UK, one of the biggest contributors of visitors to this country. That is a very high number. Equally, the reduction in the numbers of European visitors is between 30% and 40%. Our own people are also not travelling to hotels as much as they used to. While people are beginning to move out and about, many people, especially those who are older, are still being wary. They may be dining or drinking at home. There is great concern among those in the industry. Approximately 280,000 people were employed in the hospitality industry prior to the onset of Covid. A number of businesses have not reopened, so this number has certainly fallen but a large number of wage packets are still dependent on the sector. While we can pride ourselves on our level of unemployment, which is under 4%, and this is phenomenal, the important point is what will happen if we do not support the hospitality industry and its call for an extension of the 9% VAT rate for another while. We must look at this matter seriously. Have there been discussions between the Departments of Finance and Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media regarding how we are going to support businesses in future? I know we cannot support them forever and a day, but they have been hit with the double whammy of Covid and energy costs. We must do something to support these small businesses and keep the 280,000 people to whom I refer in employment.
#JenniferCarrollMacNeill	unknown-#JenniferCarrollMacNeill-party	unknown-#JenniferCarrollMacNeill-dob	unknown-#JenniferCarrollMacNeill-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-01-31 00:00:00	Gnó an tSeanaid - Business of Seanad	2	I thank the Senator for raising this important issue. She is correct that the hospitality sector has suffered this double whammy from the impact of Covid and the energy crisis. She is also right to identify that the Government has tried to support businesses through both of these periods. As the Senator is aware, the 9% rate of VAT applies on a temporary basis to the hospitality and tourism sectors, until 20 February every 2023. This 9% rate of VAT was reintroduced, having been in place for a time in the last decade, on 1 November 2020 in recognition that the tourism and hospitality sectors were among those most impacted, as the Senator said, by the public health restrictions put in place throughout the pandemic. Through no fault of their own, bars, hotels and restaurants had to close and reopen on multiple occasions in response to the public health crisis. It is important to remember that even temporary VAT reductions involve a cost to the Exchequer in the context of tax revenues foregone. The estimated cost of the VAT rate reduction to 9% when it was first introduced from 1 November 2020 to 31 December 2021, a 13-month period, was €401 million. This rate was then extended to 31 August 2022 at a cost of an additional €251 million. A further extension to the rate was announced in budget 2023, bringing the total anticipated cost of this VAT rate reduction to more than €900 million by the end of February. This represents the provision of substantial support by the Government to the hospitality and tourism-related sector of close to €1 billion euro in a relatively short time. The estimated cost for extending the current measure to the end of this year is €460 million. This can be broken down into estimated figures of €358 million for the hospitality sector and €102 million for the accommodation sector. I note that it is possible to change the VAT rate for either the hospitality or accommodation sectors without reference to the other. It is important to be aware, however, that if only the accommodation sector, for example, reverted to the 13.5% VAT rate this higher rate would have to apply to all accommodation, including bed and breakfast establishments and small hotels. This is because of the EU principle of fiscal neutrality. Member states are required to apply the same VAT rate to the same service and this principle is also the reason it is not possible to provide separate VAT rates based on geography. There are also practical, operational concerns in having different VAT rates applying to hotel accommodation and meals, given how the sector operates, with various packages possible, ranging from bed and breakfast accommodation on its own through to dining and accommodation plus dining.The complexity of it is quite real. As Senator Byrne and all Senators will be aware, this temporary 9% VAT reduction also applies to other sectors of tourist activity, as well as hairdressing. If the VAT reduction was extended in full to the end of the year, it would cost just over €500 million, with €460 million for tourism and hospitality, and €40 million for other sectors. However, in the coming weeks the Government will examine the full suite of taxation and other measures due to expire at the end of February, as the Senator identified. It is important to note that no decision has been made on whether the measures currently in place will be allowed to expire or whether new measures will be introduced. It is therefore premature for me today, at the end of January, to comment on that further except to say that the range of supports available to businesses is under consideration in a deep way. The decisions that must be made relate to the nature of supports, prospects of inflation, development in public finances, effectiveness of current measures and how that can be fully evaluated. Senator Maria Byrne highlighted the significant cost of energy, which is important to reference. It is a huge pressure for businesses, especially those in the hospitality sector. Of course, Senator Maria Byrne is aware of the temporary business energy support scheme, TBESS, which is aimed at businesses with an average unit gas or electricity price that has gone up by over 50%. I may come back to that in closing remarks; I have more data for the Senator.

I thank the Minister of State for her comprehensive response. I acknowledge all of the supports that have been given to small businesses and businesses in general. There is a case to be made, and I am glad to hear, that the Government is monitoring it and will be looking at it. That is a positive step. I encourage the parties involved when sitting around the table in the Department to think of the 280,000 people and their families, who are reliant on their salaries. We need to be cognisant of the double whammy of energy and the VAT rate. Any support that can be given, especially to small businesses, would be appreciated

I know and appreciate the importance of the tourism and hospitality sectors as significant employers. Both the Senator and I come from that background. It is right across the country. I emphasise the TBESS. In the Senator's area in County Limerick, there have been 736 applications to date, with 719 approved so far and €815,000 distributed. I see Senator Dolan from County Roscommon in the Chamber; some 238 businesses there have applied, with 230 approved. I can provide data to any other Senators on their areas of interest. This scheme will also be considered to make sure it is meeting needs. Take-up could be higher and I am aware people are making applications now. The Government is extending the period for applications. If I were going back to any part of Ireland including my constituency, I would emphasise the simplicity of the process to make applications for that scheme through the Revenue system. There is substantial support available through that scheme. It is also under consideration. What Government needs to reflect is the balance of support, where it is most needed and where it can be most effectively delivered at this time, recognising that Covid-19 is different now than it has been previously. It is about recognising the most appropriate targeted support of the best benefit while being mindful of the pressure on public finances posed by the considerable sums involved.

She is here to take this Commencement matter on behalf of the Minister for Transport, Deputy Eamon Ryan. This is about the need and urgency around bus services in rural areas and specifically my own home area of Roscommon and Galway and Ballinasloe town.At the public consultation phase of the Connecting Ireland rural mobility plan, I co-ordinated a video campaign to highlight proposed and urgently needed routes. This was in December 2021, at which time we were encouraging submissions. We have seen some of those new services, which I acknowledge. There is a Castlerea service to Ballinasloe that goes through Glenamaddy, Mountbellew, Caltra and Ahascragh. It is a fantastic service, because there were no buses going through some of those towns. In fact, there was no way for some of those people to go to day services in the social services. It is fantastic to see that up and running now. It was only launched in the past month or so. We are looking at three services per day, which again is fantastic. They are linking up places like Ballinasloe and Castlerea, which are already linked by geography by the River Suck. Again, it is bringing students to the university campus town in Mountbellew and linking people to different towns in our area. We also have the Local Link from Ballinasloe to Portumna, which is going through Lawrencetown and Eyrecourt. The frequency of service is about three times per day. There is a bus running from Loughrea to Ballinasloe. This replaces the X20 route. There used to be the 20 bus. For a student going from Dublin to Galway, there was the Bus Éireann 20 route and the X20, which was the express service. It would take all of the stops to Athlone and then go directly from Athlone to Dublin. That route was taken off one or two years ago and it has caused a lot of challenges for people who use the bus pass to travel and for students travelling. A Local Link was put in place from Loughrea to Ballinasloe covering some of those areas like Kilreekil, Cappataggle and Kilconnell. We also have some commercial services and providers covering those routes. However, there are crucial needs here because there is currently no link between and Athlone and Ballinasloe on the old Dublin to Galway road. That would go through the communities of Summerhill, Drum, Moor, outside of Creagh and into Ballinasloe. There is no public service on that route, which used to be a major route in Ireland on the old Dublin to Galway road. It is one of the proposals under the Connecting Ireland rural mobility plan and I want to ask about that particular route because in Ballinasloe we have Portiuncula University Hospital. It is the hospital for more than 20,000 people in Athlone and covers and takes in a catchment area of almost 500,000. It is the hospital for that city. For people attending maternity appointments in particular, there is no way for them to get directly to the hospital. The train station is roughly 15 minutes from the hospital itself, which is almost a one mile walk. If someone is in need and not able to walk, the bus service would be fantastic as it would stop right outside the hospital. I am asking that we have that service going forward. I am hoping it is a service being proposed and is one that would connect. We had the Minister, Deputy Ryan, down to launch the first electric bus in Athlone only a week or two ago. The other services I want to inquire about are the A78 from Athlone to Roscommon. Athlone to Ballinasloe is one route, then Athlone to Roscommon goes through Ballyforan, Ballygar and Athleague. This is one of the proposals. It would bring connectivity to some of those towns and connect people from Athlone to Roscommon. Route 440 from Athlone to Westport is also proposed, bringing in Roscommon and Mayo. My other points are on communication in local communities. What is the National Transport Authority, NTA, doing on communication with regional newspapers, local radio stations and community publications? I do not know if all of the information is on bus stops. However, that is something we need to see.

I am delighted to be here today on behalf of the Minister for Transport, and I understand the Senator's question relates to the roll-out of the Connecting Ireland plan more generally, but also specifically regarding route 23 between Athlone and Ballinasloe. I know she mentioned a few other routes too. The Department of Transport has responsibility for policy and overall funding of public transport. However, the Department is not involved in the day-to-day operation of public transport services nationally. It is the NTA, the National Transport Authority, that has statutory responsibility for securing the provision of public passenger transport services nationally by way of contracts, and for the allocation of associated funding to the relevant transport operators. I reassure Senator Dolan that the Government is dedicated to providing the public with reliable and realistic sustainable mobility options, and public transport plays a key role in the delivery of this goal. The Minister for Transport is obviously very conscious of the need to connect people and places across Ireland. It is important to provide opportunities for all citizens to access employment, education, healthcare or retail.The Minister is strongly committed to improving public transport services in rural areas and piloting new transport initiatives for people of all ages and abilities living there. Whether it is reduced car dependency or a more integrated transport network, our vision for rural Ireland is ambitious and one that is central to his Department's work programme for 2023. The Connecting Ireland rural mobility plan supports this ambition, with its core aims being improvement of public transport services in rural areas and piloting of new transport initiatives for all. Under this pivotal plan we will see a 25% overall increase in rural bus services, over 100 rural villages benefiting from a frequent public transport service of at least three return trips daily for the first time and over 60 new connections to regional cities from surrounding areas. Importantly, the ethos of community-led transport will also be maintained. This has already been seen in the adaptation of the Connecting Ireland proposals in supporting the increased demands for public transport in local areas where the population has increased due to the high influx of Ukrainian refugees. In relation specifically to the Senator's question on services connecting Athlone and Ballinasloe, I am happy to clarify that regional corridor 23 is currently served by a number of express and multi-stop services between Galway and Dublin. As a part of upcoming Connecting Ireland phases, the National Transport Authority, NTA, plans to review services on this corridor in the years 2024 and 2025 to assess the possibility of an increased frequency of services and better integration. While it is not currently planned to introduce new or enhanced services along the R446, the old Dublin to Galway road, between Athlone and Ballinasloe, the Department and the NTA remain agile and flexible in their management of the programme, so that where implementation can be kept under review and where progress could be impacted, other plans can be advanced instead. The NTA also publishes updates on the implementation of these services in its quarterly bulletin, which can be found on its website. It is also important to note there are currently a number of routes operated from Athlone to Galway. We have the Citylink services 660, 760 and 761 with nine services per day to Ballinasloe. There is the AirCoach 706 express, with a number of services per day to Portiuncula Hospital, Ballinasloe, and the GoBus 720. The Senator is shaking her head at that. It differs from her experience. She can let me know and I will come back to her on it.

They do not go through the towns and villages we are supposed to be connecting. My huge issue is there are communities that benefited. Families, older people and students use that service. When the buses went on the old Dublin-Galway road the service was very well used and was the main route from Dublin to Galway. The motorway has happened and it has bypassed many of these communities. We are instead left with commercial providers that are of course going to go from town to town on the motorway, but what happens to the communities living in between the motorways? It is up to us and to the State to provide a public transport service to people who are not being connected by commercial providers. I am surprised it is going to take two more years, when we have an electric bus that has just been launched that is supposed to do a 150 mile-radius. It is less than 20 miles from Athlone to Ballinasloe. It is in the proposal.

I note she welcomed the Castlerea to Ballinasloe service, which will offer three services a day to students, the campus and all of that. I note she also mentioned the 878 Athlone to Roscommon service and the 440 from Athlone as well. I will ask the Minister for Transport to come back to her directly on those. There are, I understand, four routes planned for the first phase of Connecting Ireland for Galway. Some have been implemented already in the Connemara region, including route 431 from Carraroe to Claremorris via Maam Cross, Cong and Ballinrobe. There is also route 432. In the coming months two further routes will be implemented, namely, route 546 from Ballinasloe and route 438 from Tuam to Galway. All of the aforementioned routes will offer a minimum three return trips seven days a week.

He is one of the hardest-working Ministers of State in the House. I am sure he will have no problem in taking over the big shoes of Deputy Peter Burke in what is a tough portfolio. I am also sure we will see a lot of the new Minister of State here. I raised this issue with the Minister of State's predecessor. I acknowledge that the new Minister of State has put a great deal of work into it because we have talked about the local representation allowance that councillors receive. I believe the legislation does not specify whether the allowance covers alarms, CCTV and panic buttons. I believe that this is something that needs to be outlined, particularly in the light of recent attacks on the homes of politicians, as well as marches and protests at their houses. We should at all cost protect councillors because they are at the forefront of politics. Like Deputies, councillors are extremely immersed in their local communities. The basic thing that councillors need is protection and anything that we can do to help and to improve their security would be beneficial. As the Minister of State will be aware, councillors can submit a claim that covers 14 categories. Some of them tie in but I advise that we add another category of home security systems. As the Minister of State has been working on this issue, I ask him to enlighten us about the situation.
#KieranODonnell	unknown-#KieranODonnell-party	unknown-#KieranODonnell-dob	unknown-#KieranODonnell-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-01-31 00:00:00	Gnó an tSeanaid - Business of Seanad	17	I thank the Acting Chairperson for his words of welcome. As a former Member of this House I am always glad to come back here for its excellent debates on various topics. I thank Senator Davitt for raising this matter. I am particularly grateful for the opportunity to come before the House today to speak about the important issue of councillors' security. Local government plays an important role in the life of the nation and is responsible for the delivery of a wide range of services. The activities of local authorities are overseen by elected councils, which provide a forum for the democratic representation of local communities.  All elected representatives should be free to carry out their functions and representational role without fear of harassment or intimidation. Heightened adversarial attitudes to elected representatives is corrosive to democratic participation. It risks deterring potential new candidates and inducing existing representatives to withdraw from political life, which is very regrettable.. I know some concern has been expressed about candidates' information being publicly available whether through the ballot paper, ethics returns or other public documentation or, indeed, simply local knowledge. It is important that people are clearly identifiable when seeking to become public representatives. There is little that can be done to counteract local knowledge but we can and we must ensure that local representatives are in a position to protect themselves. Under the provisions of the Local Government (Expenses of Local Authority Members) Regulations 2021 a range of allowances are payable to councillors to support them in carrying out their role. Senator Davitt has referred to that range of allowances. The 2021 regulations were given effect following the independent review of the role and remuneration of local authority elected members, which was overseen by Ms Sara Moorhead SC. The local representation allowance, LRA, was introduced under the 2021 regulations. The LRA is payable to all councillors on a vouched basis. Its terms are similar to the public representation allowance that is payable to Oireachtas Members. The maximum annual allowance that can be claimed under the LRA is €5,160, which is €4,200 plus the €80 per month unvouched. . The LRA is a flexible allowance with 14 eligible expenditure categories, which the Senator has identified, under which a councillor can claims expenses. Expenditure which may be claimed under the LRA must be wholly and exclusively incurred by a councillor in the performance of his or her duties, and must not include any personal element of expenditure. A member must be able to provide relevant documentation in the form of bills, receipts, invoices etc. for expenses that he or she incurred.  Local authorities are encouraged to be flexible provided that a member's requests are deemed to be reasonable and that the item of expenditure can be reasonably construed as coming under one of the 14 categories of eligible expenditure.The eligible expenditure categories include improvements to office accommodation and utilities of an office or offices, including home offices. Most councillors work from home some of the time and may have space in their home designated as a home office.  I am pleased to inform the Senator that clarifying guidelines issued from my Department in December 2022 included guidance of the issue of home security systems for councillors who have home offices. Installation costs of CCTV security systems may be covered in full under improvements to office accommodation category. Monthly and annual costs associated with home alarm monitoring may also be apportioned and claimed under utilities at up to a maximum of 20% of the total cost. The installation is under category 3 and the annual running costs are category 4.  To give full clarity on the guidance issued to the local authorities, the installation cost of CCTV may be covered in full under the category "improvements to office accommodation". Monthly annual costs associated with home alarm monitoring may also be apportioned and claimed with category 4, utility, up to a maximum of 20%.  Having looked back through it, the directions on it were updated on 1 September, including the improvement to office accommodation category. It does not specifically mention CCTV cameras. Utilities of an office or offices, under category 4 directions, include alarm security costs. I have discussed it with my Department. We will issue revised, updated directions. I have asked that category 3 will specifically mention CCTV installation. That should bring full clarity. However, under the guidance, under category 3, councillors can claim for installation of security cameras and they can claim annual running costs under category 4.

When he is on it, I implore the Minister of State to look at the full cost of paying an alarm company. To have only 20% allowable is not 20% security. Mainly, the security is tied to the person's position as an elected representative. I would implore the Minister of State to allow the 100% grant of the monthly expenses. The expenses are €4,200 plus the €80 per month. If they want to claim it for security and they think it is the most important thing for that particular councillor to do, they are well entitled to it. I cannot see why it would be just 20%. We looked for phone expenses and we were only talking about 20% and whatever else. Now, mobile phones are totally allowable. The Minister of State might please try to tighten up that end of it.

They are entitled to 20% of the annual running cost thereafter. I take on board the Senator’s point. They will be issued with revised directions for expenses of elected members of local authorities. My Department officials are now working on that. I will ask them to take on board the points that the Senator raised. I thank Senator Davitt for his insightful contribution. He brought up the wider questions about public life. I acknowledge the work of the Association of Irish Local Government, AILG, the Local Authorities Members Association, LAMA, as well as the County and City Management Association, CCMA. In 2022, the AILG provided a training module to councillors to provide an understanding of personal security and safety risks in a number of settings and a number of particular risk types. It plans to deliver further courses this year involving senior members of the Garda.  I would be very pleased to engage with the councillors and their representative bodies. I thank the Senator for bringing up this important issue.

I congratulate him on what I think is one of the best jobs in government, which relates to local government. I know he has much experience in that and I wish him well. I raise the issue of urban regeneration. There has been much talk about it.Funding under the urban regeneration and development fund comes under three strands, namely, strands 1, 2 and 3. There is a common problem. The Minister of State will know the country pretty well. I will single out a number of places. Councillor Annemarie Ryan has been in contact with me about Tipperary town. Half of the place is empty. I was there last week. I will also mention Gort in County Galway, Athy and Monasterevin in County Kildare, Fermoy in County Cork, Limerick city, Tralee, Longford, Navan in County Meath and Boyle in Roscommon. When you go around these towns - and they are towns, not villages - you will see great dereliction. Many of them are market towns that have beautiful architecture and the potential for beautiful public realms and urban spaces. We talk about funding. I welcome the funding; I am not here to knock it. It is fantastic. I will mention one of the travesties in this area. A circular that was issued yesterday to all of our county managers, Circular URDF 01/2023. On page 2, it is stated that "While just under €1.5bn was originally allocated under Calls 1 and 2 only €144m had been drawn down by local authorities". That raises questions. I know the Minister of State is not here to cover that particular issue today but it is a real concern. What am I saying? I am saying that our city and county councils are telling us that all of this is bypassing the little villages and towns and that we need to focus on the likes of Schull in County Cork and other smaller towns and villages. I think of the great potential of Ennistymon. It is not good enough to say that, unless a town has a population of 10,000, we are not prepared to fund it. I believe the reverse. I believe in going to the smaller little towns and villages and getting them right. The others will have to compete with them while they grow. That is a really important point. I am conscious of time but I want to draw the Minister of State's attention to the fact that the Joint Committee on Housing, Local Government and Heritage, of which I am a member, commissioned a major study in respect of town and village urban regeneration last year. We made 39 recommendations, many of which have not been implemented. As a new Minister of State, I ask Deputy O'Donnell to look at that again and to see how we can implement these recommendations. We have wonderful towns and villages. Cities tend to be bigger and can manage better. They can take a more collective approach with regard to funding. Let us get these communities up and vibrant. For communities to be vibrant, we have to people living and working in them and we have to build them. All over this country, there is a necklace of wonderful little villages. Surely we can focus on them.  I ask the Minister of State to please look at this circular. It is many pages long. You would need degrees in English and engineering to master it. Can somebody provide a simpler version? I circulated it to all of our city and county councillors today. I had to read it ten times myself. Some 12 or 13 people came back to me to ask what it was all about. Can we simplify the documentation and the language within it? If local authorities are not spending the money to rejuvenate these towns, we should give it to somebody else. Let us not have a situation in which Government funds are not drawn down. I wish the Minister of State well with this project.

The urban regeneration and development fund, URDF, is a flagship element of Project Ireland 2040 and was established to support more compact and sustainable development through the regeneration and rejuvenation of Ireland's five cities and other large towns. The Senator noted that is based on populations exceeding 10,000. The fund also caters for towns with fewer than 10,000 people but where there are 2,500 or more jobs. It very much feeds into compact growth. The updated census returns will be looked at to see what additional areas will qualify but I note the points the Senator raises in that regard. This funding will enable a greater proportion of residential and mixed-use development to be delivered within the existing built-up footprints of our cities and towns and ensure that more parts of our urban areas can become attractive and vibrant places that people choose to live and work in and to invest in and visit. Through the URDF, public bodies are receiving targeted support for innovative and holistic solutions to the issues that have hindered the regeneration and rejuvenation of our large towns and cities. To date, there have been two calls for proposals under the URDF, with in excess of €1.6 billion allocated to 132 projects, comprising almost 400 sub-projects, located right across the country. I have read Circular URDF 01/2023, which was issued yesterday. The Senator draws attention to the level of funding drawn down.I will make the point, however, that many of these projects are now drawing down the funding at different levels. Looking at the level of funding that has been drawn down and the roll-out of projects would not be totally compatible. It is a matter I have taken up with my Department. There are numerous other projects, many of which are now coming to fruition. I expect the Senator will see major drawdowns in the not-too-distant future in that regard. With URDF-supported projects now active in every local authority area in the country, it is clear that local authorities are eager to embrace the unique opportunity presented by the URDF programme to harness significant Exchequer support to reimagine and optimise the potential of Ireland's urban areas. To support the Government's new vacant homes action plan that he launched yesterday, the Minister, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, also announced details of a third round of funding support under the URDF. Supporting key objectives of Housing for All and town centre first, this round of supports specifically addresses long-term vacancy and dereliction across URDF eligible cities and towns. Distinct from previous URDF funding calls, the third funding round will not be a competitive bid process. Instead, specific allocations will be made to each local authority to address the financial barriers and risks faced by local authorities in seeking to tackle vacant and derelict buildings and sites. The Senator will know from the circular that there will be engagement within the Department and the local authorities. They will have to make submissions by Friday, 10 March giving an appraisal of where they are . Previous to that on Wednesday, 15 February, there will be a plenary session with all the local authorities and the Department on the issue. We will seek to have workshops with the local authorities in March and early April. We will then follow up with approved recommendations in terms of the eligibility of projects and reporting requirements for the third round of funding and associated financial allocations by quarter 2 of this year. The funding will be available to cover the acquisition costs of a property or site and any civil or design works that may be required to de-risk or improve the site or building to make it more attractive for reuse, development by others and onwards. We are looking at brownfield sites, which are very much part of this as well. The intention is that the fund would be replenished from the proceeds received from the end user, thereby allowing the local authority to put in place a rolling programme to tackle long-term vacancy and dereliction without recourse to borrowing. Up to €150 million of URDF support will be made available in individual allocations to local authorities. It should be noted that while the third round of funding is specifically tailored to help deliver specific objectives of the national planning framework, the national development plan and the Housing for All and Town Centre First plans, the Minister has committed to a fourth round of funding support, which will be made available later in 2023. This further call will revert to the heretofore wider scope of URDF projects which reflect the complex investment proposals required to transform key areas of our cities and towns.

I am conscious of time and I know the Acting Chairperson is under pressure. I will make four key points. The reality is that the circular issued by the Department yesterday confirmed that €1.5 billion was allocated. We have had calls 1 and 2, we are heading into call 3 and, to date, only €144 million has been drawn down. That has to be of concern. I will leave it at that. The next issue is around the population figure of 10,000 when we talk about villages. These communities are represented by Government party councillors. They are crying out for support and funding. The Minister of State might look at that again, please. This is about staffing and resources. Local authorities do not currently have the staff in place to administer these schemes. More importantly, the officials are scratching their heads and asking the question of who is paying for the costs of compulsory purchase orders, CPOs, to acquire these properties. If substantial progress is to be made in this regard, they need this funding. There is a need for additional information. I know the Minister of State is carrying out workshops, which I respect and appreciate. Let us stay alert, however, and be sure we are drawing down the funds that have been allocated for these schemes. I thank the Minister of State.

The Senator will see much more of that €1.5 billion in funding being drawn down. As I outlined earlier, a key action in supporting the Government's vacant homes action plan is the third round of URDF support, which will be specifically designed to address long-term vacancy and dereliction across our URDF cities and towns and the acceleration of the provision of residential accommodation. This initiative is also in support of objectives under the revised Housing for All and Town Centre First plans. It should be noted that the third round of funding support is not seeking to replicate or replace the various social housing programmes available to local authorities to tackle vacant and derelict buildings and sites. The revolving fund is intended to act as an additional and much broader tool for the activation of long-term vacant and derelict sites and buildings. There are extensive examples of vacant or derelict buildings that are problematic but which may not be appropriate or viable for social housing schemes. This funding is intended to address such properties while addressing the financial gap that exists currently for local authorities in that regard. I note the Senator's points on the issue with regard to staffing. I will take the matter up with my Department. Compulsory purchase orders are a considerable element. They are being looked at under the new planning legislation, but they are a measure. We want this plan to work. It is working, but we wish to expedite this roll-out. I very much take on board Senator Boyhan's points.

I have raised directly with the Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth, Deputy O'Gorman, in recent weeks and before Christmas the issue of hotel providers not receiving payment for a number of months for hosting Ukrainians. It has come to my attention again this week that a number of hotel providers in County Clare have not received payment from the Department since September or October. These people are owed tens of thousands of euro for the provision of accommodation and food. The problem is that the providers have to purchase the food on a weekly basis and at least one of them and possibly two are now at the pin of their collars financially. Companies are beginning to refuse to supply them with product simply because the providers are not in a financial position to pay their bills. There is something seriously wrong with a situation whereby the Government is not paying its bills and people are being put under enormous pressure and stress to keep feeding and supporting the Ukrainian people being housed here on an emergency basis. They are doing so free of charge at present because they are not receiving the payments they are due. It is reprehensible that the Department and the Government would leave people hanging on a string waiting to receive payment. If there are issues in terms of reconciliation, what is wrong with paying 80% or 90% of what is owed, with the balance to be straightened out in future or deducted from future invoices? There is something seriously wrong when the Government allows business owners to swing in the air and expects them to feed, house and turn on the electricity and heating for the Ukrainian people who are in Ireland. What is wrong with the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth that it cannot pay 300 to 400 suppliers in an efficient manner? There are companies in this country dealing with thousands of suppliers on a weekly basis, and doing so efficiently. Given the size of the Civil Service and the competencies that are within it, surely to God this matter can be resolved.I ask the Leader to bring the Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth in here, as a matter of urgency, to explain what the hell is going on in his Department such that businesses in the west of Ireland and all over the rest of the country are left swinging, waiting for their money.

Last June, the Government announced a package deal of over €30 million to support the post office network, with €10 million per year to be provided over three years. That was meant to commence this month but state aid approval and enabling legislation are required in order to bring it to fruition. The legislation in question is the Communications Regulation Bill 2022. That Bill passed Report and Final Stages in the Dáil last Wednesday. Responsibility now falls to the Senate to ensure that the legislation is processed as quickly as possible. I want to put on record the importance of this support to the post office network. Over 600 post offices will benefit from this support scheme. The post offices are divided into different categories. Those with newer contracts are more reliant on this support than those with older contracts, but all 600 are financially out of pocket because the legislation has not been passed. To put this in monetary terms or to provide an understanding of it, one postmaster I spoke to is out of pocket for December and January to the tune of more than 30%. That brings the viability of the relevant post office and its postmaster into question. We all know how hard it is in business out there in the context of the cost-of-living crisis but we are asking these post offices to survive without this State intervention which was promised to them. Without it, they will not survive. They have already gone through January without it. I am not sure exactly when the legislation will be coming before us but it looks like they will also have to go through February without payment of this support. It is significant because when a business loses 30% of its income, its viability becomes questionable. We all know how important post offices are to our communities and how hard it is to keep them open. Without this support, the viability of every single one of the 600 post offices will be questionable. I ask the Leader to provide information or guidance on when this legislation will be brought before the House. Can we prioritise it? Can we get it through in one or two weeks in order to ensure that those in the post office network to whom I refer will not be out of pocket for a second month?

At the weekend, we had another exposé relating to the HSE. Once again, Ministers' heads are on the chopping block, for want of a better description. The thought crosses my mind that when decisions like this are taken, Ministers operate on the advice given to them by their departmental officials. Because of the system of government we have in place, however, the person giving the advice is never called to account. Ultimately, the Minister of the day may end up having his or her head on the chopping block for a decision that was taken ten, 15 or 20 years ago, as the case may be. The time has come for a complete review of the Ministers and Secretaries Act of 1924. It is nearly 100 years since that Act was written. I ask the Leader, the Cathaoirleach and the Clerk of the Seanad to put together a committee of this House that would review the Ministers and Secretaries Act with a view to bringing it into the 21st century. We cannot continue to have a situation whereby people can hide behind an Act of the Oireachtas that is almost 100 years old and not be accountable for decisions taken or advice given. I have a letter from two Ministers telling me that they have no idea what is going on but that they trust their officials to do the job correctly.That is simply not good enough. I can understand how Ministers could be duped or find themselves in a situation where there are 100 letters to be signed this evening. They go in to sign them and they trust the people who are asking them to sign these letters. It is not good enough. This House is the ideal place to carry out a review of the Ministers and Secretaries Act because we do not have the pressures of the Dáil on us. Between the Leader and the Cathaoirleach, I would ask that they consider putting together an ad hoc committee that would be prepared to sit down and look at this Act and see if amendments should be brought forward. I am quite happy if a committee turned around to say that there is no need to amend the Act and that it is perfectly up to date. It is 100 years old, 99 this year, and it is time that it was reviewed.  It is just wrong that we constantly hear of Ministers being fired for the good advice that they thought they were getting at the time. We can go through CervicalCheck, the national children's hospital and through so many foul-ups in this State and it is time now to actually sit down and review it. I ask the Cathaoirleach and the Leader to report back to this House within a week as to whether or not we can do this. I thank the Cathaoirleach.

There are a couple of issues I wish to get through today and the first is that in the past week, we saw another day of quite severe disruption on the Belfast to Dublin rail line. There was a day of miscommunication and delays. We know of the economic and societal importance of that connection between the two major cities and what it brings to the economies and lives of both cities. It is time to ask the Leader to request an update from the Minister for Transport on the all-Ireland rail review and on where that is currently at. We cannot just wait for a review to be concluded and, hopefully, its recommendations implemented, when there are issues which are glaringly obvious in the here and now. There is a memorandum of understanding, MOU, between Belfast and Dublin city councils and central in that MOU is the importance and benefits to both cities brought about as a result of the rail link. The reality, particularly as we head into the summer months and know the benefits of tourism, is that we cannot afford to see these disruptions continue without an intervention at some level. I ask the Leader to request those statements at the earliest possible opportunity. Second, we have seen a very worrying and devastating escalation in Jenin and the attacks carried out there. The death toll of Palestinians is now, I believe, somewhere over 30 since the beginning of the new year and we have also seen a number of Israeli people killed. It is crucially important that we hear from the Minister for Foreign Affairs on what measures we are taking at the EU in respect of the UN to very much ensure that our experience of conflict resolution and of peace building is to the fore, but also in respect of our humanitarian support for, in particular, the people who are suffering in Palestine.  We are seeing now some very extreme rhetoric from Israeli Government ministers, which is saying something, given the extreme rhetoric from Israeli ministers over the past number of years. We are also now seeing again collective punishment, which we know is a war crime, being carried out against the families of Palestinians who have been arrested, and against whom no charges have been brought or convictions secured, but yet their family homes are being demolished as a result. It is important that we hear from the Minister and ensure that the Irish Government and State are heard loud and clear on the international stage saying that apartheid is wrong, that it must end, and that the Irish Government will be active champions in opposing apartheid and war crimes. Tomorrow is Lá Fhéile Bríde. I will not have the opportunity of speaking on the Order of Business tomorrow but I want to wish everybody beannachtaí Lá Fhéile Bríde, particularly my female colleagues in the Seanad. There will be a rally outside Leinster House at 12.30 p.m. and I know that Natalie McNally’s family will travel to Dublin. Natalie was murdered in Lurgan over the Christmas period and her killer remains at large. Like many female victims, she, and in this instance her unborn baby and her family, are awaiting justice.  This is a worrying time for women and we have debated that at length in this Seanad, not least under legislation the Leader has brought to the Chamber.I encourage colleagues to be present at the vigil tomorrow at 12.30 p.m. and to support Natalie and the families of all those women still campaigning for justice.

It has risen to a terrifying point. The attack in Ashtown, Dublin 15, last Saturday was the latest and most insidious incident. Deep down, for many of us, there is a belief that it is only a matter of time, sooner rather than later, before somebody is very seriously injured or worse. There are, of course, many things the Government and the State can do to try to head off the rise in this very ugly sentiment. I will touch on just one action I believe the Government can take and this concerns the role of social media platforms. I appeal directly to the Minister for Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media, Deputy Martin, in this regard and to make a statement in this House concerning what influence she is bringing to bear in this context. Some of the largest social media platform companies have their Europe, Middle East and Asia, EMEA, headquarters here in Dublin. It is incumbent on the Government to use its influence now to try to ask representatives of these companies to do all in their power regarding this situation. These companies have an important responsibility in curbing what we all know to be the propagation of lies, false information and hate online. For many weeks now, we have seen individuals and groups preying on communities with grievances and concerns. These people have been allowed to go ahead unimpeded. While we all defend the right of everybody in this country to have an opinion, it must never be acceptable for somebody to go uninhibited in the publication of lies, hate and fear. These social media platforms can do many things in respect of security checks, anonymous accounts, as we all know, and content moderation. There is a reprehensible, symbiotic relationship between those propagating hate and these companies, because we know the more hits and reach they have, the more these posts are pushed out. I appeal to the Minister, Deputy Martin, to engage directly with the social media companies because we are at a hiatus now regarding the regulation of these entities between the enactment this month of the Online Safety and Media Regulation Act 2022 and the advent of the online safety code, which many in this Chamber have called for. Additionally, the EU Digital Services Act, DSA, co-ordinators will not be in place until 17 February 2023. We need the Government to step in because there is this hiatus.

She and her child were buried in Granardkill cemetery on Friday, 3 February 1984. On Saturday night, 4 February 1984, "The Late Late Show" was coming to an end when the host read the headline from the next day's edition of The Sunday Tribune newspaper: "Girl, 15, dies giving birth in field". "My goodness me", said Gay Byrne, letting the newspaper fall to the floor, "Nothing terribly exciting there." The Dublin newspaper had already been alerted by an anonymous phone caller and the story was covered by Emily O'Reilly and published on Sunday, 5 February 1984. The then editor of the newspaper, Vincent Browne, made the decision to name Anne, along with giving her address. RTÉ covered the story the day after, on Monday, 6 February 1984. By Tuesday, 7 February, it had been decided that a private inquiry would take place, conducted by officers from the Department of Justice and the Department of Education. The then Minister of State with responsibility for women's affairs and family law, Deputy Nuala Fennell, had called for a full-scale public inquiry, but this was decided against. Over the ensuing two weeks, Gay Byrne would change his tune as his radio show was inundated with letters from women telling some of their stories. He and his team read out letter after letter, with Byrne saying there were too many letters and they could not be ignored.In the wake of the tragedy, statements were given by bodies such as the Federation of Services for Unmarried Parents and their Children and ALLY, which in 1983 helped 520 unmarried girls to cope with their pregnancies. Ms Gemma Rowley, the chairperson of ALLY, questioned the need to print Ann's name and address. Cherish, an organisation for single parents, also made a statement. Today, Ann's name would not have been mentioned but I wish to remember her in the Seanad today. She was a friend of mine from school and she certainly made an impact on all of those that knew and loved her.

Never mind politicians, many ordinary people from minority backgrounds in Ireland do not feel safe on social media, now more than ever. In the past 24 hours, I have reported hate and threats of violence towards me for simply putting up quotes on social media. Facebook does not see that I am being threatened; it is the same with Twitter. It is inappropriate. I was threatened, to be honest. It is not just about me personally, it is about all politicians and ordinary people like black people, brown people, refugees or migrants, that is, ordinary people within our society. We all have freedom of speech and should have freedom of speech but when your speech becomes a threat and becomes hate towards a community or individual, it is no longer freedom of speech. What you are doing is hate speech. I do not need to give a lecture in this House because we are all trying. I credit the politicians on "Upfront" last night on RTÉ for showing their support for migrants and refugees. We want to show that support. I also called last week for the Minister responsible for equality to come into this House to reassure migrants and refugees about their safety in Ireland. Nobody is really safe around social media. We need to look at how we can keep people safe. I would not even say we need tougher laws because we do not need more laws to be able to protect our people, what we need is for Facebook, Twitter and all those apps and social media platforms to be able to act to protect ordinary citizens.

Cooper at Croke Park for people to learn the words of the national anthem, "Amhrán na bhFiann". There is a startling statistic that many people in this country apparently do not know the words to "Amhrán na bhFiann". A campaign is being aimed at third-class to sixth-class students, who are invited to send videos of themselves singing the national anthem. I remember when I went to primary school, the national anthem was always on the inside cover of your homework journal. I probably learned the national anthem as a six-year-old because I was in Croke Park every Sunday and the words of the national anthem were on the programmes. Being successful back then was something you learned on a weekly basis. I was proud to go to Cork last Sunday and belt it out in Páirc Uí Chaoimh as the juggernaut of Meath football relaunched again when we defeated the Cathaoirleach's county.It is a serious campaign. I pay tribute to Rachel J. Cooper for doing this. Ms Cooper is the author of Our National Anthem, a children's book. The fact that it has instigated such a debate already is amazing. There were significant debates on the breakfast programme on Newstalk yesterday about people who actually do not know the words to the national anthem. Dr. Ciara Kelly talked about how she visited to Ghana and representatives there stood up and sang their national anthem. Of the 30 people present from Ireland, not one knew the words of the Irish national anthem. That is quite a startling statistic. This campaign is worthy of the support of the Oireachtas in order that we will get a generation of young children who know the words to their national anthem.

First, I received communication from some fifth year students regarding leaving certificate 2024 and the fact that they were out of school an awful lot during second and third year. While dispensations are being made for the current cohort of leaving certificate students, it does not look like there will be any for those coming up behind. Those students were missing from school for a long period. I am going to write to the Minister for Education, Deputy Foley, but I would appreciate if the Leader could support me in respect of this matter because it affects many current fifth year students. I welcome that the Limerick to Foynes rail line is being reopened. Phase 1 is being worked on at present. However, a combination of the National Roads Authority, Iarnród Éireann and the local authority went ahead and cut all the hedges at the backs of houses for a distance of 2 km last week and did not inform the residents that this was being done. I was in one resident's house at the weekend. The noise was so bad that you would swear the motorway beyond rail line was inside the bedroom. The trees that were the barriers to noise have been taken away. This has led to people's houses along a 2 km stretch being really affected by loud noise. These people are dealing with the fact that the rail line is being worked on and that the road is now on a higher elevation than their back walls. The latter is a risk in terms of security. In addition, they are going to have trains running past their back walls. There does not seem to be any joined-up thinking on the part of the three organisations to which I refer in the context of sound barriers or looking after residents who paid major amounts of money for their lovely homes. I am going to call the Minister for Transport, but I would appreciate any support the Leader could offer in respect of this matter.

As an island nation, we are lucky enough to have a number of sailing hubs around the country. Dún Laoghaire is obviously primary among these, but Cork could be included on the list. Within the sailing communities in question are vibrant para sailing communities. People who, for one reason or another, have physical disabilities are in a position to get involved in sailing. There are vibrant para sailing communities in Ireland and internationally. Unfortunately, the International Paralympic Committee, IPC, decided yesterday that para sailing will not form part of the Paralympic Games in Los Angeles in 2028. This decision has been lamented by World Sailing, which has said it will not stop their determination to promote para sailing. Irish Sailing has stated that it will continue to foster para sailing in Ireland. That is tremendously important, but it is a real retrograde step by the IPC not to include para sailing for 2028. There has been a quiet and big risk campaign at an international level to have para sailing return to the Paralympics. It would have meant so much to so many serious international competitors on a vibrant scene. We see from the Parasailing World Championships that there are many people sailing at a very high level. Their participation would make for a wonderful competition in Los Angeles in 2028. I really regret that the IPC has decided not to do this.I join Irish sailing not only in regretting that decision but also saying we need to push harder for greater facilities, encouragement and supports for those involved in parasailing.

I was away last week. I commend him for what he said a few moments ago on the tragedy of Ann Lovett's life. Quite rightly he cited the song by Christy Moore about the middle of the island. I have to say that even now the lyrics are absolutely powerful. I lived just a few miles away from Ann Lovett. The key line is "Everybody knew, nobody said". It is powerful and still resonates to this day. I wanted to acknowledge that. At present a conversation is kicking up in the audiovisual room with Jim Clerkin of Oxfam on a stunning report it brought out last year. It is the first proper analysis of wealth globally and in Ireland. It shows a huge shift in wealth towards a very small section of people, with 1% of people in Ireland owning 27% of the wealth. This in itself is quite stunning. The top 10% own 64% of the wealth. Two thirds of the wealth in the State is owned by just 10% of the people. This is the most in-depth study done on wealth. What Oxfam is saying to us is that the report suggests that it is time to have a national conversation about a wealth tax. As things stand this is not sustainable. Even organisations such as the World Economic Forum and the IMF are saying that perhaps we need to look at this. Successful wealth taxes are already in place in Spain and Argentina. Other countries are actively looking at it. Consider the huge differentiation in wealth and the fact we see a very small section of people owning the wealth. I have the figures here. The bottom 50% of Irish society owns just 1% of the wealth. That is the reality as detailed by Oxfam. This is not sustainable. I am asking for a conversation and a debate in the Chamber.

We all know what happened in Ashtown, not only at the migrant camp last week but the community also faced the murder of a woman, Maud Coffey, a few short weeks ago. Ashtown is a multicultural place to live. It is a growing and diverse community of wonderful people. What happened last week was a disgusting and disturbing act. Probably one of the worst acts a human being can do is to target people who are more vulnerable and at a low point in their lives, and prey on them. These people are you and me and the people who attacked them are the worst of us. Fear is not a cause. In this case it is a crime. We all have to stand together against this type of action and for people who are vulnerable, defenceless and innocent. It has been said many times in the House that all it takes is somebody with an air of respectability, perhaps with success behind him or her, who can ride the wave of the right wing and create a movement that we do not want. I concur with what my colleague, Senator Sherlock, said about online media and how the message was amplified and has incited people to attack and target. I want to reflect on this and agree it is something that we must all stand against.

It is something that we have to address. I also echo the comments of Senator Keogan about Ms Ann Lovett. On this day 39 years ago, she died in a country that did not embrace all its citizens and treat them equally. People had to hide from society. As regards the post office network, hopefully that legislation will pass as soon as possible to assist the 600 plus post offices that badly need it. Go raibh maith agaibh.

I was in Kinsale at the weekend. The town is a jewel with so much going for it. The number of OPW properties and assets there is enormous. We have James Fort, Desmond Castle and the Battle of Kinsale site, as well as other OPW properties throughout the town. We need to put a coordinated plan together to make sure all of these properties and sites are open to the public. Some are and some are not. As we build our tourism identity, these are important heritage sites which have so much heritage attached to them. James Fort, Desmond Castle and the Battle of Kinsale site are really significant monuments that need to be opened up as much as they can be. There is a considerable amount of work involved in getting some of these sites open but if we had a coordinated plan to work with the local authority, the chamber of commerce and the local community then everyone would benefit. I am calling for a debate with the Minister responsible for the OPW about how we can ensure that the majority, if not all, of these OPW sites can be opened to the public.

At least that is its intention. I do not want to rehash all of that today. Suffice it to say, the Bill is in the Dáil and many of us have received hundreds and hundreds of emails about it. I tend to respond to them all as a collective group because it is important that we engage with people and people feel absolutely isolated. In essence, when one distils the information before us in these emails, which all the Senators in this room have received as is clearly indicated on them, they are calling for two things. First, they are calling for the Government to expand the redress scheme to include those who spent time in mother and baby institutions or county homes, and to make an enhanced medical card available to those survivors. Second, to extend the scheme beyond the abuses, to include boarding out and adoptive placements or abuse through forced labour, vaccine trials, racial and disability-based discrimination or illegal expatriation outside the State. These are simple issues. I am appealing to Members of this House who are members of Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael, the Labour Party and all other parties to use their influence tonight and speak to their colleagues. Let us have a bit of compassion in our politics. Let us understand the hurt and the feeling of betrayal these people have suffered. I plead with Senators to spare a little extra time and thought and demonstrate that we can show compassion, care and genuine concern for these people and provide the simple support of an enhanced medical card and some reasonable contribution towards the counselling and support services they need. We are failing them if we do not do that. They have asked this of us in hundreds of emails in the last few days. Please let us not say here today that we can walk around the corridors of this House and are indifferent. We have the power, the function and the ability to communicate with the powers that be in Dáil Éireann. I appeal to everyone in this House to do so in the next 24 hours.

I am a postmaster myself so I know the effect this Bill not being passed is having on the nearly 900 post offices around the country.It would give legislative status to the proposal put forward last June with regard to subsidising the network. Unfortunately, while we were waiting for EU approval of that Bill, all of those offices have received significant reductions in their wages in January. If the legislative process in the Seanad goes over a certain number of weeks, it is going to run into the same issues again in February. There are a lot of post offices, particularly in the city where rental costs are significantly high, which are finding it extremely difficult to meet these targets. I ask the Leader if the timeframe might be set out. I think the next Stage is due to take place on 14 February. Would it be possible to condense that process and have the Committee and Final Stages in one day, or whatever days it can be fit into the schedule, to finish as early as possible in February in order that the same situation does not occur again?
#LisaChambers	unknown-#LisaChambers-party	unknown-#LisaChambers-dob	unknown-#LisaChambers-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-01-31 00:00:00	Gnó an tSeanaid - Business of Seanad	52	I thank the Cathaoirleach and all Members who contributed to the Order of Business today. Senator Conway spoke this morning, as he has done previously, on issues around the payment outstanding to many hoteliers across the country housing refugees and providing food and board. I will ask for an update from the Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth. However the newly-appointed Minister of State in that Department, Deputy Joe O'Brien, will be in the Seanad Chamber on 15 February. There will be an opportunity for Members to question the Minister of State on that issue, and any other issues relating to the ongoing refugee challenge and to international protection. That opportunity will be there. Senator Casey raised the issue of post offices this morning, as have Senators Daly and Carrigy. Senator Casey spoke about the importance of the post office network and the lifeline thrown to them last June when a significant package of €30 million over a three-year period was given to post offices. However, enabling legislation is outstanding and it passed all Stages in the Dáil last week. I am happy to outline to the House that it is due before us on 14 February for Second Stage. We are due to have Committee Stage on 22 February and Report and Final Stages on 28 February. While it is possible to condense Stages together, it is not considered best practice and we would need to get the agreement of Opposition Members as well because it would not be considered to be emergency legislation. We can have a discussion about that at the meeting of group leaders and Whips to see if it is possible. As it stands, that is the proposed schedule and while we are due to complete all Stages by the end of February, I appreciate that every month that goes by is a challenge for those businesses and families.  Senator Craughwell made quite a lengthy statement about accountability and transparency, as he so often does. On this occasion he made reference to the Ministers and Secretaries Act and has made a specific request of me and of the Cathaoirleach to establish an ad hoc committee to review same. It is not really within my gift to do such a thing. It is within the Senator's gift at any stage to propose amending legislation to any laws currently on the Statute Book. I urge the Senator to look at what amendments he would like to bring, or bring some ideas to the House that we could debate openly on the floor. I would of course be happy to schedule such a debate.  Senator Ó Donnghaile about the Belfast to Dublin train. I was not aware that there were issues with that line. I am happy to tell the Senator that a debate has been scheduled for 23 February on the rail network and the all-island rail review. That will give an opportunity to Senator Ó Donnghaile and others to discuss the future of the country's rail network. He has also requested a debate with the Minister for Foreign Affairs on the ongoing situation in Palestine-Israel and he also wanted to extend wishes for a warm, happy St. Brigid's Day tomorrow, as he will not have an opportunity to do so then. Senator Sherlock spoke about Ashtown, as did Senator Currie, who lives in that constituency as well. That particular incident was really awful and there is not an awful lot more that can be said about that. We are all very aware of it. I just hope the individuals concerned, the victims, are being cared for and are okay. However, that was a horrifying sight to see posted on social media. Seeing the footage was horrific. However, there will be ongoing challenges in this space. It is happening in other countries. We are not alone in that regard. We have to try to tackle it in many ways and Senator Sherlock is right to say that social media has a role to play in that. We are headquarters to many of the large social media companies and they are regular attendees in Leinster House to brief Oireachtas Members and speak to us.I will request a debate with the Minister, Deputy Martin, on that aspect of this issue. It is much broader but that is one area we as policymakers and legislators can do something about. Senator Keogan spoke about Ann Lovett and I commend her on her remarks in the Chamber. It is very appropriate we acknowledge what happened to Ann. As a country we learned a lot from that situation. It changed Ireland. Unfortunately, it took a really sad situation for that change to happen. I concur also with the Cathaoirleach's remarks in that regard. Senator Flynn spoke, as she did last week, about the ongoing situation with hate. Today she spoke about the challenge many public representatives are facing in the form of online hate, abuse and being the target of a campaign. As I said, I will request a debate with the Minister, Deputy Martin, on that issue. As the Cathaoirleach has pointed out, there is work happening in the Oireachtas to try to address those safety concerns for Members, and especially female Members. There will be a meeting with the Ceann Comhairle and female Deputies and a similar meeting with ourselves and female Senators to see what we can do to try to address those safety concerns. It is better to be proactive, as opposed to reacting. Let us not wait for something more severe to happen. Is that not the point? I thank the Senator for raising the issue. Senator Cassells spoke about the campaign by Rachel J. Cooper around the national anthem and wanting to start with third- to sixth-class students to ensure every citizens have the words of anthem. It is a very worthwhile cause and I wish her well in her campaign. Senator Maria Byrne spoke about potential challenges with the 2024 leaving certificate examinations. I note the Senator's comments and understand she is going to engage directly with the Minister, Deputy Foley. I ask the Senator to come back to me if there is any assistance I can give her in that regard. She welcomed also the reopening of the Limerick-Foynes railway line but raised a particular issue around a 2 km-stretch of housing where the sand barrier has been removed to make way for the rail station but no remedial works have been done to date. I urge the Department of Transport and the local authority to look after the concerns of local residents there and ensure their homes are protected. Senator Ward spoke around an issue that, to be honest, I am not totally au fait, namely, parasailing and sailing. It would not be a huge sport in participation terms where I am from but he said there was a particular issue with the Paralympics where parasailing is not going to be permitted as a sport. It is an important issue he has raised. Senator Gavan also spoke about Ann Lovett and drew the House's attention, though I think everyone is aware anyway, to Oxfam launching its report in the audiovisual room today. I think that was at 4 p.m., so it is probably still going on. The Senator has asked for a debate on a wealth tax. I might have a conversation with him about that. I am not sure we would have a debate on a single tax proposal as that probably would not be appropriate. I ask the Senator to come back with a wider topic for discussion in the area of finance and taxation n which we could have a discussion in the House. Senator Currie spoke about the situation in Ashtown and spoke very passionately about her community. Senator Mark Daly spoke about the campaign against public representatives and the work that has been done by his office and with the Cathaoirleach as well. He also concurred with the remarks around Ann Lovett and the post office network. Senator Lombard asked for a debate with the Minister of State with responsibility for the OPW and I will request that. Senator Boyhan spoke very passionately, as he often does, around the issue of the mother and baby homes and the redress scheme. I think we are all acutely aware of the challenges there and the deficiencies in parts of what has been offered, as well as those who have been left out. We will get one opportunity to do this right and I hope it is done right, to the benefit of survivors and to ensure people are cared for and looked after in what was a very black mark on our history. We will forever be ashamed of how we dealt with women and children in this country. We are still dealing with it and we are not dealing with it very well, but at least it is out in the open now - most of it - and we are coming to terms with that as a country, though we have a long way to go yet. Senator Carrigy spoke about the post office network as well. I have outlined the schedule that is proposed for the month to come but we will revisit that topic across parties and across groups.

Is Bille tábhachtach é an Bille um Fhorais Chultúir Náisiúnta (An Ceoláras Náisiúnta) (Leasú) 2022. It represents a crucial step forward in the journey of the National Symphony Orchestra, the choirs and the National Concert Hall. It is a critical part of the National Concert Hall's ambitious vision for the development of symphonic music, with the restored symphony orchestra taking its place in a 21st century concert hall. The legislation will also help to support the concert hall's efforts to return the orchestra to full strength by embedding it and the choirs into the corporate structure of the concert hall. The amendment to increase the limit of the State indemnity is a necessary measure that will support our cultural institutions to continue to present exhibitions of international quality to the Irish public.

The correct text of the subsection is as follows:‘‘(3) Domestic violence leave shall consist of one or more days on which, but for the leave, the employee would be working in the employment concerned but shall not exceed 5 days in any period of 12 consecutive months."I just wanted Members to be aware of that issue.
#AliceMaryHiggins	unknown-#AliceMaryHiggins-party	unknown-#AliceMaryHiggins-dob	unknown-#AliceMaryHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-01-31 00:00:00	Gnó an tSeanaid - Business of Seanad	69	I move amendment No. 1:In page 7, line 12, after “child,” to insert “foster parent,”.Amendments No. 1 and 12 deal with the same issue, which is the concern that some of those who are providing parental care may accidentally or inadvertently fall outside the remit of the Bill. Amendment No. 1 seeks to include foster parents within the definition of "relevant parent" under the Bill. Whether or not it is the relevant parent in another context, in the context of this Bill people may, for example, have to take periods of leave or need to address particular care for a child. I believe it is important that foster parents would be included in that. My understanding of it at the moment is that the phrase "in loco parentis" does not actually cover or account for foster carers as relevant parents in the same way that in many circumstances social workers are the designated people acting in loco parentis, and foster parents may need to seek permission from social workers around making decisions for the children's care. If this is not a concern, or if it is included, it would be useful to have it clarified. It is a concern I am hearing from foster parents that it is not clear to them whether they are covered by this scope of the Bill. I do not believe it is the intention of the Bill that foster parents who do need flexible arrangements in respect of the care needs of the child in their care are not able to access the provision of this Bill. Similarly, amendment No. 12 addresses the same issue about "in loco parentis", what it actually covers and who it includes. I have suggested the removal of the phrase there but I would also be happy if we had "in loco parentis" or "providing parental care" in the definition of relevant parent. Instead of replacing it I am happy to expand that section in amendment No. 12, which is section 13AA. There are a couple of other categories - which I will not speak to now because I will have amendments later - where I feel the definition is too narrow in terms of other caring relationships. Amendments Nos. 1 and 12, however, relate specifically to the issue of those providing parental care.

It is one of Ireland's most ambitious Bills dedicated solely to improving work–life balance. I look forward to the detailed discussion we are going to have. Not only will the Bill transpose EU law on work–life balance for parents and carers but it will also implement some important programme for Government commitments. It delivers a right to request flexible working so mothers, fathers and carers can be present for their children and families. It will deliver five days of leave per year to provide care to those with serious medical issues, such that in the most stressful moments of parents' or carers' lives, they can focus solely on supporting the person who is ill. The Bill will extend breast-feeding breaks from six months after birth to two years after birth and, significantly, introduce five days' paid leave for victims of domestic violence. There are 29 Government amendments. They are primarily technical. With respect to Senator Higgins's amendment, section 3 provides for the interpretation of terms used in the Bill. A definition of "relevant parent" has been provided that mirrors that in the Parental Leave Act 1998, which is the Act being amended. The Senator's amendment would include an explicit reference to foster parents. However, the definition of "relevant parent" includes a person acting in loco parentis to the child and would in our view encompass a person caring for the child in a foster relationship. As such, we see the amendments as unnecessary. As the definition in the Bill is one used in the Parental Leave Act 1998, it would not be appropriate to make the proposed change. Amendment No. 12 is a similar amendment. It seeks to remove the term "in loco parentis" from the provisions on domestic violence leave and substitute "providing parental care". The term "in loco parentis" would have the meaning desired. It is already used in the Parental Leave Act and various definitions in this Bill and therefore the proposal is not necessary. However, it is very much our intention to include foster parents, so I will be happy to get officials to triple-check. It is certainly our intention to have foster parents included within the definition of "in loco parentis".

Many groups that made a recommendation to the Joint Committee on Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth on the Bill recommended the removal of the six-month employment eligibility criterion. It is our view that this will negatively affect lone parents who may be in need of flexibility in order to take up a job in the first place. Those returning to work following a period out of the labour market for care are more likely to be women, as are workers on temporary contracts. Our view is that retaining the six-month employment eligibility criterion will prevent lone parents from taking up employment, directly contributing to the ongoing high rates of poverty, at 13.1% in respect of deprivation and 44.9% in respect of this cohort.
#AliceMaryHiggins	unknown-#AliceMaryHiggins-party	unknown-#AliceMaryHiggins-dob	unknown-#AliceMaryHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-01-31 00:00:00	Gnó an tSeanaid - Business of Seanad	75	I support the amendment. I have similar amendments, relating to another Part of the Bill, on the six-month criterion. The six-month requirement makes it less likely that people will be able to enter employment in the first place because requiring full-time availability for six months with no flexibility is exactly the obstacle for those who are parenting alone or returning to the workforce. One of the huge employment issues in Ireland is that women, in particular, tend to leave the workforce and then face an obstacle on re-entering. Where an employer is considering what is needed for the employment and so forth, I would imagine that there are many circumstances in which the employer would indeed be very happy to arrange and accommodate a flexible working arrangement for somebody re-entering the workplace, perhaps with significant skills. There is a presumption that such an arrangement is granted rather than something that just makes sense for both the employer and the employee. It is unnecessary to have such a large obstacle. It means there may be a six-month hurdle, perhaps involving childcare and trying to get care arrangements in place, before one can re-enter the workforce, rather than being able to have a conversation very early on about flexible working arrangements.

I have checked and double-checked my thinking on it to make sure I am accurate. While I have great sympathy for the points made by Senators Warfield and Higgins, I believe the amendment is about substituting the 26 weeks for one week in the context of ceasing employment. I note the Minister nodding, so it must be right. If I end my employment with an employer and return to work with that employer within 26 weeks, the period before my ending the employment is added on when it comes to the calculation of my service for the purpose of the operation of this Act. It is taken as continuous employment. I have read and reread the legislation. While the Senators' sentiments are correct, they are misplaced in respect of section 4. They do not accurately reflect what is stated in the section. The section refers to the calculation of service and states that as long as one re-enters employment within six months after leaving, one's employment is regarded as continuous in the calculation of service. While the argument on six months is for a later point, with which I have sympathy, it is unnecessary at this point because the legislation states something that differs from what the Senators are saying it states. I am loath to make these remarks.

As drafted, it would mean that only previous employment in the past week would qualify as continuous service for the purpose of calculation. I do not believe that is the intention of the Senator in the circumstances but it is the result of the amendment proposed.

It points to a gap in the understanding of care and medical care leave in the Bill. My amendment would seek to amend the provisions. The list of relevant persons included in the Bill is quite narrow. The Child and Family Relationships Act recognises the many and complex relationships that children and each of us may have. The most relevant person to a person in need of medical care may not always be a spouse, cohabitant, brother or sister.My amendment does not expand it indefinitely, allowing multiple persons to take medical leave. Instead, it seeks to expand it to cover cases where people are in hospital or need medical care and no one else applies to give them that medical care. Relationships are complicated. People may be estranged from their parents and unwilling to provide that medical care for them. In such circumstances, an aunt or an uncle may be in a position to provide that medical care and should be allowed to do so. Similarly, a person's niece or nephew may be able to provide that care. If somebody is sick and needs that medical care but does not have children or a spouse, it may be the case that a niece or nephew could provide it. The section provides for the provision of care to grandparents but not grandchildren. This amendment includes grandchildren of an employee who need care as relevant persons where a parent of that grandchild cannot provide it. This acknowledges the reality of relationships. As we have discussed when dealing with other legislation, relationships are complicated. I am not suggesting we add these in as extra categories but rather that we provide that, where no parent, grandparent, cohabitant, spouse or brother or sister has applied for leave to provide medical care, this slightly expanded range of relatives might be allowed to apply for that medical care leave. It would show an understanding and prevent situations in which persons are left isolated. Given the pressures on our hospitals and so on at the moment, we know it can sometimes be something as simple as there being somebody who can provide a certain amount of care that allows someone to make the transition out of hospital or acute care and into their own home. It would be a pity if we did not facilitate that.

This amendment would extend the cohort of parents and carers who are entitled to avail of leave for medical care purposes. I appreciate that there is a wide range of potential caring relationships but the Bill very much follows the definitions set out in the EU work-life balance directive, which is itself very broad and encompasses a significant range of family and other household relationships. The Bill provides an entitlement to leave for medical care purposes for the care of: a person of whom the employee is the relevant parent; the spouse or civil partner of the employee; his or her cohabitant; his or her brother or sister; or a person other than one specified in any of the relevant subparagraphs of the section who resides in the same household as the employee and is need of significant care or support for a serious medical reason. A broad set of categories and familial relations are already provided for in this legislation. I do not believe we need to make this particular amendment.

If someone is coming out of hospital, to use the Senator's example, the term "resides" is loose enough to encompass these categories where a need arises. I believe an employer would be open to taking that into account. Section 6 is broad enough to include everything suggested in the amendment and other arrangements, including people who are very close and who share a house but who are not actually cohabitants. It is loose enough to include any sort of relationship really, should the need arise.
#AliceMaryHiggins	unknown-#AliceMaryHiggins-party	unknown-#AliceMaryHiggins-dob	unknown-#AliceMaryHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-01-31 00:00:00	Gnó an tSeanaid - Business of Seanad	85	The term "cohabitant" is not always interpreted that widely, although it does cover certain households. To be clear, the provisions of the EU directive are a signal of direction, an encouragement and a move in the right direction, but they do not set a limit on what we can do. Just as many countries had much better parental leave policies than Europe required them to have, there is nothing that says we cannot have something that is better or that goes further. Ireland has a particular record in recognising different kinds of relationships, for example, through the Children and Family Relationships Act 2015. That is important. I do not believe some of the circumstances my amendment provides for would be used too much because I have included the safeguard that, if any of these other people, such a parent, have used the provisions of this section, those included in my amendment may not. For example, a cohabitant may have used the medical care leave. This only applies to those circumstances where no one is taking medical care leave in respect of a person who needs medical care. Take for example a grandparent who has a 19-year-old grandchild whom nobody else is coming to help. That grandchild may not live with that grandparent. Unfortunately, we have had situations where grandparents have been the carers for grandchildren. The parents may not be in a position to be the main carer. If you are a grandparent who works and your 19-year-old grandchild is in need of medical care, in circumstances where nobody else is stepping in, you should be able to. I am not going to force this-----

It does not work both ways. It covers grandparents but not grandchildren. It covers half that relationship. I put it to the Minister that, between now and Report Stage, he should consider this and see if there is any practical reason not to do this other than that Europe is not making us. I do not believe these provisions would be taken up to any great degree but, in a number of individual circumstances, it could make a significant difference. Again, my amendment covers aunts and uncles, nieces and nephews and grandchildren. I will not press it now but I will bring it back on Report Stage and push it at that time. It is worth considering whether there is any reason not to do this.

Particularly in rural areas, that person might be an elderly man who is no relation whatsoever. That man is the person who calls to the person in need of care and who is there. There is no other person. The Bill should be extended.The Department should consider that in many situations where an individual coming out of hospital needs emergency care for a short time for a serious medical reason, the person providing that care may not be a relation but there is no one else to provide it. It would be interesting to see if an amendment was possible on Report Stage to provide such an extension, albeit not in too wide a manner. It should be an extension with restrictions. It should apply solely where there is no one else available to provide the care.

We need to provide certainty for employers. If we are too broad in the provisions, we will end up with a situation whereby any person could, at any time, seek to avail a protected category of leave - that is the entitlement we are providing for here - in respect of any other person. That would leave employers in a precarious situation and unable to plan because such a situation could arise at any point. We need to be careful not to broaden it out too far. As regards grandchildren, if a grandparent is the only person who can take leave in respect of a child needing medical care, the likelihood is that grandparent is in loco parentis. All present are aware of such instances. I am not sure it is not arguable under that. The proposed section 13A(2)(a)(vi) provides for a very broad category of persons, namely, those residing with an individual who has a serious medical condition, where those two things combine. They do not have to be a cohabitee; they just have to be residing in the same household. It is arguable as to how inclusive or definite the interpretation of residing would be, or the duration in that regard. Any legal person worth his or her salt would be able to argue for the inclusion of a person within that category if the situation arose and it was needed. What is provided for in that regard is wide enough and has scope to include anything that may arise where the care is needed.

The inclusion of "grandchild" is very important for this legislation and I ask the Minister to consider that provision. It is a relevant piece of care that can be given. I agree with Senator Higgins that in loco parentis applies only in respect of children up to the age of 18. After that, the young person falls under the adult services.

The amendment would extend this entitlement to ten days. The Bill is introducing a range of new entitlements, and that is positive. These entitlements have been discussed at length with social partners, unions and representatives of employers. I have engaged in some of those negotiations, as have my officials. It has to be understood in the context of other developments, such as the extension of paid parent's leave which, as we know, has gone from two weeks to seven weeks per parent during the lifetime of this Government. It is important that any changes we make are balanced in terms of their impact on employers. This is why we had always indicated it would be five days under this heading. It is relevant to note that carer's leave and carer's benefit may also be available to some people under this heading. I am not in a position to accept the amendment.

I apologise for my confusion there for a hot second. I raised this issue with the Taoiseach at the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Gender Equality. We have consistently made the point that many companies provide more than five days' leave. In the North, there is more than five days' leave. We thought the Government should go further. I will press the amendment. I have made these points on many occasions. As I stated on the previous amendment, many groups made a submission to the children's committee on the Bill and recommended the substitution of "10 days" for "5 days", in line with international best practice and sectors that had already commenced such a policy in Ireland, including the higher education sector, with the support of the Minister for Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science, Deputy Harris.

It must also be considered whether supplying medical information on a third party to an employer is consistent with the general data protection regulation, GDPR.

Requiring a medical certificate in respect of a third party creates its own difficulty but I am particularly concerned that some of the language, especially that on page 10, is a little excessive in the way it is framed. It refers to such information as the employer may reasonably require in relation to the employee's relationship, the nature of the personal care or support and the evidence relating to the need of the person. It is quite expansively framed. I appreciate there needs to be a mechanism whereby the relationship and the reason for having to take this medical leave is stated but medical information is one of the special categories of information under section 10 of the GDPR. It is important that necessity and proportionality measures be included in the context of information being sought and provided, rather than it just being a case of that information being reasonably required by the employer. By framing this just in terms of what an employer may want, it poses the risk that persons will be asked to give detailed personal or medical information in respect of a third party. A minimalist approach should be taken in this regard. I appreciate there needs to be something but it should be at an absolute minimum. I reserve the right to bring amendments on Report Stage to provide that proportionality and necessity requirements apply to that information.

A medical certificate has a specific meaning in all of our heads. We expect it to have a particular content of information. Since the introduction of the GDPR, employers are not requiring that any more. They just need to certify that somebody is absent without stating the reason for it, as long as it is on a headed paper and stamped by a GP or private doctor. Perhaps clarity in that regard, in that we do not need to disclose the information regarding the third party, but verifying that it hits the standard within this Act, is a reasonable request. Perhaps that could be clarified on the record.

The touchstone of policy development from a data protection perspective is that the design of the system should seek to achieve the minimum invasion of privacy rights, be they third party or otherwise, while also achieving the legitimate objective of ensuring that the employer concerned has the sufficient information they need to base any necessary decisions. There is a legislative basis for the processing of such data through the general data protection regulation and the Data Protection Act 2018. Both the GDPR and the Data Protection Act will apply in relation to the obligations on an employer in terms of processing, storing and the destruction of personal information, be that third party or otherwise.  The provisions of the Bill strike the balance required in that they require the minimum information necessary. It is important to note they are in line with existing provisions in family leave legislation, in particular the Parental Leave Act, which this Bill amends. Information of a similar nature is sought for other forms of leave, such as parental leave, where information on the child can be requested, including on any disability. Similarly, for force majeure leave, a statement of facts must be provided to support the leave. We have achieved the correct balance, reflecting on the fact that the implementation of this request by an employer has to be done in a way that is GDPR-compliant.

The phrase he used, “the minimum information necessary”, is not in the Bill, rather it states, "such information as the employer may reasonably require in relation to ... the employee’s relationship with the person", and relationship can be construed many ways, and refers to “the nature of the personal care or support”. That is the detail of what a person will do in terms of personal or support. It addition, the employer may require relevant evidence around the needs of the person concerned for significant care or support.  I urge the Minister to take on board reasonable points that were made on the language. We have this opportunity now between Committee and Report Stage. I have suggested one route and alternative perspective that would achieve the same aim as suggested by Senator Seery Kearney, which is something that makes clear the basic requirement that the relationship satisfies the criteria and not the nature or anything that might be reasonably necessary, but whether it fits the criteria, for example, that there is a medical need and the person is in one of the named relationships. Once that is evidenced, then by leaving it as to the employer’s reasonable requirement, which each employer may or may not interpret, the Minister is relying on each employer interpreting that in a way that will be necessary and proportionate, rather than making it clear in the Bill. Why not just make it clear in the Bill? Then every employer knows what it is meant to do. There will not be a situation where you have to have a long chat with an employer where it is asking you questions and it does not know what it can ask you and you do not know what you have to tell it.  Let us make it clear, and there is a chance to do that between Committee and Report Stage. Necessity and proportionality is one simple way to do it.

It is a useful Government amendment in terms of extending the purposes of domestic leave to include other relevant services. The list in the original Bill was well intentioned but inevitably there are certain other services, including, for example, financial services and the separation of finances, which is one of the most difficult things for people who are trying to leave a situation of domestic abuse, or a parent needing to go to a child’s school and make arrangements in that respect. There are a number of circumstances that may arise. It is a wise decision of the Government to include this slightly wider catch-all of other relevant services. I welcome it.

I refer to the phrase "the state of the economy generally, the business environment and national competitiveness". The idea that the state of the economy in general would be a reason for providing or not providing people with leave in situations where they are experiencing violence or abuse or are in danger is a little bizarre. We do not put that kind of caveat on lots of things, but to impose it in this regard would be a real danger. This is not a luxury; having domestic violence leave is not something that we add on because if the economy is doing great, we can afford to give the women something. It is an essential and sensible provision to include. In terms of the regulations, I am not objecting to the new subsection (7)(b), which refers to "the state of society generally, the public interest and employee well-being". That recognises that there are many other circumstances which might mitigate the need for this leave - if we have much better social supports, for example, or if there are much better other supports around persons experiencing domestic violence. However, the idea that competitiveness and the business environment would be determinants is problematic. If we were to attach that to every kind of leave or measure, we would find ourselves in a race to the bottom because the economy is always in flux. We have had four or five crises of different kinds in the time I have been a Senator. It is a little bit of a hostage to fortune to place that as a caveat on something that is genuinely positive and laudable, that is, the fact that Ireland is stepping up and recognising domestic violence. This is part of a progression that began with the recognition of coercive control, which Seanad Éireann fought for and won. Domestic violence leave is part of a move forward but the language used in lines 38 and 39 is inappropriate and should be removed from the Bill. This section relates to prescribing the rate of domestic violence leave pay and there are other issues which we will come to around leave pay. Amendment No. 9 seeks the deletion of the new subsection (7)(c) for reasons similar to the reasons behind my seeking the deletion of the new subsection (7)(a). This subsection refers to the "potential impact, including the potential for any disproportionate or other adverse impact, that the rate of domestic violence leave pay to be prescribed will have on the economy generally, specific sectors of the economy, employers or employees ". Again, if we are talking about something that is very particular because it is an emergency measure, then what we do not want is special pleading from a specific sector like hospitality, for example. We do not want arguments against decent rates of domestic leave pay because a specific sector of the economy cannot pay them. Hospitality is a specific sector of the economy and is great at special pleading. The Minister is looking at me sceptically, but these provisions are in the Bill. If we do not think these measures or provisions will be used, why are they in the Bill? Why include them? Why put in place caveats in respect of special sectors of the economy in the context of whether people will be given pay? Why include those provisions? It is better for the legislation to be clear that this is something we are doing wholeheartedly and clearly because we are focused on the rights of those experiencing domestic violence and it is not something that will be variable vis-à-vis whether sectors of the economy can afford to be decent. Amendment No. 10 seeks to insert a new provision into the subsection (7)(e), which explicitly includes "service providers working in the area of domestic violence" in the expert opinion that the Minister may consider in the context of paragraphs (a) to (d), inclusive. All of these amendments relate to the regulations that the Minister will make with regard to domestic violence leave and the rates of leave pay. The views of employer representative bodies and trade unions are included, as is the need to obtain expert opinion. However, one of the missing pieces, which may or may not be construed as part of expert opinion, is the specific opinion of service providers. Service providers, those which people are taking domestic violence leave to access, are going to be able to give the Minister very important information in respect of what kind of time people need and what is actually involved when somebody is seeking one of the services under this legislation. These service providers may be covered by the phrase "expert opinion, research, national or international reports", but explicitly naming them would be very useful. They are the bodies to which persons availing of this leave will be going and they have the greatest sense of what is needed. Women's Aid wrote to Senators to raise issues relating to the rate of pay, and there are questions in this regard. There are differences of opinion on the idea of full replacement. I understand that Women's Aid is seeking full replacement. In general, there is a concern in the context of having unequal levels of payment in terms of who is getting what, but there is a unique circumstance relating to domestic violence leave that favours having full replacement, namely, that one of the main forms that domestic abuse takes - and we know this from coercive control - is financial control. The very fact of having a dip in one's income is, itself, a potential signal to an abuser. Those who are in coercive control situations, which are often tied up with domestic violence, do not have financial independence or full control of their own finances. One of the things that makes it very difficult for people to leave an abusive situation is the scrutiny of their finances and it is one of the reasons domestic violence is leave is so important. People often do not have control of what they are doing except for when they are at work. Those are the hours that are accounted for which allow them to make arrangements and that is why it is important that they take leave then because they do not have control of their evenings, in some cases. Every hour after work might be monitored by an abusive partner. Similarly, their finances may be monitored. Regardless of one's view on replacement rates in general, this is a particular circumstance that should be considered in the making of these regulations in terms of the rate of domestic leave pay. That is where that expertise on domestic violence hopefully comes in. Amendment No. 11 also refers to the issue of service providers and their expert opinions. The strength of this is that it gives a wider level of input for them. I wish to indicate to the Minister that I might be tabling some more amendments on this matter for Report Stage because these regulations will be the crux of how this works, and whether it actually works. I do not want us to be dependent solely on the Minister's goodwill or the goodwill of a future Minister. I would like the regulations themselves and the criteria around them to be really clear and rights driven, rather than interest balancing.

In a way, providing domestic violence leave is another step forward for us as a nation in saying this is not tolerable. Creating a set of circumstances whereby we will provide it or limit it depending on the economy, does not send out the right message. That is not in any way in keeping with what our position and intention as legislators would be. There are many unnecessary and peculiar things in the Bill that read in a meanspirited way and contrary to the thrust, momentum and intention of this legislation. With regard to the Women's Aid perspective, the idea that we would align what a woman is paid, if she needs to take domestic violence leave, with that of sick pay and not with a full day's rate of pay brings on a level of financial hardship at a very precarious and vulnerable time. When that level of coercive control is in place, everything is monitored. People have their phone's cloned. Absolutely everything in their life is controlled. Thus, seeing a sudden dip in wages gives rise to queries. If someone is controlling another individual to that point, he or she will give a good guess about 70% of the individual's rate of pay. The Women's Aid perspective on this is valid, as it calls it, in the context of a safety risk. Women's Aid is absolutely right. We should be hesitant about supporting or putting in place anything that points to an individual exercising an opportunity to get out of domestic violence or to free himself or herself from such a situation and might give that away to the perpetrator. We should be assisting that individual in keeping his or her privacy and not being exposed to this safety risk.
#MarieSherlock	unknown-#MarieSherlock-party	unknown-#MarieSherlock-dob	unknown-#MarieSherlock-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-01-31 00:00:00	Gnó an tSeanaid - Business of Seanad	121	I very much welcome the introduction of domestic violence leave in this legislation. It is very important. I ask the Minister to consider amendments Nos. 10 and 11, because they are absolutely worthy of consideration and inclusion in the Bill. As for the criteria when the Minister is determining what the rate of pay should be by regulation, this is a copy-and-paste job from the workers' rights legislation we have. The sectoral employment orders, the national minimum wage and sick pay are the criteria. I know the percentage rate of pay is not specified here but we know from sick pay that the rate is 70%. It is worth highlighting it will be less than 70% if the board and lodgings are included. Let us think about that for a moment. If a person who is experiencing domestic violence wishes to seek domestic violence leave and is already living at his or her workplace or availing of bed and board and lodgings, he or she will receive less than the percentage the Minister will specify. A considerable issue here is putting ourselves into the shoes of somebody who will put himself or herself forward to take this leave. The real question is as to whether a person will shy away from taking the leave if he or she has to think twice about it. We really want this leave to work. We wish to see that those who need to take this leave will take it up. However, if they will be out of pocket and there will be issues about payroll and having to run through a different rate of pay relative to everybody else, people will shy away from saying they need to take this leave. The appeal from the three of us here this evening and I am sure from others, is for the Minister to really consider the criteria being set down. The criteria seem to consider everybody else other than the person, especially in using the state of the economy generally or the impact on the domestic economy. Such a consideration seems heartless and unrelated to the leave in question. I urge the Minister to tighten up the criteria and to send a signal that it will not be the 70% rate and should be the full rate, because it would set out a very important message. Countries such as New Zealand, Italy and others have set domestic violence leave at a full rate of pay. I would love to see our country follow suit.
#FintanWarfield	unknown-#FintanWarfield-party	unknown-#FintanWarfield-dob	unknown-#FintanWarfield-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-01-31 00:00:00	Gnó an tSeanaid - Business of Seanad	122	I risk being slightly repetitive. As Women's Aid noted, during the Second Stage debate in the Seanad, the Minister stated the Government is looking at parity of pay for domestic violence leave with sick pay. As my Labour Party colleague just pointed out, the proposal is modelled on the Sick Leave Act 2022 among others and is in line with the proposal by the Minister's Department. The report on domestic violence leave recommended that the daily payment from the employer be 70% of daily salary rate capped at €110 per day and that a minimum rate entitlement should also be set. Sinn Féin disagrees with that on a number of grounds, including financial hardship. Women experiencing domestic abuse and coercive control are often subjected to financial abuse, frequently do not have access to savings or family assets and have to survive on very tight budgets. Losing 30% of their daily salary if taking the leave may be very difficult for them, create real hardships for women and children and play against them taking domestic leave. Domestic violence leave may be taken by women who are in the process of questioning the relationship or leaving the abuser. The need for counselling, court and relocation are some of the reasons for taking domestic violence leave. Separation is not only a very dangerous time but also one when women face additional and significant expenses such as legal expenses and finding alternative accommodation. Therefore, a decrease in income would be highly problematic. Safety risks are another issue. If a woman's income is monitored or appropriated by her abuser or both, a change in her normal salary may alert the abuser. That point has been mentioned already. On privacy, unfortunately, there is still considerable stigma attached to domestic abuse and fear of the abuse becoming common knowledge in the workplace may prevent a survivor from accessing domestic violence leave. If the normal salary is paid, this would minimise domestic violence leave being identified in payslips and payrolls, while employers could still keep track of it separately. We disagree with the proposal and strongly believe that domestic violence leave should be paid in full at the normal rate of pay. I raise these issues in order to bring an amendment on Report Stage if necessary.

I wish to speak on behalf of women in Dundalk Women's Aid with whom I work quite often and who struggle to get out of domestic violence. We heralded this legislation as positive - which it is. However, we are putting up an extra barrier with a potential financial penalty and, possibly, safety risks and a lack of privacy. I cannot remember the number of efforts it takes by a woman to consider leaving a domestic violence situation. The wish and spirit of this Bill is not to put up another barrier or for people to feel domestic violence leave is at arm's length, or that there are risks attached to applying for such leave.I would appreciate it if this were to be examined. It is a little meanspirited.

That was misstated earlier. The introduction of new leave is negotiated with the social partners with whom the Government engages. As part of that engagement, some small employer groups raised real and genuine concerns, considering their circumstances, about the introduction of this leave, particularly as paid leave. Nevertheless, it is important the Government has taken the important step of going ahead. The Senator asked about setting the rate. I am not sure it is correct to discount completely the views of employers in determining the rate, especially when that determination also involves the consideration of the state of society generally, the public interest and, importantly, employee well-being. Consideration of the needs of specific employees is part of what we are trying to achieve and is part of the consideration, but I am not sure that entirely removing consideration of the views of employers sets the right balance. The Senator also mentioned the issue of replacement. It is important to remember we have included a two-year review in this legislation to examine the take-up of domestic, sexual and gender-based violence, DSGBV, leave. We are doing something new here. We will be among the first countries in Europe to introduce such a measure. Only a small number of countries in the world have brought in paid leave at a national level. A couple of federal states in various jurisdictions have brought in such leave. We are putting in that review position. We normally let legislation go a little longer, but because of the importance of this, we are reviewing it in two years to consider the level of take-up. Where we see barriers to take-up or wider issues with the way in which the legislation is framed, we will have the opportunity at that stage to bring forward relevant amendments. Amendment No. 11 seeks to include explicitly domestic violence service providers. I believe their views are already included as the Bill is set out. The relevant provision is contained in section 13AA(7)(e) which refers to expert opinion, research and national and international reports. Those relate to the matters specified in sections 13AA(7)(a) to 13AA(7)(d), inclusive. I particularly draw the attention of Senators to section 13AA(7)(b) which refers to the state of society generally, the public interest and employee well-being. I see that as a clear route to bring in information about employee well-being, especially for employees who have suffered from DSGBV. There is a clear route and there could be no more appropriate source of information in respect of decisions about the rate. Those provisions are included in the legislation so I do not believe it is necessary to list explicitly the views of service providers. I believe there is already protection in that regard.
#AliceMaryHiggins	unknown-#AliceMaryHiggins-party	unknown-#AliceMaryHiggins-dob	unknown-#AliceMaryHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-01-31 00:00:00	Gnó an tSeanaid - Business of Seanad	125	The problem, as others have pointed out, is that the tool the Minister has described has been borrowed from another toolbox. It is not a tool designed for this situation. The Minister referred to balancing different interests. Are we tackling domestic violence and trying to introduce domestic violence leave? A rights-based approach recognises domestic violence as an egregious breach of human rights. We as a society should have no tolerance for it. Workplaces and all other parts of society are due to challenge and address domestic violence. Is that the approach we are taking? Are we balancing our approach to measure its effect on employers and employees? Tackling domestic violence is not just a nice thing for employees to have. It is essential to make our society more equal. It is central to making us a society that does not have the scourge of violence, domestic violence and violence against women in different forms. Those acts of violence occur internationally but have a long history in Ireland. This is a different matter from negotiating between interest groups. It is a rights-bases piece. It is not a matter of balancing the interests of employers and employees. This is something we as a society are trying to take robust steps to tackle. I do not know who is concerned about domestic violence leave in particular business sectors and I will not hazard a guess. The Minister has made it clear that the issue is not about whether the leave will happen but rather about the rate that will apply. If we balance interests in the way the Minister has suggested, we may end up with a meaningless rate of domestic violence leave with so many caveats that it becomes effectively unusable. I appreciate the Minister has referenced on multiple occasions the section that mentions the state of society generally, the public interest and employee well-being. I am not trying to remove that part of the Bill. I like that section. In fact, I think the references to the state of society generally and the public interest are sufficient to cover the economic elements. Where there are economic issues that might affect the public interest of economic factors within society generally, section 13AA(7)(b), which refers to the state of society generally and the public interest, is sufficient. However, we should not be balancing the public interest, society and employee well-being against the specific preferences of different sectors, whether it has been a good or bad year for any one sector and whether companies in some sectors believe they can afford to offer this paid leave. I urge the Minister to consider section 13AA(7)(a) and some of the language that is used in section 13AA(7)(c). It is still inappropriate. The Minister is not an adjudicator around a balancing of interests. He is the Minister with responsibility for equality and is trying to address a social ill and ensure our employment regulations reflect and support that. That consideration needs to be centre stage in the mission. I urge the Minister to take a more ambitious and thoughtful approach and to use the right criteria. I also urge him to listen. There are separate issues around piece work, extra work and overtime, but we need the basic rate of pay to remain the same because of the safety issue. The Minister is recommending the use of a particular tool for a particular set of circumstances but the circumstance we are considering is one in which a person may be unsafe. I know it is hard to bring forward these arguments. We argued in the Seanad for coercive control legislation and were told by a Minister for Justice that all the tools we had already would work. We kept saying they do not work. It took quite an argument for even the officials to understand that coercive control was particular and required particular measures to tackle it. I am glad there was a shift in understanding and a willingness to listen to the detail and reality of people's experiences and to design policy that works for people rather than taking existing policy tools and simply trying to ram them into a new situation. There was a real breakthrough on coercive control. As the Minister has said, we have the opportunity to be leaders in respect of domestic violence leave. It would be a brilliant initiative if we had good legislation. Because we are leaders and one of the first to do it, we must do it right. Let us design it for the actual needs of those experiencing domestic violence. Let us set a good template rather than borrow an old template. Let us set a good template for other countries which I hope will follow and bring in similar leave.

I will talk about the Title first. I do not believe the Bill at any point stipulates the kinds of working arrangements that might be available. Much emphasis has been put on remote working over recent years for obvious reasons. Remote working is only one part of flexible working; there are many others. Without reference to the types of possible flexible working arrangements, people will not know what to ask for. For instance, it can be core working hours, flexible hours or compressed hours. Does any part of the Bill spell out what flexible working arrangements actually are? It is great that this is being offered to carers and parents. While we are making it easier for them, we are not challenging the status quo that it is normally women who take parental leave and who will request flexible working arrangements. In 2020, Permanent TSB carried out a survey which indicated that 33% of men and 22% of women would not take parental leave as they would be concerned about it damaging their career progression. The level of uptake of parental leave is extremely low. Even in my old job in advertising and marketing, taking parental leave was unheard of; people just did not do it. I have always been of the view that flexible working arrangements should not just be for parents and carers; it should be for employees. That is how we change the culture. Without having reference to the types of flexible working arrangements available, how can we communicate to people that they will now have the option of doing this? How will they know? How might employers know how to manage it when employees come to ask? It is asking a lot of people for them to know themselves, for example, that they can ask for compressed hours when the culture is not there for such hours. Other countries' legislation has standardised types of flexibility. For instance, Finland has core working hours and predominantly for office workers it has compressed hours. It has flexible hours and it has remote working hours. As has been discussed throughout, it is an ideological debate at this stage. Is it for parents and carers or can it be for all workers? I am still in the persuasion mode I am hoping that it can be expanded to all employees.

I agree with everything Senator Currie said. In some ways our amendment strikes to the very heart of the Bill and what I see as an artificial distinction between remote work and flexible work. In the world of work people want flexibility on both hours and location. We have already heard the debate here about who should be included - whether within a family a niece or nephew or even a neighbour is included. As we all know, life is messy. I am very uncomfortable that we would prescribe the types of caring responsibilities that take place in households. Flexible work is not just about children or care, although, obviously, that is what is being alluded to here. It is about so much more than that. It is about the ability to take public transport or to consider alternative means of working. I continually come up against this and I am sure the Minister is also hearing it. People want flexible hours because travelling to work during rush hour will take them twice as long as would be the case if they can start a bit earlier or a bit later. That is a really simple thing. If we are serious about trying to encourage people onto buses or trains or to cycle - I know from trying to encourage people to cycle that they do not want to cycle while the city is heaving but maybe cycle a bit later - then we must allow those flexible hours. My appeal is that we allow flexible work for all. I know this legislation is subject to review within a certain period, but why wait for that review, why not do this now? I refer to the difference in the uptake of flexible work between men and women. A legitimate concern has been expressed that in giving flexible work rights to certain workers, only those who predominantly have the caring responsibilities will take that up. That is the antithesis of what want. We want greater equality in the household between men and women, and within workplaces we want just as many men as women taking up flexible work arrangements. I would cast a serious question mark over the incidence of men requesting flexible work arrangements because of caring responsibilities. We need to encourage as many people as possible to be able to stay in the workforce when they have other responsibilities in their lives. How can we ensure people can stay in the workforce when they do not necessarily have easy public transport or other transport options? The right to flexible work for all employees would really help those in a number of categories.First are those with a disability. Compared with every other EU member state, Ireland has the largest number of disabled persons who are jobless. That is a stark figure. Second are lone parents. Compared with every other EU member state, Ireland has the highest share of jobless lone parents. The Minister might say that lone parents are somewhat covered in these flexible work provisions, but only up to a certain age, after which caveats apply. Where does this Bill speak to those with disabilities? We are not speaking to them at all. This legislation could be a tool for trying to improve the appalling employment rates among those with disabilities. I have no doubt that, in the broad Department he manages, the Minister wants to introduce legislation that encourages people with disabilities to join the workforce and that said legislation will come further down the line, but there is an opportunity to do it in the here and now. It is sad that we are seeking to have an artificial distinction between remote work and flexible work. There has been a myriad of surveys. Senator Currie mentioned the Central Statistic Office's data on the demand for flexible work in terms of place and hours of work. I appeal to the Minister to reform this Bill dramatically so as to ensure that flexible work is available to all.
#AliceMaryHiggins	unknown-#AliceMaryHiggins-party	unknown-#AliceMaryHiggins-dob	unknown-#AliceMaryHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-01-31 00:00:00	Gnó an tSeanaid - Business of Seanad	135	I support these amendments. I have similar amendments to the section on remote working. The detailed points made by Senator Currie and, though blunt, the wide frame of amendment No. 15 are important. Despite its Title, the Bill's contents are actually about needs – the urgent needs of those suffering domestic violence, the urgent need to medical care and the need to care. That is not work-life balance, though. Rather, that is addressing urgent care needs. The Title should read, "Work (Accommodation of Care Needs)", which is different from "Work Life Balance". We have always understood work-life balance to mean having a life and a job that fit together well. There are many reasons for people to seek flexibility. I understand that there is a particular urgency around the need for flexible working arrangements for those who are balancing care needs but claiming that we have achieved work-life balance because we are letting people who have to contribute to society in some other way design their work around that contribution is not the same as work-life balance. There would be a danger in framing flexible working as just being for these care needs. There is an urgent need to accommodate them and I understand why the Minister might begin there, but despite what it is called, this is not a transformative work-life balance Bill. People might want to move to a four-day week for many reasons, and I might reserve the right to table an amendment on this matter on Report Stage. Perhaps people are volunteering. Perhaps they are artists in other parts of their lives and a four-day week would make a difference. Perhaps they want to spend three days in nature. None of this has anything to do with needs, but with people's work-life balance. Compressing 40 hours of work into a four-day week might make a significant difference to them. In terms of remote working, maybe they work better with music in the background. Maybe it is a matter of the commute. Maybe people have environmental reasons for not wishing to commute to work when they do not believe it is necessary to be there in person every day to perform their jobs and deliver as employees. I understand the urgency for beginning with these particular care needs, mainly because society has been relying on people to deliver unpaid care and extra care. When that work is not accommodated by schedules and employers, it creates extra pressure, but I am worried that we are narrowing the meaning of "flexible employment". Coming out of Covid is a transformative moment and we know that many workplaces have been proven to work well with flexible arrangements and hybrid work being a greater part of the package. If we narrow the definition to just asking what concessions employers might give to employees instead of asking how the world of work could be redesigned to fit better into life and society, we will be framing it as an assumption that the employer does not want people to do flexible work because it is a disadvantage and will only make a concession if the need is proven. I will come to this point later. I am concerned about the needs framing being used in the section on remote working as well as in the section on care needs. If someone is looking for remote working, why must he or she frame that in terms of needs instead of as an option? The narrow framing of flexible work arrangements towards care seems to be leaking into the wider discussion on flexible work and how we approach remote working. I understand why the Minister might be beginning at this point, but I am worried that we are setting a template that is needs based rather than possibility based. I urge him to consider these amendments.

The provisions of the new Part IIA go towards the transposition of Article 9 of the work-life balance directive. Part IIA has been carefully drafted to ensure that the directive is correctly transposed and provides the right to parents and those providing personal care or support for serious medical reasons to be a person who falls within the range of family or personal relationships set out in the directive. A definition of "flexible working arrangements", which was Senator Currie's point, is set out within the definitions section of the Bill. It reads: "'flexible working arrangement' means a working arrangement where an employee's working hours or patterns are adjusted, including through the use of remote working arrangements, flexible working schedules or reduced working hours". These are the three elements that I have always thought of – remote working, flexible schedules and a reduction in hours. This definition is reasonably clear as regards what constitutes flexible working and is stated in section 3, which amends the principal Act. It will be repeated in the code of practice to be delivered by the Workplace Relations Commission, WRC, in terms of how the legislation will be implemented. Senator Currie's amendments seek to broaden the right. The review period of two years that is set out in section 13H allows us to consider broadening the entitlement. Regarding the narrower application of flexible working to remote working, this legislation is the result of two Bills, those being, the right to request remote working Bill, which the now Taoiseach was developing while he was Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, and the existing work-life balance Bill. When we considered bringing the two together, we discussed the application of remote working to all workers as opposed to the application of flexible working to parents and carers. I wanted to enunciate that, in the review period, we would examine whether flexible working should be extended more broadly. Reading the text around the review, that intention could be more explicit. There is a direction of travel that I would like to see us go in terms of making this provision broader. While I am not in a position to accept the amendments, I will look to make the review under section 13H more explicit to ensure that we are enunciating that extending flexible working to groups beyond just parents and carers would be considered.

For the reasons I stated, there is a difference between legislation that will predominantly help women and, on the other hand, gender equality legislation. The knock-on effect of that is that we are dealing with numbers of women falling out of the workforce, especially as they have children, but we are also talking about a new generation of the workforce that works very hard and wants more flexibility. Giving people the flexibility to work compressed hours and take longer holidays is where the workforce is going. Other countries are recognising the fact flexibility is not just for parents and carers but for everyone. Moreover, when there are standardised forms of flexibility, there will also be a better ability to disconnect. If people have various agreements in the office and if some people are entitled to flexible working arrangements and others are not, that is a perk., and sometimes people feel they need to work harder when they are given a perk. Having standardised forms such as I mentioned, and which the Minister mentioned in the broader sense of the Bill, will help to put parameters around what that flexibility is. It is good that he made those references in the legislation to reduced hours, flexible working arrangements and remote working, but we need to help employers with this if it is to do what it should do, namely, create a cultural shift in the workplace.

In a way, we have already had a trial period because of Covid. I worry that if we lower our ambition for two years and let the status quo sink back in, we will be on the back foot. We had a trial period for remote and flexible working and it largely worked. There were some learnings or improvements to be made, but we are losing some momentum by making flexible work available to some people some of the time, based on needs, after a period when it has been a widespread practice. I worry that we are narrowing that down. We should not be at a point of piloting this idea. We should try to take the momentum and move as far as possible.  One problem is this concessionary mind-set that wrongly assumes flexible working is always going to be a burden on an employer, whereas there is much evidence it does, as Senator Currie outlined, deliver very positively. It also means we can keep a lot more women in the workplace who have been shown by the figures to fall out of the workplace at various points. While I do not think this is the intention, the way in which section 13B(3) is framed suggests a hard measure whereby the flexible working arrangement for the care of a child "shall" end not later than the date on which the child has achieved 12 years. Why is the State requiring that this flexible working arrangement end? If an employer and an employee are happy to have this continue, why would we provide that it must end not later than a certain date? That is the language used here. The amendment, which is a simple one, will simply replace "shall" with "may" in order that this will become the point at which the arrangement may end. The evidence for this came through when lone parents were required to have their care work become invisible within the system in that they became ineligible for the jobseeker's transitional payment when their child reached the age of 14, a point that relates to my other amendments, which concern the age provision, by making them have to be available full time from the point at which their child turned 14, in contrast to other parents in the State. It did not look to the reality that teenagers often still need care, and that while the parent may have some availability, he or she may still need flexibility. Those hours between 4 p.m. and 6 p.m. might be very important. There have been cases, for example, of hostile scheduling, where older workers, who might have slightly better rates of pay, find themselves always scheduled for the evening shift. We have seen this in retail, where older workers were always being scheduled for the evening shift because the employer knew they had teenage children whom they did not want to leave unsupervised between 4 p.m. and 9 p.m. Perhaps one 14-year-old would be fine and would be able to be at home on his or her home, whereas another one would not be. Similarly, in the case of 12- and 13-year-olds, the idea of ending the provision at that point is very blunt. When a child reaches the age of 12, that may be a useful point to negotiate a flexible working arrangement, but the idea of the flexible working arrangement ending, and bluntly being required to end, at that age is not appropriate. When we send out a signal like this, it almost acts as a perverse measure that encourages employers to end it at that point. I recall that when the Department of Social Protection sent out a circular stating that child support did not have to be paid after a certain point, that led, of course, to a fall-off in child support payments. When a signal stating something "shall" end is sent out, that is very negative. A number of other Senators also tabled amendments in this grouping, so I will give them some space. My other amendments relate to the provision concerning children with a disability. Again, it is not clear why the age of 16 years is specified. It should be 18 for all parents. Children of 16 years cannot apply for the disability allowance, as I understand it, and do not qualify for their own payment at that age.

Is that the argument for the provision relating to 16 years? I was concerned that there was a state of limbo where children reach the age of 16. Even in that circumstance, the child is still a minor. I refer to children with a disability.It could be that two years of having to make complicated special arrangements is exactly what makes a parent who is balancing out the cost of care, especially the very expensive cost of additional care, with the value of their continued employment fall out of the workplace in that two-year period before, for example, a child with a disability might go to college or move on. I echo Senator Sherlock's point about disability. Having curtailed capacity or needing to manage one's capacity is one of the very good reasons people might be looking for flexible work.
#SharonKeogan	unknown-#SharonKeogan-party	unknown-#SharonKeogan-dob	unknown-#SharonKeogan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-01-31 00:00:00	Gnó an tSeanaid - Business of Seanad	143	I want to speak on this section as well as I have a couple of amendments. I can never put it as eloquently as Senator Higgins but I am going to try. My amendments are Nos. 18 and 19 and I have tabled amendment No. 21, which is the same. The age of 12 is far too low. The age limit does not make sense. If a 13-year-old or an older teenager requires the care of a parent or legal guardian, the Bill should not exclude them from availing of the flexibility of work-from-home benefits. While the Bill does include greater provisions for parents of children who have disabilities or long-term illnesses, there are many children who require care who may not have a disability or a long-term illness. For example, children may have behavioural issues. More often children have mental health issues. Sometimes these issues can result in self-harming. I am not too sure if anybody in this room has had a child who self-harms or who would be on suicide watch. That parent is required there all of the time. He or she is literally watching the child morning, noon and night to make sure the child does not take any action that might cause very serious harm or death. The age of 12 just seems a little bit young. I would like it increased to 16. With regard to the disability provision, I would also like that raised to age 18.

It answers the question, "Can I leave a baby home alone?" with, "No, not even for a few minutes." It states that a young child should never be left at home alone, not even for a short time. On the question of leaving an older child at home alone, the guide states that it is recommended that children under the age of 14 should not be left home alone for more than a very short time and that a child over 16 can be left home alone. We are at a variance here, coming back to Senator Higgins's point around "shall". The age limit of 12 is at a variance with Tusla advice with regard to children and minors being left alone. Are we saying children over 12 do not need their parent or that an arrangement that is working in the context of a workplace should be set aside because the child has attained 12 years of age? Tusla's advice is completely different. There is a disparity and we need some sort of consistency with regard to ages.

There are several amendments which seek to amend the age limits at which a parent of a child is entitled to leave for medical care purposes and a request for flexible working arrangements. The age limits for relevant parents to request a flexible working arrangement for care purposes are aligned to the age limits for applications for parental leave, that is, the leave can be taken before the child's 12th birthday, or 16th birthday if the child has a disability or long-term illness, or the arrangement can be put in place until the child's 12th or 16th birthday. It is important to say the directive itself sets a maximum age of eight. The provisions we have here go significantly beyond what the directive sets out in this regard as we are going up to the age of 12. In addition, under the Bill, and Senator Keogan touched on this, a relevant person can also qualify for the right to request a flexible working arrangement where they are providing personal care and support for a serious medical reason, regardless or the age of the child. This may also include an adult child where there is a serious medical reason. On amendment No. 17 and the issue of "may" versus "shall", obviously a parent or carer is fully entitled to agree a flexible working arrangement with an employer beyond the age of 12. It just will not necessarily be given the full range of protections that are contained within this legislation. There is nothing in the legislation that stops an arrangement that is working. It just will not be covered directly under this legislative process.

A simple thing would be to use "may" to indicate it may be reviewed at that point and then continued rather than providing that it shall end not later than the child's birthday. This sends a very strong punctuation piece and would become the de facto end so that people would not get flexible leave arrangements after a child was 12. At that point a person is in an employment long enough. By using this language, we are having this arrangement fall off a cliff and going back to the very beginning. It is not like when someone is first applying for a job and maybe negotiating a contract. The person is in a job and trying to negotiate based on nothing, rather than saying the arrangement is working, asking to continue it, and having a review point with possible adaptation of the arrangement that is in place. I cannot see a reason not to provide that it may end at that point. Another way to approach it would be a provision that it shall end, excepting where, for example, the employee and employer agree to continue it for another period. I would like to put something in that encourages the option of continuing it rather than leaving it to the individual to start a whole new cold negotiation and sending a signal that the State expects this arrangement to end when the child reaches the age of 12. To add to the good points that were made about medical need, and those are quite extreme medical need situations, in terms of the child of 16 being left alone, there is a little bit of that limbo of what is meant to happen to a 12- or 13-year-old child between the hours of 4 p.m. and 6 p.m. I know this because I have worked extensively with lone parents. In terms of the impact of that caveat of the age limit of 14 when it came in on them, in a way it is easier with a younger child who can go into childcare. One cannot hire a babysitter for a 14-year-old in the same way or put him or her into care. A lot of the time it is simply about being present in the house with them, doing something completely different but being present so they are not alone in that house. That can be very important. Even an equalising of the age limit to 16 for all measures would be very constructive. That was the proposal made by Senator Keogan. Is it the case that disability allowance can be accessed from when somebody is 16? Can I have that confirmed as well?
