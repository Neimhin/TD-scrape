#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-05-04 00:00:00	Prelude	0	The Taoiseach will be aware of the comments of the Minister for Finance yesterday in this House, when answering questions about the Exchequer figures.  The Minister commented that the fiscal figures for April show that the tax profile is beyond the budget Estimate for December and that expenditure is below the budget Estimate.  The Minister also said that for the first four months of the year, "things are better than on track and we hope that continues for the rest of the year."  However, he said this does vary.  He concluded by saying "we will not have any degree of certainty until we get the June figures.  It will be early July, therefore, before I would be firm on the figures, but so far so good."Will the Taoiseach confirm to the House and to the country that he agrees with his Minister for Finance that Exchequer Estimates were broadly correct, and that the recovery programme that was in place is working?
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-05-04 00:00:00	Prelude	1	I agree with the Minister for Finance.  I also agree with him that the Government of which the Deputy was a member entered into commitments for which there was no back-up to provide the wherewithal to deliver on them.  For instance, €50 million was supposedly left aside by the previous Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food for an agri-environment options scheme, but we found nothing there at all.  There is a raft of commitments entered into by the Government of which the Deputy was a member, but for which no moneys have been provided.I agree with the Minister.  He will be in a much clearer position when the June figures come in.  The figure bandied about around budget time for dealing with the requirement for bank debt was €10 billion.  After the PCAR exercise that was raised to €24 billion.  There has been an increase in interest rates and in the cost of fuel, a decrease in consumer demand, and an increase in the savings ratio.  All of these things have had an impact on the circumstances surrounding our economy.  For that reason, one of the central features of this Government will be to promote the creation of a stronger economy through the development of jobs and opportunities.  That will be central to the Minister's statement on the jobs initiative next Tuesday.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-05-04 00:00:00	Prelude	2	In fairness to the Minister for Finance, he was very emphatic about it.  He said that the figures were better than on track.  He said that the Estimates were broadly correct, as defined by the outgoing Government.  The Taoiseach rightly mentioned the agreement with the troika.  Central to the ongoing certainty mentioned by the Minister for Finance yesterday will be the revised agreement with the troika, which I believe has been published today.  Page 16 of that report states that it is important that we make effective use of our State assets, and where appropriate, dispose of them, to help reduce our Government debt.This is a new, clear commitment to privatisation.  Given that the Cabinet will have had to agree this document, how is it that the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, Deputy Rabbitte, who controls many of the State's most valuable assets, was able to state categorically in a national media interview on 24 April that he would not dispose of State assets merely to write down debt?  Has the traditional Fine Gael ideology won the day?  Or has the Government performed yet another U-turn that it hoped people would not notice?
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-05-04 00:00:00	Prelude	3	This Government is not into performing U-turns or pirouettes like the Government of which the Deputy was a member.  The Minister with responsibility for public expenditure and reform has asked every Department to respond to him by the end of May in respect of the possibility of the potential for disposal of non-strategic State assets.  This matter was raised on several occasions during discussions between the Ministers in the Department of Finance and the troika.  The Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources set out clearly a strong view that in the event of any non-strategic State asset being sold at the appropriate time, it should be used for the purpose of investment in job creation measures.  Very few people would disagree with that.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-05-04 00:00:00	Prelude	4	It is not what the Government has agreed to.

#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-05-04 00:00:00	Prelude	7	From that perspective, elements of the original deal done by the last Government with the IMF and the EU have been changed following discussions between this Government and the troika about stronger and greater efficiency measures and greater investment in the growth of our economy.  When the Minister with responsibility for public expenditure and reform receives, by the end of May, the view of each Department on the McCarthy proposals and the disposal of non-strategic State assets, then if the Government decides to dispose of any of these assets in due course, the return on that will be a matter for discussion between the Government and the troika.

The result of this is real hardship for people.I do not know whether the Taoiseach saw last night's RTE "Prime Time" programme, which showed the kind of hardship experienced by many communities in Dublin and beyond in this State who have been abandoned, and the conditions in which they are living.  Does the Taoiseach agree the conditions we saw on last night's programme are unacceptable?Sinn Féin has raised this issue many times previously, here in the Dáil and elsewhere.  We have worked with residents in St. Teresa's Gardens, Dolphin House, Croke Villas, O'Devaney Gardens and many other areas across Dublin and in Limerick and beyond.The conditions in which many citizens are living——

#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-05-04 00:00:00	Prelude	82	Deputy McDonald asked me, in her first question, what the Government will do for the disadvantaged, and I will tell her again.  The Government will deal with the challenges of the economic legacy it has inherited.  The mandate which has been given is to sort out the public finances and deal with the issues with which those of whom she speaks must suffer as a consequence.
#JonathanOBrien	unknown-#JonathanOBrien-party	unknown-#JonathanOBrien-dob	unknown-#JonathanOBrien-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-05-04 00:00:00	Prelude	83	What about the NAMA problem?
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-05-04 00:00:00	Prelude	84	In respect of her question on NAMA, the Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government with special responsibility for housing and planning, Deputy Penrose, has done a great deal of work in the short time that he has been appointed on an number of issues in so far as housing is concerned with the NAMA stock and he will report to the House on that in the not too distant future.  From that point of view, I expect there will be a social dividend.  One cannot do it all over Ireland but one must start with some measure of facility provision for people who are disadvantaged.
#JoeHiggins	unknown-#JoeHiggins-party	unknown-#JoeHiggins-dob	unknown-#JoeHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-05-04 00:00:00	Prelude	85	The editorial in The Irish Times yesterday stated, "The US special forces team was under orders not to take him [Osama bin Laden] alive, as confirmed by a US national security official to Reuters."  We now know he was shot dead unarmed.The Taoiseach, the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and leader of the Labour Party and presidents of the EU Commission and Council, all categorically supported the assassination of bin Laden.  Since when is it the policy of the Government and of the European Union to support a shoot-to-kill policy of somebody suspected of serious crimes?  Is it only justified if the target is a reactionary anti-democratic, anti-human rights obscurantist like bin Laden, whose organisation slaughtered thousands of innocent people, not only in New York but, massively, in Pakistan and elsewhere?  Are there other circumstances?  Before the Taoiseach and the Tánaiste join the chorus of sycophantic congratulation, did the Taoiseach consider some more profound and subtle issues, for example, that bin Laden was being increasingly isolated because the heroic revolution for democratic, economic and human rights sweeping Arab nations and led by the youth and the poor in their millions did more to undermine al-Qaeda than all the US military might and their missiles and bombs?  Did he consider the rank hypocrisy of the United States and EU countries such as Britain which armed and supported dictatorships whose brutal repression was grist to the mill of the reactionary al-Qaeda organisation?
#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-05-04 00:00:00	Prelude	86	The Deputy's two minutes are up.
#JoeHiggins	unknown-#JoeHiggins-party	unknown-#JoeHiggins-dob	unknown-#JoeHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-05-04 00:00:00	Prelude	87	Did the Taoiseach not consider therefore that this assassination was no more than a naked political stunt to project military and political power which was——

#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-05-04 00:00:00	Prelude	92	The fact of the matter is that Osama bin Laden——

#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-05-04 00:00:00	Prelude	97	Many of his victims in the Twin Towers in New York were of Irish descent or directly Irish.  The avalanche of material published yesterday following the announcement of his death has in many cases been altered as new facts emerge.  I did not join any sycophantic group, as Deputy Higgins crudely put it.  I did make the point that the world is now a better place without Osama bin Laden.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-05-04 00:00:00	Prelude	98	Hear, hear.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-05-04 00:00:00	Prelude	99	From this perspective, as a non-aligned neutral country it is important that vigilance be maintained in respect of the safety of citizens throughout the world.It is a fact of life that atrocious murders have been committed in the name of political and religious beliefs at various times throughout the world.  Osama bin Laden is no more, and from this perspective the world will now move on and I hope that good politics can bring about a situation where peace, which is so difficult to achieve, can reign throughout the globe.  A total of 3 million people have died in the Congo but I have not heard Deputy Higgins speak about them.  I have not heard him speak about the citizens of Benghazi who were about to be massacred by Colonel Gadaffi and his forces.  Those difficulties are ongoing and the European Union has a distinct interest in them with regard to the protection of human life.
#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-05-04 00:00:00	Prelude	100	Deputy Higgins has one minute to ask a further supplementary question.
#JoeHiggins	unknown-#JoeHiggins-party	unknown-#JoeHiggins-dob	unknown-#JoeHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-05-04 00:00:00	Prelude	101	Thousands of people have been murdered by reactionary terrorists.  I suggest to the Taoiseach that the answer to this is not to do likewise and use their methods.  In 2003, the Taoiseach stated that under international law and order the war in Iraq was wrong, unjust and unnecessary.  Tens of thousands of innocent Iraqis were killed.
#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-05-04 00:00:00	Prelude	102	Could we have a supplementary question please?
#JoeHiggins	unknown-#JoeHiggins-party	unknown-#JoeHiggins-dob	unknown-#JoeHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-05-04 00:00:00	Prelude	103	The two figureheads of that invasion, Messrs Bush and Blair, were responsible for that.  If a group of aggrieved relatives of those tens of thousands of dead mounted an assault on Mr. Blair's luxury compound, wherever that might be, would the Taoiseach equally justify that——

I deplore the reduction of the services for 26 highly dependent patients who were being cared for in St. Brigid's.  I also reject the HSE national service plan which saw a reduction of 26 beds in Waterford while other areas benefitted.  I call on the Government and the Minister for Health and Children to support St. Patrick's Hospital and the people of Waterford in this matter of priority.  When will the new 50-bed unit as promised——

I call on the Government to make a statement on the matter.

#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-05-04 00:00:00	Prelude	167	The Taoiseach will probably do so.  It was not his intention but the assertion is hanging and it should be withdrawn.With regard to the Order of Business proper, the Taoiseach has told the House that legislation to establish the Department of public spending and reform will be published shortly and will be enacted at some point in the next two months.The Taoiseach will be aware that more than six weeks have passed since the Minister, Deputy Howlin, indicated that he would be happy to answer in this House questions in regard to his brief.  The Minister has probably set a record in terms of the length of time he has gone without answering parliamentary questions.  The last time this happened was when Members of the House were on the run or in jail during the first and second Dáil.

#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-05-04 00:00:00	Prelude	169	There is a motion on today's Order Paper which would allow us to address this issue immediately.  Will the Taoiseach agree to the motion and make interim arrangements so that the Minister, Deputy Howlin, in whose hands rests the fate of hundreds of thousands of public sector workers, can account to the House rather than the media alone?  He is, of course, entitled to speak to the media.

#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-05-04 00:00:00	Prelude	171	Thank you, Taoiseach.

#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-05-04 00:00:00	Prelude	174	In respect of the reminder from Deputy Martin, I recall an answer given by a former Taoiseach to something which came from the Sinn Féin quarters.  Were I to make a remark like that made by the good Deputy when she referred to the Deputies opposite as the boys over there, I could be guilty of behaviour unbecoming.

#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-05-04 00:00:00	Prelude	178	The Minister, Deputy Howlin, is anxious to answer questions on his parliamentary brief.  We are dealing with the creation of two separate Departments to deal with finance and public expenditure and reform.  The legislation to establish his Department will be published on 17 May and we hope to process it quickly to give him the legal and constitutional authority he requires to answer questions in the House.  That will be followed shortly afterwards by legislation in respect of the Department of children.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-05-04 00:00:00	Prelude	179	There is a motion on the Order Paper.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-05-04 00:00:00	Prelude	180	I have no problem with the motion, which I have just received and read.  There is nothing wrong with it but it is a matter of whether the Attorney General will advise that the Minister has the constitutional and legal authority to answer questions before his Department is formally established.
#MaryLouMcDonald	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-party	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-dob	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-05-04 00:00:00	Prelude	181	The revised memorandum of understanding finally came to light and was published last night.  I am not sure whether there is anything new in it other than the issue of the minimum wage.  What progress has the Taoiseach made on these matters in light of his assertion that he is toiling daily on them?
#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-05-04 00:00:00	Prelude	182	I remind the Deputy that this is the Order of Business.
#MaryLouMcDonald	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-party	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-dob	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-05-04 00:00:00	Prelude	183	In the course of yesterday's exchanges, the Taoiseach stated that because the document is not the finalised agreement with the troika it would return to the House.  Can he tell me the date in May on which that will occur and whether we will have a debate and, more important, a vote on the matter?  I raised this question with the Taoiseach previously.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-05-04 00:00:00	Prelude	184	There was not a request for a debate with a vote on this.  There was a legitimate request that the memorandum of understanding would be debated and that is what the Chief Whip acceded to.  What is taking place today was granted in response to the request made to the Government by the Opposition Whips.  We have already held a vote on the vote on the matter.  It is not true to say the memorandum of understanding has not been altered.  It has been altered in so far as the Deputy rightly refers to the minimum wage.  There is no second NAMA and transfers of loans below €20 million are not allowed.  There are significant changes in respect of the jobs initiative, which was signalled even before the discussions with the troika.  Prior to the election, the troika made it perfectly clear to us that it would be willing to accommodate within the overall envelope changes in priority to give a more effective drive to create jobs and strengthen the economy.  That element of the changed memorandum of understanding will be announced on Tuesday.  I hope there will be a relevant discussion on the memorandum, which was granted in response to the request that was made.
#KevinHumphreys	unknown-#KevinHumphreys-party	unknown-#KevinHumphreys-dob	unknown-#KevinHumphreys-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-05-04 00:00:00	Prelude	185	Like many Deputies, I am meeting increasing numbers of families suffering problems with debt.  The programme for Government promises legislation to transfer the Money Advice and Budgeting Service into a personal debt management agency with strong legal powers.  When will legislation come before the House to enable that to happen?
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-05-04 00:00:00	Prelude	186	I cannot indicate an exact date but it is a commitment of the programme for Government and work is being done on it at present.  As progress is made we will report further to the Deputy but I cannot yet provide him an exact date.
#RichardBoydBarrett	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-party	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-dob	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-05-04 00:00:00	Prelude	187	Following publication of the McCarthy report, the Taoiseach indicated in response to questions put to him in this House that he would be open to a debate on it.  Those of us who believe it is a plan to asset strip the country to pay back the IMF and the bankers would like to know when a debate will take place on the McCarthy report.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-05-04 00:00:00	Prelude	188	I have no problem with having a discussion on the issue and I would welcome one.  The Whips will meet this evening and I assume Deputy Catherine Murphy will raise the issue in order to make arrangements for a debate.  Deputy Boyd Barrett should bear in mind that it will be worth having a debate when he sees what the Government proposes to do.

Another company, Xtra-vision, has gone into receivership or administration due to upward only rents.  A number of companies around the country are facing severe difficulties but, while legislation was promised, I cannot find it in the legislative programme.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-05-04 00:00:00	Prelude	190	This is an important element of providing certainty for those who wish to invest in the purchase of property.

#WillieODea	unknown-#WillieODea-party	unknown-#WillieODea-dob	unknown-#WillieODea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-05-04 00:00:00	Prelude	191	I ask about the commitment in the programme for Government to introduce legislation to allow small and medium enterprises to restructure their debts without recourse to expensive court proceedings.  Will that provision be part of the bankruptcy legislation or is a separate Bill planned and, if so, when can we expect to see it?
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-05-04 00:00:00	Prelude	192	I will have to revert to the Deputy with the details of that issue.  I am not sure that it requires legislation but I will give him an up-to-date report tomorrow.
#CiaranLynch	unknown-#CiaranLynch-party	unknown-#CiaranLynch-dob	unknown-#CiaranLynch-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-05-04 00:00:00	Prelude	193	I seek clarification from the Ceann Comhairle regarding the submission of parliamentary questions.  Two weeks ago he indicated that a suggestion had been made to Ministers that responses to questions about agencies such as the NRA which are not directly under the control of Ministers should be sought via the respective Departments.  Can he confirm whether he has issued a direction to Ministers on this matter?
#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-05-04 00:00:00	Prelude	194	Any parliamentary question received on such subjects has been approved for oral or written answer.
#PaulKehoeFG	unknown-#PaulKehoeFG-party	unknown-#PaulKehoeFG-dob	unknown-#PaulKehoeFG-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-05-04 00:00:00	Prelude	195	As theDeputy is aware, the Government is committed to implementing a comprehensive programme of Dáil reform.  I met the other party Whips on 13 April when we had an initial discussionof areas in which the reform of Dáil procedures could proceed in the short term.  Thesediscussions are continuing and I am hopeful we can reach agreement on a number of matters speedily.
#AengusOSnodaighSF	unknown-#AengusOSnodaighSF-party	unknown-#AengusOSnodaighSF-dob	unknown-#AengusOSnodaighSF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-05-04 00:00:00	Prelude	196	I welcome the initial discussions on Dáil reform.  Will they include consideration of earlier Dáil sitting times and longer and more sitting days?  Will they also include consideration of the Taoiseach being present on more occasions and being more accountable to the Dáil?  These demands were made by all Opposition Members at the last two Dáil reform committees.  I understand from our own discussions that Sinn Féin hopes to present a Dáil reform package.  Will Members be encouraged, other than through their Whips, to bring forward proposals to help to formulate Dáil reform proposals, similar to what we did on committee system reform?  Recently the House held a debate when new and older Members were able to give their views on the committee system.  Would it be feasible to hold such a discussion on the various Dáil reform proposals made?
#PaulKehoeFG	unknown-#PaulKehoeFG-party	unknown-#PaulKehoeFG-dob	unknown-#PaulKehoeFG-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-05-04 00:00:00	Prelude	197	Everything the Whips wish to discuss will be discussed.  I will have no problem in accepting proposals from any of the political parties opposite.  The Deputy was a Whip in the previous Dáil and is aware that a number of comprehensive proposals were set out by the Whips at the time, some of which I hope will be taken into consideration and can be implemented by the next term.The Deputy spoke about more sitting days.  I have increased the number by almost 35%.  The programme for Government contains a proposal that the House should sit on Fridays.  To increase the number of sitting days by 35% we have shortened the holiday periods and are coming back a day earlier after bank holidays.  We will have a special sitting on Monday next, Europe Day.  The Deputy asked that the Taoiseach be more readily available and come to the Chamber more frequently.  The Taoiseach will be present on Monday and take part in the special sitting.The Deputy spoke about encouraging newer Members to take part in the discussion on Dáil reform.  I would have no problem in arranging a debate similar to that on the committee system.  That was an idea of my own.  I thought the debate on the committee system was worthwhile.  A number of proposals and suggestions were made on that day which we have included in the proposals for the new committee system.  I will also accommodate a special debate on Dáil reform.  Some new Members who have been here for the past seven or eight weeks might see where we can improve on our procedures.  It would be only right to give them the opportunity to debate the matter in the Chamber.I am not sure what the Deputy means by encouragement of backbenchers.  I hope the proposals for Dáil reform will include measures to allow backbenchers to debate urgent constituency issues rather than raising them on the Adjournment.  The Adjournment debate is often a set-piece when a Minister listens to a Member's speech and then gives a detailed answer.  That could be done in a more meaningful way.  It is something we will discuss.
#SeanOFearghaillFF	unknown-#SeanOFearghaillFF-party	unknown-#SeanOFearghaillFF-dob	unknown-#SeanOFearghaillFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-05-04 00:00:00	Prelude	198	On behalf of Fianna Fáil, I acknowledge the ongoing work of the Whips on the matter of Dáil reform.  We are generally satisfied with the approach being set out by the Chief Whip.  We also acknowledge and commend the Government for providing for additional sittings.  We are committed to having Friday sittings.  Does the Minister of State agree that it is essential that these sittings form part of the routine Dáil week, that they be fully meaningful, that we deal with legislation on Fridays as we do throughout the week and that Ministers be present for oral questions?Will the Minister of State comment on today's announcement by the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Phil Hogan, of plans for a reduction in the number of Deputies as part of the overall Dáil reform package?  In the run up to the general election Fine Gael stressed the perceived need to reduce the number of Members by 20.  The Labour Party has been unenthusiastic.  In fact, I believe it is opposed to the proposal to reduce the number of Members of the House.  Will the Chief Whip say if the Government has reached agreement on this matter and what the current position is?
#PaulKehoeFG	unknown-#PaulKehoeFG-party	unknown-#PaulKehoeFG-dob	unknown-#PaulKehoeFG-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-05-04 00:00:00	Prelude	199	The Deputy spoke about routine Dáil sittings.  That is not merely a matter for the Government.  It will also be a matter for the Opposition to make sure it takes part fully in Friday sittings.  It is not simply for the Government to keep a sitting going and supply speakers for an entire day.  It is also the responsibility of the Opposition to supply speakers, take part properly in a debate and ensure a debate is successful and meaningful for the people watching outside the House.The reduction in the number of Deputies is being discussed at Government level.  The Deputy will know well in advance of any Government proposals in this regard.
#CatherineMurphy	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-party	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-dob	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-05-04 00:00:00	Prelude	200	I acknowledge that there has been dialogue regarding Dáil reform.  In the Technical Group the demand has been for the adoption of a more inclusive approach.  I would welcome the provision of time for a more comprehensive debate rather than a discussion among the Whips.  When are we likely to have such a debate?  The timeline for reform is working towards the end of July.  It would be better to hold the debate at an earlier stage.When is it likely that the body to examine political reform will meet?  I believe it will be called a constitutional convention, although no terms of reference have yet been published.  When will its terms of reference be announced and when is it likely to be set up?  The demand in the Oireachtas and among voters, as expressed during the general election campaign, is for major political reform.  If what we do between now and the end of July constitutes the bulk of the work of reform, there will be considerable disappointment because this will be seen as an exercise in box-ticking and the changes minor.  Much more substantial change is expected by the public.
#PaulKehoeFG	unknown-#PaulKehoeFG-party	unknown-#PaulKehoeFG-dob	unknown-#PaulKehoeFG-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-05-04 00:00:00	Prelude	201	There will be comprehensive discussions.  Ideas from Opposition Deputies are welcome and will be considered.  Deputy Catherine Murphy referred to a possible debate on Dáil reform.  That matter can be discussed at this evening's Whips meeting and a debate could be held in the next two weeks.  Next week's schedule has been agreed, but a debate on Dáil reform could be held in the Chamber the following week.  Members opposite and from my side of the House could take part in the debate.  Good ideas can be taken on board.  Deputy Ó Snodaigh's idea is a good one.  The debate on committees we had in the House was extremely successful.  A similar debate on Dáil reform and procedures in the Dáil that new Members have seen here in recent weeks, with new ideas being brought forward, can be accommodated by the Government.
#AengusOSnodaighSF	unknown-#AengusOSnodaighSF-party	unknown-#AengusOSnodaighSF-dob	unknown-#AengusOSnodaighSF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-05-04 00:00:00	Prelude	202	First, will consideration be given to re-examining the pilot project run in the last Dáil in terms of giving assistance to Deputies in producing legislation?  Will the question of the Library and Research Service be taken on board during our discussions on Dáil reform?Second, in all our discussions on Dáil reform we need to be mindful of the staff of the Houses of the Oireachtas.  Will that be borne in mind given the public service embargo which prevents the Houses of the Oireachtas commission from employing additional staff to make up the shortfall due to natural wastage and so on and its impact on staff who are already stretched?  If we extend the working hours that could cause further problems.  That aspect should be borne in mind, even in the short period between now and July when we present the full Dáil reform document.
#PaulKehoeFG	unknown-#PaulKehoeFG-party	unknown-#PaulKehoeFG-dob	unknown-#PaulKehoeFG-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-05-04 00:00:00	Prelude	203	I would hope that when we go to the sub-committee on Dáil reform of the Committee on Procedure and Privileges we can ask for the advice of the Clerk of the Dáil on staffing issues in terms of any proposals the Government Whip may bring to that sub-committee.  It is important to take that into consideration when we are bringing our proposals to the House.The Deputy mentioned the Library and Research Service.  That is something that can be discussed also with the Ceann Comhairle and the Clerk of the Dáil at the CPP sub-committee.  We might even be able to discuss those issues at CPP level.
#PaulKehoeFG	unknown-#PaulKehoeFG-party	unknown-#PaulKehoeFG-dob	unknown-#PaulKehoeFG-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2011-05-04 00:00:00	Prelude	204	I propose to take Questions Nos. 2 and 3 together.I am currently preparing proposals for a committee system for the Thirty-first Dáil. When the Government has considered these proposals and given its approval to the new arrangements, I will consult with the Opposition Whips in relation to them.As Deputies will appreciate, I am not in a position at this point to comment on the detail of these proposals, except to say that I have taken into consideration many of the points raised in the recent debate on how to make the Dáil committee system more relevant and effective.
#AengusOSnodaighSF	unknown-#AengusOSnodaighSF-party	unknown-#AengusOSnodaighSF-dob	unknown-#AengusOSnodaighSF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-05-04 00:00:00	Prelude	205	Will the new committees to be announced soon be larger committees given that the Government has given a commitment to having fewer committees of the House, and will they be fully resourced?  The key point that came up during our discussions on the committees recently was the need to ensure some type of compellability mechanisms.  Is there legislation on that or advice from the Attorney General regarding compellability of witnesses when committee inquiries and so on are held?  Will that legislation be forthcoming or when will we see it?
#PaulKehoeFG	unknown-#PaulKehoeFG-party	unknown-#PaulKehoeFG-dob	unknown-#PaulKehoeFG-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-05-04 00:00:00	Prelude	206	Parts of the legislation the Deputy refers to are being prepared.  I have spoken to the Attorney General about such legislation that we will bring forward in the future.  When the Taoiseach spoke about this issue, which is in the programme for Government, and the Labour Party also referred to it in its pre-election manifesto, he spoke about making committees stronger and more relevant.  That is something I would like to see happen but pieces of legislation will be required to make some of the committees stronger and more meaningful.The committees we are proposing to go forward with are being signed off.  I hope I will have them signed off entirely by tomorrow or the end of this week.  There will be a larger number of members on each of the committees.  They will include Deputies and Senators, and they will be resourced fully.  As there will be half the number of committees that were in the Thirtieth Dáil I would hope the same number of staff members involved in all the committees can be combined, but that is a matter for the Houses of the Oireachtas through the commission, which will be set up shortly to make sure that the committee system is fully resourced and that it will work in a different way than was the case in the past.
#SeanOFearghaillFF	unknown-#SeanOFearghaillFF-party	unknown-#SeanOFearghaillFF-dob	unknown-#SeanOFearghaillFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-05-04 00:00:00	Prelude	207	I thank the Minister of State for his response and acknowledge that the plenary session here on committees and the committee structure was useful but I must point out that we have not had the level of engagement on this issue at Whips level as we have had on Dáil reform.  Would the Chief Whip consider convening a special meeting of the Whips to discuss that in advance of any final decision?I emphasise to the Minister of State the importance of setting up the Houses of the Oireachtas commission as a matter of urgency.  I presume the commission falls within the ambit of committees in general.  I support the issue raised by Deputy Ó Snodaigh in terms of the critical importance of the joint committee on the implementation of the Good Friday Agreement and the fact that it should not be sacrificed, given its critical importance at this juncture.
#PaulKehoeFG	unknown-#PaulKehoeFG-party	unknown-#PaulKehoeFG-dob	unknown-#PaulKehoeFG-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-05-04 00:00:00	Prelude	208	On consultation with the Opposition on the setting up of committees, I had a special debate here in the Dáil to give the Opposition Members an opportunity to discuss fully their proposals on the number of committees and so on.  The debate held in the House was meaningful but not that many Deputies spoke about the committees that should be formed, those that should be sacrificed and the committees that should be combined.  I thought there would have been more views expressed on that in the debate.I hope to announce before the end of this week the number of committees.  I can assure the Deputy that the Good Friday Agreement committee will not be sacrificed.  There will be a full committee to carry out the work that has been done previously, and the work that will be done in coming years on the Good Friday Agreement.  I assure the Deputy that we will have a stand alone committee for the Good Friday Agreement.On the setting up of the Oireachtas commission, I have spoken to the Taoiseach on that and I would hope the Taoiseach will announce through the Houses of the Oireachtas the setting up of the Oireachtas commission within the next ten days.  It is hoped we will have announced everything on the committee system and the Oireachtas commission by the end of the following week.  I have no doubt that Members opposite have an appetite to get involved in the committee structure in the House and in the workings of the committees and bring forward some of their ideas but I have set out a programme for the committees to work for the first three or four weeks.  The Taoiseach spoke about the chairpersons of bodies and so on coming before different committees to outline their plans and proposals on what they want to bring to the chairmanship of the new bodies.
#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-05-04 00:00:00	Prelude	209	I remind Members that there are 30 minutes for priority questions.  There are six minutes for each question — two minutes initially for the Minister to answer and four minutes for supplementary questions and replies.
#RuairiQuinn	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-party	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-dob	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-05-04 00:00:00	Prelude	210	The Deputy will be aware that the student grant measures announced in budget 2011 by the previous Fianna Fáil-Green Party Government began to come into effect from January this year when a reduction of 4% in the rates of grant was applied to all student grant recipients.  Further to this, budget measures that will come into effect from next September for the 2011 to 2012 academic year will change the assessment of the qualifying distance criterion for the non-adjacent rate of grant, from 24 kilometres to 45 kilometres, and mature students will no longer have an automatic entitlement to the non-adjacent rate of grant.The Deputy will appreciate that given current economic circumstances I regret that I am not in a position to reverse the changes made to the qualifying distance criteria or to introduce another adjacent rate of grant category into the student grant schemes.  As a matter of routine, my Department prepares policy proposals on the student grant schemes each year.  For the coming academic year, these will include the budgetary measures I have alluded to already and the annual review of the reckonable income limits contained in the schemes.  This year, a more fundamental review is also being undertaken in order to consolidate the four existing student grant schemes into a single unified scheme as part of my Department's overall student grants reform programme.Student grant schemes have a fundamental role to play in ensuring equality of access to higher education and our scarce resources should be targeted towards those most in need of assistance.  The introduction of further reforms, including improvements to the way in which assessments are carried out, will be facilitated by consolidation of the administration function in a single grant awarding authority, which is due to take place from 2012.
#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-05-04 00:00:00	Prelude	211	I thank the Minister for his reply.  Will he indicate when the scheme for the next academic year will be published?  Generally, it is published in May or June, but the earlier the better, as I know from my own experience as a Deputy.  The Minister referred to the budgetary parameters within which he works and the parcel of money that is allocated for the higher education grant scheme.  Having spoken to students and USI officials, I know that they are anxious for the Minister to review the new arrangements concerning adjacent and non-adjacent rates.  They made the valid point that there should be a graduated scheme, perhaps involving another type of non-adjacent rate and a near-adjacent rate.  There should be some graduation in it because it will be a fairly blunt instrument when the new arrangements come into place due to the monetary pressures involved.  Those pressures are severe because of the 60% increase in participation in higher education in less than a decade, which is welcome nonetheless.  Many of those currently participating in higher education come from homes where incomes are quite low.  The Minister should consider ameliorating the proposal as outlined in budget 2011.
#RuairiQuinn	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-party	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-dob	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-05-04 00:00:00	Prelude	212	I thank the Deputy for his comments and questions.  At this point, I am not in a position to indicate when a revised or changed scheme will come into effect for the academic year 2012-13.  I will examine the Deputy's proposal but he will understand that any such proposal will have to be cost-neutral within the operation of the scheme.  If we can make the scheme better, however, then I am open to suggestions.
#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-05-04 00:00:00	Prelude	213	The information may not be readily available now but can the Minister let me know as soon as possible when the scheme for 2011-12 will be published?  I know from experience that the earlier it comes out the better in order to facilitate students and their parents.  The Minister proposes to carry out a fundamental review of the entire student support grant scheme. When does he expect to have that review completed?  According to comments attributed to the Minister in a radio interview, he indicated his concern that the scheme seemed to operate a bias in favour of farming families and self-employed persons.  That view has created some concern, therefore, I would like him to deal with that issue and allay the concerns of such people in the community.
#RuairiQuinn	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-party	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-dob	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-05-04 00:00:00	Prelude	214	The Deputy has raised a few supplementary questions and I will try to deal with them quickly.  As regards the scheme that will come into effect for September, I will try to have it published as soon as possible.  I will communicate directly with the Deputy in that regard.With regard to the modernisation of the grant system generally, progress has been made in that the administration of the student grant will now be done by one body and it will be streamlined.  We hope therefore that the frustration felt by many students due to delays in obtaining grants will be reduced or eliminated.  In that case, they will get their money much more quickly than has been the case in the past.With regard to means-testing, yes, I have made such comments.  This criticism goes back a long time.  However, I met with representatives of the ICMSA when they had an open-day presentation in Buswells Hotel and discussed the matter with them informally.  They assured me that in modern terms, because of changes in agriculture with which the Deputy will be more familiar than myself, the accounts are more up to date, transparent and readily accessible than was perhaps the case in the past.  That is all to the good and it will mean that people who are entitled to get grants and other support will do so on the basis not so much of merit but of income.  In the past, there were real fears concerning the manipulation by self-employed people — whatever their activity happened to be — of their accounts in a way that a PAYE worker could not do.  Hopefully, the new system will avoid that difficulty, which is a legacy from the past.

#RuairiQuinn	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-party	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-dob	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-05-04 00:00:00	Prelude	216	Social Personal and Health Education, otherwise known as SPHE, is designed to promote students' coping and decision-making skills, and encourage healthy lifestyles.  The modules at junior cycle deal specifically with belonging and integrating, coping with stress, emotional health and well-being, and relationships and sexuality education.  An awareness of when, how and from whom to seek help, when in difficulty, is promoted.All post-primary schools provide a guidance and counselling service for their students and they receive ex-quota hours from my Department for this provision.  The service includes the provision of individual guidance and counselling for students at times of personal crisis.  My Department funds the provision of ongoing professional support through a counselling supervision service, providing advice and sharing practice on issues of concern.  This is supplemented by the work of the National Centre for Guidance in Education and by funding provided to the Institute of Guidance Counsellors for professional development.  The National Office for Suicide Prevention is also working with the Institute of Guidance Counsellors to support their members' work in this area.Pastoral care teams in schools provide important assistance in promoting students' well-being and in ensuring that potential difficulties can be identified early.  Class year tutors, guidance counsellors, home-school liaison co-ordinators and the services of the National Educational Psychological Service or NEPS, can play an important role in this respect.NEPS provides consultation for guidance counsellors and other school staff, enabling them to put interventions in place for individuals with clearly identified and serious difficulties.  When counselling of a protracted nature is required it is referred to an outside agency.  Schools are advised to identify, with the assistance of NEPS, appropriate referral pathways in consultation with the HSE and other mental health services in their local community.The guidelines issued by NEPS for schools on responding to critical incidents provide advice on managing traumatic events, including advice on prevention and early intervention strategies for students at risk.  In the cases referred to by the Deputy, it is imperative that outside clinical services are involved.  NEPS psychologists will be available to consult with guidance counsellors if requested.
#SeanCroweSF	unknown-#SeanCroweSF-party	unknown-#SeanCroweSF-dob	unknown-#SeanCroweSF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-05-04 00:00:00	Prelude	217	I thank the Minister for responding to this matter.  I tabled this question to find out what is happening in this regard.  We all accept that there is a crisis and the House has spent some days recently discussing suicide prevention.  One difficulty, however, is that schools may take different approaches to such cases.  I am not saying that one approach will fit all, but this growing crisis must be dealt with.  In one school that I am aware of, a number of children have died.  The second child died on the anniversary of the first child's death.  In that school, a child that needs counselling slips a note under the door of the principal.  The difficulty, however, is that the child is then taken out of the classroom, so everyone knows why he or she is being taken out.  That is the method in that school but there does not seem to be a pattern because other schools may adopt different approaches.There is a recognition that there is a crisis facing many schools, but how should we approach it?  The Minister referred to interventions and I understand that special needs assistants have a role with regard to children who may be at risk of self-harm.  The worry is that if we cut back services in schools that have experienced these incidents, the problem will get worse.It is about how we approach this problem, which is getting worse.  There are additional problems in certain sectors, particularly the Traveller community.  How will the Department examine the problem and approach it?  I do not suggest there is one solution but we need to examine this again and come up with a new approach to this growing problem.

There have been a number of incidents in recent times, perhaps compounded by economic difficulties in broader society, which are bringing some of these crises to a head.If schools in the Deputy's constituency are struggling with these matters, I urge him to communicate directly with them and get them to make sure that their teachers with responsibility for pastoral care avail of the many supports in place.  If he has a specific query that he would like me to refer to confidentially, I will be happy to do so.

My worry is that I do not know who is taking an overview of what is happening in the schools.  Is the Department monitoring this and looking at particular schools where a problem has arisen?  Is it examining the response to this problem?  Are officials monitoring this growing phenomenon in schools?

#RuairiQuinn	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-party	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-dob	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-05-04 00:00:00	Prelude	221	RTT posts and teaching hours for Traveller pupils will be withdrawn, effective from 31 August 2011.  Traveller pupils who are eligible for learning support teaching should receive this tuition through the existing learning support provision in schools.  All schools should select students for learning support on the basis of priority of need.The expected budgetary target reduction in the number of RTT posts and teaching hours for Travellers, based on estimated provision for 2011, was 723 whole-time equivalent, WTE, posts, comprising an estimated 500 WTE posts at primary school level and 223 posts at post-primary school level.  It was estimated that 123 posts should be used for adjustment or alleviation purposes for schools, resulting in an overall net saving of 600 posts.At the end of January 2011, in respect of the 2010-11 school year, the number of RTTs employed amounted to a total of 709.54 WTE posts nationwide, comprising 488 posts at primary school level and 221.54 posts at post-primary level.  At the end of January 2010, in respect of the 2009-10 school year, the actual number of RTTs employed amounted to a total of 712 WTE posts nationwide, comprising 486 posts at primary school level and 226 posts at post-primary level.For schools other than DEIS schools in receipt of enhanced pupil teacher ratios, alleviation measures are being provided to assist schools with high concentrations of Traveller pupils who were previously supported by RTT posts.  Proposed alleviation measures must be considered in the context of the limited resources available to my Department and they are being concentrated on schools that have 33 or more pupils supported by RTT posts.  A total of 38 learning support alleviation posts have been allocated to such schools to date.Additional information not given on the floor of the HouseWith regard to schools which have less than 33 Traveller pupils previously supported by RTT posts, within the context of the limited resources available and taking into account Government policy and the employment control framework, my Department will consider whether further limited alleviation measures can be provided for schools for whom it can be demonstrated that they have been disproportionately effected by the alleviation-adjustment measures outlined in comparison to schools of a similar size and circumstances.The decision to withdraw RTTs was taken by the previous Government in the last budget.  The requirement to make expenditure savings and to ensure that staffing numbers remain within the public service employment control framework prevents me from revisiting this decision.I will arrange for a breakdown of the location of posts, as at January 2011, to be forwarded to the Deputy.
#MickWallace	unknown-#MickWallace-party	unknown-#MickWallace-dob	unknown-#MickWallace-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-05-04 00:00:00	Prelude	222	The Minister referred to schools that have 33 or more pupils supported by RTT posts.  A school with 200 kids of whom 33 are from the Traveller community is entitled to a learning support teacher.  However, RTTs are being done away with for schools with fewer than 33 RTT supported pupils.  Are they supposed to fall under the remit of the learning support system?I was approached by Clonroche national school.  It has 110 pupils, of whom 23 are from the Traveller community and another 25 are in receipt of learning support.  That is a total of 48 kids, which is almost half the school population.  The school had one learning support teacher and 1.5 resource teachers for Travellers to deal with the 48 kids.  The number of teachers has reduced to one because it does not meet the threshold of having 33 pupils supported by RTT posts.  A school up the road has 33 kids but its enrolment is twice that of Clonroche national school and, therefore, it has more learning support teachers.One teacher must cope with 48 kids who need special attention, of whom 23 have a Traveller background, in a school with an enrolment of 110.  Even the brightest kids in the class will suffer and not only the Traveller children or those on learning support.  Just about every kid in the school will suffer because it is unfair and they will not be able to cope.  I realise the money is not there for everything but, in special cases, the Minister surely has to examine the position.  It is too unfair on the kids in these areas, which are generally underprivileged.
#RuairiQuinn	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-party	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-dob	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-05-04 00:00:00	Prelude	223	I understand the Deputy's concern.  I have received many representations from different Members in the Wexford constituency about this school.  I am not sure what can be done.  I accept that the overall impact of the reduction of certain supports should be examined in the context of how schools are struggling to provide for existing pupils who need support.  I will examine the Clonroche case again and I will write to the Deputy about it because it is too complex within the context of Question Time to respond to it in considerable detail.
#MickWallace	unknown-#MickWallace-party	unknown-#MickWallace-dob	unknown-#MickWallace-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-05-04 00:00:00	Prelude	224	Thank you, Minister.  I wrote to the 99 national schools in County Wexford and I discovered that many of them are not badly affected.  I met representatives of Pavee Point earlier this week and they explained that money was being spent on Travellers under a number of headings that should not have been spent and value for money assessments needed to be carried out in these areas.  There is a need in this area and it will not be looked after but, in the past, money was spent in areas where it was not needed.  A school might have 30 Traveller kids one year but the following year it might only have had ten, yet it received the same funding both years.  The Pavee Point representatives admit this issue could have been addressed better with less money.
#SeanSherlock	Labour	14028	Cork East	speech	unkown-language	2011-05-04 00:00:00	Prelude	225	The programme for Government contains a commitment that the Government within thefirst 100 days of taking office, will provide a jobs initiative.  This initiative will contain apackage of measures to support employment creation and stimulate economic growth, while enhancing the activation supports available for those seeking employment.  It will deliver a minimum of an additional 15,000 places in training, work experience and educationalopportunities for those who are out of work as committed to in the programme for Government.Details of these additional activation places will be contained in the forthcoming jobs initiative launch, which is due next week.  The activation places outlined in the initiative will be in addition to 108,500 training places, 168,000 places in the further education sector and 156,000 places in the higher education sector, which the unemployed may access.
#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-05-04 00:00:00	Prelude	226	The Minister, Deputy Ruarí Quinn, Deputy Seán Crowe and perhaps other Members of the House attended various teachers' conferences last week at which one of the major issues about which we heard was unemployment among graduates.  We all know of the need to ensure that where job opportunities arise, people who are not retired and are genuinely seeking employment are given first refusal.  The concern about employment opportunities is not just among graduates of teacher training colleges or those who have completed their bachelor of arts degrees but among all graduates.  I welcome the Minister of State's reference to the specific provision of 15,000 places in the jobs initiative to be announced next week.  Are these 15,000 places additional to the ones announced by the then Tánaiste in budget 2011?
#SeanSherlock	Labour	14028	Cork East	speech	unkown-language	2011-05-04 00:00:00	Prelude	227	Yes.  I nearly referred to the Deputy as Minister as I marked him in a former mandate.  In terms of the issues raised vis-à-vis graduates, there will be a clear priority within the upcoming jobs initiative towards adopting a qualitative approach to internships.  The intention is to take a more holistic view of the workplace programmes which it could be argued were not necessarily providing for the progression required in allowing students to progress from graduate status into the workplace and move further within that stream.  There is a clear priority in terms of internships which are additional to the existing programmes.  It should also be noted that there are at least 276,564 training places provided for if one takes the FÁS programme, the Skillnets programme, the labour market activation programme, the PLC programmes and the VTOS programmes.  They are well encompassed and the 15,000 places are additional.  It is envisaged that there will be a particular emphasis on providing quality internships in order to stem the tide of emigration and ensure graduates will not just be educated to take up jobs in such places as Australia and other countries.  A qualitative approach will be taken to the placement of graduates.
#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-05-04 00:00:00	Prelude	228	I agree with the Minister of State that it is not just a matter of placements; there must also be a qualitative approach.  In many instances people who take up internships will bring new thinking and expertise to many public and private sector organisations which might not have had new entrants to the profession or workplace in recent times.  They can bring new skills, expertise and thinking to the workplace.  Will the Minister of State assure me that every public body, both central government, local government and statutory agency, with the private sector which also has a responsibility, will do its utmost to ensure as many internships as possible will be available as quickly as possible?  My experience is that, unfortunately, these things move too slowly.
#SeanSherlock	Labour	14028	Cork East	speech	unkown-language	2011-05-04 00:00:00	Prelude	229	I can give that assurance.  The point the Deputy made parallels my own thinking.  It is clear that what is required is a more holistic approach to how we view training.  It must be with a view to ensuring progression and an outcome in order that the person in training either stays within the organisation across a broad public or private sector sphere or that he or she moves on but that he or she will have gained a progressive experience.  I will bear in mind what the Deputy said.  As he will appreciate, at this juncture I cannot say what will be in the jobs initiative document, but there will be a clear emphasis on the points he made.
#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-05-04 00:00:00	Prelude	230	Will the Minister of State outline when the internship places will be available on foot of the commitment given by his Fine Gael partners in government in the five point plan to provide placements for 23,000 unemployed graduates?
#SeanSherlock	Labour	14028	Cork East	speech	unkown-language	2011-05-04 00:00:00	Prelude	231	The programme for Government has been negotiated and mandated by the House.  The most prescient approach would be to await publication of the jobs initiative.
#RuairiQuinn	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-party	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-dob	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-05-04 00:00:00	Prelude	232	The Deputy will be aware that the special needs assistant, SNA, scheme provides additional supports for schools to enable them to support pupils with significant care needs.  SNAs are allocated to schools by the National Council for Special Education, NCSE, through its network of local special educational needs organisers, SENOs.  The NCSE operates within my Department's criteria in allocating such support.  This now includes a requirement for the NCSE to have regard to an overall cap on the number of SNA posts.Schools may apply to the NCSE for an SNA post to support students with an assessed special educational need who also have a significant medical need or a significant physical or sensory impairment.  Students with an assessed special educational need who present with significantly challenging behaviour may also qualify for some SNA support.  I have no plans to review the allocation of special needs assistants in DEIS — developing equality of opportunity in schools — schools, as SNAs are allocated to such schools on the same basis as other schools, including special schools, that is, on the assessed individual needs of pupils in the context of the resources available to a school.The programme for Government clearly states education will be a priority for the Government and that we will endeavour to protect and enhance the educational experience of children, young people and students.  To that end, we will endeavour to protect front-line services in education.  However, the fiscal position is extremely difficult.  The country is effectively in receivership.  It is necessary to ensure educational services are delivered within the resources available.  I intend to prioritise and support special educational services.  However, I cannot revisit the previous Government's decision to place a cap on the number of posts available under the SNA scheme.  That number is 10,575 whole-time equivalent, WTE, posts.  That is a significant number of posts and, unlike other areas of the public sector, vacancies are being filled up to this number.  It also represents continual increases in the number of SNAs in recent years.Additional information not given on the floor of the House.It is considered that with equitable and careful management and distribution of these resources there should be sufficient posts to provide access to SNA support for all children who require such care support to attend school in accordance with departmental criteria.The NCSE asked schools to submit all applications for SNA support to it by 18 March and intends to inform schools of their annual SNA allocations as soon as possible in advance of the coming school year.  My Department and I will be glad to consider any suggestions from school management or parent representative organisations as to how the allocation of SNA resources can best be managed within the context of the overall limit on SNA numbers established.  In that regard, I am committed to making whatever improvements are possible to the resource allocation system.  We all must understand the legacy of economic mismanagement which the previous Government gave to this country.
#SeanCroweSF	unknown-#SeanCroweSF-party	unknown-#SeanCroweSF-dob	unknown-#SeanCroweSF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-05-04 00:00:00	Prelude	233	The Minister will accept that there are particular demands on DEIS schools in terms of where children come from.  I accept what he said, that he has an envelope for education services.  However, there are particular demands on SNA support services in DEIS schools.  In many cases there is a senior and a junior school operating in tandem.  When the EPSEN Act was passing through the House we talked about the provision of seamless support for those with special educational needs.  I am concerned that where a junior and a senior school operate within an area the SNA supports will be retained by pupils when they move to the senior school.  Would it be possible for the Minister to examine this possibility, bearing in mind the special needs of such children?  What is happening in the community is being reflected in the schools and as such, there is a greater demand on teachers in DEIS schools.  We should try to retain supports for pupils at first and second level.  The Minister should, therefore, examine the possibility of ensuring SNA supports are maintained throughout the education process.  I accept there might be difficulties in stand-alone schools, but it would be one way to address the problem.  What is evident in the schools reflects what is happening in society.  The demands are much greater in DEIS schools which cannot seek funding from parents.  They do not have the extra supports into which other schools can tap.  I urge the Minister to examine the issue and revert to me.
#RuairiQuinn	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-party	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-dob	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-05-04 00:00:00	Prelude	234	The Deputy is well aware that a DEIS school, in contrast to a regular primary or post-primary school, receives additional resources for the very reasons outlined, namely, the socio-economic background of the pupils, the lack of resources among parents that could otherwise be made available through a PTA in a middle-class or non-DEIS school.The difference between what the Deputy proposes and what is available is that the SNAs are tailored to the needs of individual students, irrespective of whether they are in a DEIS school or not.  It is the individual need of the student, for whatever reason, as assessed by the SENO and as signed off for by the NCSE, that makes for an assessment of that individual student as requiring an SNA.  I understand the sentiment expressed by Deputy Crowe, but what he is effectively saying is that where there are existing SNAs in DEIS schools, they should be kept there, even if the individual with the specific need that brought them there may have moved on to post-primary school.  We have capped the number of SNAs at 10,575.  We are looking at how that will play out and the points made by the Deputy will be taken into consideration.
#SeanCroweSF	unknown-#SeanCroweSF-party	unknown-#SeanCroweSF-dob	unknown-#SeanCroweSF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-05-04 00:00:00	Prelude	235	We have a trapdoor in the case where an SNA is shared between two schools.  If the SNA is not based in the school, the child in need cannot move on, based on the envelope available.  That is one way of looking at it.  My proposal is radical, but it could work to solve the difficulties faced by schools.  We have seen that positive changes are taking place, with smaller classes and so on.  However, we are now talking about pulling away the foundation, the structures and the supports for those children.
#RuairiQuinn	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-party	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-dob	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2011-05-04 00:00:00	Prelude	236	I propose to take Questions Nos. 9 and 11 together.County Louth VEC has informed my Department that it projects an increased enrolment of 216 students in September 2011.  My Department has therefore given provisional approval for an additional 11 teaching posts, which will be subject to confirmation of the actual enrolment in September.  All vacancies and any additional teaching posts should, where possible, be filled through the redeployment of surplus permanent teachers.Devolved funding for nine additional mainstream classrooms was approved by my Department in 2010 for schools that operate under the management of County Louth VEC, in order to cater for their immediate accommodation needs.  The classrooms are currently in construction and should be ready for occupation in September 2011.I appreciate the record of accomplishment of vocational education committees throughout this country in delivering a high quality education.  The VEC system has made a significant contribution to the development of our education system.  It has a tradition of providing high quality education and of placing a particular emphasis on meeting the needs of the most disadvantaged in our  society.As the Deputy will be aware, the previous Government decided to reduce the number of VECs from 33 to 16, and on the merger of particular VECs.  I want to ensure that progress is made in bringing about a reduction in the number of VECs.  I invited the Irish Vocational Education Association, IVEA, to submit alternative rationalisation proposals, as it had expressed concerns on the configuration of the proposed new entities.  I am informed the IVEA will respond shortly.  I have made clear to the IVEA that while I am open to considering proposals on alternative configurations, the invitation does not mean the process of rationalisation will be slowed or diminished.In considering the submission from the IVEA regarding particular mergers, I will seek savings and to ensure that the new structure will involve a substantial reduction in the number of individual bodies, but with each remaining one of greater scale than currently.  I am confident that this merger will ensure an even higher quality educational service for students and the public alike.Regardless of the final shape of the reconfiguration, there will still be a requirement for co-operation and joint endeavour between all of the new local bodies.  The current work on arriving at a single grant awarding body for the student support schemes is a good example of avoiding duplication and achieving improved public service delivery.
#SeanCroweSF	unknown-#SeanCroweSF-party	unknown-#SeanCroweSF-dob	unknown-#SeanCroweSF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-05-04 00:00:00	Prelude	237	Is there a timescale for the rationalisation programme?  I presume the thinking behind the rationalisation has to do with cost savings.  What cost savings will there be as a result of the amalgamation of these services?  Different changes have been proposed over the years for this sector by the various parties, but to a large extent the system as it exists has worked and there have been successful outcomes for students.  Why is the system being tinkered with now when the savings that will be made are minimal?  Why are we going ahead with amalgamation of these VECs?  The VECs have been democratic, open and accountable bodies, but we are talking about reducing their number.  This will be harmful to students and I do not see the logic behind the plan for reducing the number of committees.
#RuairiQuinn	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-party	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-dob	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-05-04 00:00:00	Prelude	238	I am informed that the original estimate of the savings that might be obtained is of the order of €3 million.  I hope that when we get into the detail of the amalgamation the savings will be even greater.  The configuration and structure of the VECs reflect an Ireland that no longer exists in terms of transport, access and communications and there is a wide discrepancy in the scale and operation of the different VECs.  The one with which the Deputy is familiar, County Dublin VEC, is an enormous operation with a vast number of post-primary schools, not to mention an array of support services for further education, adult education and literacy.  In contrast, other VECs have very small budgets and turnover of less than €15 million, as against €50 million.  We hope to achieve savings and sensible rationalisation, having regard to modern communications and transportation contacts.With regard to the timeframe, I expect to hear back from the IVEA within the next ten days or so.  I will then bring a proposal to Government that will set out the proposal for proceeding with the rationalisation and for legislative reform in the context of the VECs, their entitlements and the possibilities.  Eight Acts since 1930 cover the operation of the VECs.  This legislation needs to be consolidated so that we can provide clarity for the sector.  I look forward, with the co-operation of the House to debate here and with the Oireachtas committee on the issues.  I hope we will have certainty by the end of the year and that the legislation may be enacted by then.  I know from previous experience that the worst thing that can happen to any organisation is for a pronouncement of change to be made and for that to be followed by uncertainty with regard to the timeframe and the delivery.  That puts everybody on the defensive and the uncertainty compounds the difficulties.  Drawing from previous experience, I am determined to avoid that outcome.

I have not set my heart on a particular configuration.  There are alternatives, but I will wait to see the IVEA suggestions.  I gather the central council has come up with a set of recommendations, but these must still be signed up to by the individual VECs.  The matter lies with them and as soon as I receive the proposals, I will move forward.
#RuairiQuinn	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-party	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-dob	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-05-04 00:00:00	Prelude	241	The programme for Government clearly states that education will be a priority for this Government and that we will endeavour to protect and enhance the educational experience of children, young people and students.  We will endeavour to protect frontline services in education.  However, the fiscal position is extremely difficult.It is necessary to ensure that educational services are delivered within the resources available.  I intend to prioritise and support special educational services.  However, I cannot revisit the previous Government's decision to place a cap on the number of posts available under the special needs assistant scheme.  This number is 10,575 whole time equivalent posts.  This is a significant number of posts and, unlike other areas of the public sector, vacancies are being filled up to this number.  It also represents continual increases in the number of SNAs over recent years.  It is considered that with equitable and careful management and distribution of these resources, there should be sufficient posts to provide access to SNA support for all children who require such care support to attend school, in accordance with departmental criteria.The National Council for Special Education, NCSE, is responsible, through its network of local special educational needs organisers, SENOs, for allocating resource teachers and special needs assistants to schools to support children with special educational needs.  The NCSE operates within my Department's criteria in allocating such support.  This now includes a requirement for the NCSE to have regard to an overall cap on the number of SNA posts.The NCSE has issued a circular to all schools advising of the allocation process for the 2011-12 school year.  A key feature of the amended scheme will be to provide for an annual allocation of SNA support to eligible schools.  The NCSE has asked schools to submit all applications for SNA support to them by 18 March 2011 and intends to inform schools of their annual SNA allocation as soon as possible in advance of the coming school year.My Department and I will be glad to consider any suggestions from school management or parent representative organisations as to how the allocation of SNA resources can best be managed within the context of the overall limit on SNA numbers established.  In this regard I am committed to making whatever improvements are possible to the resource allocation system.We need to understand the legacy of economic mismanagement which the last Government gave to this country.  We have in effect lost our economic sovereignty and every Member of this House continually needs to understand that.
#JoanCollins	unknown-#JoanCollins-party	unknown-#JoanCollins-dob	unknown-#JoanCollins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-05-04 00:00:00	Prelude	242	I thank the Minister for the standard reply.  The last Government's decision to cap the number of SNAs in schools was disgraceful.  Even heretofore it was difficult to get their children assessed, to get them into schools and to get the SNAs that are needed.  Now they are being told that because of economic constraints their children may not and will not have that support in the future.  The Minister might put a cap on the number of SNAs but he cannot put a cap on the number of children being born every year who will have special educational needs in the future.  I heard the Minister's speech to the INTO conference, which did not mention resource teachers or SNAs once.

#JoanCollins	unknown-#JoanCollins-party	unknown-#JoanCollins-dob	unknown-#JoanCollins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-05-04 00:00:00	Prelude	244	The Minister has choices like everybody else.  The cost of employing the required 2,000 SNAs would be €60 million, of which €40 million would be saved on social welfare payments.  Really it would cost €20 million to employ 2,000 more SNAs, which is a drop in the ocean.  The Minister should consider that alternative. The cost of subsidising private fee-paying schools teachers is €100 million.

#JoanCollins	unknown-#JoanCollins-party	unknown-#JoanCollins-dob	unknown-#JoanCollins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-05-04 00:00:00	Prelude	248	I cannot accept that.  The Minister has a choice and can stop paying teachers in fee-paying schools, thereby saving the State €100 million, which could be put into providing badly needed SNAs and resource teachers.  The choice is between protecting people and keeping privileged schools going.

Can the Minister give them any hope?  Some of their children have very severe special needs requirements.  One child, Aisling McEniff's five-year-old son, is unique in the world.  He has been in intensive care eight times and has had two heart operations.  He has Down's syndrome and——

#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-05-04 00:00:00	Prelude	258	Special schools such as the Holy Family school in Cootehill in my county or St. Raphael's in Celbridge, which has already been mentioned, cater for pupils with very complex and severe physical and intellectual disabilities.  Are those schools exempt from the cap on their total SNA allocation?
#RuairiQuinn	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-party	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-dob	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-05-04 00:00:00	Prelude	259	The National Council for Special Education is the professional body which through its locally based SENOs assesses individuals referred to it and comes to a professional conclusion whether a particular child qualifies for support.  It is not the function of the Department of Education and Skills in order to prevent it becoming open to manipulation and abuse as we have seen in the past with other schemes.  The professional assessment is not made by politicians or by civil servants who have a generalist education and do not have the necessary expertise.  The number of SNAs has increased by almost 1,000% since they were established.

The previous Government against the background of economic constraints, which still exists, decided to cap it at the level I mentioned and investigate ways in which some degree of internal prioritisation can be made.  It would be easy for me to tell Deputy Boyd Barrett that I would review the specific individual application, but I will not discuss individual cases in the House as it would be wrong.Question No. 11 answered with Question No. 9.
#RuairiQuinn	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-party	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-dob	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-05-04 00:00:00	Prelude	263	The programme for Government sets out that education will be a priority for the Government and that we will endeavour to protect and enhance the educational experience of children, young people and students.  To that end, we are committing — during the tenure of the Government — to the publication of a plan for the implementation of the Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs Act 2004 to prioritise access for children with special needs to an individual education plan.  The priority will be to move to a system where necessary supports follow a child from primary to second level and to achieve greater integration of special needs-related services.The Deputy will know that a number of sections of the Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs Act have already been commenced.  As required under the Act, the NCSE made recommendations regarding the implementation of the provisions of the Act and suggested additional investment over a period of years of up to €235 million per annum across the education and health sectors.  My Department's opinion is that the level of investment required would be greater than that envisaged in the NCSE report.In the light of the very difficult economic situation and these significant costs, the previous Government deferred the full implementation of the Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs Act.  It is my intention to prepare a plan to implement the Act in line with the programme for Government, subject to the serious financial constraints which we have inherited from the previous Fianna Fáil-Green Party Government.  All parts of the Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs Act, which have not been commenced to date, will need to be considered during this process.  The Deputy will appreciate that commencement of individual aspects of the Act in isolation is difficult because of linkages across the various sections.  Given the extent of the considerations required and also requirements to consider a number of other priority policy areas regarding the education of children with special educational needs, it is not possible to advise a specific date for the publication of this plan at this early stage of the Government's term in office.
#SeanCroweSF	unknown-#SeanCroweSF-party	unknown-#SeanCroweSF-dob	unknown-#SeanCroweSF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-05-04 00:00:00	Prelude	264	Many parents are concerned that they are not getting speedy assessments.  When the Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs Act was passed by this House it was supposed to provide supports for those families, but we increasingly find that the families need to make up the shortfall.  We have no timescale for when the Act will be fully implemented.  I listened to what the Minister said about difficulties with funding and so on, but these families and their children are suffering.  Does the Minister not accept that families will need to go back to the courts again to try to get the resources and supports needed for their children's educational needs?  It was very positive to move children from special schools into mainstream ones, but without those supports there is no alternative for families.  Increasingly, families must make up the shortfall themselves.  It is a case of them borrowing from the credit union or other families and communities having to organise fund-raising functions because the State is not supplying the basic resources to which children are entitled under the Act.
#RuairiQuinn	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-party	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-dob	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-05-04 00:00:00	Prelude	265	I share the Deputy's concern and acknowledge his genuine commitment in this area.  The reality is that when the EPSEN legislation was introduced, no one appreciated fully the extent of support that would be required, or the cost of that support, as indicated in my initial reply.  Therefore, it is understandable the decision outlined was taken.  When the level of growth had expanded by virtually 1,000% in ten years, there had to be a review.  There is a cap.  This area has not been subject to a reduction in numbers, as is the case in other areas of the public service.  Officials are considering ways to maximise the effectiveness of the very substantial resource already in place.
#SeanCroweSF	unknown-#SeanCroweSF-party	unknown-#SeanCroweSF-dob	unknown-#SeanCroweSF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-05-04 00:00:00	Prelude	266	Let me give an example based on the predicament of a family in a certain school.  The child in question is being dismissed from school because, from 21 February to 11 March, there was an unmet requirement to supply psychological support, psychiatric support, occupational therapy, speech and language therapy and social worker support.  The family is supposed to come up with the goods in the knowledge that the child will be dismissed from the school if it fails.  That is the pressure families are being put under owing to the lack of resources.  What does one say to a family whose child faces dismissal from school?  The chances of having the child enrolled in another school are nigh on impossible.  That is the pressure that has been placed on just one family in recent weeks.  This is crazy.  I do not know how the State can respond.  I outline but one example; I do not know how many others there are.  What I have outlined is a microcosm of what is happening to other families.  I may revert to the Minister on this case.
#RuairiQuinn	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-party	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-dob	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-05-04 00:00:00	Prelude	267	As I do not know the details of the individual case to which the Deputy referred, I will not prejudice any outcomes.  Clearly, the response from the school is one that the family should query with the special educational needs organiser with a view to determining why the school is adopting what seems to be such an extraordinarily demanding stance to which an ordinary family must respond.  I do not know if the special educational needs organiser was involved in mediation between the school and parents in this case.  If the Deputy has the details, I will certainly examine the case, but I cannot make any commitment.
#SeanSherlock	Labour	14028	Cork East	speech	unkown-language	2011-05-04 00:00:00	Prelude	268	I am responding on behalf of the Minister of State, Deputy Ciaran Cannon.The review group was established in January 2009.  The review was carried out as part of the 2009-11 round of value for money reviews approved by the previous Government and conducted in accordance with the criteria for such reviews set out in the Department of Finance's Value for Money and Policy Review Initiative Guidance Manual.  The emphasis in such reviews is on the efficiency and effectiveness of the programmes under examination to assess value for money in their delivery.The composition of value for money review committees can vary.  In this instance, membership of the steering committee was drawn from my Department and other relevant Departments and included an independent chairman, namely, Mr. Willie Soffe, former county manager of Fingal County Council, and two independent experts.All external stakeholders, including school patrons and parent and teacher organisations, were given an opportunity to make their views on the school transport scheme known.  The process included a call for submissions on a range of specific issues which resulted in 85 submissions.  In addition, following an assessment of these submissions and in order to give stakeholders a further opportunity to present their views, a day-long consultative forum was organised in October 2009 by the steering committee with a combination of individual sessions and an open forum discussion with the chairperson and committee members.  In this way, it was considered by the steering committee that all stakeholders were afforded a further opportunity to make a meaningful contribution to the review process.I am taking it that the Deputy is referring to the issue of the cessation of the closed school rule, CSR, as it relates to primary school transport eligibility.  This change was announced in budget 2011 by the previous Fianna Fáil-Green Party Government and derived from a recommendation in the published value for money review of the scheme.  To put the matter in context, the review showed that the unit cost of primary school transport was €1,020 per child.  Furthermore, the four year national recovery plan requires savings of €4.5 million to be made through operational efficiencies and other savings measures in the school transport budget in 2011, rising to overall full-year savings of €17 million by 2014.  The aggregation of the measures being implemented arising from the value for money review will be an important element in achieving these savings.It is important to stress there are a number of dimensions to the cessation of the closed school rule.  The first of these which will be implemented from September involves the uniform application of the distance criteria to all pupils travelling under the primary transport scheme, including those travelling under the closed school rule.  This means that children residing less than 3.2 km from the school of amalgamation will be deemed ineligible for school transport.  In such cases, the children concerned may apply for concessionary transport.Additional information not given on the floor of the House.The second element of the change is scheduled to take effect in September 2012 and will apply only in the case of pupils commencing their primary education from that date.  This second element will restrict school transport eligibility for those pupils entering in September 2012 to pupils who meet the distance eligibility criterion and are travelling to their nearest school.  Available statistics, based on sampling undertaken as part of the value for money review, indicate that the impact of this change will be limited as the majority of pupils categorised under the closed school rule are, in fact. attending their nearest school.  Therefore, the majority of these families will not be affected by this change.Before implementing this second main change which is proposed for 2012, my Department has requested Bus Éireann to conduct a detailed analysis of the on the ground impact for individual schools and the rural communities they serve.  This analysis will be based on the most up-to-date information available on current school transport usage patterns and I expect to have the information available to me this summer.  I will then have an opportunity to carefully examine the likely effect of this change well in advance of the 2012 implementation date.
#MichaelCreed	unknown-#MichaelCreed-party	unknown-#MichaelCreed-dob	unknown-#MichaelCreed-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-05-04 00:00:00	Prelude	269	The Minister of State is correct that this is a legacy issue.  The devil is in the detail.  I urge the Minister of State, in consultation with the Minister and his colleague, the Minister of State at the Department of Education and Skills, Deputy Ciaran Cannon, to tread very carefully.  On the alleged savings, while the Department has stated the impact will be minimal in terms of pupil numbers, there will be a disproportionate impact on small schools in respect of two matters.  The first concerns the change in the number required for the establishment or retention of a school bus service from seven to ten.  In small schools which are predominantly but not exclusively to be found in rural areas, increasing the number from seven to ten to retain or establish a bus service will in many circumstances mean that from 20% to 40% of pupils will need to be using school transport.  This will have very severe consequences for the viability of the schools in question.The second matter is that the closed school rule could mean that members of families will be sent in two directions.  I suggest a solution that the Minister of State might consider.  The catchment area of a closed school should be treated as a single catchment area for the future.  Therefore, the entitlement would relate to the central school——

#SeanSherlock	Labour	14028	Cork East	speech	unkown-language	2011-05-04 00:00:00	Prelude	272	I concur absolutely with the points the Deputy is making on the basis that I have received representations from families who are fearful they will be split as a result of the implementation of this mechanism.  I am aware there is a further review taking place and that it will conclude at an unspecified date some time this summer.  It should take a deeper look at exactly how many will be affected.  I am also aware of the potential for certain parishes to be affected adversely, whereby an amalgamated school may, ironically, have reduced numbers in the future.  There is no question but that a number of issues arise from the implementation of the initiative.  However, I ask the Deputy to give us some time pending the outcome of the review which will result in a closer examination of the exact effect on families.  I hope it will give rise to a further set of public utterances by the Minister on how some of the issues could be tackled.
#RuairiQuinn	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-party	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-dob	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-05-04 00:00:00	Prelude	273	I intend discussing the commitment in the programme for Government to negotiate the transfer of school infrastructure currently owned by 18 religious orders cited in the Ryan report, at no extra cost to the State, with my Cabinet colleagues in the near future.  This discussion will take account of my Department's engagement with the congregations regarding the potential use of the various property offers made to date and their acceptability to the State and the congregations' potential to augment their offers, so as to realise a 50:50 sharing of the costs of the response to residential institutional abuse.Against this background, the formal transfer, without cost to the State, of schools infrastructure could help achieve the 50:50 target.  The schools transferred will continue to be used by the religious congregations and/or their successor trusts with the same patronage arrangements as prevail today.  The difference would be that the Irish taxpayers, through the State, would be the owners of that educational infrastructure which would continue in use for educational purposes and the issue of change of use would, therefore, be unlikely to arise in the foreseeable future.  There will be further engagement with the congregations involved following the Government's consideration of the matter.

The reason I put this question down was to find out the timescale for this.  The Minister says it will go to Cabinet shortly.  What will the procedure be after that?  Will the Minister return to the Dáil to make an announcement on it?  There was concern that many of these properties would decrease in value, particularly with the collapse in the property market.  Some of this involves the direct transfer of schools but there was also talk of additional buildings being transferred.  Can the Minister outline when this will happen?  Have the discussions about it concluded?

#RuairiQuinn	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-party	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-dob	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-05-04 00:00:00	Prelude	277	I am anxious to proceed with this matter as quickly as possible in the interests of equity.  In this specific proposal we are not talking about getting extra cash.  It is about equity.  The religious teaching orders have already given a great deal and many of the valuations they had on their properties have collapsed, as has happened to the many people who are in negative equity.  They have not contributed to the desired target of 50:50, which is still the policy of this Government.I have told the religious teaching orders who own property that they could make good the balance to get as close to 50:50 as possible, and the figures are in the public domain, if they were to transfer the ownership of the schools that they currently possess and operate or which are operated by trusts on their behalf, with the clear assurance that the patronage arrangements of those schools would continue until such time as the schools in question decided or chose to change the patron.  However, the Irish taxpayer would be clearly given the legal ownership of those properties, so they could not be sold in future generations.  They would remain within the education system.I initiated this idea when I was a Member of the Opposition.  It was an attempt on my part to understand the constraints and pressures being experienced by these aging religious teaching congregations.  Every Member of the House is aware of the cost of health care for the elderly, and in many, if not all, cases these congregations do not have a new generation coming through to support them, as would be the case in secular or civilian life.  The offer I suggested at the time, which is now part of Government policy, was to enter negotiations and to point out to the trusts or religious congregations that they are short of the 50% target that was set by the previous Oireachtas.  One way of meeting it is to hand over the keys and ownership of the properties, on the clear understanding and assurance that they would continue to operate those schools and that the patronage arrangements currently in place would remain in place for such time as they wished.  It is up to them if they wish to change them.

We will initiate those discussions quite early.  The proposal is already in the public domain and the people involved are well aware of my sentiments.  I have expressed them more extensively elsewhere.  They know what is expected and they are aware of the safeguards.  They also know that the property market at present does not offer an alternative for them.  The expanding school population suggests that we need the schools anyway.  My suggestion is that one way to respond in lieu for what has happened is to symbolically and physically transfer the ownership at no cost.

My Department provides annual grants to the recognised management bodies at primary and post-primary level to assist them in providing management support to the schools in their sectors.Management bodies such as the Catholic Primary Schools Management Association, CPSMA, Educate Together, Church of Ireland Board of Education at primary level or at second level the Joint Managerial Board/Association of Management of Catholic Secondary Schools, JMB/AMCSS, the Irish Vocational Education Association, IVEA, and the Association of Community and Comprehensive Schools, ACCS, provide important support services for schools on employment, legal, financial and other matters.  The individual management bodies' remit reflects the particular patronage of the schools which they serve, for example,  the CPSMA provides support services to primary schools under Catholic patronage and it is a similar position in relation to each of the other management bodies.  The core funding to the management bodies at primary and post-primary level amounts to a total of about €1.4 million per annum.

#RuairiQuinn	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-party	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-dob	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-05-04 00:00:00	Prelude	285	The National Council for Curriculum and Assessment, NCCA, has been asked to review the junior certificate and advise on the scope for reform which would cater for the promotion of understanding, creativity and innovation, and which would provide appropriate evidence of learning.  Concerns have also been raised about curriculum overload and rote learning.  As I await advice on this matter from the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment setting out the detail of its proposed reforms, it would not be appropriate for me to spell out a definitive timeframe for implementation at this stage.  I expect this advice this summer, after it has been discussed with the partners in education through the council's consultative structures. I will then to be in a position to consider more fully the implementation issues which arise.I would like to see movement on this for students entering second level in September 2012, but detailed implementation will need to be considered in the context of the proposals being presented and the resources available, and the need to prioritise the national literacy and numeracy strategy.  In 2010, 88% of the 56,088 candidates sat junior certificate science.  In other words, nearly 90% took science on a voluntary basis.  I do not wish to pre-empt the advice of the NCCA on whether this should be a compulsory subject.  A total of 90% is not a bad statistic in the first instance.
#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-05-04 00:00:00	Prelude	286	The Minister will agree that curriculum reform should result in a more active learning experience.  A new post-primary junior cycle programme is required to reinvigorate the junior certificate.  I hope the Minister will be able to move on these important issues as quickly as possible.  I mentioned previously the need to complete the roll-out of project mathematics.  Will he confirm that this is his intention?
#RuairiQuinn	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-party	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-dob	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-05-04 00:00:00	Prelude	287	There is general acceptance in the education sector that the secondary level, in the junior and leaving certificate cycle, must be reformed.  However, the calls for reform have come from the third level sector, particularly the universities.  There is not much point in reforming the junior and senior cycles and, by extension, the leaving certificate and the Central Applications Office, CAO, unless there is buy-in from the third level sector.  In that context, I met the heads of the seven universities — I have yet to meet the heads of the institutes of technology but I will be doing so — in order to involve them in the process with the NCCA so that we might reach an agreed understanding of the kind of educational inputs, formations and structures which would be appropriate in respect of the type of learning outcomes to which the Deputy refers and which would be put in place at second level.  We must also arrive at an agreement regarding how this will be assessed and how it will be interacted with at third level in order that there might be a progression through second level and into third level.  In that context, whatever system we put in place must meet the needs of the universities.There has been a disconnect in this area.  The reform of the junior certificate cycle is proceeding and I am awaiting the reports relating to it.  However, we must, at the next stage, integrate whatever changes take place with entry to and passage through third level and further education.

Will the Minister include in the study the position of dyslexic children, many of whom are intelligent but who struggle to deal with examinations?  Prior to the conclusion of the work relating to the report, will the Minister instruct the Department to ensure that children who had access to readers for their junior certificate examinations will continue to have access to them for the leaving certificate?  I understand that this service has been requested in a number of cases but that it has not been made available.  Some children will be very disadvantaged by the withdrawal of the reader service.

#RuairiQuinn	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-party	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-dob	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-05-04 00:00:00	Prelude	290	I wish to advise the Deputy that the National Council for Special Education, NCSE, is responsible, through its network of local special educational needs organisers, SENOs, for allocating resource teaching hours to schools to support children with special educational needs.  The NCSE operates within my Department's criteria in allocating such support.  It is not the practice of National Educational Psychological Service, NEPS, psychologists to recommend specific numbers of resource teaching hours.  NEPS psychologists assess children's needs.  The SENOs determine the hours to be allocated in accordance with departmental policy and taking account of reports such as those provided by NEPS psychologists.In respect of the allocation of resource teaching hours, the Department of Education and Skills is required to ensure that the overall allocation of teaching posts does not exceed the targets set out in the Government's employment control framework.  The Department had planned for a certain amount of increased growth in teacher numbers across the school sector in 2011 in line with increased demographic growth.  In respect of resource teaching hours for children with special educational needs, allowance was made for growth in 2011 over and above normal demographic increase levels.  In 2010, the total number of whole-time equivalent, WTE, posts provided for resource hours teaching — including under the general allocation model — was approximately 9,600.  By comparison, approximately 9,950 WTE posts have been provided for 2011.  The Deputy will note that this represents an increase in the number of WTE posts available for the year 2011.My Department requested the NCSE to provide data on the numbers and rate of application for additional resource teaching hours to date this year so that this information can be considered in the context of the Department's employment control framework obligations.  The NCSE has also been asked to pause sanctioning additional resource teaching support hours to allow for collection and consideration of this data by the Department in conjunction with the NCSE.  It should be noted that this is a temporary suspension of the allocation process in order to allow for consideration and analysis of this issue prior to any decisions being made.  The NCSE issued a circular to schools advising them that the final date for submission of any outstanding completed applications for resource teaching supports is 13 May next.
#RichardBoydBarrett	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-party	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-dob	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-05-04 00:00:00	Prelude	291	The Minister wrote to schools in March and instructed them to stop allocating resource hours to pupils on foot of the review of the numbers employed in the area of education which was demanded by the IMF.  This means that children who have been lucky enough to receive assessments from NEPS and who are obliged to wait months for such assessments will not now get what they are due.  The stress that parents and children undergo while awaiting assessments and in dealing with the results thereof will be further exacerbated by the Minister withdrawing children's rights to resource hours.The Minister stated that it is child abuse not to read to children.  Is it not even worse abuse to deny some of the most vulnerable and needy children in society the educational resources they require?  It is estimated that approximately 400 additional resource teacher posts will be needed by the end of the year and that 300 of these could go unapproved at a cost of approximately €13.5 million per year.  I understand the Minister has recently been made aware that the costs associated with dealing with parents who are fighting legal cases relating to their children's entitlements amount to €14.5 million.

#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-05-04 00:00:00	Prelude	296	I welcome the opportunity to update the House on the outcome of the first and second quarterly programme review of the EU-IMF programme of financial support.  Since taking office, the Government has addressed the banking situation, with the measures set out in the announcement made on 31 March.  The Government has also engaged in a more co-operative fashion at European level with a view to restoring Ireland's position within the European Union.  This approach will continue at this month's Eurogroup and ECOFIN meetings, where we will continue to pursue our case for a reduction in the cost of the programme.The benefits of this greater engagement are already apparent.  Deputies will be aware that last month the Government successfully concluded the first and second quarterly programme review mission with the EU Commission, the ECB and the IMF, that is, the troika.  The purpose of the review was to evaluate performance against targets to date on all the elements of the programme of financial support for Ireland, including fiscal developments, the macroeconomic outlook, progress on commitments in the restructuring of the financial sector and structural reform.During this programme review, a number of my Cabinet colleagues and I, along with senior officials, met representatives from the troika and assured them of the Government's commitment to the fiscal targets set out in the EU-IMF programme.  In the negotiations with the troika, the Government outlined the policy priorities that it wished to have included in the revised programme.  I am happy to say there was sufficient flexibility within the programme to allow us to include these important policy measures, while respecting the overall fiscal parameters and goals of the programme.These policy priorities include measures such as the jobs initiative, the reversal of the minimum wage cut, the comprehensive spending review and important changes to banking policy in areas such as recapitalisation, as well as ending further loan transfers to NAMA.  These are included in the draft revised programme documents, which have been circulated for Members' information in advance of this debate.  These documents include the revised memorandum of understanding and memorandum on economic and financial policy, the technical memorandum of understanding and the accompanying letters of intent.  I have sent these documents to the EU agencies and to the IMF.The review will be formally completed with the consideration by the Eurogroup, ECOFIN and the IMF executive board of these revised documents, along with the reports by their various staff on progress to date.  The final documents will be made publicly available following final approval on 16 and 17 May.  It is clear that the conditions of the programme are being broadly met to date.  The fiscal programme is on track and important progress has been made in addressing banking sector challenges.It is encouraging that the fiscal programme is on track.  The targets set for the Exchequer primary balance — the Exchequer balance excluding interest costs — for both the end of December and the end of March were met by a comfortable margin.  The targets for net central government debt for the same periods were also achieved.  We remain on course.  My Department will publish data later this afternoon which will show that, in broad terms, spending and tax outturns to the end of April are in line with expectations.  The details will be published as usual at 4.30 p.m. today.However, it remains the case that further significant budgetary adjustments will have to be made in the coming years so that we align more closely the State's revenues and its spending and reduce our levels of borrowing.  We cannot continue to spend more than we earn.  This is simply not sustainable.  It is important to ensure that our debt level, although high, remains on a sustainable path if we are to be in a position to return to accessing market funding as soon as possible.During the review mission, we reaffirmed our commitment to achieving a deficit of less than 3% of GDP by the end of 2015.  We also made it clear that we would adhere to the aggregate adjustment target as set out in the joint programme for the combined period 2011-12.  However, we did outline that given the current degree of uncertainty surrounding the economic growth outlook, we would review progress on deficit reduction in the context of achieving the deficit reduction target by 2015, in preparation for the 2013 budget.  We will strive to ensure that future budgetary consolidation is as fair as it can be and that it does not overburden those in most difficulty.Budgetary reform to strengthen our fiscal framework is an important element in the Government programme and it is also something that we are committed to implementing under the terms of the EU-IMF programme of financial support.  In November 2010, the Joint Committee on Finance and the Public Service published a detailed report entitled Macroeconomic Policy and Fiscal and Economic Governance.  In addition, early last month, my Department published on its website a discussion document entitled Reforming Ireland's Budgetary Framework with a view to assisting debate and setting out a range of policy options in this important area.Within the next number of weeks, my Department will hold a seminar to advance the discussion on fiscal reform.  In addition, under the EU-IMF programme, we are required by the end of June to establish the proposed fiscal advisory council.  We are also required to introduce a fiscal responsibility Bill by the third quarter of this year.  Work is advancing on both fronts.The macroeconomic outlook was also discussed during the negotiations with the troika.  There was a general consensus that the Irish economy will return to growth this year, albeit at a more modest level than envisaged at budget time.  The latest official forecasts were set out in last week's stability programme update.  GDP is forecast to grow by around 0.75% in 2011 and 2.5% in 2012.  This growth is largely export led, with a gradual improvement in domestic demand.  For the period 2013 to 2015, the Irish economy is forecast to grow by 3% per annum on average.As Deputy McGrath pointed out yesterday, 0.75% growth is not very dramatic.  However, it is worth putting this in context.  In 2008, the economy declined by 3.5%.  In 2009, it declined by 7.6%.  In 2010, contrary to predictions, it declined by 1%.  That is a decline in the economy of over 12% in the last three years.  In the fourth year of the cycle, we now have growth in the economy and it is beginning to accelerate.  It may not be what was predicted at budget time, but when we take a figure of minus one for 2010, then 0.75% for 2011 means there is a lift of 1.75%.  The projection for 2012 is 2.5% and it is 3% for 2013 and 2014.If we can get more confidence back in the economy, continue the export-led drive and concentrate on different sectors of the economy where growth and employment are possible, and if we can encourage people with savings to start spending again in the consumer market, then we may be able to get those growth figures up another bit.  The overall strategy of the Government must be to grow the economy and to get people back to work and to start paying our way again.  The situation is improving and we see the level of the improvement when we look at the decline in growth for three years in a row, which has now been replaced by the start of an upward growth pattern.As outlined in the stability programme update and in the discussions with the troika, there is a high degree of uncertainty surrounding macroeconomic projections for Ireland and the world at this time.  Due to this, we consider it prudent to review progress on deficit reduction in preparation for the 2013 budget.  Our immediate priority is to support enterprise, restore confidence to the economy and get people investing and spending to create sustainable employment.  To that end, next week we will be presenting a jobs initiative to the House. The measures to be introduced to assist in the generation of employment have been outlined in broad terms in the programme for Government.  The measures are designed to lift public morale and confidence in the economy, to provide jobs, to provide suitable job placement for unemployed persons and to encourage spending by consumers.  It became clear during the review mission that there was sufficient flexibility within the programme to allow us to include this important initiative, while respecting the overall fiscal parameters and goals of the programme.This Government is committed to protecting the vulnerable, which is why we are committed to reversing the recent cut in the minimum wage.  The effect on business costs will be offset by a reduction in employers' PRSI.  In addition, we are reviewing the employment regulation orders, or EROs, and the registered employment agreements, or REAs, and are promoting other measures to increase competition in sheltered sectors of the economy.  All of these measures are part of a comprehensive package designed to make work pay and improve the competitiveness of the economy.The review group on State assets and liabilities published its report on 20 April 2011.  As set out in the programme for Government, non-strategic assets up to a value of €2 billion will only be sold when market conditions are right and when adequate regulatory structures are in place.  The review group has been clear that it does not favour a fire sale.  As the Government comes to a view on what parts of the report's recommendations it wishes to implement, we will agree with our EU-IMF colleagues on the appropriate use of realised funds, with a view to getting the right balance between debt reduction and growth stimulation.There are several structural measures in social welfare to which the Government is committed under the revised memorandum of understanding.  This includes a commitment to reduce the risk of long-term employment though a number of initiatives such as reforming the unemployment benefit system and taking steps to tackle unemployment and poverty traps.  The Government is also committed to reforming the system of labour activation policies by improving the efficiency of the administration of unemployment benefits, through social assistance and active labour market policies, enhancing conditionality on work and training availability and the introduction of instruments to identify better job seekers' needs — this is known as profiling — and increased levels of engagement, including the application of sanction mechanisms for beneficiaries who do not comply with the conditions of job-search.These measures are linked to other structural changes with the transfer of FÁS employment and community services programmes to the Department of Social Protection.  Changes in working age payments and to rent supplement are part of the structural commitments within the EU-IMF programme.  They will also assist with the budgetary stabilisation process.Among the other structural measures to be progressed this year are an assessment structure for water provision and charging, and also a review of the energy sector with particular reference to electricity and gas sectors.  Reform of personal insolvency and bankruptcy laws is also proposed to assist persons to re-engage in economic activity in society.The review by the external authorities notes the good progress we have made in restructuring of the banking system.  On the wider banking landscape, we have met the target of carrying out the assessment of the capital and liquidity needs of the banks and the results were published at the end of March.  I will not repeat in detail what I dealt with in my statement of 31 March to the House, but I believe the assessment gives us a firm estimate of the needs of recapitalising and restoring the banking system and a framework for how this will be achieved in the coming years.  Central to that framework is the deleveraging of the banks to make them smaller but more robust and reduce their dependency on funding from central authorities so that they can re-enter the markets in the future to a greater extent.I set out on 31 March the outline of the approach to the banking sector including the establishment of two pillar banks, the effective amalgamation of the EBS into AIB as part of that process and the selling off from Irish Life & Permanent of the life assurance business.  Under the programme of financial support, the Government was committed to submitting a plan to the EU Commission by end-January for the resolution of Anglo Irish Bank and INBS.  This deadline was met and a plan to wind down these institutions is with the Commission awaiting its decisions.  In the meanwhile however, we are pushing ahead with the overall strategy and, to this end, the deposits and matching assets were transferred out of the institutions in February.  The path forward has now been set for these two bodies.  The Central Bank is reviewing the capital needs of the two bodies and the results will be available in May.  Should additional capital be needed the Government will be involved in consultation.The Government has shown determined action in tackling banking issues and these plans will develop a new banking sector better matched to the needs of the economy, and help the banks play their role in funding economic revival.  I should also note that proposals for a new banking resolution regime were published at the end of January and this matter will be coming before the House soon for debate.  This also will help in the future to deal with banking crises.The Central Bank will continue to build on the programme of initiatives already underway in the area of banking supervision.  It will further strengthen its capacity to supervise credit institutions by reinforcing its staffing levels and expertise.  The Central Bank will also enhance its risk assessment and monitoring framework, including the collection of relevant data from the banking system, particularly drawing on the lessons learned in the PCAR process on data validation and integrity and asset quality review.I will publish legislation before the summer to enhance the supervision and enforcement powers of the Central Bank.  This legislation will take on board:——

#MichaelMcGrath	unknown-#MichaelMcGrath-party	unknown-#MichaelMcGrath-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcGrath-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-05-04 00:00:00	Prelude	299	I welcome the opportunity to make a contribution to the debate on the outcome of the second quarterly EU-IMF programme review mission.  This review has resulted in a new set of programme documents which the Government released yesterday evening, including a draft of the updated memorandum of understanding between Ireland and the EU and IMF.I welcome the fact that the conditions of the programme have been broadly met to date.  The programme presents an essential funding source for the running of the State.  The programme agreed in November last has been much criticised but I have yet to hear a credible source of funding which would allow for essential public services in this country to be maintained.  All of us hope that Ireland can return to the sovereign debt markets as soon as possible and, therefore, no longer be subject to the onerous conditionality imposed under this agreement.  I will return to this issue later.The review concludes that the fiscal programme is on track.  The new Government has now fully accepted the €6 billion fiscal correction for 2011 which was introduced by the previous Government in December last.  No changes have been made to that budget despite the most trenchant opposition to it in December last from those parties now in Government.The Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, indicated in the Dáil yesterday that the Exchequer returns to the end of April, which I understand are being published this afternoon, are ahead of the projections set out in December last's budget.  This is to be welcomed.  It will remain essential that the path of fiscal correction which has been laid out continues to be pursued.  That will not be an easy task for the new Government and will require a seismic change in the attitude adopted by the Government parties since 2008 when the process of fiscal correction was commenced by the previous Government.One point is clear.  There has been no wholesale renegotiation of the EU-IMF agreement which was reached in November last.  Last year the Minister, Deputy Noonan, referred to the deal as an obscenity and a disaster.  The Tánaiste, Deputy Gilmore, stated it was "Labour's way or Frankfurt's way".  The Irish people were promised substantial renegotiation of the deal.  What they got was a copy and paste of November last's deal with some strictly fiscally-neutral tweaking.  There has been, and will be, no change to the fiscal targets.  Any changes to the detail of the agreement must be fiscally neutral and must be agreed in advance with the troika.  There will be no burden-sharing with senior bondholders, a point to which I will return later.There even seems to be some doubt about the reduction in the interest rate that was being negotiated by the previous Government on leaving office.  A final decision on this is now to be taken by the euro group and the ECOFIN Ministers, and hopefully this will happen sooner rather than later.  A reduction in the interest rate will not solve our fiscal problems, but it can make an important contribution.  While a 1% interest rate reduction would result in annual savings of €130 million based on the current drawdown of the facility, a 1% reduction on the rate charged on the full €45 billion available from EU sources, as opposed to the loan from the IMF and the bilateral loans, would result in a €450 million saving for each full year borrowed.  That would make an important contribution.  If this €45 billion was held for an average of seven and a half years, that is, the term envisaged in the programme, the total saving would amount to €3.375 billion.  We support the Minister and the Government in the efforts to secure this reduction.  The sooner it can be achieved the better.The truth is that the Government parties are now fully supporting and implementing a programme that they resolutely opposed while in Opposition.  In his banking statement to the House at the end of March, the Minister made clear the Government parties' new-found commitment to the EU-IMF programme.  He stated:For the benefit of our people and of market participants, I want to be clear that we are committed to the EU-IMF programme.  We have issues that we wish to raise and changes that we need to make in the context of ensuring growth and recovery in the Irish economy.  However, we will respect the overall fiscal parameters of the programme and where adjustments to the programme affect these, we will make appropriate offsetting adjustments.This is a far cry from the rhetoric of the election campaign only a few short months ago.We were told during the recent general election campaign by the parties now in Government that there would not be another cent for the banks in the absence of burden-sharing with all classes of bondholders, including senior bondholders.  The same parties have now agreed to put a further €24 billion into the banks without a single cent being taken off senior bondholders.  The Minister had already stated that the debate is over on burden-sharing with senior bondholders in the proposed three main banks, AIB-EBS, Bank of Ireland and Irish Life & Permanent.  In reply to a parliamentary question of mine yesterday, he stated:I also reiterated in my statement [at the end of March] that it is Government policy to work out Anglo Irish Bank and Irish Nationwide Building Society in an orderly manner over time and to minimise further injections of taxpayer capital into either institution.  I have made clear that should additional capital be required, the Government will consult the external partners on the timeframe and means of recapitalising those institutions at minimum cost to the taxpayer, having regard to the financial stability impacts in Ireland and abroad.In other words, the issue of burden-sharing with senior bondholders in Anglo Irish Bank and Irish Nationwide Building Society only arises if further money must be put into these institutions beyond the recapitalisation that has already been committed.In essence, when confronted with the reality of the European Central Bank's position on the issue of burden sharing with senior bondholders, the Government threw in the towel.  Asked on radio in January about the renegotiation of the deal Deputy Eamon Gilmore, now Tánaiste, stated it had to be renegotiated as several aspects were just not acceptable such as the fact that it had been struck without any contribution being made by senior bondholders.  Sadly, we no longer see any of this no-nonsense straight talking by the Tánaiste.  As was pointed out on many occasions, the issue of burden sharing was raised by the previous Government with the international authorities during the negotiations last November.  However, the then Opposition parties did not believe us.  The Government has acknowledged that in respect of the €36 billion of outstanding senior debt in the Irish banks, a contribution will not be required to the banking bailout.The updated draft memorandum of understanding makes reference to the jobs initiative to be announced next Tuesday in the House by the Minister for Finance, Deputy Michael Noonan.  I sincerely hope whatever measures are included in next week's announcement will actually work.  We all accept the point that growth is the key to working our way out of our current economic difficulties.  Assuming the pathway of fiscal correction is continued, we need economic growth.  Unemployment is a scourge in society and we must replace the hopelessness experienced by thousands of unemployed people with optimism.  Yesterday the Taoiseach and the Minister sought to lower expectations about the impact of the jobs initiative, but next week they will have to be clear about how the initiative will be funded.We already know the jobs initiative will provide for a reduction in the lower rates of VAT and employers' PRSI.  Based on written replies by the Minister to parliamentary questions, these two measures alone will cost up to €1.3 billion to the end of the lifetime of the programme — the end of 2013.  A reduction in the lower VAT rate will cost approximately €850 million, while the PRSI reduction will cost more than €400 million.  As I acknowledged at Question Time yesterday, it is hoped the net costs will be considerably lower if the measures result in additional economic buoyancy.  All of us hope these measures will remove people from jobseekers' payments and increase income tax revenue for the State.  However, it is not possible to anticipate their impact in advance.  Therefore, the Government must ensure the package of measures is fully funded.  The European Union and the IMF are very clear that the estimated costs must be offset in full in the period to 2014.  Presumably, we will find out next week whether the package will be funded by spending cuts, tax increases or a combination of both.The Government is examining the McCarthy report on State assets and liabilities.  On a number of occasions it has informed us that the European Union and the IMF were agreeable to allowing the proceeds from the sale of State assets to fund job creation initiatives and it is hoped this will be the case.  However, the programme document published yesterday makes no reference to using the proceeds for job creation measures but instead states on page 16, "It is important that we make effective use of our state assets and, where appropriate, dispose of them to help reduce our government debt".  The Troika appears to have asserted its authority on this issue also.At Question Time yesterday the Minister and I had an exchange on the issue of national debt sustainability.  The downward revision of the growth forecast by the Department of Finance in the stability programme update is a serious development which underlines the debt sustainability issue Ireland faces.  According to the Department of Finance's projections, interest payments on the national debt will use up 21% of State tax revenues by 2015.  However, this is based on a tax revenue figure in 2015 of €44.3 billion.  For comparison purposes, the expected tax revenue this year is €34.9 billion; therefore, the Department is factoring in an increase of almost €10 billion in the tax take between now and 2015.  That would be a 27% increase in the four-year period.  We all hope these figures are correct.I am not privy to the economic model being used by the Department, but I believe it is healthy to ask questions about some of the figures being used.  For illustrative purposes, let us assume tax revenues increase by a more modest 2.5% each year from 2011.  This would give a tax revenue figure of €38.5 billion in 2015 as opposed to the €44.3 billion estimated by the Department.  However, with national debt interest payments set to reach €9.2 billion in 2015, this would mean 24% or just under one quarter of the tax take would be going on interest payments alone at that stage.  This is still lower, as the Minister would point out, than the amount of the tax take that went on interest payments in the 1980s.  However, it would take us to a very dangerous level.For 2012 the Department is predicting GDP growth of 2.5%, whereas the IMF and the European Union believe the rate will be less than 2%.  They believe a figure of 1.9% is closer to what is expected.  As the Minister indicated, the Department believes the economy will grow by 3% in the period 2013 to 2015, following the three successive years of economic contraction we experienced to the end of 2010.  However, it is only right and proper that we question the Department's ability to make such growth predictions.  Yesterday the Minister stated these were the Government's economic growth predictions, as did other Ministers outside the House.  They are made by Department of Finance officials.  I am sure the Minister did not interfere in the Department's decision to revise downwards the forecast for the current year to 0.8%.  Equally, it was not the then Minister, Deputy Brian Lenihan, or any other Minister, who came up with the figure of 1.75% last December for the rate of growth in 2011.The question I ask is whether the Minister really believes Ireland will be borrowing on the international sovereign debt markets next year.  He has stated the NTMA is in constant contact with market participants and that its view on market perception of sovereign debt in Ireland is a crucial input into our deliberations.  It is clear from the bond yields that market perception of our sovereign debt is not favourable.  On the basis of the evidence it seems less rather than more likely that Ireland will be back to the markets any time soon to meet its funding requirements.  The truth is that, irrespective of the level of the fiscal correction any Government can reasonably be expected to achieve, if the growth forecast pencilled in by the Department is not at least achieved, the prospect of debt restructuring will loom on the horizon for Ireland at some point.  I have no doubt that the European Union and the IMF are acutely aware of this and the Government needs to be also.  It is only prudent that in private the Government should conduct contingency planning and enter discussions with the Union and the IMF to discuss the possibility of the rate of economic growth in Ireland not reaching the level we anticipate it will.  On page 14 of the document published yesterday it is stated "the scale of the necessary consolidation in Budgets 2013-2015 will have to be reviewed in the context of the likely growth prospects nearer the time".  This underlines the point I am making, that if the growth projections made by the Department prove yet again to be too optimistic, clearly the Government will have to increase the fiscal consolidation measures in 2013 and beyond.I agreed with the Minister who stated yesterday that the issue of debt sustainability was not black and white.  If we anticipate that the level of tax revenue accounted for by national debt interest repayments could reach one quarter by 2015, how much further are we prepared to go in terms of fiscal consolidation and the impact on ordinary people's lives?  These are discussions we need to have on a contingency basis with the relevant authorities at the earliest opportunity.If I had time, I would go into many other issues.  I have just come, like the Acting Chairman, Deputy Joe Costello, from a meeting of the committee established by the House to examine the subsidiarity issues arising from the CCCTB proposals.  I wish the Minister well in the forthcoming meetings with his finance Minister colleagues at ECOFIN and among the euro group.  In particular, I wish him well as he seeks to achieve the reduction in the interest rate which we all hope will happen as soon as possible.

Tá siad séanta ag an Rialtas seo agus tá an Rialtas ag glacadh leis na téarmaí a foilsíodh inné ó thaobh an airgid a tá imid ag fáil ón EU-IMF.  Níl a fhios agam ar cheart dom trua a bheith agam don Rialtas agus don Aire, mar is cinnte go bhfuil an Rialtas agus an tAire Airgeadais briste ag an IMF agus an EU.  Níl aon cheann de na gealltanais a thug an tAire, Páirtí Fhine Gael ná Páirtí an Lucht Oibre le feiceáil sa cháipéis a foilsíodh inné.  Ní chloisimid aon rud i dtaobh na bondholders, i dtaobh fostaíochta a chruthú nó faoi gheallúint Fhine Gael 100,000 post a chruthú.  Ní fheicimid an t-athrú suntasach a fógraíodh ocht seachtaine ó shin agus Fine Gael ag iarraidh fáil isteach ar an oifig atá aige anois.  Tá trua agam do phobal na tíre seo, mar an rud atá soiléir sa phlean seo ná go bhfuil níos mó ciorruithe agus am crua le bheith ann do ghnáth theaghlaigh agus daoine — daoine atá dífhostaithe, daoine atá ar ioncam íseal nó ar mheán ioncam, daoine atá ag déanamh sár oibre san earnáil phoiblí agus daoine atá ag iarraidh fostaíocht a chruthú.  Is iad sin a bheidh thíos leis na cinntí atá déanta agus leis an mbeartaíocht lag a bhí ar an Rialtas seo lena athrú suntasach a fháil sa socrú seo a bhí de dhíth don tír.Throughout the general election campaign, Fine Gael and the Labour Party told the electorate they would make renegotiation of the EU-IMF austerity package their No. 1 priority if elected to Government.  The Tánaiste famously told an election press conference that after 25 February it would be Labour's way not Frankfurt's way.  Since forming the Government, both parties have repeatedly told the House and the public they are making progress on the renegotiation of a deal which would contain significant changes.  The wait is now over and it is clear that they have signed, sealed and delivered a package they were hell-bent against just eight weeks ago.  The revised EU-IMF programme of financial support for Ireland is virtually identical in letter and spirit to that agreed by Fianna Fáil last year.  It is an unrevised programme and the only support it provides is for the failed policies of the bank bailouts and austerity measures imposed by Brian Cowen in the dying days of the last failed Administration.Is this the change for which the people voted?  Is this the promise of a new era of Fine Gael and the Labour Party in Government?  This is the pup that was sold to the Irish people.  It is an act of political fraud by a Government on a scale unprecedented in history.The unrevised EU-IMF programme is based on the same failed economic logic as its identical predecessor.  We are told the Government deficit will be reduced to 3% of GDP by 2015.  When other parties claimed that target could be reached in 2014 we were alone in this Chamber in arguing it was unachievable and I repeat that argument now.  Any serious attempt to meet the target will cripple working families, undermine front line services, increase unemployment and add to the growing mountain of public and private debt.  With this revised document, the Government has promised to continue the failed policies of the previous Administration, which have already caused the problems I have outlined.  Working families have already been crippled and pushed into mortgage arrears.  Spending in the domestic economy, which is key to our recovery, has decreased to the point where growth rates are flat or negative.  The Government has promised to pursue that failed agenda over the coming four years.The fact that jobs are only mentioned in a single paragraph on page 14 of this programme of austerity is a measure of how far Fine Gael and the Labour Party have travelled since the general election campaign.  The Government's No. 1 priority gets one paragraph out of 41 pages.  That reveals the skill of the negotiators we sent to Brussels and Frankfurt and to deal with the IMF.  We only have to compare this paragraph with the six pages of detailed policy prescriptions and costings for pouring more of Irish and European taxpayers' money into failed and toxic banks.  At least €24 billion, including €10 billion from the National Pensions Reserve Fund, will be poured into these banks.  Depending on the outcome of the stress test of Anglo Irish Bank, which will be announced in the coming weeks, we may see further taxpayer money injected into that failed bank.  Not only is the Government content to continue honouring the promissory notes signed by the last Government which will inject €3.1 billion into that bank every year for the next ten years, but it is committed to pouring yet more money into an institution that holds no deposits and is of no systemic value to the Irish economy.  For the life of me, I do not understand why such a decision is being taken when senior bondholders are receiving full payment.  The people who own the bonds in Anglo Irish Bank are probably making money out of them because they were sold on the secondary market at discounts of 40% to 60%, as the Minister for Finance himself pointed out when he sat on this side of the Chamber.  They are going to receive a huge lump sum from the Irish taxpayer and we are going to spend additional billions of euro to help them along their way.If there was one major flaw in this Government's policies since it took power it was the attempt to spin the jobs initiative as a fully resourced jobs budget which would sort out all the big problems.  Over the past several weeks, however, it has attempted to condition the Irish public for the damp squib which is likely to be announced on Tuesday.  The downgrading of the jobs initiative will, according to the EU-IMF deal, be revenue neutral.  There will be no new money or targets and I suspect no new jobs will be created by this so-called initiative.  The EU, IMF and ECB are not interested in creating jobs in this State.  They want to shore up our failed banking system in order to protect the other banks in Europe and to drive down wage levels and public spending in a vain effort to restore economic competitiveness.  This is not a support plan; it is a vicious programme imposing an internal devaluation on the Irish economy.  Its commitment to cut public and private sector wage costs will increase poverty and income inequality among working families.  It will widen the gap between the wealthy and the working poor.  Less income in people's pockets will further depress the economy as consumer spending continues to fall.  As we have seen the result is further private sector job losses.The programme proposes to reform the social welfare system.  While slim on the details, it is a coded plan for reducing payments to the most vulnerable in society in order to incentivise them to take jobs that do not exist.  It proposes to cut social welfare expenditure even though the unrevised projection on employment is 40,000 fewer out of work than is currently the case.  Social welfare expenditure will be reduced even though the programme for Government states that payments rates will not be reduced.  We have heard hints that the pressure will come on family income support, rent supplements and other supports required by the most vulnerable in society.  That is a sad indication of how far this Government has come.The objective of widening tax bands in 2011 and 2012 remains in the EU-IMF programme even though the programme for Government specifically states there will be no further widening of bands or reduction of tax credits.  This is another U-turn.  On whom will that impact?  Once again, it will impact hardest on low income earners.  The reduction in tax credits and increasing stealth taxes such as property charges and fuel charges will also hurt families and small businesses.  Alongside all of this, the plan commits the Fine Gael-Labour Government to widespread cuts in front line public services and the sale of the strategically important State assets of gas, electricity and water, putting short-term financial gain before long-term social and economic gain.As if all of this was not bad enough, the EU-IMF programme contains a commitment to a fiscal advisory council supported by a fiscal responsibility Bill, the purpose of which is "to safeguard fiscal discipline in the future".  This is code for imposing the preferred policy prescriptions of the EU and IMF on future Governments.  When the Government parties were in opposition they were, rightly and genuinely, critical of the previous Government, as it walked out of office, signing up to a plan to which the Government is now agreeing.  This argued that it was wrong for a Government to tie the hands of a future Government.  Incorporating the fiscal responsibility Bill into law will tie the hands of future Governments when the current Government is finally ousted from office.  It is wrong.  It should not happen and leeway should be given for those who are the people's choice to act in government without having constraints imposed on them in carrying out their fiscal responsibilities or in the choices they make.Wage cuts, social welfare cuts and tax increases on working families will all push the economy further into recession and do nothing to reduce the deficit or the prohibitive interest rates barring the Government from borrowing on the international markets.  How bullish the Minister for Finance was when the review was completed.  He announced that interest rates had dropped by 80, or maybe 100, basis points.  The actual figure was about 60.  They were coming down, but they are going up again.  The international markets are screaming that they are.  The biggest bondholder in the world is telling us we need to burn senior bonds in the banks.The Government does not understand the art of negotiation.  In negotiation one must play one's hand.  We do not have a huge number of cards to play, but we have strong cards.  I recommend to the Government, and to whoever else will be dealing with these negotiations, to take a crash course in negotiation over the next couple of days.  In the next term, they may be able to come up with something better.  We in Sinn Féin will assist the Government in that crash course in negotiation, as we have particular skills in these matters.

There are always choices and decisions that can be made.  Otherwise, why is the Government there?  Is Deputy Noonan a puppet for the EU-IMF or for the ECB or is he an Irish Minister standing up for Irish interests?The document published yesterday does not stand up for Irish interests.  I appeal to the Minister to stand up for Irish interests, take the crash course in negotiation that I commended to him and do the right thing.  A couple of weeks ago, Fine Gael and the Labour Party said there could be substantial renegotiation of this deal.  It does not need to be tweaked on a quarterly basis.  It needs to be fundamentally restructured.  The programme of austerity does not work.  It is not working.  Judging from the comments of the previous speaker, Fianna Fáil have realised we are going into default.  The other parties on this side of the House realise we are in that trajectory.  The Minister also knows we will have to restructure our debt.  This exercise is a huge act of political fraud and betrayal.  It should not be happening in this way.This deal needs to be voted upon in the House.  What is happening is wrong.  Although the Government has a majority in the House, I want Government Deputies to walk through the lobby and vote for the same deal they jumped up and down about when in opposition and said they would not be bound by.  "Labour will not be bound by this document" was the chat from Deputy Éamon Gilmore.  I want him to walk through the lobby and vote for the document he held in his hand that day.  There should be a vote in the House.  The people deserve little less.
#ShaneRoss	unknown-#ShaneRoss-party	unknown-#ShaneRoss-dob	unknown-#ShaneRoss-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-05-04 00:00:00	Prelude	305	With the permission of the House, I will share time with Deputies Richard Boyd Barrett and Clare Daly.A great opportunity has been missed by the Government.  Let us conjure up the scene in the ECB many weeks ago and imagine what they were looking at in the Irish political scene.  They saw a Government going out of power, having negotiated a deal about which the ECB must have been somewhat triumphant, and examined those who were about to take that Government's place with some trepidation.  There was the red-haired fiery man from Dún Laoghaire, who said it would be Frankfurt's way or his way.  There was a man from Limerick, who was more taciturn but who growled the kind of tough line that never came to pass.  The ECB must have anticipated the emergence and arrival of a new Government with some worries.  They cannot believe their luck at what has happened.  The present Minister for Finance and Tánaiste have turned out, in European terms, to be paper tigers.The happiest man in this House today is not the Minister for Finance, the spokesperson for Sinn Féin or myself.  It is Deputy Michael McGrath.  The Government has made Fianna Fáil's task so easy by its attitude to this deal.  This afternoon, Deputy McGrath  was exulting in once again congratulating the Government on taking the ECB line, which Fianna Fáil took a very few weeks ago.  Fianna Fáil cannot believe that the opportunity Deputies Gilmore and Noonan and the Taoiseach saw eight weeks ago of going to Frankfurt and saying "We will not take this deal" has been thrown out the window.Fine Gael and the Labour Party were right to say they would burn the bondholders and that it would be Frankfurt's way or Labour's way.  They were an unknown quantity when they said that.  However, when they came to the table their attitude, particularly to burning the bondholders, restructuring or whatever one wants to call it, was weaker than that of the former Minister whom Deputy McGrath is representing here today.  Deputy Lenihan made it clear that he put the issue of restructuring, defaulting or burning bondholders to the ECB that Saturday night and that the ECB said, no.  The Irish delegation capitulated on the spot.  The nation was subjugated to the ECB on that day.The great opportunity was there for the Minister for Finance and Irish officials to go back to the table and say, "The deal stays on the table or we walk".  What would have happened?  It is all very well to say there is no alternative.  There is an alternative.  Deputy Pearse Doherty is right.  Those who are pulling the strings are the ECB and the Department of Finance.  There is an alternative.  What would have happened if the Minister had said: "We are going back to Ireland, we are holding a referendum and we are coming back with the result of that referendum and we are defaulting on structured renegotiated terms on that basis."What would have happened?  Iceland's default is not an exact parallel but this is an important point.  On the issue of defaulting against British and Dutch banks, Iceland had a referendum.I believe the Minister also knows we are going to have to restructure our debt.  This programme is a huge act of political fraud.  It is an act of betrayal and should not be happening     The Icelandic authorities got much better terms offered because their threat of non-payment was realistic and it was believed.  We could have tried the same.  We could have said we were not going back to the Irish people and telling them that we are paying this debt, as the Minister said before the election.It is pitiful for the Minister to come before this House and say we have renegotiated the minimum wage.  As Deputy Doherty and Deputy Michael McGrath stated, that is revenue neutral.  There is no concession in that.  Someone somewhere will have to pay for it and someone somewhere next week will have to pay for what has now been downgraded to the jobs initiative because it is not a jobs budget.I agree with what Deputy Doherty said earlier.  I do not believe there will be much in what we get next week.  Let us wait and see, but there is no concession from the IMF and the EU in the jobs initiative.  There is an agreement that we can fiddle around with the figures all we like provided we keep paying the same amount of interest, a reduction in the rate of which has not yet been conceded.  That was sold to us during the election as a given and something which would automatically happen with a change of Government but it is now already receding before our eyes.
#RichardBoydBarrett	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-party	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-dob	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-05-04 00:00:00	Prelude	306	I am not making a cheap political point but given that we are discussing the issue that will dictate and dominate our economic future for many years into the future I am amazed that so few Members have bothered to attend this debate.  The emphasis put by the Government parties in advance of the election was on how this was such a bad deal for Ireland and a bad deal for Europe, that it had to be renegotiated, that it was economic treason and would all be reviewed.  We are here discussing the review of that deal, yet hardly anybody bothers to attend.  I find that extraordinary.  That is not a cheap political point.  I understand that people cannot be here all the time because they cannot follow every Minister but I find it extraordinary that a significant number of Members did not bother to turn up to discuss a document that will dictate our future for years.Perhaps the reason so few Members have bothered to attend this debate is because nothing has changed.  The Minister said the EU-IMF programme was a bad deal for Ireland and for Europe and had to be renegotiated, that it was economic treason and that he would do something about it but nobody has turned up for this debate because it is clear that nothing has been done about it.  Nothing has changed.  The position is exactly as it was when the dirty deed was done by Fianna Fáil.  The Minister has agreed to carry on with the dirty deed of essentially selling this country down the river to pay off the bankers and bondholders who caused the economic crisis in the first place.Is it not the case that this unrevised and barely tweaked EU-IMF deal is nothing other than a cold-blooded decision by the European Central Bank and the big states in Europe to protect the bankers and bondholders who caused the crisis and whose greed and lending to the property sector here caused the property bubble and the economic crash, and to make ordinary working people pay with brutal austerity and cutbacks for that crisis?  This is not just a programme to make ordinary people pay for the crimes of bankers.  It is worse than that.  It is a programme to take advantage of the crisis and do things that these same bankers, bondholders and corporate elites would not have got away with previously.  They now believe, in the atmosphere of crisis, they can get away with it because hidden behind the innocuous "techno-babble" in the memorandum of understanding is a programme for the asset stripping of this country and even more brutal and savage attacks on ordinary people in the interests of the very same corporate elites and golden circles who caused the crisis in the first place.The reality behind words like "fiscal consolidation" is continued bank bailouts, savage cuts, home taxes, water taxes, and increased taxes on the low paid.  When the Minister refers to "labour market restructuring" what he actually means is to savage the pay of low paid workers and smash up sectoral agreements that have protected those workers who are the lowest paid in the country.  We can expect vicious attacks on their already beleaguered incomes.  What is actually meant by "structural reforms" is privatisation and the asset stripping of the public assets of this country and the State companies that could be the engine of economic rejuvenation, employment growth and so on.  The reality behind language like "structural fiscal reforms" is about making ordinary people work longer for less in order to pay off the bankers.  One of my favourites phrases is "social welfare reform and labour activation measures", which means to slash social welfare and then hound people who have lost their jobs through no fault of their own but are unemployed because of the crisis created by others.The appalling human cost of all of that was on show in this Chamber earlier when we were discussing education during Question Time.  Parents of special needs children, some of the most vulnerable and innocent people in our society, were in the Visitors Gallery pleading with the Minister to take away the cap being demanded on special needs and education posts to ensure their vulnerable children could be provided with an education.  Yet we were told by the Minister that it cannot be done because of the dictates of the IMF and EU.

The answer, therefore, is to make the bankers pay for the crisis they caused and to put taxes on the wealthy rather than the vulnerable and working people in this country.  It can be done if there was a will to do it but there is no will on the part of this Government and therefore we are stuck with this austerity.
#ClareDaly	unknown-#ClareDaly-party	unknown-#ClareDaly-dob	unknown-#ClareDaly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-05-04 00:00:00	Prelude	309	Speaking this afternoon during Leaders' Questions the Taoiseach made the point that his approach to dealing with the EU-IMF and the economic crisis would be that he would tell the truth, which was the most definitive recognition of the fact that he was lying during the course of the general election campaign.  The message now of slavish adherence to the EU-IMF deal negotiated by Fianna Fáil and the Green Party when in Government is very different to the one that was pedalled by Labour and Fine Gael in the course of the election.  The messages were of not one cent more, burden sharing and so on but instead we are supposed to sign up to the fifth bailout in three years and put our people and our economy in hock to the tune of €70 billion.The question that must be highlighted, and which will be highlighted as time passes, is who will pay for this crisis?  It is clear that the method of payment will be vicious cutbacks and austerity, privatisation, further public sector pay cuts and, in reality, a setting back of conditions in this country for generations.We have had to listen to a certain amount of double speak by the Government parties.  The excuse for everything is a shrugging of the shoulders and either to blame Fianna Fáil for the problems that happened or to say they can do nothing about it as they are hamstrung by the confines of the deal.  That is a very different message to the one the Minister was peddling during the election and is very different to the approach he is adopting in regard to corporation tax.  His response to those who dare raise the question that big business might want to consider contributing a little more to this economy is to say that we will stand up to Europe, we will fight them on the beaches and so on.  When it comes to defending the conditions of ordinary people, however, that is not the case.  We have an unbelievable interference and micro-management of the economy, including bowing down at the EU-IMF altar, the details of which are only beginning to emerge.Under this deal every home will be subject to a property tax which will be introduced this year.  We have been told that this property tax will have to increase in 2012.  The introduction of water charges and the establishment of a water utility company have also been mandated, which can only lead to privatisation.  I find it ironic that the Taoiseach said earlier that we should not worry about the sale of semi-State assets, because we will be able to get around what the document actually says, while using the money for job creation.  Why would one use the money for job creation, however, by implementing a measure to privatise and sell State assets, which inevitably leads to job losses?  It is a fallacy.  The Government, including the Labour Party, is prepared to stand over a situation where, in order to pay for speculation by bond-holders, the retirement age for social welfare pensions will go up from 65 to 68.  We are now facing the spectacle that by 2028 people will have to work until they are 68.  The generations who struggled for a better life, including improvements such as a shorter working week, can kiss it all goodbye because they will be working longer hours for less.  In addition, they will not be able to access State pensions.  Like all the other measures, not only will this not work, but I can also promise the Government that it will be resisted.  Ordinary people are not prepared to pay that price for something they did not create.

The debate that took place during the election campaign was clear; it concerned the disaster of the blanket bank guarantee.  Unfortunately, with the exception of the Labour Party, all other parties in this House, including the Independents at the time and Sinn Féin, voted for the blanket bank guarantee.  In many ways, those votes of Sinn Féin and the Independents who were here, and who were aligned with both sides——

The people of this country want an end to the recession as well as a restoration of their jobs, businesses, communities, homes and factories.  Many Members of this House share the analysis of what created the boom and what destroyed the economy.  I was one of those who, over a long period of years in the Dáil, identified things like ridiculous tax breaks that helped to create the bubble.  I have spoken previously about how, when Ireland entered the eurozone, there were no checks or balances by the emerging European Central Bank on economies having a runaway credit bubble.  Unfortunately, every man, woman and child has inherited the consequences.The Government is determined to restore the economy, as well as rebuilding employment, businesses and economic activity generally.  That includes returning to traditional areas of economic activity such as tourism and other indigenous industries.  Our own resources should be utilised to get people working again.  I am disappointed that some speakers seem to believe that most people actively seek a life which is going to become dependent on social welfare income support over a long period.  Most people I know, whether young or old, want a job or to run their own business.  They want to contribute to social welfare in their working years, so that if they fall on hard times and become unemployed they can avail of it.  An extraordinary number of people are currently unemployed or have lost their businesses.  They have little social welfare protection because they were self-employed.  They never expected not to be working because their businesses failed.The challenge for the Government, and for every Member of this House, is to work on a detailed plan to recreate employment, small and medium enterprises, and indigenous Irish businesses.  By and large, the internationally-traded sector in goods and services is doing well.  It does not depend on Irish banks for banking facilities.  They are not like an indigenous Irish company or a small and medium enterprise.  They are not popping down to the local branch of one of our big banks seeking credit.  No matter what the banks are saying about the flow of credit, people in business — whether a large operation or a small indigenous one — are finding that their credit lines are either not available or are squeezed to the point where firms are hanging on by their fingernails.  Alternatively, they find that facilities are being changed in title and large extra charges are being made because something which was an overdraft becomes a term loan and so on.  Facilitation fees as well as interest rates are becoming even higher.As regards the troika's support for Ireland, including the IMF, I spoke about the renegotiation at length in the course of the election.  I have always said that it is a marathon and not a sprint.  The Fianna Fáil Government signed up to an extremely detailed programme.  Anyone who is familiar with the history of the IMF in particular will know that once such a programme is entered into, getting out of it is a long-term process lasting several years.  Members of this House have spoken casually about default, but I wish they had had the experience of living in a country that defaulted entirely on its international obligations.  This House would be well served by having a detailed debate on what exactly is meant by default and what the consequences would be for businesses in Ireland, particularly the small and medium enterprises.

#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-05-04 00:00:00	Prelude	323	People have spoken about Russia after the collapse there, as well as Argentina, as possible models.  Members of the House who are interested in economies which have defaulted should realise that it is not in any way a soft option.The result of a default on the scale some people suggest is that a state's only line of access to credit from the outside world would be through the IMF for a period of at least seven years.  In raising the default option, there should be a detailed discussion of what people mean by it.  They can mean different things.However, the Government is determined to continue towards renegotiation, particularly on the interest rate, the structure and the duration of the deal, which is critical;  renegotiation that separates bank debt from the fiscal deficit; and renegotiation involving the ECB and the Commission, which provides for the imaginative creation of new structures that assist peripheral countries such as Portugal, Greece, Ireland and other member states whose sovereign debt capacity will be tested by the markets in the future.  We need the development of new instruments such as eurobonds, which would enable the peripheral countries to raise additional debt.We also need new structures to deal with sovereign debt in the context of the complete change in financial markets over the past ten years where globalisation means a 28 year old with an MBA is as likely to make a decision about Ireland's sovereign debt as a senior Minister or Ministry official in capitals around the world, which is the way it used to be.  However, this is the global financial market in which we live.  We can wish it to be different but we cannot reinvent globalisation and the evolution of the financial market.  We can reform them and that is where Ireland's interest lies.  That is what the Government will do as well as rebuilding jobs and businesses.  That is the mandate we have from the people and when we have finished, this country will be a better place for working people, the unemployed and those who have lost their businesses and want to rebuild them.
#SeanFleming	unknown-#SeanFleming-party	unknown-#SeanFleming-dob	unknown-#SeanFleming-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-05-04 00:00:00	Prelude	324	I welcome the opportunity to contribute to the debate on the revised document published recently following completion of the quarterly reviews for the first quarter of 2011 of EU financial assistance to Ireland and of the extended IMF arrangement.I will deal with a number of aspects of the document before the House and then refer to our overall position as a result of this agreement.  A major section of the document deals with financial sector policies, restructuring, deleveraging and recapitalisation.  It says that the prudential capital assessment review recently found that €24 billion is required to ensure a sound capital basis for the banks and this will cover losses up to approximately 2013 over those previously estimated.  That is in addition to funding that has already gone into the various banks.  Much of this money will be put into the banks in the short term.The revised document contains new changes about which I am worried.  First, the position of the new Government parties is to go soft on the Irish banks again in a way they have not told the people about and in a way they hope people will not pick up on.  They propose to inject up to €24 billion in the banks and the documents state that they will make arrangements "for a clawback of any injection of capital by the State subject to the approval of the CBI.  This mechanism will require the banks to repay any such capital in excess of their regulatory obligations when the financial institutions again have stable access to the wholesale funding market or otherwise stabilise their funding, including a normal reliance on Central Bank funding".  That means money has to be put in for recapitalisation purposes.  If it is found to be too much, some of the money can be repaid with agreement.More important, the cost of the €24 billion at the blended interest rate of 5.6% will mean the taxpayer providing an interest subsidy of approximately €1.3 billion per annum to the banks.  Most of the loans taken out under the deal run for an average of seven years and, therefore, the taxpayer will provide a further interest subsidy of €10 billion to the banks for providing the €24 billion injection now.  There is no mention of the Government making an effort to seek a refund of the interest the people will pay on the money drawn down from the EU and the IMF.  I can understand someone saying I am splitting hairs when AIB is under State control and is almost 100% State owned but it is a commercial institution and it is effectively a semi-State body.  There is a case for AIB to make a dividend payment to the Exchequer down the line to cover the interest subsidy it is receiving.More important, why is such a subsidy being provided for Bank of Ireland?  The taxpayer does not have full control of the bank but the State is putting expensive funds borrowed under this deal into the bank and no request is being made of the bank to repay the interest the taxpayer is paying.  If between €4 billion and €8 billion is injected into Bank of Ireland over a period, the bank should be charged the blended rate of interest and the money generated recouped by the Exchequer.  The bank should not be in a position to increase profits and pay dividends to its shareholders, thereby increasing their wealth, on the basis of this subsidy.I acknowledge Bank of Ireland is in competition with a semi-State bank, AIB but the interest subsidy must constitute state aid when the bank is still operating outside the jurisdiction.  It will be in receipt of not only the capital injection but the interest subsidy for the duration of this plan.  The Minister has not referred to this at any stage.  The Government parties are going soft on the banks and they are not coming clean on this, which is a new development.The document refers to AIB and the Bank of Ireland as the two pillar banks.  I worry about the over reliance on domestic banks to deal with our financial crisis.  International competition is needed in the banking sector and, as part of this deal, the Government should try to attract banks from outside the eurozone and, therefore, outside the control of the ECB, which has a vested interest in recouping as much money as it can from our economy.  The Government parties are in the process of creating two major banks, both of which will be too big to fail.  They are creating new sacred cows, which will be untouchable, no matter how much harm or damage they do, no matter how much pain they inflict on the people and no matter how dangerous their behaviour is for the economy.Now that there are only two Irish banks they are too big to fail.  We are now making sacred cows out of them.  We must guard against that.  Currently, Ulster Bank is carrying out a significant amount of financial activity in this country.  It is necessary that we have competition from outside the euro area.  That is to be welcomed because otherwise the two banks will have a duopoly which is not a safe way to proceed.The Minister made clear yesterday that the public interest directors have no right or legal authority to communicate with him.  Having been appointed based on their previous CV, in the same way as judges, their sole duty is to do their job.  There is no mechanism in law for them to do otherwise.  They have a fiduciary duty to the banks of which they are board members to deal specifically with the bank.  We have seen that problem occur in the past.  In the previous Dáil the problem became especially evident in FÁS where departmental officials who were on the board did not report back to the Minister because they felt they had a corporate duty to FÁS rather than to the Minister when they were attending board meetings.  That was a serious issue.People will be keen to discuss in further detail the reference to the importance of making effective use of State assets and, where appropriate, to dispose of them to help reduce the Government debt.  It is a disgrace to sell off some key State assets that can produce jobs.  Two generations ago when the country was becoming strong we set up big semi-State companies such as the ESB, Bord na Móna and CIE.  They provided a good social service in terms of employment.  It is bad enough that the Government wants to sell them off, but one must ask who was fooling whom when it convinced the people that the sale of State assets would be used to create jobs.I am also concerned by the reference on page 28 of the document to "the small but locally important credit union".  The reference to "small" is almost derogatory.  The Government intends to force mergers among credit unions.  We agree there should be proper standards of governance in credit unions but the Government is picking on them unnecessarily in some cases.  The document indicates that the Government will provide financial assistance if required, subject to EU state aid rules.  In other words, it is going to hold credit unions over a barrel under that heading.  There will be no mention whatever of EU state aid rules when it comes to giving billions worth of interest-free, major cash injections to Bank of Ireland and AIB.The Fine Gael Party put much emphasis on the abolition of quangos.  However, on page 30 there is a commitment to setting up a new water utility company.  Every Member in the House is aware that if a water leak occurs or there is a water improvement investment programme to be carried out in a local authority, those best placed to do it are staff in the relevant local authority.  There will now be one central agency.  It will be another new quango and another layer of bureaucracy.  It will be another way of making the Minister less accountable to the House.  The new water utility company is one of the first official new quangos the Government is to set up.  It will be interesting to see how many other new quangos it will set up.  We are seeing the start of it now.  I could speak further on the matter but I understand my time is up.
#JoeMcHugh	unknown-#JoeMcHugh-party	unknown-#JoeMcHugh-dob	unknown-#JoeMcHugh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-05-04 00:00:00	Prelude	325	I welcome the opportunity to speak in this evening's debate.  I wish to put on record an important classification of the issue at hand with respect to the overall transfer of funds within the EU.  Currently, a total of €457 billion worth of funds is being lent through the European Central Bank through the inter-European transfer system with respect to national central banks borrowing and lending to one another.  It is important to put that into context.  Equally, it is more important to put into context that the biggest lender with respect to the transfer system are our friends in Germany through the Bundesbank, to the value of €325.5 billion that is being lent to various countries within the EU.  Other countries such as Luxembourg, Holland and Finland are net contributors to the lending system.  The list of countries that are borrowing within the euro transfer system include Greece at €87.1 billion, Portugal at €59.9 billion, Spain at €50.9 billion and France at €28.3 billion.  The country that is at the top of the pile of net borrowers is Ireland with €146.1 billion borrowed from the European Central Bank through our banks.  That is before we even refer to the EU-IMF deal of €67 billion.  That is the situation.  It is the reality of where we are at as a country and the straitjacket that has been passed to us by the previous Administration.We must consider the matter in context.  Between 2004 and 2010 there was an exponential rise in borrowing by this country, by a factor of seven.  Our rate of borrowing continues to rise.  We must examine constructively at a European level where we are going.  We should bear in mind the recent commentary by Finnish politicians in the context of the formation of a new government there and the stalemate situation that has arisen.  We should also bear in mind the comments of the Dutch Minister for Finance on the corporation tax rates in various countries.  A circumspect debate is going on at an individual country level which must change.  A constructive debate is required at EU level.  If the type of borrowing practised by Portugal, Greece, Spain and this country is to continue, it will continue to damage confidence which will have a detrimental effect on the marketplace in terms of our liquidity.We must look to structural funding in the short to medium term.  The new round of structural funding will be of the utmost importance to this country because for every €1 billion worth of investment in capital projects, it will have a knock-on effect in the creation of up to 15,000 jobs.  We must examine how we can work with Europe on the significant EU problem that has landed on all our doorsteps in order to try to get us out of the situation.We should look closely also at what is happening in this country on a cross-Border level.  I am aware of the co-operation and synergies that have been created by all parties on both sides of the Border in trying to keep alive capital projects.  I will refer to two of them.  There has been constant and consistent goodwill and co-operation towards the Altnagelvin project in Derry, the aim of which is to provide a cross-Border radiotherapy facility for the north west.  A new government is due to come on-stream in the Northern Assembly in the not-too-distant future.  We must also continue the co-operation, goodwill and joined-up thinking with respect to the N2-A5 road network.  We must continue the all-party co-operation, communication and synergies with respect to one-to-one projects for both sides of the Border.  The message we must deliver to Europe is that if we can co-operate on an all-party, cross-Border level, we must consider similar projects that have been hampered by the austerity measures with which we are faced.There will be a probable reduction in many of the capital projects that have been on the table.  We must look at Europe as a vehicle for new rounds of Structural Funds for tangible capital projects that will get people back working.  All Members are singing from the same hymn sheet in that regard.  If we get people back working, we will get money back into the Exchequer, we will create revenue and be in a win-win situation.  I have a simple message for Europe.  If the EU-IMF will not interfere with international projects, such as the Altnagelvin project and the N2-A5 project, which is welcome, we should send the message to Europe that there are other win-win projects which will create employment.To return to the figures, we owe €146.1 billion, apart from the €67 billion we already owe.  One should listen attentively to what people on the street have to say, something the previous Government failed to do during the good times.  Under the previous Administration, people on the street were saying quite succinctly that the bubble would burst, the boom could not last, we could not continue to get free money and would face a watershed at some stage.  The question now being asked by the man or woman on the street is from where will the jobs come.  People are at a loss as to from where the jobs will come.  There is no point in politicians articulating just for the sake of it the argument that they can create jobs here or there.  We need capital investment.  We need help, we need Structural Funds to be spent sensibly and we need co-operation at all levels.We need to think about procurement and procurement rules.  If we lose out on projects as result of the EU tendering system, social benefits will be restricted for many parts of the country.  Obviously, we must have guidelines on procurement, but there is no point in ensuring we get Structural Funds in place through the next round of structural funding, if we then lose out on projects.  We must ensure there is some sort of social contract in place that will ensure that we can create jobs at local level.We continue to grapple with the idea of being in Europe and of losing some aspects of our natural resources, such as our fisheries — an issue always on the agenda in my constituency in Donegal.  We must listen more to people expressing their sentiments on these matters, particularly the fishermen in Donegal.  We had a successive "No" to Lisbon in Donegal, which should not be forgotten.  We must ensure our continued participation in Europe is a two-way street and is not just about paying back money which, if the situation continues as it is, we will never be in a position to pay back.
#MaryLouMcDonald	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-party	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-dob	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-05-04 00:00:00	Prelude	326	I welcome the fact we are at last having this debate, although I note there will not be a vote on the issue.  I understand the document which was published last night is the basis upon which the troika will deliberate.  The Taoiseach has indicated that it is possible the matter will return to the House and I believe we should vote on it.  I make that point repeatedly because what is agreed between the Government and the troika behind closed doors will have serious ramifications in the long term for low and middle income workers and families and the vulnerable in society.Earlier, the Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Joan Burton, spoke about poverty traps.  I could not agree more.  Nobody in the House would wish to see any individual or family trapped in a welfare trap.  However, it is disingenuous to use that argument as a smokescreen for a continuing austerity programme which will inevitably mean hardship and cutbacks for people on very low, subsistence incomes.  The Minister also referred to the general election and claimed correctly that she and her colleagues on the Government benches had secured a mandate from the people.  However, it is worth reminding ourselves that in the course of the election the Labour Party promised a strategic investment bank to support businesses.  Also, Fine Gael promised some form of burden sharing.  Neither of those commitments sees the light of day in the document.  Deputies in the House should have been afforded a full debate, followed by a vote on the EU-IMF programme.  I hope that will happen in the near future, because the programme shapes the State's budgetary process to 2014 and ultimately decides our economic fate.Fianna Fáil has pursued an austerity model since the financial and economic crisis of its making began.  The current Government, despite its respective parties' election promises to the contrary, continues on the same path.  The Government's budgetary strategy should be focused on recovery, not austerity.  It is time now to begin addressing the real, underlying problems with the economy.  A refusal to do so will only prolong and deepen the recession.  Recovery requires investment, supports and a commitment to real stimulus that will create jobs and increase revenue.The memorandum as revised and presented creates uncertainties and ignores the outworkings of its internal devaluation model.  For example, despite rising unemployment, now at just under 15%, the Government intends to target social welfare recipients and extend the age at which a person can receive his or her social welfare pension.  Working age payments, child income support and disability allowances are all to be "reviewed", a term favoured by Government.  There is a particularly insidious reference to "making work pay for welfare recipients" in the memorandum.  I have made known my heartfelt opposition to poverty traps.  Targeting people who find themselves out of work and on welfare in this way is unacceptable.  The proposal to make work pay for welfare recipients begs the question asked by Deputy McHugh earlier: "Where are the jobs?"  I find it hard to believe that the Government could be so out of touch as to imagine that people are languishing on welfare payments because they do not want to work, since these people are in receipt of their payments because there is no work.There is a commitment to lower personal income tax bands and reliefs year on year, but there is no detail on how many of the State's lowest paid workers the Government intends to bring into the tax net or what impact this measure will have on low and middle income families struggling to pay the Government's property tax, flat water charge and the universal social charge.  The Government has steadfastly refused to countenance measures such as a wealth tax or a third income tax band of 48% on individual incomes in excess of €100,000 per annum.  It has steadfastly refused to consider these measures, leading people to the conclusion that austerity is for one class of citizens but not for the other.The memorandum also promises a reduction in private pension reliefs and general tax reliefs.  However, there is no detail on how much of a reduction there will be or on whether the intended changes will reduce reliefs on the lower rate of income or the higher.  Sinn Féin has argued since the crisis began, and before, for a standardisation of all discretionary taxation reliefs, including pension relief, with a view to eradicating tax reliefs that do not return value for society.  Taxation reliefs have historically favoured the better off.  An ESRI study from 2009 showed that 80% of pension tax reliefs benefited the top 20% of earners.Carbon tax is to be increased but again there is no detail on what measures the Government intends to undertake to tackle fuel poverty.  Some 115,000 households are in arrears in paying their gas bills and we have no way of quantifying how many older people or families have been forced to do without oil during the coldest months.  The carbon tax continues to have a negative impact on people experiencing or at risk of energy poverty.  No compensatory measures have been implemented or even identified by the Government.  The carbon tax is pushing more low income households into fuel poverty and this will only get worse.The memorandum commits to a reduction in public service numbers in line with the Fine Gael and Labour parties' programme for Government, yet there is no detail on where within the service these cuts will be made or how it intends to resource or manage any area with depleted personnel.  The Government needs to publish in detail exactly where these jobs cuts within the public service will be made.  It is difficult to give credibility to the Government's commitment to job creation given that it is so intent on increasing the numbers of unemployed public servants in a random and indiscriminate fashion.A comprehensive Government review of expenditure is under way and is due to be completed later this year.  In consultation with the European Commission, the IMF and the ECB, the Government intends to introduce further budgetary measures, which begs the following question.  How much more does the Government imagine the people or front line services can take?  I believe — the figures bear this out — austerity is not working.  Pumping billions of euros into insolvent banks like Anglo Irish Bank and out of public services is not working.  Cutting front line services is not working.  Cutting public spending while refusing to invest in stimulus can only lead to lower economic growth and higher unemployment.There are two glaring omissions from this document.  It does not refer to investment in the real economy and there is only a paltry reference to job creation.  Without these two things, we cannot pull ourselves out of recession.  I agree with Deputy McHugh on the value of the all-Ireland economy and cross-Border projects, and with what he said about EU procurement rules.  Very good work has been done in the North on interventions in that arena, a policy which we should also adopt in this State.The Government told us that its first 100 days was to be all about jobs and yet this memorandum of understanding contains nothing of real substance in that regard.  The memorandum contains an explicit commitment to dispose of State assets not to pump the money into job creation or to stimulate job creation, but in order to write down debt.The Minister, Deputy Burton, reminded us that the renegotiation of the matter is a marathon and not a sprint, which, I am sure, is the case.  However, even a marathon begins with a single step.  The revised memorandum makes it very clear that the single step has not been taken.
#JoeOReilly	unknown-#JoeOReilly-party	unknown-#JoeOReilly-dob	unknown-#JoeOReilly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-05-04 00:00:00	Prelude	327	The Government has successfully concluded the first and second quarterly programme reviews with the European Commission, ECB and IMF.  The EU and IMF have endorsed actions taken and to be taken by the Government regarding our public finances, the banking sector and jobs.  The thesis which came across during the general election campaign and in the House today from Members of the Technical Group and Sinn Féin that in some way we should default unilaterally does not hold up in reality.  I agree with the Minister, Deputy Joan Burton, who suggested that we need a specific debate on the matter.  If we were to default unilaterally the following questions arise.  From where would we source money?  What interest rate would we pay?  How would we pay our public servants and how would we maintain our public services?  These are critical questions and people who use the bland, evocative and populist terms such as "burning bondholders" and "defaulting" are failing to fill in those blanks.  I challenge Deputy Boyd Barrett to come into the House soon and fill in those blanks.  He should suggest to us where he believes we will get the money, what interest rate we will need to pay, how much we will get, how we will pay it and how we will maintain our services.  If he takes up that challenge, then it would be worthy of discussion, but until then we have an empty formula.

#JoeOReilly	unknown-#JoeOReilly-party	unknown-#JoeOReilly-dob	unknown-#JoeOReilly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-05-04 00:00:00	Prelude	329	I congratulate the Minister for Finance, the Taoiseach and the Tánaiste on their initiatives in seeking a pan-European solution.  We need to continue with the diplomatic offensive, which is in place.  We need to continue to build credibility.  We will eventually achieve a reduction in interest rates and an improvement in the general terms of the bailout, but it is a marathon.  It is not a matter to which there is a magic solution.  With the greatest respect to Deputy McDonald, it is not tenable to suggest that we can deal with this matter instantly; it must be dealt with on a pan-European basis.  I maintain the view we put forward before the general election that the deal is not sustainable in its current form and merits renegotiation.  While we cannot achieve it overnight, it is being gradually achieved and results will accrue from that.We are successfully restructuring the banking sector and the establishment of the two pillar banks and their rationalisation is a step in that direction.  Its success is reflected in a reduction of the degree to which deposits are being withdrawn from those institutions and reform will ultimately be achieved.  I come across this every day in my constituency work and I know it is repeated across the House.  Despite what we hear from the banks' PR, there is a major problem with finance for small businesses.  I know of viable businesses that are being refused term loans and overdrafts, thereby jeopardising two or three jobs, and therein lies the future of our country.  It is important to get the banks into a position to lend and to get the money flowing through our banks into the economy.  The restructuring is a critical first step, but we are by no means finished with that.  I urge the Minister to stick with the idea of getting money flowing.  I commend to the Minister the idea that we should implement the provision in the programme for Government to guarantee small loans in the business sector to get over this problem.  Credit is crucial to getting investment going.The memorandum of understanding contains an acceptance of the jobs initiative, which represents progress from where we stood before.  It would be lovely if a Minister could come into this House and announce that billions of euro would be injected into a jobs programme, which is the ambition and what we ultimately want to get, but the jobs initiative will be a critical first step.  We need to restore the dignity of work to people and end the lines of young people in the departure lounge at Dublin Airport going to Australia.  While it is fine for people to go abroad voluntarily to gain experience during a gap year, it is a tragedy when people are going against their wishes because they have no option.  While it is a tragedy for their families, it is also a tragedy for the future of our economy and society, and it must be reversed.  The training programmes and propositions included in the programme for Government which will be implemented through the jobs initiative to be announced next week are crucial first steps in dealing with unemployment.  We need to deal with this issue immediately.It is important that we maintain the fiscal ambition to keep the deficit at 3% of GDP by 2015.  It is important to our international credibility and the project of achieving a pan-European solution to the unacceptable bailout.  With regard to the bailout, bondholders will have to take a hit.  However, we cannot act unilaterally as a small country that depends on international conditions and that has such a great need for money to pay for services and maintain the apparatus of the State.  Doing so would not make sense to me.We should examine the Japanese mortgage model which I commend to the Minister for consideration.  We should consider intergenerational mortgages and mortgages extended in time.  This would involve putting more finance into the banks such that they would be in a position to act in this regard.  There are too many people in negative equity and too many families whose income has been reduced by the universal social charge and other charges.  In some cases, their income, or 50% thereof, has been eliminated.  Such families are having a shocking problem trying to make mortgage repayments.  Even to have them investing and serving as confident consumers in the economy to get the economy moving, it is vital that there be mortgage restructuring.The proposition in the programme for Government and the proposition of the Minister for Finance, Deputy Michael Noonan, outlined in a number of speeches today, that Departments consider the Canadian model of departmental expenditure, is critical.  This process is in train.  One can prune expenditure without causing vulnerable people to suffer.  I would be aghast and horrified if vulnerable people still suffered, perhaps through the withdrawal of a bus service to a special school, when wasteful expenditure was eliminated.  There is potential for cuts in expenditure that would ultimately protect the vulnerable by making more cash available.The Croke Park deal offers a great avenue to achieve an outcome that will maintain industrial peace and a fair society and keep people working together.  The deal must be exploited to the full.  Since the Government has been in office, serious strides have been made.  Real confidence has been built outside the House by a leaner, fitter Government.Something must be done to tackle exorbitant salaries, bonuses and ludicrous payments for failure.  If we cannot tackle them because of contractual law, I support the proposition that we proceed through taxation measures in future budgets.  We must have equity and fairness across the board.  We should be saluting the Government and revel in the House in the fact that so much has been achieved in such a short time.  This augurs well for the future.
#SeamusHealy	unknown-#SeamusHealy-party	unknown-#SeamusHealy-dob	unknown-#SeamusHealy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-05-04 00:00:00	Prelude	330	I am sharing my time with Deputy Mick Wallace.We have been told time and again by the Government that it received a strong mandate in the recent general election.  It has such a mandate and an overwhelming majority, possibly an unhealthily large one.  Surely we should tell the truth in this House, the truth being that the public was sold a pup in the general election.  The document we are discussing is the same as that presented by the former Government.  I said during the general election campaign that I believed there would be little or no difference between the policies pursued by a Fine Gael-Labour Party Government and those pursued by the Fianna Fáil-Green Party Government.  From what we have been listening to in the House since the general election, there is no doubt but that this is the case.  There is now a grand coalition of Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael and the Labour Party, all of which are singing from the same hymn sheet.We were told it would be "Labour's way or Frankfurt's way".  We were told the financial circumstances were an obscenity and that there would be burden sharing.  We were told not one red cent more would be given to the banks, yet we are giving them an additional €24 billion.  What we are witnessing is the implementation of the programme for Government introduced and pursued by the previous Government.  The fundamental principle of the programmes of the current and former Governments is to make ordinary people, including lower income and middle income families and the poor, pay our way out of the recession, a recession in which they had no hand, act nor part in creating.The other side of the coin is that there has been no taxation of very wealthy people.  The super rich in this country, amounting to a figure of 6%, still have €250 billion in assets, but they are not being asked to pay a halfpenny thereon.  A 10% windfall tax on these assets would bring in €25 billion and the super rich would still be super rich.  There is no doubt that if one had blindfolded oneself while listening to various Ministers in recent weeks, one would have thought one was listening to Ministers from the previous Government.  The hymn sheet, story and message are the very same in that they seek to make the ordinary man and woman in the street pay for the gamblers who gambled recklessly and lost.  Taxpayers, including lower income and middle income families and the poor, are being made to pay for the reckless gambling losses.  I have stated previously in the House that we must have a structured, negotiated default, but that will not be enough.  The bondholders must be burned, but this will still not be enough.  Together with these steps, there must be reasonable taxation of very wealthy people in this country who have significant assets and are not paying their fair share.  We need to tax them urgently; otherwise we are headed towards a catastrophic default that will absolutely destroy Ireland's families, economy and society.
#MickWallace	unknown-#MickWallace-party	unknown-#MickWallace-dob	unknown-#MickWallace-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-05-04 00:00:00	Prelude	331	Deputy Joe O'Reilly made a few points that were very fair.  He spoke about the lack of credit and stated the Government would ensure credit would be available soon.  From my experience in business, I note it is now nearly three years since credit was freely available.  I have been listening for a long time to Governments stating credit will become available every time the banks are given money, but, unfortunately, credit is not yet available and I am not sure when it will be.It was good to hear Deputy Joe O'Reilly refer to mortgage restructuring.  When we debated the notion last night, some Members on the other side of the House were throwing seriously cold water on it.  The taxpayer and the bank is now one and the same person.  If somebody bought a house for €400,000 which is now worth €200,000, does it make more sense for the taxpayer or bank to repossess it, put it on the market and sell it for €150,000 or to give the person some help, even in terms of €50,000?  There would still be €350,000 for the State, rather than getting €140,000 from an initial investment of €400,000.  We must seriously fight repossessions.  They just do not make sense, financially or socially.The Minister also mentioned the importance of equity and fairness.  We agree on that.  In the period before the publication of the revised terms of the EU-IMF programme, the Minister, Deputy Noonan, stated that all changes must be fiscally neutral and that in terms of total cuts and taxes the revised memorandum of understanding remains unchanged.  Does this mean we will still achieve the target deficit of 3% of GDP by 2015?  In the past couple of weeks the forecast for our growth rate has been revised down from the 1.8% forecast last December to an optimistic estimate of 0.8%.  Can we still achieve the target of 3% in 2015 with the same figures?I understand that cuts amounting to €3.6 billion are planned for the December budget.  Will that figure be larger to compensate for the fact that GDP growth will not be as good as we thought?  We are probably being very optimistic in anticipating that the levels we are calculating for 2013 and 2014 will be reached, given the serious effect of the austerity measures.  If the budget is to be even more severe, do Members agree that the people who will probably suffer most are the most vulnerable?  It is generally accepted that those who are most hurt by budget cuts are, as a rule, the most vulnerable.  Fairness is disappearing at this stage.There is reference to property tax and water charges in the document.  I find it hard to believe that even the current Government could have the neck to impose water charges and property tax on people who are already suffering as a result of the universal social charge, rising interest rates — we have not seen the last of them — and mortgage problems.  God knows, the figure of 44,000 households being 90 days behind with their mortgage repayments will certainly increase dramatically in the next year.  All this adds up and makes one wonder about the role of the State.  Is it to protect big business, look after the financial institutions and play ball with the boys in the ECB?  I understood that the role of the State was to work towards protecting the most vulnerable in our society.  Undoubtedly, history will be hard on the last Government, but I believe it will be hard on this one as well.
#GeraldNash	unknown-#GeraldNash-party	unknown-#GeraldNash-dob	unknown-#GeraldNash-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-05-04 00:00:00	Prelude	332	In January 2010, the then Minister for Finance, Deputy Brian Lenihan, assured the Dáil that our economic future was bright.  In his speech he guaranteed that the national minimum wage was untouchable as it had been introduced "to protect the weak in our labour market".  Before the year was out, Fianna Fáil slashed the minimum wage from €8.65 to €7.65, a reduction of almost 12%.  It blamed the cut on the constraints imposed by the EU and the IMF.However, we now know that the minimum wage was eviscerated at a time when Fianna Fáil was still approving bonuses for banking executives and when Deputy Lenihan had a path worn to the tax man's door to have tax bills reviewed for all sorts of characters who were in contact with his office.  During the last general election campaign the Labour Party promised to restore the national minimum wage to its former level.  That process is now in train and will be completed shortly.The Government readily acknowledges that this is just a small part of repairing the colossal damage that has been done to this country.  The people who gained the least from our plastic boom are paying a high price following its collapse as a direct result of the disastrous response of the previous Administration.  The impact of the collapse on ordinary Irish families is manifold.  As the "Prime Time" programme last night demonstrated, regeneration schemes in our most disadvantaged areas lie abandoned by reckless developers, who fled at the first whiff of the downturn.  The cruellest mockery is that while many of our citizens are forced to remain in run down housing estates reminiscent of something from a Seán O'Casey play, the same developers left acres of unserviced, incomplete ghost housing estates.We would love to be able to rectify all the injustices, right all the wrongs and repair all the damage wrought by the previous, rotten Administration, but we cannot.  People know and accept that we cannot, at least not immediately.  Our country is broken; its economy has been devastated.  However, it can and will be fixed.  We must put the country back together piece by piece, day by day.  Part of that process will involve repairing international relations, especially within the European Union.  The revised memorandum we are discussing today, political and diplomatic efforts and the continuous process of renegotiation allow us the opportunity to do this.These relations were not soured solely by the impact of the banking collapse three years ago.  The rot had set in long before.  While the former Minister, Charlie McCreevy, high-fived the representatives of the German and French banks and encouraged them to pour more fuel into an already exploding Irish economy, we neglected our relationships with our smaller European neighbours.  They were unimportant because we were playing with the big boys.  Member states of a similar size to Ireland were arrogantly told to come to this country so we could show them how it was done.  We now know how it was done and we also know the price of playing with the so-called big boys.  When the fun ended and the big boys explained the rules and handed us the bill, we looked around for help and sympathy from our European neighbours, particularly the smaller nations.  There was none.The Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs faces the critical task of restoring our international standing, reputation and confidence.  Slowly, bridges are being rebuilt.  The revised memorandum of understanding proves there has been a discernible shift in the mood of many of our partners in Europe, in the institutions of the European Union and in the IMF.  The process of restoring trust in Ireland has begun.  It must not fail and we, as public representatives, must ensure it is not allowed to fail.
#TomBarry	unknown-#TomBarry-party	unknown-#TomBarry-dob	unknown-#TomBarry-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-05-04 00:00:00	Prelude	333	It is clear that many Members of the House have not run or are not running a solvent business.  The only job some of them have created is their own.  They have spoken highly of Iceland, but we are not in Iceland.  We live and trade in this country.  It is easy to be critical and difficult to be constructive.I will speak about the systematic destruction of our indigenous industries, such as sugar and chocolate production.  People say that the policies pursued by this Government are no different from those of the last Government.  That is rubbish.  It is populist speech.  We are all workers.  Some people might be aware that agriculture underwent negative benchmarking for many years.I commend the Minister on the actions he has taken to date.  As a person who has founded and currently runs a business, it is clear to me that his actions have instilled, and continue to instill, confidence in our economy both in this country and abroad.  The extremely difficult process of ongoing negotiation is being dealt with in a businesslike fashion which shows both a clear minded approach and systematic thinking.  The strands simultaneously put in place by this Government are working to sow the seeds of recovery.  The Minister has sought to restructure and stabilise our banking system which, unpalatable as it might be to many Members of the House, is something which had to be achieved.  The Government's jobs initiative will secure the economic growth that must accompany the EU-IMF programme.I thank the Minister for paying heed to the suggestions put forward by many Members in respect of the jobs initiative.  I am sure several of those suggestions will be taken on board, either in part or in full, with the aim of providing real employment in the community.  It is important that people should see the strands of recovery coming together and forming a real opportunity to get Ireland moving again.Who are the people responsible for stating that the pay of workers is being savaged?  I run an indigenous, small to medium-sized agribusiness.  We treat our employees fairly and with decency.  Of course we have all been obliged to work longer hours, but that is how we will survive.  The members of my generation have borrowed heavily and have invested in the State.  It is they who are suffering under the debt burden.  Other Members must recognise that fact.Ireland's economic recovery will be led by exports.  In that context, agri-industry will play a major and pivotal role.   Real jobs are created in the area of manufacturing.  It should not be forgotten that in business one trades on one's reputation.  This country is no different in that regard.  Members who continually refer to who created our problems should go away and read the Nyberg report.  Focusing on the past will not allow us to fix the future.I commend the Minister on looking forward and on taking all the steps and fostering the conditions necessary to facilitate the creation of employment.  We must explain to people that creating jobs, particularly in respect of small to medium-sized indigenous industries, is a gradual process.  One cannot merely switch on job creation as one would switch on a light bulb.  The road towards job creation is long but, as a person who runs a business, I am of the opinion that each step we take upon it represents a step in the right direction.
#WillieODea	unknown-#WillieODea-party	unknown-#WillieODea-dob	unknown-#WillieODea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-05-04 00:00:00	Prelude	334	I welcome the opportunity to contribute to the debate on this important matter.  The kindest remark I can make about the document with which we have been presented is that it constitutes a gigantic anti-climax, particularly in the context of the boasting, pose-striking and breast-beating we witnessed and the grandiloquent phrases such as "Labour's way or Frankfurt's way" and "not a red cent" to which we were treated prior to the general election.  The document before the House is extremely minimalist in nature when one considers the process that was undergone in respect of its production.  It appears to be a prelude to the jobs initiative, about which we will be informed on Tuesday next.  The latter has all the signs of being a damp squib.  However, I hope I am wrong about that.Apropos of the jobs initiative, the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Innovation, Deputy Richard Bruton, appears to have a problem with his Department.  These leaks are very unusual in nature.  Those of us who have had the privilege of running Departments have been the victims of leaks.  I refer to circumstances where, for example, someone — be it a civil servant, an adviser or someone else — might give a document to a particular journalist.  What is happening in the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Innovation's Department represents a peculiar form of leaking.  Information has been given to several journalists and great pains have been taken to ensure that the relevant material received the widest possible exposure.  There has also been a process of serial leaking whereby information has emerged in instalments on successive days.I do not know what the House will debate on Tuesday next because we are all quite well aware of what the jobs initiative is going to involve.  If I were of a suspicious frame of mind, I might state that the leaking is spin that was officially authorised.  As I am not of such a frame of mind, I will not accuse the Minister of that.  Regardless of the number of times one leaks or publishes information, one will not take the bare look off it.One of the features of the EU-IMF programme of financial support for Ireland is the restoration of the minimum wage.  I wish to make it quite clear that I am wedded to the notion that people who work should be properly paid.  People who work for the minimum wage, whether it be €7.40 or €8.40 per hour, are not particularly well paid.  I have taken cognisance of the difficulties faced by employers at present and I listened carefully to what the previous speaker, who is an employer, said.The problem we face is that the new minimum wage will be approximately 30% higher than the comparable wage in the UK and Northern Ireland.  It will, in fact, be the highest minimum wage in Europe.  There are two types of people one can take off the dole queue.  The first type is young single people who have relatively low skill levels.  The vast majority of individuals of this sort with whom I am acquainted would love to obtain work, even for a minimum wage of €7.40 per hour.  Why then are we making it more expensive for employers to offer them the opportunity to leave the dole queue?  How does such a move contribute to restoring competitiveness to the economy?It is quite wrong for the Minister for Finance to state that the change in the rate of employers' PRSI will compensate for this.  It will not do so.  According to the various leaks — I suppose they cannot all be wrong — the proposed change to employers' PRSI will mean that for someone being paid up to €356 per week, the rate of such PRSI will fall from 8.5% to 4.25%.  As a result, someone who offers a person employment on the minimum wage will save 4.25% of the wage they will be paying.  However, they will be obliged to pay out 13% because that is what the increase from €7.40 to €8.40 per hour represents.  In net terms, these employers will be worse off to the tune of 9% or €25 per week regarding a minimum wage paid to someone who works 37.5 hours per week.  That is the position in respect of young single people.There is already a system in place to protect married people who have children or other familial responsibilities.  This takes the form of the family income supplement.  If my calculations are correct, a person with one child who is in receipt of family income supplement and who enters employment on the minimum wage and works 37.5 hours per week is, in gross terms, supposed to gain €37.50 per week.  However, he or she will only gain approximately €9 per week.According to replies given provided to my colleague, Deputy Michael McGrath, it will cost the State something of the order of €400 million to do what is proposed.  As a result of the Government's decision to the effect that this change must be revenue neutral, the money involved will have to be taken from elsewhere in the economy.  We will, therefore, take a certain amount out of the economy before putting an equivalent amount back into it.  We do not know from where this money will come.  We do not know whether it will result from tax increases, spending cuts or whatever.  However, it will have to be removed from the economy and goodness knows what impact this will have on jobs.  This single reform could mean that we will end up in a worse position than when we started.When he is replying, I would like the Minister to respond to one question.  The programme for Government appears to state that the level of employers' PRSI will be halved in respect of wages up to €356 per week.  Does this mean that the old rate of 8.5% will apply in respect of the tranche of people's wages over and above €356 or will the new rate simply apply to wages up to that amount?  If the latter is the case, there will then be an inducement to every employer to artificially drive down wages that are slightly in excess of €356 per week.  Why would they not do so in order to avail of the new rage of employers' PRSI?The programme also refers to joint labour committees, JLCs, regulated labour agreements, etc.  However, this is only the vaguest reference.  On 29 March, the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Innovation stated that JLCs and the minimum wage increase are inextricably linked.  In other words, we should take no notice of the fact that the minimum wage is being increased because the Government is going to restore lost competitiveness through introducing fundamental changes to the regulated labour agreements.It is interesting that on 14 April, the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Eamon Gilmore, contradicted the Minister and stated that the two are not linked at all and are entirely separate.  The Tánaiste also stated that one is not dependent on the other.  He refused to say whether there will be any substantial changes as a result of the current inquiry into the JLC-created agreements.  When he is responding, will the Minister for Finance confirm whether the Government has received the Duffy report, which relates to the type of arrangements to which I refer?  If it has been received, when does the Government propose to act on its recommendations?  When will the two sides of the Cabinet agree to a common approach to this matter?The only element of surprise regarding the document before the House is what it does not contain.  For example, the programme for Government contains a commitment to renegotiate terms and to replace emergency funding from the ECB to the Irish banks by way of a fixed medium-term facility in order to bring confidence into the system.  Our masters in Frankfurt gave the Minister, Deputy Noonan, a flat "No" and he accepted that and came home with his tail between his legs.  The fact is that deposits are still leaving the Irish banking system.  That cannot be gainsaid.  I have had a number of queries over the last few weeks from people I normally regard as sane, straightforward, honest and sensible on whether it is still safe to leave money their money in Irish banks.  There is no confidence in them.Where are we in respect of the reduction in the 5.8% interest rate?  This is about 3% more than is being paid for the money.  I understand the matter is going to a meeting of ECOFIN Ministers, and I wish the Minister for Finance the best of luck in his attempts to renegotiate that.  We will have to do something for this hard-pressed economy.  There was much talk about burning bondholders, and we heard statements such as "not a red cent" and "Labour's way or Frankfurt's way".  The Minister for Finance came back from Frankfurt and said on "Morning Ireland" that Frankfurt had said "No" and that the debate was over.  Now we know whose way it was.  It was always Frankfurt's way and the Government always knew it would be.What about the commitment to compel banks to reduce interest rates on variable mortgages by 0.25%?  That commitment was firmly given before the election.  We have heard nothing about it since.  What about the situation regarding the famous strategic investment bank?  That will never see the light of day.  Another part of the low-hanging fruit of the programme for Government is gone.

The programme for Government states that it is "committed to maintain the current rates of income tax, together with bands and credits".

In his reply, I would like the Minister to reconcile those two statements and tell us exactly where we stand.

I am but a humble apprentice at the feet of the Deputy.  The most delightful part, if it was not so serious, was to hear Deputy O'Dea lecture the Government on budgetary prudence, when the Government of which he was a Minister left the people of this State a €7.1 billion debt for the first 12 weeks of this year.  He has the temerity — I acknowledge it is skilful — to walk in here and criticise the Government regarding dealing with the budgetary legacy that he and his colleagues created.  He referred to our masters in Frankfurt.  Which Government created the environment where a sovereign state had to hand over its economic autonomy to other parties?  It was the Government of which the former Minister for irony was a member.

Nobody will allow a Fianna Fáil Deputy to lecture a new Government about how it should conduct itself, when the legacy of continuous years of the Fianna Fáil Government is the impaired sovereignty of our State.  It would be enjoyable to hear the Deputy practice that wheeze were it not for the fact that the consequences for the ordinary people of our State are so savage.I heard somebody else up on a pulpit today and that person deserved to be there.  In his contribution at Arbour Hill, Archbishop Diarmuid Martin used a phrase that struck a chord with me.  He said that we have spent a long time thinking about who we are looking for independence from, but not enough time thinking about what we want to use that independence for.  As this Government goes through the difficult work of regaining our economic independence and autonomy, it is becoming clearer what kind of State we are doing that for.  There are two elements to this.  First, we will ensure that we will never again end up with a financial sector whose failure can bring down a State.  Second, we will ensure that we have a State that can pay its own way in the world, that is not dependent upon the kindness of strangers to keep our hospitals open or to pay social welfare benefits to 440,000 people who are unemployed.  That is the economic dimension of what we need to achieve.There is a broader definition of sovereignty as well.  I have heard it stated many times in this debate that we have lost our sovereignty.  We have not lost our sovereignty.  The IMF, the European Commission and the European Union are not dictating to us how we should run our schools, what our attitude should be to the killing of Osama Bin Laden, what the rights of children should be in this State, or how we should treat prisoners.  What has happened is that a crucial part of that sovereignty has been lost, namely, our economic autonomy.  However, there are many other areas of our sovereignty that are firmly within the grasp of this State and its elected Government.One of the themes that has been continually suggested is that we should not have external bodies in our country, and that we should instead go down the route of unilateral default.  I have two questions for those who advocate that action.  Where are they going to find the €12 billion that we need this year to keep our schools and hospitals open and to pay the social welfare benefits for those people without jobs?  If they cannot answer that question, perhaps they can answer the second question.  What schools and hospitals will they close?  We are in a situation where the only people who can lend money to our country are these bodies.  If we decide that we do not want to do business with them, that is a course of action that no responsible government can incur.  It is a strategy which has risks that are so vast that we cannot knowingly pursue it.When other people make these points, they tend to preface that language by asking about the ordinary person.  What about the weak, the poor, the people who suffer?  They make those points as if they have a monopoly on representing those people.  I also represent those people, as does every other Member of this House.  Perhaps it is because I wear a shirt and tie that it is less acknowledged that I do so.  I will yield to nobody in stating that my social conscience does not burn any less brightly than anybody on the other side of the House.  However, I am clear that a tough course of action must be undergone if we want to look after the weakest in our society.  It is in their interests, as much as it is in mine, to make sure that they have schools to attend and to make sure that the social welfare benefits on which they are dependent can be paid next week and for the next few years.This leads on to another criticism that has been made, which is that this Government is not capable of delivering change.  I am always fascinated by this charge when it is made.  What automatically happens after we are told that we cannot make any change is that we are criticised for whatever change we do make.  We are told that the Government does not want to make that change because it is counterproductive or because it cannot pay for it.  That indicates that change has been delivered.  It might not be the vast structural change that we are seeking to deliver, but the Government has been in office for a matter of weeks, not years.  As Deputy Nash pointed out, the commitment that a new Government would be able to reverse the cut in the minimum wage is being met.  This is something the newly elected Government did.  Despite the claims of many that it could not be done, it has happened.  We were told that we could not put in place additional plans to deal with job creation, and it is going to happen.  I guarantee the same people who say that change cannot be delivered within the parameters of this plan are those who will stand up and criticise the change that has been made, and one cannot do both.I want to conclude on one point regarding the outlook of the State within the arrangement and return to a theme I visited previously, which is what will happen to the State from the summer of 2013 when the European stability mechanism is in place.  This mechanism will be very important to the prospects and destiny of the country because it will contain the idea of a collective action clause.  That clause will allow, for people buying future debt, that a structured default would be delivered on that debt.  The point I want to emphasise is that, for the State, this has the ability to be profoundly self-defeating, the reason being that the target for the State is that it will return to the financial markets at some point in the second half of 2012.Anybody considering buying our debt at that point will form the conclusion that the debt they are buying might be subject to that stability mechanism.  This will force up the rate of interest on our debt as we look to return to the market and that will create severe difficulty for the State.  It is a flaw in the mechanism that must be addressed in the coming year and a half to two years that are open.  The State can survive that dynamic by ensuring that we need to borrow as little as possible when we get to that point.  We cannot allow the State to be dependent on the vagaries of money markets or the kindness of strangers again.  In tandem with delivering jobs, which will ensure that the budget will over time correct itself, that is the job of the Government, and it has made a strong and decisive start to making that happen.

The people of Ireland will not judge the Fine Gael Party-Labour Party Government on how it contrasts with Fianna Fáil.  They will judge it on the basis of jobs and the ability of the State to function.  North Korea would contrast favourably with the policies of Fianna Fáil over the past number of years.  It is important to focus on developing policies that will bring real change.The last election was all about how the people would witness massive change with the new Fine Gael Party-Labour Party Government.  We were promised the renegotiation of the EU-IMF bailout package and that job creation would be central to this process of change.  We are 100 days in and that change is nowhere to be seen.  The EU-IMF bailout and the memorandum have hardly altered at all.  In fact, we are seeing a Government that is Fianna Fáil mark two.  It is incredible to sit here and have Fianna Fáil ex-Ministers congratulating Fine Gael on implementing exactly what they themselves would implement.Government is about making choices, and the choices the Government makes will determine its legacy.  It has real choices to hand.  If the Government acquiesces in this current bailout, it will further the likelihood of this country going down the route of default.  The Government has a choice about creating jobs.  I was shocked when I read the memorandum of understanding.  It is striking that amid all the paragraphs about banks, wages, etc., there is only one paragraph about job creation.  There are no job creation targets or budgets.  There is no information about the job creation programmes to be developed or how employment will be increased.Job creation is central to the recovery of the State.  It is the oxygen by which most of the State functions, from the family basis right up to the society and national basis.  Job creation impacts on all levels of our being.  It impacts on how we feed ourselves, clothe ourselves and even on whether we can house ourselves.  It impacts on whether we, as individuals, can exist in this country in the future.Job creation was the mantra of the Fine Gael and Labour parties for the past number of years.  If one remembers the Lisbon treaty referenda, the posters were festooned with the words, "Jobs, jobs, jobs".  Nobody knew it was the Lisbon treaty on which they were voting; people thought they were voting for jobs.At the last election, each of the Government parties made a massive pitch that they would increase jobs in the State, yet now that they are in power we have had to wait 100 days for a jobs creation budget, initiative or whatever the Government wants to call it.  In that 100 days, 13,000 people, the Government parties' constituents, have emigrated.  They cannot wait for the Government to get its act together to implement a jobs policy.The policy implemented over the past number of years has been deflationary and anti-jobs.  Fianna Fáil implemented it for the past three years and the Fine Gael and Labour parties are implementing it at present.  Deflationary and anti-jobs are two sides of the same coin and for each euro the Government takes out of the economy, there is a further multiplier effect which reduces the size of the economy.It is significant that in the memorandum of understanding two lines are beside each other.  The first line is that they expect growth to resume in 2011.  The next line is that the currently estimated decline in real GDP in 2010 was larger than anticipated.  The heart of the problem of the memorandum's economics is that expectations are always wrong.  For three years, growth level expectations have been lower.  Unemployment has been greater than expectations and investment recovery has been lower than expectations.  One would expect in this situation that there would be a motivation on the part of Government to change the policies, but the Fine Gael and Labour parties refuse to leave Fianna Fáil's economic orthodoxy and continue on that road themselves.  We can forget the programme for Government and the Fine Gael Party and Labour Party manifestos.  What we have in the 31st Dáil is dominated by Fianna Fáil's four-year plan and EU-IMF austerity.  The memorandum of understanding is the real manifesto under which the State will be run in the next number of years.Unfortunately, there are not too many Labour Party Deputies in the Chamber.  However, from speaking to Labour Party supporters and members, I know that they particularly feel the imposition of this austerity implementation over the past number of months.  Within nine weeks, the Labour Party's ideology and policy has been gutted.  It has been replaced with a mantra that the State is in receivership and the Government will not revisit any of the cuts made by the previous Government.  Within nine weeks, Labour Party Deputies have transmogrified into Fine Gael vote fodder.

As a result, Fianna Fáil should remain politically toxic for a generation.  Each of the Labour Party and Fine Gael Party's Deputies should now consider their legacy to the State.The Government is sleepwalking the State into default.  The memorandum will be seen by future generations as the blueprint of this default.  The anger and bitterness the people of Ireland have for Fianna Fáil will in no small measure also land at the Government's doorstep if it continues with this.  I want to echo the comments of my colleague, Deputy Doherty, that there is another way.  We are here because choices are available to us.The key to growth is job creation.  Growth cannot happen without investment.  The multiplier works both ways.  To be able to pay for the running of the State we need to reduce debt to manageable levels, and this cannot happen without proper burden sharing.  We also need to implement efficiencies, but we need to invest in the economy.  In the current climate, the private sector cannot come to the rescue with regard to investment.  Export growth, while it is key, will remain job-neutral in the foreseeable future.The choice we urge the Government to take is to invest in the State's economy, reduce costs to businesses, restructure the enterprise development organisations so they are fit for purpose and resource small and medium-sized businesses so they can export.  At present, there is no export programme for businesses in the State with fewer than ten employees.  There are ad hoc programmes run by a number of county enterprise boards throughout the State but there is no programme.  The Government speaks about an export-led recovery but surely we can gather the low-hanging fruit by enabling these small businesses to develop in this export area.

The Government has the choice of putting that money into a dead bank or putting the Irish taxpayers' money into creating jobs.  Its deflationary policy, which it has taken up from Fianna Fáil, has on every single occasion reduced all economic indicators against expectations.  The people of Ireland now expect the Government to learn from these mistakes and change tack and grow the economy out of recession rather than making cuts.
#PeterMathews	unknown-#PeterMathews-party	unknown-#PeterMathews-dob	unknown-#PeterMathews-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-05-04 00:00:00	Prelude	352	This is a report card by the Government to the people who entered into an agreement to provide a working capital arrangement for Ireland over the next five or six years.  Some of the points made by the Opposition this evening are understandable in so far as they are trying to grasp the situation without thinking it through fully.  The straitjacket of the parameters of the template for this programme — a joint programme by the IMF, the EU and the ECB — is made out in such a way that we have to show discipline.  We also have to show it for ourselves, as it is not just for others because we have to get the operational machinery of Ireland — the political, economic and social machinery — working again.In early November, a G20 meeting was held in Seoul, on the other side of the globe.  This was an important meeting because the finance Ministers present were concerned, most particularly the Europeans, that the exposure, referred to by Deputy McHugh earlier, of the ECB and our Central Bank as proxy for the ECB at more than €150 billion in total was perilously close to being uncollectible and could have been a serious fissure in the entire financial system.  With regard to last weekend's conversation in the newspapers about whether the previous Government and the Minister for Finance knew what was the driving force behind the arrival of the troika, a close examination of the six Irish-owned financial institutions would have suggested the answer to that question and it remains the same.  However, the new Government has a responsibility, and by virtue of a document such as this is fully accountable for the necessary corrections and reining in of what had got out of control.The ECB has not done us any favours.  Last week, Klaus Regling, who was a joint author of a report on what went wrong in our banking sector, in his address to the Institute of International and European Affairs confirmed that people in his country, namely, Germany, which has the largest population in the EU, did not understand that the bailout for Ireland is not a transfer of funds or a gift but a loan.  This brings me to my next point, which is that it is a loan at an expensive rate of interest.  Where I commend the Minister for Finance, the Taoiseach and the Government is that having been told "No" on their first presentation of a request some weeks ago immediately after the St. Patrick's weekend having just taken office, after 40 working days they acted wisely.  This is like the first nine holes of a golf scorecard; one demonstrates one can keep within the operational parameters in the first nine holes and then one returns and re-opens discussions on two fronts.  We now have a better picture of the true extent of losses in the banking sector.  As the first step of what the Minister, Deputy Burton, stated will be a robust race and not a sprint we must ensure the figure for losses, which is the starting point, is in clear and sharp focus.  As the first step, on 31 March, the outline was presented whereby we would regroup with a revitalised banking sector with new supervision, management, boards of directors, energies and competencies in place.  This is all in the report card.New capital has not yet been injected, and there are various ways of putting capital into businesses and banks.  One is by direct injection and another is by writedown of creditor amounts, and this may be coming.  It is already in the report card where it discusses liabilities management exercises for subordinated debt so we are on the right track.  I am confident that with sharper and clearer focus and fuller measurement we will know at the end of the month what further loan losses are likely in the two banks being wound down, namely, Irish Nationwide Building Society and Anglo Irish Bank.  We will have a better fix on this, and with that better fix we can present the losses to the counter parties in the troika, particularly the ECB, and state this is the full measurement and here is where we are, that our banks are indebted to it on the emergency funding basis at a level of, for example, €170 billion or €180 billion and that it is too much for the marathon ahead of us so let us discuss a resolution.There is huge misunderstanding about default.  Default is just a state of existence; it is not something one chooses from a panel of buttons.  One arrives at default by going broke.  It happens to households, businesses and countries.  What is important is to be ahead of the curve and anticipate what is happening and likely to happen, measure it correctly and meet the people who will be part of the outcome prior to the outcome becoming harder to deal with.I am confident we will do that because good and honest people from the Labour Party and the Fine Gael Party are sitting in Cabinet.  Imagine what it would be like if one had to take over a business that was in a state of disarray with nobody willing to provide credit.  That is not a nice thought.  I invite each of the 166 Members of this House to collectively put their shoulders to the wheel rather than nitpick, particularly when the nitpicking comes from those who landed us in our current predicament.  I remind Deputies that BlackRock Solutions prepared its report only after we entered Government.Let us be courageous as a people and think in terms of values, responsibilities and accountability so that we fill in the second nine holes over the next year and get within striking distance of par.  I am confident the Minister for Finance will be able to draw this simple picture for Mr. Trichet and others.  There will be a resolution even if we do not achieve all the parameters we have set out for 2013.  They are not set in cement because the IMF has a better understanding of our situation.In regard to the interest rates, I am confident the Minister will be able to demonstrate that the EU portion of the funds provide a profit margin that amounts to almost 3%, which equals €1.3 billion per annum when translated into a full draw down of the facility.  That is too much and it does not seem to capture the spirit of EU solidarity to charge a margin of €1.3 billion on top of the basic cost of providing funds.  I am confident the Minister will address that issue.  He comes from the solid foundation of being able to fill in the first nine holes.  I use that as an analogy.

I fully agree that the only way we can get out of our difficulties is by achieving economic growth and an increase in employment.  However, the sources of the finance often suggested by Sinn Féin are based more on rhetoric and misinformation than on detailed analysis.  For example, a Sinn Féin Deputy stated that money from the National Pensions Reserve Fund was going into Anglo Irish Bank.  That is not a fact.  The NPRF can invest only where it can achieve a return and the banks in which it invested were AIB and the Bank of Ireland because they were believed to have a future.  If the money had not been provided from that source, it would have had to be found somewhere else.The NPRF has been useful in dealing with a variety of issues and it is important it is used to our best advantage.  The reason it is investing in the banks is that the Government intends to establish two banking pillars.  By putting money in these two amalgamated institutions, the hope is that they will become viable banks which can lend to industry and commerce.  The alternative is to put the same money in a separate vehicle to lend it directly but one then faces the problem of a non-functioning banking sector which cannot obtain the necessary finance.  What cannot be done is give the money to one group and invest it somewhere else on the pretence that it was not already spent, which is the kind of economics practised by Members of the Government while they were in Opposition.  They advocated all sorts of programmes and sources of finance.  The Labour Party proposed to establish an investment bank but did not tell us where it would find the money.

The need to find an additional €18 billion was a major flaw in that argument.We have reason for hope in the future.  The idea that nobody in this country has money is fallacious.  We have to encourage the people who have money to invest in productive activities.  I am also keen on motivating communities.  If a community of 1,000 created ten jobs, which is certainly possible for the communities with which I am familiar, we could create 40,000 jobs across the economy, while at the same time increasing the tax take and reducing the social welfare bill.  We need to engender something in the mind that is not necessarily reliant on State money but that creates an air of community commitment to job creation.  If we were to encourage people who have wealth to use their money to create jobs in every small industry in the country our financial position would improve tremendously.I am curious as to whether the Government has progressed the initiative on sovereign annuities.  If it is looking for genuine sources of money, the pension industry has significant potential.  However, if the Government is to go down this route, it will have to give an undertaking that it will not default on the money.  That was the argument traditionally proffered by the pension industry for not investing in Irish bonds but pension funds invest in high risk equities as well as in German and French bonds with very bad returns.  Legislation passed by this House before Christmas provided for the establishment of a sovereign annuity whereby NTMA would issue bonds to the pension industry.  It was believed that between €4 billion and €5 billion could be raised, which is not to be sneezed at.  We would, of course, have to pay interest on the bonds but we would be doing so over a period of 35 years and the money would be repaid into the economy.We acted on a proposal by the trade union movement to issue solidarity bonds, although I do not think the Department of Finance was particularly enthusiastic about them.  If these bonds had been sold with the same vigour as SSIAs we would have found a great number of individuals willing to invest in the future of the young people of this country.  There is a call for old-fashioned patriotism where people who have funds would make them available to create better infrastructure, more jobs and a worthwhile future.I was interested in what Deputy Peter Mathews had to say about the EU, the IMF and the €150 billion.  What created the €100 billion problem in our banks, which it was in November, was that people were pulling money out of the banks.  The challenge was that the Europeans had created uncertainty and people had got scared and started pulling money out of banks.  The Europeans then came knocking on our door and saying they would lend us no more.  I do not agree with Deputy Mathews when he says Ireland's difficulty was a major crisis for the European Union.
#PeterMathews	unknown-#PeterMathews-party	unknown-#PeterMathews-dob	unknown-#PeterMathews-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-05-04 00:00:00	Prelude	356	It still is.

For 4 million people, €150 billion is a huge amount.  However, there are approximately 400 million people in the European Union.  On a European scale, €150 billion is equivalent to Ireland having a problem of €1.5 billion.  The scale is 100:1.The real preoccupation of Europe at the time was not with Ireland.  Europe did not think the Irish problem was unmanageable.  It was only a pimple on the nose of Europe.  The Governor of the Central Bank and the Secretary General of the Department of Finance agreed with that thesis at the time, no matter what head-wagging Deputy Mathews does.  The problem was that the EU was looking at Portugal and Spain.  That was the real concern, and not the absolute amount of money involved in the Irish economy.  That proves this is not just an Irish problem but a general European problem, in which many peripheral countries are involved and which are collectively of serious concern to the European Union.I am disappointed the European Union has not taken a more pan-European approach to the issue and come up with pan-European solutions, rather than deal with it on a country-by-country basis.  It has taken some pan-European decisions but I get the impression it does not have a pan-European plan.This brings me to the favourite topic of Deputy Tóibín and his colleagues, which is default.  The only way to consider default in bonds is by an ECB pan-European arrangement.  There is no way Ireland could unilaterally default.  First, we would not get the money to run the country on a day-to-day basis.  Second, there are consequential issues, too numerous to go into here, that would have huge downsides for our economy.  Therefore, these issues must be dealt with at a European level.  A European-created problem needs a European solution.  Until we understand that we will not make progress.
#AndrewDoyle	unknown-#AndrewDoyle-party	unknown-#AndrewDoyle-dob	unknown-#AndrewDoyle-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-05-04 00:00:00	Prelude	358	There are two facts with which no Member of the House can disagree.  First, no one wants to be at the behest of the European Central Bank and the International Monetary Fund.  Second, the only way to claw ourselves out of the problem we are in is by job creation.  However, this is where the agreement of Members comes to a sharp end.Two trains of thought seem to divide the House at this point.  One view is that we can create jobs by restructuring, retasking and resourcing some of our enterprise agencies to create an internal economy.  The other is that we should default unilaterally.  However, we cannot default and continue to operate unless we take a pan-European approach, as Deputy Ó Cuív has said.  In time, a pan-European approach will have to be worked out.  Since the Government took office, Ministers have been going everywhere they can on a diplomatic and trade mission to let everyone know we are a country that must export.  The mistake we made, which is well documented, was to think we were so brilliant that we could survive as a domestic economy without doing what we had done for generations, which was to build a competitive export economy.Deputy Ó Cuív missed the point when he said our €150 problem was only a pimple on the nose of the ECB.  It was not.  The ECB bought into the mantra that it could lend into this economy and that Ireland could sustain that level of debt.  For that reason, there is an onus on the ECB to work with us on an ongoing basis.  The involvement of the troika in Ireland's affairs is reviewed on a quarterly basis.  This must be seen as a work in progress.  It cannot be seen as a deal that is set in stone with no ongoing renegotiation, review or amendment.  It will finally dawn on our European partners that the only way for the eurozone, or euro project, to survive is by a restructuring.  This can happen in several ways.The euro itself is a new project and is in need of fine tuning.  Not every member state of the EU is a member of the eurozone.  This has been a particular problem for Ireland.  Our biggest trading partner is in another currency area and was in a position to devalue when the euro was not devalued.  Our other big strategic partner is the United States, and the US dollar did the same thing.  Ireland was hamstrung by not being able to make those decisions.  With regard to the euro project, we must be either in it or out of it.If we are to create jobs, and we must reassure the world that Ireland is open for business, we must reform those structures in which the troika has no input.  Last night, the Fine Gael Parliamentary Party heard that 400 potential jobs in a call centre in a part of the country, which is not my constituency, are jeopardised by a single appeal to An Bord Pleanála by a notifiable organisation.  As there is no deadline date for the planning decision the project has been thrown into jeopardy.  This is something we can reform internally, and must reform.  We can do the same with our bankruptcy laws.  People who were persuaded, by financial institutions and on foot of fundamentally sound business plans, to take risks, to borrow money and to get into the property market now find themselves in distress.  These people are excluded from business for 12 years by the most out-of-date law in Europe.  We must review this law.  The programme for Government states review of this law is Government policy.

This motion crystallises an issue of which we are all very much aware, namely, the growing number of people who are experiencing great difficulty in paying the mortgages on their homes.  The two consequences of that are, first, as they encounter difficulty in paying the mortgages on their homes that then cascades into difficulty in paying debt in other areas of their lives such as credit card debt, which results in even greater difficulty in making ends meet.  The second consequence we are all aware of as constituency politicians is the huge amount of stress and personal difficulty that causes.The reason this problem is of such concern to the House is the potential for it to become more serious resulting in more people being unable to pay their mortgages.  Leaving aside the huge social difficulty and pain that it causes, it also has the ability to cause further damage to our economy and to the banks we are trying to keep secure and stable to meet the needs of the economy.I read with great interest the motion brought forward by the Technical Group but my difficulty, and it is one of the reasons I oppose the motion, is that while I agree with the analysis put forward in the motion I could not find the solution indicated anywhere in the motion.  The only line regarding a possible solution is the reference to "using whatever emergency measures are deemed necessary to reduce the unsustainable debt burden" but nowhere does the motion lay out what those emergency measures would be.With that in mind I took time to read the contributions made by each of the Deputies proposing the motion to see if I could find examples of the measures they had in mind.  In Deputy Thomas Pringle's fine contribution, and I agree with the analysis he outlined, there is only one sentence that lays out what he would do in regard to this problem.  It states: "There are proposals relating to debt forgiveness, increasing the terms of loans or engaging in debt for equity swaps".  It acknowledges those proposals but it does not indicate the ones that would be chosen.  As I read through all the contributions, with the exception of the contribution of Deputy Stephen Donnelly, I could see an analysis of the issue but no reference to the solutions.  The only solution laid down and which different Deputies commended was the idea of debt forgiveness.  That issue creates huge tension because while there are currently 40,000 people who are finding it very difficult to pay their mortgages there are 746,000 people who can pay for them.  Dealing with the difficulty for those people who cannot pay their mortgages will create further cost to the taxpayer and to an Exchequer and a Government that is struggling to pay for social welfare, education or health care commitments.In terms of the course of action this Government has outlined, it is committed to putting in place a moratorium on house repossessions if it is clear that the borrower is doing all he or she can to pay the mortgage.  It has also brought forward a detailed programme of action that was detailed by the Minister, Deputy Michael Noonan, last night which laid out the options available in that regard.More needs to be done about this issue.  The Law Reform Commission report on bankruptcy law reform is an important report containing many imaginative ideas that should be explored.  Our bankruptcy laws and provisions are out of date and are quickly becoming part of the problem.There are other new ideas such as the negative equity loan proposed by Karl Dieter.  It is an interesting idea that involves putting in place a loan that would be carried forward from a property for which somebody is unable to pay that would relate only to the negative equity.  Those are the types of ideas this Government should explore further with a view to finding solutions that would make a difference.
#PeterMathews	unknown-#PeterMathews-party	unknown-#PeterMathews-dob	unknown-#PeterMathews-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-05-04 00:00:00	Prelude	363	Like Deputy Paschal Donohoe I commend the proposers of the motion and agree with their analysis but it falls short in terms of solutions.An example occurred during the week that I would like to share with Members that explains at a microcosm level, and can be extrapolated to the national level, the terrible bind the country is in with the legacy debt for households, the banks and the country.  In early 2007 a public servant who is now aged 50 sold a house and realised €100,000 of equity in that house which they invested in a new house in a provincial town.  That new house cost €420,000.  That was a prudential level of equity investment in the new house in early 2007.  This person has worked in the public service all their working life and four years ago, at 46 years of age, they made this second home investment.  A total of €320,000 was borrowed from a building society which is now a bank and a 21 year loan entered into for €320,000.  Prudentially, a five year interest only fixed rate of interest of 5.5% — that was before European Central Bank interest rates fell — involved a €1,480 monthly repayment commitment.  That was fine.  It was prudential.  There was nothing wrong with that but because of the collapse as a result of total mismanagement of the banking and financial sector and the economy, and the way the finances were organised up to that point, the position now is that that public servant has experienced a huge drop in net take home pay in the order of 20%.  The €1,850 monthly repayment for the loan on the house was not possible within the income constraints.  That person took the initiative with the bank because the banks were operationally under strain and not working according to the normal banking operational levels as a result of the collapse.  That person suggested that €1,000 a month would be the new monthly commitment.  That happened for 12 months but, weirdly, at the end of that period the bank wrote to say that the difference between the €1,480 and €1,000 monthly payments for the last 12 months must be met.  It presented a statement invoice for €6,000 odd, which did not make sense.  The real hammer blow, however, is that the house, which cost €420,000, now has a realistic market value of about €200,000.  That means the €100,000 investment by that good public servant is gone and they have a debt of €320,000 on their home worth €200,000.  That is the shock of the debt burden on this country, which is replicated all over the place, including businesses.This is not something that occurred in the last 40 days, however.  It is something we have had to describe, within that period and against the background of a straitjacket, to get this country's fiscal accounts in order, which has included the revenue-generating elements, the jobs, and which has had to be within the constraints of being revenue neutral, along with all these other difficulties.  I invite Members of the Opposition to be understanding, co-operative and supportive in this respect.  The EU-IMF report on the first two quarters is like the first nine holes on a golf card.  We should not judge it until some more unfolds.  We must continue to present the true facts across all levels to achieve debt resolution, especially with our counterparts in Europe.
#DamienEnglishFG	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-party	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-dob	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-05-04 00:00:00	Prelude	364	I am grateful for the opportunity to contribute to this motion.  I am glad we are having this debate.  We all share a desire to do something about residential mortgage debt.  In the coming months, the Minister for Finance will bring forward some new initiatives and one hopes he will take on board some of the contributions to this debate.  We do not have all the answers on this side of the House because others have various ideas for solutions.  We should put together a range of measures that will help people in various circumstances.  Some people's property is in negative equity while others want to sell their homes and move to another area for employment.  Many people cannot afford to pay their mortgages.  We may quote figures indicating that 40,000 or 60,000 or 80,000 people are under pressure with mortgage arrears, but that is not a true reflection.  We all know that hundreds of thousands of people are struggling every week to make ends meet.  They have to choose between paying their mortgage or paying for something else, like schoolbooks.  We all have a duty to bring forward new ideas for change and I have no doubt the Government will do so.  When the Minister for Finance has assessed the situation and has all the necessary information, he will bring forward some changes.There are a couple of key areas we must home in on.  We cannot concentrate too much on the question of debt forgiveness because we could become lost in that debate.  Some of the banks, however, are starting to offer products which involve some interest or debt forgiveness.  We will work on that, but we must find ways to give people help, guidance and advice on how to get out of debt.  They must have a short-term plan as well as a long-term one, including restructuring, facing reality and seeing what they can do to earn extra income.  They must receive proper advice, but I do not think the money advice and budgeting service, MABS, has either the required staff numbers or, in some cases, the necessary skills set to tackle this problem for everyone concerned.  We need to strengthen MABS by giving it the expertise needed to advise people properly.  In that way, people will be able to negotiate with their bank or credit union to restructure loans.  Many Deputies are helping people to do this because they cannot get the necessary help and advice elsewhere.  Most people will find a way out of this if they are given proper advice and do not let the banks bully them by ringing them ten times a day, which is unacceptable.  We have a duty on this side of the House to ensure such help is provided.We must also create time and space for people to be able to work this out.  Some will have earning capabilities, perhaps from a new job, and so will have a chance to repay their debts, but others will not.  Both categories of debtor need different strategies because one umbrella will not fit them all.  They will need different plans to get out of debt.  If a person loses their house, they will become a cost on the State and there will be a drawdown on the housing budget anyway.  We must use our imaginations to find other ways of spending that money earlier to prevent the loss of family homes.  I have dealt with people who cannot pay off their debts even with debt forgiveness amounting to €40,000 or €50,000.  We must find a solution to keep such people in their family homes by some form of equity release either through a bank or private investor.  In that way, another person may take a share of the house.  Perhaps a local authority could buy the house while allowing the family to remain in it.There is no magic wand to fix this problem overnight, but we must tackle it with new ideas.  Many ideas have been raised in this debate, so I hope we can select the best ones to see what can be done.  Everyone must focus on this matter realistically to offer solutions that can work and not just things that sound good.  We need ideas that will contribute genuine solutions for people who are under serious pressure, something we cannot ignore.
#CiaranLynch	unknown-#CiaranLynch-party	unknown-#CiaranLynch-dob	unknown-#CiaranLynch-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-05-04 00:00:00	Prelude	365	I thank the Technical Group for bringing this motion before the House.  The problem of residential mortgage debt is hurtling down the tracks towards us, so it must be dealt with comprehensively.  The programme for Government contains a determined and responsive plan, the key aspect of which is that people will not find themselves on the side of the street as a result of the property bubble.  The primary focus of the new Government's agenda is to ensure a two year moratorium is put in place.  That is not the only measure included in the programme, however.  We need a comprehensive and detailed response to this problem, but there is no one-size-fits-all solution.  The previous Government's position was not to address the issue at all.  It established an expert group following a Private Members' debate initiated by the Labour Party in the autumn of 2009.  That group issued a report on the very day the Dáil went into recess in 2010.  Its findings, which were published in October or November 2010, were not debated in this House, despite calls to do so by myself and others.  This is not a new issue but an immediate response is required.Ever since the mortgage crisis started developing in 2007, we had procrastination by the previous Government.  What will the new Government do about it?  The first thing is to put in place a two year moratorium on repossessions to give people time to sort out their financial position, while allowing them to remain in their homes.  We will do that because it is in the programme for Government.Second, we will convert MABS into a strengthened personal debt management agency which will be established within an extensive and comprehensive legislative framework.  Since one size does not fit all, we need to have such an agency to assess the individual needs of people in mortgage distress.  In doing so, we will provide professional advice to those in arrears to rebalance the relationship between borrowers and lenders, which is one of the big difficulties facing those in mortgage distress.  We need to make greater use of the MIS because that is required as well.  The criterion to qualify for MIS is unemployment.  The vast majority of people bought houses based on their income three or four years ago but this amount is no longer available to them.  Private and public sector wages have reduced and the income ratio for their mortgage repayments is no longer relevant.  The MIS scheme, therefore, has to be adjusted.The three measures relating to repossession also need to change because we need longer-term solutions.  To do so, the reconstructed MABS or personal debt management agency needs to assess people on an individual basis and, after two years, in order that the problem is not long fingered or kicked down the road, their case should be reassessed and if they can meet two thirds of their repayment, as recommended in the expert group's report, their mortgage should be restructured.If they cannot repay this amount, the State needs to step in to cover the repayments and take equity in the properties.  An unbelievable sum is allocated to the rent supplement scheme.  If people are evicted following repossession of their homes, they will move into another house and claim rent supplement.  It makes more sense to provide them with mortgage interest relief.  However, householders have obligations as well and the minimum requirement for anybody in difficulty should be to pay the rent differential they would have to pay if they were in receipt of rent supplement.  They would still service their loans and have financial obligations to meet but this would be done in a structured fashion.Over time as this programme is rolled out, the State will step in and take equity in properties.  We are a home purchasing nation and we will not change.  We need to provide a facility for those in difficulty to ensure they will not be evicted, that the State will provide assistance and that the householder can redeem the equity the State has taken in their property after a period.  This recession will not last for six months or 12 years but people need a guarantee that they will be protected by the State for a set period and that they will not lose their homes but they should be obligated to redeem the equity the State has taken in them.
#JerryButtimer	unknown-#JerryButtimer-party	unknown-#JerryButtimer-dob	unknown-#JerryButtimer-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-05-04 00:00:00	Prelude	366	This Private Members' motion is about an gnáth dhuine, the ordinary person, in our communities.  In commending the motion, I regret that a solution is nowhere to be found.  All of us can sign up to the narrative of the motion.  Every day, people who are in negative equity or who have lost their jobs and are struggling to pay their mortgages come into our offices while we are also approached by business people who are in trouble.  This is not about speculators and developers who went berserk and lost the run of themselves; this is about ordinary people who are struggling.The motion does not offer a solution and it behoves all of us not only to provide an analysis but, as Deputies Lynch, Matthews and English said, to come up with solutions that will ensure people retain their homes and small and medium enterprises continue to thrive and to create jobs and that we place a value on work and reward entrepreneurs who create jobs.The Government has only been in office for two months but I believe we will experience a radical change because the Minister for Finance has been proactive on this issue.  Opposition Members do not have a monopoly on concern or condemnation but it behoves all of us, to borrow Deputy Martin's phrase, "to end the Punch and Judy show" and come up with solutions to the problems that affect the ordinary person.Last night, the Minister stated:A key objective for government is to strengthen overall fiscal sustainability be separating bank risk from that of the sovereign.  Clearly this can be achieved only by returning the banking system to health.We must return our banks to health in order that they can support and work with entrepreneurs, public servant and home owners and that is why the House recognises that people are under pressure and SMEs are struggling to access credit and are being pursued by banks.A friend of mine runs a small business in Cork.  When I spoke to him yesterday, I told him I would be contributing to this debate tonight.  I received an e-mail from him earlier which stated:The issues as they affect me are....costs are still too high, turnover has receded at a bigger rate than costs such as rent, rates, bank charges, energy costs etc. The legislator needs to force banks (now state owned), energy companies, local authorities and insurance companies to realise that small businesses are the lifeblood of many local towns and the service and employment they provide must be preserved...The credit circle (as I call it) MUST be serviced in order to maintain jobs and keep non cash businesses afloat. This can only be done at the expense of the interests that I have already mentioned. The banks must work with us rather than against us.Those are the words of a business person who employs people and who is generating revenue to get our country moving.I appeal to the Government to go back to the banks to tell them in no uncertain terms that it is not good enough to pay bonuses and to have the former chief executive officer of AIB doing a degree in Trinity College Dublin while ordinary people are struggling.  They must co-operate and work with customers and not frighten them.  The morality exhibited by many senior bank executives leaves a great deal to be desired and I am concerned that this culture has not been cleaned up.  I hope the next time we discuss banking issues, the culture of greed will be no more among executives and they will work in the interests of the people.
#RobertDowds	unknown-#RobertDowds-party	unknown-#RobertDowds-dob	unknown-#RobertDowds-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-05-04 00:00:00	Prelude	367	I welcome the opportunity to address this issue which is causing no end of hardship, stress, worry and anxiety to many thousands of our citizens.  The problems we have are not only in the boardrooms of banks, but also in the living rooms of many ordinary people.  There has not been sufficient focus on this aspect of the crisis we are in.It is a particularly difficult thing to lose one's job and there are no shortage of people in our country who can attest to this.  However, to lose one's house and home is far more serious, more difficult and more disruptive to a family's life.  In Ireland, for historical reasons, there is a particularly deep attachment to the home and this can be witnessed in economic statistics which consistently show that we have high rates of home ownership, higher than almost all other EU states.  For similar historical reasons, the threat of eviction from one's home in Ireland is a deeply disturbing notion.  If home repossessions become widespread in coming years, I shudder to think of the social consequences.  However, I have no doubt that the Government will never allow such a scenario to come to pass.I am delighted the Government parties are committed to helping those in difficulties with mortgages through increasing the relief available through the MIS scheme and widening the availability of crucial help provided by MABS.  I particularly welcome the revised code of conduct for mortgage arrears which came into effect on 1 January this year on foot of the recommendations of the expert group.  It is an important means of helping all residential mortgage holders.I have become aware of several cases of hard pressed constituents who took out what are best described as "sub-prime" loans and who have been harassed by companies engaged in sharp business practice.  For that reason, I welcome the provision that a mortgage arrears resolution process must be initiated by established lenders when dealing with customers in arrears and the obligation on lenders to set up an arrears support unit.  These measures will no doubt save many of our citizens from anxiety and anguish which they would otherwise endure.  The psychological effects must be borne in mind.  They include stress, worry and the sleepless nights which many people are going through.  We must do everything we can to alleviate the anguish.  I appreciate the Government's efforts in that regard.
#DessieEllis	unknown-#DessieEllis-party	unknown-#DessieEllis-dob	unknown-#DessieEllis-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-05-04 00:00:00	Prelude	368	On 1 July 2003, the then Sinn Féin housing spokesperson, Arthur Morgan, issued a statement in response to the figures on house prices and mortgages which at the time were spiralling out of control.  He accused the main lending institutions of fuelling the fires of unacceptable house price increases.  He stated that the main banks, building societies and other lending institutions had a moral and social obligation to curb the excessive and potentially ruinous amounts that were currently being given out in mortgage loans.  He outlined that the ever-spiralling house prices showed that the lending institutions were continuing with a reckless if not criminal policy of providing excessive mortgages, especially to first-time buyers and that it should not be allowed to continue.  The banks, building societies and other lending institutions were giving away mortgages, in some cases of up to five and six times the amount of annual income coming into a home, sometimes more.  We are feeling the effects of that now.At the time, Sinn Féin said that the lending institutions must realise that their drive for profit and greed needed to be tempered by their social and moral obligation not to allow people to borrow beyond their means and that the excessive and potentially ruinous amounts being given away in mortgages must be curbed.  We said all of that in 2003.  Other parties and the media said that we were wrong and that we did not have a clue.  They did not take us seriously.  I take no pleasure in pointing out that we were completely right.  Everything we said when it came to mortgages, about the developers being a law unto themselves, the ridiculously high price of houses and the immoral amounts of money that was lent to people — all came to pass.Everyone acknowledges that something needs to be done about unsustainable mortgages.  The Government would not listen to us in 2003, and it is refusing to listen to us in 2011.  It is all well and good talking about supporting the mortgage interest supplement scheme, but that fails to acknowledge that the mortgage arrears of some people are so severe that in a single lifetime they will never be able to repay what they owe.  A report today from Standard & Poor's indicated that house prices are likely to fall in this country for a few years to come.  The statistics indicate that there are approximately 45,000 mortgage accounts in arrears for more than 90 days.  That amounts to 5.7% of residential mortgages, which is very high given the comparatively high level of home ownership in this State.  The European Central Bank has no problem in increasing interest rates.  Unemployment continues to go up, wages are being cut, yet we must all wait for the penny to drop with the Government while it refers to providing supports to mortgage holders in difficulty by making advice available through MABS.  I accept that MABS does great work but a budgeting service is of no benefit to a person who has no prospect of ever being able to get back on track with his or her mortgage.While the Government fiddles as Rome burns to the ground around us, we in Sinn Féin have come up with proposals that should be adopted to address the problem.  We commend the Technical Group for proposing the motion, which we urge other Deputies to support, but we need concrete proposals to address the issue, not meaningless amendments as proposed by Fianna Fáil and the Minister for Finance which only reiterate policies that clearly are not working.  At least it is clear to the rest of us who take the time to listen to people, as opposed to just seeking direction from the IMF, the absentee landlords of Ireland, on what to do.  As my colleague, Deputy Pearse Doherty, outlined last night, Sinn Féin will launch detailed proposals on tackling mortgage distress in the coming period.  Debt resolution cannot be left waiting.  The Government must begin to take housing policy seriously.Last year, a group of respected economists also urged that the banks introduce some form of debt resolution and that they accept part of the loss as their own.  Given that the State is now effectively running the banking sector, the Government must take proactive measures to force all of the banks and other financial institutions, including the sub-prime lenders who appear to be the most aggressive pursuers of repossessions, to provide real relief for mortgage holders.  One cannot leave people in a situation where, through the reckless lending of the banks who were allowed do whatever they liked, they are left shackled with debt around their necks that they will never be able to pay.Local authorities are just as guilty as the banks when it comes to reckless lending.  People were given loans when there was no way they could afford to pay them.  Now, the Government must also address the unsustainable mortgages held by those who purchased homes in affordable housing schemes and shared ownership schemes and are local authority mortgage holders.  Those who bought in shared ownership schemes generally see their interest rates go up with ECB increases.  The Housing Finance Agency makes decisions on whether increases and decreases are passed on to the mortgage holder.  The last time there was an ECB decrease, it was not passed on to those mortgage holders.  An interest increase was announced days after it emerged that these mortgage holders were six times more likely to be in arrears in comparison to their counterparts who borrowed from banks.  The figures have shown almost one in three people with a local authority housing loan are in arrears.  Approximately 25,000 of those who have an affordable home, tenant purchase or shared ownership loan from their local authority have not paid for three months or more, according to figures compiled by one RTE report.The Government has a bizarre attitude when it comes to housing.  In the Finance Bill it included a provision to attach a €100 stamp duty fee to the purchase of affordable homes.

#DessieEllis	unknown-#DessieEllis-party	unknown-#DessieEllis-dob	unknown-#DessieEllis-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-05-04 00:00:00	Prelude	370	It may well say that it is only €100, but considering how hard some local authorities find it to sell affordable homes, one must ask what exactly is the point of that.  That kind of money-grabbing does the State little, if any, good and only hurts people on low income.There has been much focus on those with distressed mortgages.  However, we must also be mindful that while there is a need to address the issue, the Government must ensure a complete overhaul of housing policy in general.  There are still 5,000 homeless people in this State.  Distressed mortgages are just one symptom of a fundamentally broken housing system in this country.  Long-term homelessness could be ended through the adequate provision of social housing.  There must be a dedicated revenue stream for supported accommodation for the homeless and provision of a reliable annual count of all people in homeless services using counted-in methodology.  Further to that, rent controls, and a tenants' rights charter must be introduced.  Existing tenancy laws must be strengthened and enforced.  The Government must take a rights-based approach to housing policy.  We said that in 2003 while we were talking about the banks being flaithiúlach with the money they lent.  We are still saying it now and urging the Government to listen.Tá ár ndaoine ag fulaingt.  Caithfimid seasamh leis na daoine atá i dtrioblóid agus ar tí a dtithe féin a chailleadh.

#JoeHiggins	unknown-#JoeHiggins-party	unknown-#JoeHiggins-dob	unknown-#JoeHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-05-04 00:00:00	Prelude	373	Deputy Ciarán Lynch referred to the fact that this is a home-purchasing nation.  That is true.  Some commentators in the past have responded to that as if it was something dramatically unusual that should be changed and that working people should put their lives and their need for shelter at the gentle mercies of landlords, which is another class about which we in this country know a lot from our historic memory.  As one who spent 20 years of my life in the hands of landlords, I commend the wisdom of working people who purchased their own homes.  This wisdom was manifested during the craziness of the property bubble when rents charged for quite modest homes in working class areas were equal to the gouging level of mortgages being charged.Deputy Mathews gave us a parable of a good and faithful public servant, prudent, diligent and paying his or her way, who then finished up, as a result of the machinations of the financial markets, hundreds of thousands of euro in negative equity and in an impossible situation.  The Deputy then accused Opposition Deputies of having no solution.  There is a solution, but there is no solution on the basis of the system he supports, which is the financial market system by which unelected, unaccountable, faceless forces in hedge funds and vampire banks etc. have such enormous control over society and the lives of human beings.  We have seen clearly that kind of capitalism is an anarchic system.  It is a casino-like system in which there are no solutions.

#JoeHiggins	unknown-#JoeHiggins-party	unknown-#JoeHiggins-dob	unknown-#JoeHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-05-04 00:00:00	Prelude	375	That is very clear from the Government amendment, which offers no solutions either.  It states more or less that the Government bailed out the banks.  It gave tens of billions of euro to European bankers to pay off their gambling debts and now depends on what is called "lender forbearance".  In other words, the banks should be kind towards the people they have got into such a crisis.  That is supposed to be a solution.  There is no solution on the basis of capitalism.  Unfortunately, the situation will get much worse.  The 60,000 will grow to hundreds of thousands as long-term unemployment takes its toll.What do we need to do?  The solution is that we must refuse to bail out the bondholders and speculators.  We must stop paying those debts.  Then we should take public ownership of the financial system, but in an entirely different way from the type of panic nationalisations we saw for the purpose of bailing out banks, speculators and developers.  We must remake the financial system on the basis of public ownership and the democratic control of society — of working people generally in society — over those institutions.  We must do similarly with our fellow working people on a European basis.  Then we will have a solution and can recalibrate prices downwards to their real value.  We can recalibrate the obscene prices working people were forced to pay and recalibrate monthly mortgages downwards, without question of evictions.  Then we will have a reasonable and sane system based on public ownership of the financial institutions and social good.That is a solution, but we will not get it from a Fine Gael-Labour Party Government, because it bases its solutions on the current market system which is the problem, not the solution.
#JoanCollins	unknown-#JoanCollins-party	unknown-#JoanCollins-dob	unknown-#JoanCollins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-05-04 00:00:00	Prelude	376	I noted from the Minister's contribution yesterday that no mention was made of Fine Gael's election commitments in the programme for Government.  One of the commitments proposed introducing special relief for those who bought homes between 2004 and 2008 within 100 days of taking office.  Measures were also promised to force lenders to reduce variable rates by 0.25% within 100 days.There is nothing new from the Government for people in arrears or in difficulty.  This is another retreat and yet more back-pedalling on the part of the Government.  Will the Government deliver on a single commitment it made within 100 days?  The Minister outlined the supports in place — a mortgage interest scheme, MABS, a mortgage arrears resolution process and a code of conduct for lenders — but there is nothing new in that.  All of these were already in place with the previous Government.  While these measures are welcome, they are insufficient.  Why, for example, does the deferred mortgage interest scheme which was recommended by the expert group only operate on a voluntary basis?  Surely, it should be compulsory for all lenders.Deputy Ellis referred to local authorities.  Currently, local authorities cannot deal with the huge housing waiting lists they have, not to mind dealing with those who are losing their homes.  Access to the 20% affordable housing programme has been cut, despite the fact this was a programme the Government encouraged local authorities to become involved in with developers.  The programme was inadequate anyway.  The Government did not provide funding to local authorities last year in their budgets for house building.  Instead, it provided a second bailout to developers and landlords.It is also scandalous and insane that the State, through NAMA, has purchased some €35 billion worth of property, much of it residential.  Last year, I placed a motion before Dublin City Council calling for NAMA to hand over residential properties to local authorities for affordable and local council housing.  This motion was unanimously supported by Fine Gael and Labour Party councillors.  Such a move is key to supporting people getting access to homes in the future.  We cannot continue to let property sit idle while people desperately need a roof over their heads, but cannot afford to buy into the housing system.I was alarmed by the casino auction that took place last Friday week, at which NAMA sold off residential properties.  NAMA then said it intended to pump money into the banks to try and reinflate the property market again.  That is not the way the country should be going.  We should not try to inflate the economy in that way again.  We should not try to inflate housing and land prices again.  As pointed out by my colleagues, we should be trying to reduce the cost of homes and interest rates for people.  People in the public sector bought houses on the basis of their incomes and the banks handed out excessive mortgages over the years, but those mortgages were based on the incomes people had then.  Now, people's incomes have been slashed and the Government is talking about slashing further and putting its hands in people's pockets for water and property taxes.  People will not be able to survive that.The Government must take charge of the situation, particularly in the banking area.  It must play a role, although as Deputy Higgins stated it may not be able to if his analysis is correct.  The solution will certainly not be on the basis of the Government's economic policies of putting its hands back into people's pockets leaving them with less money to pay their mortgage.
#SeamusHealy	unknown-#SeamusHealy-party	unknown-#SeamusHealy-dob	unknown-#SeamusHealy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-05-04 00:00:00	Prelude	377	I would like to put forward some case histories.  The first relates to a self-employed man with a family living in a modest three-bedroomed house and into the second half of his mortgage.  He was doing well but due to an addition to the family needed a modest four-bedroomed house.  Thinking he could deal with the mortgage on the new house, he went to his bank and looked for a mortgage on the basis of selling his first house.  The bank manager advised he should not do that but should let his house and take out a 100% mortgage for the four-bedroomed house.  Unfortunately, the man took that advice.  Now he is unemployed and unable to pay the mortgage on either house.The second case relates to a single public servant living in Dublin in rented accommodation who applied for an affordable house from the local authority five years in succession.  Eventually, in September 2008, he was offered an affordable apartment at a price of €278,000 — a good price at the time when the same apartments were on the private market for €470,000.  He jumped at the offer and felt he could afford the payments.  However, 12 months later, following two cuts in pay and a pension levy, he found himself in significant negative equity and no longer in a position to meet the mortgage repayments.  That is the kind of situation in which many people find themselves.  The solution is to freeze mortgage interest rates at rates pertaining in 2008 at the time of the bank guarantee, but that is not enough.  The capital debt needs to be reduced to the level of the current house price and householders must be legally protected from eviction.  That would be a fair way to deal with the current situation.Some defenders of the banks and building societies claim that it is the home owners' fault; in other words, the people who took on these mortgages should have known better.  However, we all know that during the boom, kept economic commentators of finance houses repeatedly told us through the media that people needed to get a foot on the property ladder before house prices rose again, that there was no chance of a property crash and there would be a soft landing at worst, and that the banks were well capitalised.  RTE made such broadcasts daily and national newspapers with lucrative property supplements followed suit.  We now have tens of thousands in negative equity with many finding it impossible to meet their mortgage repayments and some increasingly threatened with eviction.The Central Bank is funded by taxpayers including mortgage holders.  Its duty is to ensure prudence in banking.  Top business people, trade union leaders and senior civil servants on its board, who reported to the Minister for Finance, allowed the banks to borrow €90 billion abroad between 2003 and 2007.  They allowed the banks to lend out that money with meaningless security to developers and others creating a property bubble which drove the price of houses skyward.  All the Irish elite are represented on the National Economic and Social Council.  This includes professors of economics from the Economic and Social Research Institute.  The institute is funded by taxpayers to give expert advice to Government but nobody shouted "Stop".Freezing mortgage repayments, while welcome and necessary, will not be enough.  The capital debt must be reduced to the level of the current house price and householders must be legally protected from eviction.  That would be a fair way to deal with the situation.
#TomFleming	unknown-#TomFleming-party	unknown-#TomFleming-dob	unknown-#TomFleming-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-05-04 00:00:00	Prelude	378	The ongoing debate regarding arrears in mortgage repayments, personal loans and utility bills is often trivialised by some commentators who prefer to link the problem to that of over-borrowing.  People who use this very simple yet incomplete argument are not being thorough in their examination of the scale of the problem facing families today.  A number of reports published by both the EU and Council of Europe in recent years attribute the issue of indebtedness to unforeseen events such as unemployment, sickness or changes in family situations.  In fact, in one report, the Council of Europe concluded: "A high level of consumer credit use is not necessarily an indicator of debt problems."In recent years Ireland has experienced a severe income crisis affecting everyone.  Additionally, in recent months, as highlighted in today's Irish Examiner, the issue of repayment capacity is likely to deteriorate for some time to come as a recent spate of cost increases take their toll, including increases in fuel costs, mortgage repayments, insurance costs and inflation in general.  As a society, we have all been asked on successive occasions to reduce our income expectations.  It has been argued that Ireland must again return itself to a state of competitiveness.  I agree with this policy provided it achieves the right result and gets the country back to work.  However, in the meantime, we must accept that reducing all of our wages will have a severe negative impact on some people, especially their capacity to service their debts loans repayments and utility bills.  There is no simple solution to the income crisis and resulting debt crisis facing families, including those in my own constituency of Kerry South.  However, I am confident that we have the right mechanism to alleviate the extreme financial hardship of those most affected.At its annual conference on 16 December 2010, the Law Reform Commission presented its report, Personal Debt Management and Debt Enforcement, in which it argues for the overhaul of the laws that govern debt in Ireland.  The recommendations make sense and represent a breath of fresh air in an area of law that has long been forgotten.  It is shocking that we still operate under laws that were better suited to the Dickensian or Elizabethan era when it comes to dealing with debt in our society.  How can we ask people to accept lower wages and yet not change the law to address their diminished capacity to service their debts?  We need to act on the Law Reform Commission proposals immediately.  This House has a duty to act on those recommendations.  Our families will thank us for doing so and society will benefit enormously.Instead of toiling with the more limited matter of mortgages, I urge the House to address the real issues facing our society today.  We do not need ad hoc solutions to deal with negative equity.  We need a radical reform of our debt laws and the Law Reform Commission recommendations largely give us the means and the mechanism for doing this.  Instead of leaving the matter to the courts and the media, it is the responsibility of this House to legislate and deal with this important issue once and for all.I also wish to highlight the work of the expert group on mortgage arrears, which came about through consensus between a number of Departments and representatives of interested outside parties.  Apart from changes to the code of conduct on mortgage arrears, not a single recommendation has yet been implemented including relatively straightforward procedures such as reform of the mortgage interest supplement scheme.I call on the Government to finally act on the Law Reform Commission proposals and to enact them into law.  Almost six months ago, the Law Reform Commission published its recommendations and yet it continues to sit and wait for action.  Instead of providing the means for hope, it gathers dust as our society bends under the burden of rising costs and falling incomes.  I welcome what Deputy Ciarán Lynch said on the Government initiatives on the two-year moratorium on repossessions and the proposed personal debt management agency.  I also welcome what the Government is trying to do on the income supplement.Today's Irish Examiner reports that 115,000 gas customers are now in arrears on their utility bills.  Inflation is again taking hold with petrol and insurance costs rising rapidly.  Increased taxation, levies and fees are placing a growing strain on family incomes.  We are in the midst of an income crisis and not just a debt crisis.  Families who are most affected need the laws to protect them.  We must act immediately.  The Law Reform Commission recommendations give us in this House the means to act and we cannot delay.A revised code of conduct on mortgage arrears, which came into effect on 1 January, enhances the protection afforded to those in arrears or pre-arrears.  It is most important that borrowers engage early with their lenders to benefit from the protection afforded under this revised code.  The Government and the Central Bank should give extensive media coverage to this code and we should act immediately.
#JohnHalligan	unknown-#JohnHalligan-party	unknown-#JohnHalligan-dob	unknown-#JohnHalligan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-05-04 00:00:00	Prelude	379	Deputy Ciarán Lynch recognised that at least this motion is a valuable one, which is in contrast to his few colleagues who bothered to speak on this worthwhile and compassionate debate addressing the issue of thousands of our citizens losing their homes and finding themselves in distress and despair.  I refer to the trauma that has been and is still being inflicted upon many of our citizens, beaten and bludgeoned by the antics of uncaring lending institutions and the previous uncaring Fianna Fáil-Green Party Government.Deputy Buttimer spoke about bringing the banking system back to health.  Last night we had a debate on suicide and the Government should listen to what institutions are saying about recession depression and the number of people being driven to suicide because of the antics of the lending institutions.It is not the banks that need to be brought back to health but the ordinary, everyday working people who are affected by what the banks have done.  Many of those losing their homes who have mounting debts and are suffering from depression are looking to this Parliament for hope.  However, I do not see much hope in the document presented to us last night by the Government.We are looking for alternatives.  In this regard, we need to force banks to renegotiate.  This would stop the evictions.  Since we now control the banks, why can we not force them to renegotiate?  If one runs into debt with a city council or credit union, one can renegotiate one's loan to reflect the money one is earning.  This is what we must force the banks to do.The so-called moratorium will not work because the banks are ruthless.  They are still lying to us about payments they made to some of their staff.  Banks are already forcing people to give up their homes voluntarily.  When I was in Waterford last week, I met a girl who did shift work in a big company in Waterford, Bausch and Lomb.  She finished her shift at 8 p.m., at which time I met her with her father.  She had a letter from her bank — one's bitter enemy would not send it to one — because she was in arrears by €1,200.  The bank more or less told her she could lose her home and be mentioned in debt magazines.  This is what the banks are doing this week and will continue to do.  Does the Government think it can stop them by asking them for a moratorium for two years?Let me refer to the document presented to us last night by the Minister.  It states lenders are required to set up an arrears support unit to assess arrears and pre-arrears cases.  The support unit will involve the same individuals in the banks who are putting people out on the streets after having taken their houses from them.  Does the Government not realise this?  The document also states that if a borrower agrees an alternative payment arrangement for his or her mortgage with his or her lender and continues to meet the revised payments, the lender cannot start legal action against him or her or seek repossession.  That is not forcing the banks to do anything because the ones who will be calling mortgage-holders to make the new arrangements are the same people with whom the mortgage-holders have dealt heretofore.  The banks have been doing this for the past five years and are making no agreements; they are just forcing people out of their houses.With regard to local authorities, the document states people losing their homes can remain in their property until appropriate alternative accommodation is found.  Is the Government out of touch with reality?  Does it not understand 60,000 people are on local authority housing waiting lists?  A couple who lose their home in Waterford could have to wait three or four years for a house.  Will the Government state to those affected that they should stay in their houses which will not be taken from them at all?  It should at least be honest about the matter.  It should not put the onus on local authorities to rehouse people because they will not be able to do it.  There are not enough houses being built and there are too many on the housing lists.We must receive a commitment from the banks that they will renegotiate loans and, as my colleague stated, retrospectively revalue the houses valued during the boom, thus lowering mortgage values.  Nothing else will work for those who do not have sufficient funds.  We must instruct the banks to renegotiate loans; that is what will keep people in their houses.
#RichardBoydBarrett	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-party	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-dob	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-05-04 00:00:00	Prelude	380	The essential and big question everybody in the country is asking is, "Where is the bailout for the people?"  There is a bailout for the bankers to the tune of over €100 billion but ordinary people who sought to do nothing more than put a roof over their heads — an entirely legitimate aspiration — are threatened with losing their homes and battered with unsustainable interest payments on inflated mortgages.  The mortgages were inflated because of the reckless lending of the bankers and the reckless greed driven policies of Fianna Fáil, the EU authorities which did nothing to address what the bankers were doing, the developers, etc.As with every problem we are facing, it is not those who are guilty and caused the crisis who are being asked to pay but those who are innocent, had nothing to do with causing it, cannot afford to pay and struggling to make ends meet.  There is no bailout for them, nor is there a State guarantee or guaranteed protection, yet there are guarantees, bailouts and State protections to the nth degree for the bankers and institutions which caused the crisis.  They stoked and pumped up the unsustainable bubble for no reason other than greed.  If one is greedy, one's greed is insatiable and one is willing to do the most reckless things, one will be bailed out and protected.  If, however, one is somebody who just wants to put a roof over one's head, tough luck.  All the State will do is ask the institutions which caused the crisis to offer some forbearance and, at best, a little breathing space.  However, as Deputy John Halligan stated, the banks actually keep threatening people and putting the pressure on them.I am sorry the Minister is not present.  The essence of this issue is summed up in the Orwellian doublethink of the Minister's speech thereon: "A key objective for the Government is to strengthen overall fiscal sustainability [of the State] by separating bank risk from sovereign risk."  We are doing the exact opposite.  The Government is welding the private gambling debts of the banks onto the backs of citizens of the State.  It is what the last Government did and the Government is stating it will continue to do.  As a consequence, people will lose their homes and are being screwed to the walls with debts they cannot afford to pay through no fault of their own.  The Government will not issue the same guarantee it is giving to the banks to ordinary people who are fighting to keep a roof over their heads and make ends meet.  In the process, the Government is crippling the economy because even those who can just about meet their mortgage repayments have no spending power left to fuel economic growth and meet the required domestic demand.What is the alternative?  The Government states there is none.  The first alternative is to determine the principles that will guide our actions.  The principle that must guide our actions is that the people, the innocent, should come first.  Their right to a home should come before the right of the banks to be recapitalised, make profit and protect themselves, given that it is the banks which caused the problem.  Let us not forget that those who are being threatened with having their homes taken from them and cannot meet interest repayments are the very people who have bailed out the banks.  This is because of levies and pay cuts.  The least we can ask for, given all the money that has been put into the banks and that the people now constitute the majority shareholder in the banks, is that the banks do not take people's homes from them and write down debts to levels that reflect the real values of properties during the bubble that was stoked up by the bankers and developers.  In this way, debts could become sustainable and people could pay back their loans.  Ultimately, it would save money for the State.It is a loss-making exercise for banks to have to foreclose on loans and sell off homes at rock bottom prices, as they are doing.  It is madness.  Will the Government, please, do something about this and bring to an end the circumstances where it only bails out banks rather than ordinary people?
#AlanKelly	unknown-#AlanKelly-party	unknown-#AlanKelly-dob	unknown-#AlanKelly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-05-04 00:00:00	Prelude	381	It is clear from the statements made so far that there is much in common between the concerns expressed by Members of the Technical Group about the plight of ordinary homeowners facing the challenges of making ends meet and honouring their mortgage commitments in the current economic climate and the sentiments expressed in the programme for Government on this issue.  Nevertheless, I will refer to some key issues raised by the Deputies in the course of the debate to ensure the House understands the constraints and challenges facing the Government in addressing these issues.It is important to keep a perspective on the extent of the impact of the issues raised in the debate, as solutions come with a cost at a time when the Government is committed to major reductions in public spending and when tax revenues are down.  In that context, I note that Deputy Pringle is forecasting that wholesale repossessions are about to happen.  The Government shares his concern, particularly for individuals unable to meet their mortgage repayments and who are facing possible repossession of their home.  However, repossessions remain low and both the overall statistics and anecdotal material from some of the banks indicate that a significant number of those who fall into arrears manage to rectify the situation.  In short, the system we now have is working reasonably well.It is worth noting that repossession orders granted by the courts do not necessarily lead to homes being repossessed.  When a repossession order is granted, homeowners can still work with their lenders in exploring alternative repayment measures, such as those outlined in the code of conduct on mortgage arrears, CCMA.  Mainstream lenders, and particularly those benefiting from the State guarantee, have been very reluctant to take the route of enforcing repossession.  The total figure for legal repossession of owner occupied homes by institutions covered by the Government guarantee for 2010 was 50, which is extremely low when compared to the UK and other jurisdictions.  While I accept it may well be 50 too many, it is a fact that repossessions even happen in good times.  It is also important to note that many repossessions involve mortgages taken out with the so-called sub-prime lenders, whose market consists mainly of borrowers in the higher risk category, many of whom would have been turned down for loans by the main lending institutions.It is easy to understand why, for many, the solution to relieving homeowners is some form of debt forgiveness, particularly for those, including myself, who bought family homes during the 2004 to 2007 period.  There are arguments in support of such proposals, such as those presented by Deputies last night in the House.  Such arguments point to the inequity of the burden placed on the taxpayer in bailing out the banks, the institutions which promoted loans with high loan to value ratios and approved mortgages beyond the limits of normal prudential guidelines at a time when house prices were clearly over-inflated.  However, we must be clear that any form of debt forgiveness, whether in the form of a downward revaluation of homes and consequent reduction in mortgage for the home owners, as suggested by Deputy Daly, or a write-off of a portion of the mortgage by the lender, imposes costs on the economy and the taxpayer in an era of necessary cutbacks in public spending and when the sovereign debt is under daily scrutiny by the international markets.  To put it simply — if we forgive debt, somebody must pay for it.On the issue of mortgage interest supplement, Deputy Ó Cuív raised a valid point about the need for careful targeting of home owners most in need of financial assistance from the State and the role of the mortgage interest supplement scheme in addressing this need.  This scheme allows individuals to be paid a mortgage interest supplement on a discretionary basis where the amount of mortgage interest payable by the claimant is in excess of the amount that is considered to be reasonable to meet their residential needs.  At the end of April 2011, there are 18,569 persons currently in receipt of mortgage interest supplement.Deputy Daly and other Members referred to the need for the Government to intervene as the major shareholder in the guaranteed banks to prevent them from raising the variable interest rates, which are a source of further pressure on already hard-pressed mortgage borrowers.  The Deputy will appreciate that it is important a balance is achieved by the Government between influencing the banks through the bank guarantee scheme and other financial support incentives, while at the same time being seen to have a hands-off approach to the daily running of these institutions, which must operate on a strictly commercial basis.  Ireland had very low mortgage rates in recent times, but it is clear that this is coming to an end for both owner-occupier and commercial mortgage holders.The Government is very aware of the difficulties facing some home owners and shares many of the concerns expressed in the motion by the Members of the Technical Group.  Indeed, it is a welcome and constructive motion.  It is very important that this nation gets things right and is seen to follow sensible courses of action.  Through the proposal contained in the programme for Government along with implementation of recommendations in the final report by the Cooney group, including the mortgage interest supplement and other measures, the Government is taking the appropriate courses of action to provide effective support to home owners who find themselves in difficulty.  While I have great sympathy with many of the arguments put forward by Members towards helping people who are under pressure, the situation in which we find ourselves is such that in trying to help those people, we could well end up punishing the taxpayer and, believe me, the taxpayer has had enough.The debate about how we get people other than taxpayers to pay for our banking debt is one that will ultimately be resolved at European level.  This Government is working tirelessly on a diplomatic level to generate political support in Europe for a more positive solution to the bank debt that does not disadvantage the taxpayer.
#LukeMingFlanagan	unknown-#LukeMingFlanagan-party	unknown-#LukeMingFlanagan-dob	unknown-#LukeMingFlanagan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-05-04 00:00:00	Prelude	382	I commend Deputy Pringle on putting this motion before the House.  I expected it to receive more support because after canvassing my constituency I believed there was a problem.  However, according to the Government speakers yesterday, it is only a minor problem.  What harm is it if one ends up in court and one's house is not taken?  One is standing in the court with one's children, in front of reporters from one's local newspaper and potentially going to lose one's house, but the attitude is that one might not lose it and it is not that bad after all.  If one loses one's house, it will be hell and if one must worry about losing one's house, it will also be hell.  It will slow the person down, make them less beneficial to society and will do nobody any good.  It will cause more rows and stress in the home and more psychological problems, but the reaction is: "What harm is it when some might not actually lose the house?  They will only be dragged through the courts."I often said in the last few weeks that I could not understand who is and is not a socialist, but at this stage I know who is not a socialist.  The Members on the other side of the House are not socialist.  One does not talk about there being some type of moral hazard in an individual defaulting on their debt while simultaneously believing there is no problem with a bank offering money to people it knows could never repay it if anything went wrong.  Deputy Wallace gave an interesting insight last night into the potential percentage of people who might have to default on their mortgages.  We cannot be sure this will be the case but it is an interesting indicator.The Irish League of Credit Unions, however, gave a more interesting and strong hint of what is coming down the line.  It said that 21% of people in this country, or 735,000, have €70 per month after they pay for everything.  Will they be all right in the next couple of years after they pay the new water charges that will be introduced and the new housing tax to be imposed on us by our friends in Europe and the IMF?  Our friends in Europe are also talking about increasing interest rates by 1% or, in their language, 100 basis points.  That is only another €1,000 gone from one's income.  If one lives in a rural area, there will be a septic tank tax which, presumably, will not be a problem.  One will be able to pay that, as well as the insurance levy.The Tuam Herald today reports that a new EU directive is due to be introduced, which we will swallow hook, line and sinker because the EU runs this country.  Apparently, the EU will force farmers to pay the same rate of tax on agricultural diesel as is paid on motoring diesel.  This means they will have even less money.  Yet, with all this and, perhaps, many other things we do not yet know about coming down the line, the Government is saying it will not be a problem.As somebody who got a small mortgage to buy a relatively small house, part of me is uncomfortable with the fact that I might be paying for somebody who bought a big house.  Perhaps they should have been smarter and not done that.  The reality, however, is that we do not have a choice.  We either deal with it now or later when, like the banking debt, it will fall on us like a tonne of bricks.  We will have to deal with it one way or the other.I heard somebody say yesterday that it would require further recapitalisation.  I understood a stress test had been carried out on the banks.  One does not need to be a mathematical genius to understand that if one is carrying out a stress test on the banks, one should take account of the fact that people might default on their mortgages.  In fact, it is almost definite that the latter will happen.  Therefore, in stress testing the banks, one should include recapitalising them in respect of the potential losses to which I refer.  Obviously, however, the Government did not believe that this was going to happen or that it was a worst case scenario.When one considers the Government amendment to the motion, it becomes clear who, along with the EU, is running the country.  It is being run by civil servants.  I am convinced that the individual who drafted the amendment is the same one who used to draft amendments for the previous Minister for Finance.  Apparently, the difficulties in which we find ourselves are not the fault of Fianna Fáil or the previous Government of which it was a part.  Our problems are due, it seems, to the worldwide financial crisis.  It did not take those opposite long to turn into the same beasts — and they were beasts — as those who served in government before them.  They should be ashamed of themselves.
#CatherineMurphy	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-party	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-dob	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-05-04 00:00:00	Prelude	383	This motion was intended to place on the agenda a very serious issue with which many thousands of households and those in the wider community are faced.  A generational issue arises in respect of this matter.  Those who purchased at the top of the housing bubble have tended to be those in their mid-20s to mid-30s who were beginning to have families.  It is they who are most in crisis.  They are also seeking to cope with the consequences of huge personal debts in addition to their mortgage debts, and they are often trapped in inappropriate accommodation such as small apartments.  Accommodation of this type might have been fine for individuals or couples.  When babies arrive, however,  as they have done in abundance in recent years, accommodation such as that to which I refer is inappropriate.  It is also impossible for those in negative equity to get out of this type of accommodation.  In conjunction with all this, we must deal with the problem of unfinished and ghost housing estates.Entire housing estates and communities are struggling with the impact of the current crisis.  It has too often been necessary for communities to put in place social supports in their areas.  The mighty markets are not prepared to invest in such areas.  There is a social cost to this problem which has not yet been calculated.  For example, the matching funds for our so-called free education system will be impossible to deliver in areas where there is a concentration of mortgage debt and where there is no possibility of movement as a result of negative equity.  Gone will be the ability to raise funds, run sporting clubs and other community organisations.  Unfortunately, this is all very predictable.The Law Reform Commission's report on personal debt management estimated a ratio of household debt to disposable income of 48% in 1995.  This reached 176% in 2009.  In the current economic climate, with almost 500,000 people unemployed and at a time when there are continual income shocks, the level of personal debt is simply not sustainable.  In the section of its report on debt enforcement, the commission argues that a more holistic approach must be taken, with a minimum threshold of disposable income retained to sustain individuals and their dependants.The commission is also seeking a debt management system to operate outside the courts system.  Will its recommendation in this regard be implemented?  If it is implemented, how quickly will this be done?  If it is not forthcoming in the immediate future, the courts system will become clogged up as a result, as Deputy Luke ‘Ming' Flanagan stated, of people being dragged through them.It appears the only recommendations that have been introduced are at lender level.  There is much to be done in the context of introducing new laws and ramping up the powers of the relevant agencies in order that we might have an adequate system which will give people a degree of certainty.  It is interesting to note that when a person robs a bank or when a bank robs a nation, the legal bill falls to the taxpayer.  When an individual faces proceedings which do not include imprisonment, however, there is no legal aid available to them.  Will the Law Reform Commission's recommendation in this regard be implemented?  If it is, will serious resources be invested in the free legal aid scheme?  The position with regard to the money advice and budgeting service, MABS, is similar.  There are recommendations that this should either be ramped up or transformed into a debt agency.  When is that going to happen?  Will MABS have the resources necessary to allow it to deal with the problem?From the Central Bank's analysis, it appears that 45,000 mortgages have been rescheduled and that there is an overlap between these and the mortgages which are in arrears.  The Central Bank estimates, therefore, that some 70,000 mortgages are either in arrears or have been rescheduled.  The Cooney report into mortgage debt recommended a more equitable approach in respect of the mortgage interest supplement.  We are all aware that there is a poverty trap in this area because if one person in the household is unemployed, then the supplement is not payable.In the case of the deferred interest scheme, the real question will arise where a mortgage is deemed to be unsustainable and where a housing need still exists.  The Cooney report states that in such cases the occupant should be eligible for a housing assessment.  There is no point in carrying out such an assessment when there are no houses to be delivered.  We are all aware of the position with regard to local authority housing lists.  A large additional workload is going to be placed on local authorities without the provision of extra resources, even at administrative level.  The sourcing of new houses under the rental accommodation scheme is hugely time consuming.  The Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government must indicate how it is intended to deal with this matter.We will be obliged to pay the cost for all of this because if people are evicted, they will have to be rehoused by the State because they will not be in a position to obtain new mortgages.  Essentially, all we are doing is kicking the can down the road.  Debt forgiveness is the only solution that will be available to some households.  That is the challenge we must face up to.
#ShaneRoss	unknown-#ShaneRoss-party	unknown-#ShaneRoss-dob	unknown-#ShaneRoss-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-05-04 00:00:00	Prelude	384	I was deeply disappointed by the Minister's contribution.  It appears that in respect of this problem all the Government has to offer is concern and sympathy.  That really is not good enough for those who are affected by negative equity and by the extraordinary debts they have incurred as a result of the mortgages they took on.  If the Minister is not taking the figures seriously, then he should begin to do so.  As Deputy Boyd Barrett stated, the scale of this problem symbolises what the banks have done to this country.Is the Minister aware that the ESRI has indicated that by the end of this year some 200,000 households will be in negative equity?  There are at least 40,000 people who are already in arrears on their mortgage repayments.  The average person in negative equity owes almost €40,000 on his or her house at this stage.  With property prices continuing to fall, the problem is going to become greater.A previous speaker referred to the knock-on effects of mortgage debt.  People in negative equity do not spend money, rather they save it because they feel insecure.  The knock-on effect of this on consumer spending is enormous.  This is a monumental problem which the Government has failed to recognise.  The amendment it has tabled is a kind of sticking plaster affair that refers to mortgage schemes and the provision of a few subsidies here and a few supplements there.  What the Government envisages will not resolve the problem of the massive number of people who are trapped in their homes as a result of negative equity.  These individuals cannot move upwards or downwards on the property ladder and the entire market freezes as a result.What are we going to do about mortgage debt?  There are those who have stated that we, the proposers of this motion, have not put forward any solutions.  I suggest that we are thinking exactly the wrong way about what is happening.  Why do we not adopt the mantra that the lender must take at least equal responsibility in respect of mortgages as that taken by borrowers?  It is as simple as that.  If one says that the bank, building society or institution which is lending the money has a responsibility, all one is doing is extending the thinking that has been applied to those overseas who lent money to Anglo Irish Bank and stating that the lender has a responsibility in this regard because the lender has been lending recklessly.  If one accepts that the banks have responsibility in this regard, one must then state that this responsibility must be shared.  How can it be shared?I do not know if the Minister has ever considered the idea of a debt for equity swap between the bankers and the lenders.  This concept has been extended in the corporate world.  It has also been suggested in respect of the foreign banks, Anglo Irish Bank, AIB and Bank of Ireland.  It is a simple idea which involves the swapping of debt for equity.  What happens is that instead of not receiving any payments because the borrower is not in a position to repay, the bank which lends the money receives equity.  In this way, the bank must accept responsibility for the decision it took when it lent the money in the first instance.  Such a bank would have taken a decision to lend on a security which is devaluing.  At present, banks are not facing any risks and enjoy all the legal protections one could possibly envisage.  In other words, the lenders are taking no risk and the borrowers are taking all of it.

#ShaneRoss	unknown-#ShaneRoss-party	unknown-#ShaneRoss-dob	unknown-#ShaneRoss-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-05-04 00:00:00	Prelude	386	Thank you.  Why not enforce a system whereby the bankers who lent the money have to accept that they also have a stake in the equity, and if they overlent, they take equity instead of debt?  If the equity is worth less, then that is their problem.  They made a bad decision as well, and the borrower has suffered enough.  Why not also look at the possibility whereby a borrower who cannot pay the money back can hand the keys over to the bank and call it quits?  The borrower must accept that he no longer has an equity interest in the house because he cannot pay back the bank, but the bank then has the keys and it has the responsibility.  The borrower can then walk away, having suffered for making a bad decision, but also sharing that particular problem with the bank, which will also take a hit.  At the moment, it is all one way for some reason.I am asking the Government not to offer us a list of sticking plaster solutions that will not actually tackle the problem at all.  I am asking the Government to look at this in a way that will tackle it fundamentally because the scale of the problem demands it.  I commend my colleagues for putting down this motion and for putting it on the agenda.  I am utterly dispirited by the fact that the Government is offering sympathy, cups of tea and concern, but no radical thinking on a problem that will haunt us for years to come.

#JimDaly	unknown-#JimDaly-party	unknown-#JimDaly-dob	unknown-#JimDaly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-05-04 00:00:00	Prelude	388	I wish to bring to the attention of the Minister the current situation that borrowers of term mortgages in the commercial sector are experiencing if they have some temporary difficulty in making the scheduled repayments set out when they originally availed of the facility.  I have been made aware of a number of cases.  The Minister will appreciate it is sensitive information and I will not disclose the specifics at this stage.I am informed that the financial institutions concerned have no difficulty in converting capital and interest-type repayments to interest-only type but they are demanding large increases in the interest rate on the entire sum borrowed.  To add further insult to injury, the by now almost fully State-owned banks are not only taking advantage of small businesses that are struggling to meet repayments in the challenging economic climate but are essentially defrauding the customers by charging the increased rate of interest on the entire sum of moneys borrowed and not on the amount of capital in question during the proposed capital repayment holiday of 12 to 24 months.I believe that any person who is making a real effort and fighting to allow his or her business to survive over the next few years must receive a level of co-operation from his or her banks when the pressure is on him or her to make scheduled repayments that were agreed and negotiated in an entirely different economic environment.This House will also recognise that every business person who is making a genuine effort is aware of the reckless lending that went on between banks and the borrowers, with some banks lending up to €2 billion to individuals to speculate on the property market.  These same business people will also be aware that the institutions which carried out this type of reckless lending will most likely never see the return of either capital or interest on these larger accounts.  Instead the Irish taxpayers, including every business person in the State and many more, will foot the bill for years to come.To consider the subject of interest-only repayments on borrowings in general, I cannot see what difficulty the banks would have with any customers who are making a genuine effort and are in good communication with their bank to convert to interest-only repayments in the short term.  After all, there is absolutely no loss of revenue to the bank.  The only revenue the institution concerned will make from a particular account is the interest element of that account so, in essence, by deferring some of the capital for a prolonged period the bank will earn more interest on that account than it would by sticking to the original agreement.At present, many people are so worried they cannot sleep at night, they cannot enjoy family life at home, and they cannot concentrate on making their business the success it used to be because the banks are their biggest nightmare and fear.  I am aware that in many cases, computer-generated letters are the first thing to reach borrowers who find themselves in difficulty, which can be very intimidating and distracting to borrowers, even making them afraid of doing the right thing, which is to communicate with the bank.  The banks need to review their methods of handling these situations and I firmly believe the House should have a role in introducing such legislation.I respectfully ask the Minister to take on board my request to review the manner in which the two pillar banks in the State deal with persons requiring a move to interest-only payments for a period of time to allow for the drastic changes in economic circumstances which have befallen so many business people throughout the State.  I do not accept that raising the interest rate for the duration of the holiday in capital repayments is just, moral or helpful in these times when we are all trying to reignite the engine of our economy.  At a time when we as legislators proposed to ban upward-only rent reviews in the property sector, perhaps it is time the House also considered similar action to prevent the two State pillar banks from upward-only interest reviews for struggling businesses throughout Ireland.
#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-05-04 00:00:00	Prelude	389	I thank Deputy Daly for his contribution.  One of the difficulties in replying to the Adjournment debate is that one works from a prepared script and I had no previous sight of the Deputy's views.  I will read out what I have and then comment on what he stated.The Deputy will appreciate that a balance must be achieved by the Government between influencing the banks through the bank guarantee scheme and other financial support incentives, while at the same time staying out of the day to day running of these institutions.  Banks must operate on a commercial basis.  In recent years, Ireland had very low mortgage rates but now it is clear this era is coming to an end for both owner-occupiers and commercial mortgage holders.The decisions financial institutions operating in Ireland make on the mortgage interest rates they charge to customers are commercial decisions for the institutions concerned.  The Department of Finance has no direct function in an individual institution's decision on the matter.  I understand the public anger when a financial institution increases its variable mortgage interest rates.  Unfortunately these increases reflect market realities, including the cost of accessing funds.As described by the Financial Regulator, Mr. Matthew Elderfield, when he appeared before the Joint Committee on Economic and Regulatory Affairs last year, part of the reason for low mortgage interest rates was that the banks' business models were fundamentally flawed.  They were chasing unsustainable profits through risky property and development lending.  These profits effectively subsidised aggressive campaigns for mortgage market share and unsustainably low interest rates.  This business model is now being fundamentally recalibrated.  Banks' costs of funding are significantly higher.  Interest rate increases for borrowers are an unfortunate but inevitable consequence of these factors.The State has a duty in this area to prioritise its efforts and resources to assist owner-occupier mortgage holders.  Unfortunately the financial crisis has created conditions in which many home owners, through no fault of their own, now find themselves in arrears with their mortgage repayments and at risk of losing their homes.  Through its agencies, the State is assisting mortgage holders in arrears in a measured and proportionate manner.  I set out below some details of this assistance.The mortgage interest supplement scheme, managed by the Department of Social Protection, provides assistance where the mortgage relates to a person's principal private residence.  It supports approximately 18,500 mortgage holders.  The Money Advice and Budgeting Service, MABS, provides a national, free, confidential and independent service operating from 53 offices nationwide.  I understand that MABS devotes a substantial amount of its resources to dealing with client mortgage difficulties.The report of the expert group on mortgage arrears and personal debt also made a series of recommendations designed to help as many people as possible save the family home.  Many of these recommendations were implemented through the revised Central Bank code of conduct on mortgage arrears while the deferred interest scheme, or a variation of it, proposed by the expert group will be adopted in 2011 by lenders representing the majority of the market.One of the main recommendations of the expert group was that a deferred interest scheme should be put in place.  This was intended to allow borrowers, subject to certain criteria being satisfied, to pay at least 66% of their mortgage interest, but less than 100%.  Payment of the balance may be deferred for up to five years.  Mortgage lenders have been requested to commit to the scheme.  Lenders representing the majority of the market have already indicated their willingness to implement the expert group's proposals for a deferred interest scheme or a variation of it, including AIB, AIB Mortgage Bank, Bank of Ireland, ICS Building Society, EBS, Haven Mortgages, Permanent TSB and Irish Nationwide Building Society.Much of the material I am reading was already put on the record in response to the Private Members' debate.  I listened carefully to Deputy Daly and I do not think my reply meets the case he made.  If he provides me with a copy of his script I will raise it with the appropriate authorities to see whether something can be done.  He spoke about commercial mortgages which are moving to an interest-only repayment scheme where the lending institution is doubling the interest rate and the extra tranche is being justified because capital repayments are not being made.  This is a particular area that needs examination.As I stated at the beginning, it is difficult to reply to an Adjournment debate in realistic terms because one does not know the case that will be made when the script is being drafted.  I was very interested in what the Deputy stated and if he provides me with a copy of his script I will ensure the regulatory authorities get sight of it and see whether something can be done.

Changing the pupil-teacher ratio would be a problem in itself, but by applying it retrospectively Gaelscoil Inse Chór and 30 other gaelscoileanna will lose a teacher this year.  In all sense of justice and fair play I urge the Minister to row back on this decision for this year at least.In September last year, gaelscoileanna like all other primary schools applied the rules as they stood.  In most cases, they prevented children entering the school because they had reached the quota and did not want to overcrowd the classes.  In the case of Gaelscoil Inse Chóir, it achieved what it thought was the required number to have a staff of nine teachers when the school term started.  However, lo and behold in February it was told the criteria had been changed retrospectively.  At that stage, children could not be enrolled because they had already enrolled elsewhere.  If that were allowed by the Department it would address the problem.Many of the children in Gaelscoil Inse Chór come from disadvantaged areas and it has been quite successful in promoting the Irish language in difficult circumstances. Tá líon beag páistí ag freastal ar an scoil agus tá siad tar éis iarracht a dhéanamh le tamall de bhlianta anuas cur leis an líon páistí.  In ainneoin ciorraithe i mbuiséad na scoile agus scoileanna eile, déanadh iarracht mhór cur leis an scoil.Le déanaí, in ainneoin gach rud a dúramar faoin Roinn Oideachais agus Scileanna, tá foirgneamh nua tógtha le ceithre seomra ranga nua.  Osclófar roimh dheireadh na míosa seo é, ach ní úsáidfear ceann des na ranganna nua sin toisc nach bhfuil muinteoir uimhir a naoi á maoiniú, toisc an t-athrú a tharla i mbliana.Bhí deis ag an Aire tarraingt siar ón chinneadh a rinne an Rialtas a chuaigh thart.  Ní shábhálfaidh an cinneadh an oiread sin airgid, ach cuirfeadh sé leis an ualach ar pháistí atá ag freastail ar ghaelscoileanna, ach go háirithe, an Ghaeilge agus na hábhair atá á mhúineadh tré Ghaeilge a fhoghlaim in atmasféar ina bhfuil Béarla, don chuid is mó, lasmuigh den seomra ranga.Tá ualach níos troime ar pháistí agus ar mhúinteoirí na nGaelscoileanna.  Tugadh aitheantas thar na blianta don ualach sin agus dos na difríochtai sin.  Sin an fáth go mbíodh an cóimheas idir mic léinn agus múinteoirí difriúil i nGaelscoileanna thar scoileanna eile.  Dá mbeadh an cinneadh ag teacht i bhfeidhm an bhliain seo chugainn agus a fhios ag na scoileanna faoi, roimh Mhí Meán Fhómhair bheadh loighic éigin ann, in ainneoin go mbeinn i gcoinne an chinnidh.  Ach tá sé go huile is go hiomlán mícheart na rialacha a athrú leath-shlí tríd an bhliain.Impím ar an Aire athrú a dhéanamh ag an staid seo, le gur féidir leis an scoil, agus leis na scoileanna eile atá ins an riocht céanna, pleanáil cheart a dhéanamh don bhliain seo chugainn ionas nach mbeidh daltaí óga measctha istigh i ranganna atá ró-mhór agus le daltaí atá ar leibhéil difriúla.Má tá an Rialtas ag triail teacht ar airgead, tá fliúrse airgid ar fáil sa cheantar, de réir cosúlachta.  Tá a fhios seo agam mar tá páiste de mo chuid féin ag freastal ar Ghaelscoil Inse Chór.  Le cúpla lá anuas, tá an OPW tar éis na mílte euro a chaitheamh ar fhéar a chur síos le go mheidh sé ann do bhanríon Shasana nuair a thiocfaidh sí.Hundreds of square metres of grass have been rolled out in the avenue leading up to the school simply to welcome the British queen.  The OPW seems to have no problem with finding money and perhaps if it has the funds to spare it can help the Department of Education and Skills to employ an additional teacher at the school next year.  There will be no problem in future years because the school has a waiting list every year and it would have addressed the issue if it was given a fair opportunity to do so and if the new rule had not been applied retrospectively.

D'iarr mé ar an Roinn script Ghaeilge a ullmhú ach i mBéarla atá sé.Tá sé an-thábhachtach go bhfuil an cheist seo á plé agus molaim an Teachta as ucht an rud a dúirt sé.  Beidh mé ag caint leis an Aire faoin méid a dúirt an Teachta agus neosfaidh mé dó na pointí nua nach raibh ar eolas agam go dtí seo ach go háirithe.I ndiaidh bhuiséid 2011, tháinig athrú, ins na Gaelscoileanna ach go háirithe.  Ó shin, tá an cóimheas idir daltaí agus múinteoirí cothrom, cuma más Gaelscoil nó scoil nach Gaelscoil atá ann.  Tiocfaidh an riail seo i bhfeidhm ag tús na bliana acadúla seo chugainn, i Meán Fómhair 2011.  Beidh líon na múinteoirí i nGaelscoil Inse Chór maraon le líon na múinteoirí i scoil nach Gaelscoil í.  An fáth go bhfuil sé seo ag titim amach ná go bhfuil cúrsaí airgeadais go práinneach ar fad.  Ní féidir leis an Rialtas dul siar ar an chinneadh atá déanta ag an Rialtas a chuaigh romhainn.The Gaelscoil movement is well established.  Is é an tuairim atá ag an Aire nach gcuirfidh an cinneadh seo isteach ar fhás na nGaelscoileanna.  Sin tuairim láidir an Aire agus na Roinne.  The change in the staffing schedule will result in an overall reduction, of the order of 50 posts in Gaelscoileanna.  Faoi láthair, tá níos mó ná 1,500 múinteoir ag obair ins na scoileanna seo.  The actual impact at individual school level, including Gaelscoil Inse Chór, is determined as part of the allocation process for 2011-12 and schools are being notified in the normal manner.This case has been raised with my Department by Deputies Eric Byrne, Michael Conaghan and Catherine Byrne.  They have been invited to submit an appeal to the primary staffing appeals board, which operates independently of the Department.  The appeals board is next scheduled to meet towards the end of May and the school will receive notification of its decision shortly afterwards.The Government will endeavour to protect front line education services as best as possible.  However, this must be done within the context of bringing overall public expenditure back in line with what we can afford.  All areas of Government spending, including gaelscoileanna, will have to manage on a reduced level of resources.  The challenge will be to ensure that the resources provided are used to maximum effect to achieve the best possible outcome for pupils.
#JoeMcHugh	unknown-#JoeMcHugh-party	unknown-#JoeMcHugh-dob	unknown-#JoeMcHugh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-05-04 00:00:00	Prelude	394	I raise this matter in the aftermath of the recent election and on foot of the experience of previous elections whereby people who were on the electoral register for years discovered that through no fault of their own they did not have a vote on election day.  This is a serious matter which requires us to consider the recommendations of the Joint Committee on the Constitution in regard to electoral reform.  One of its recommendations was to consider the possibility of linking PPS numbers with the electoral register.A small minority of people are abusing the right to vote and are bringing the electoral process into disrepute.  It is a mark of a healthy democracy that a person can place himself or herself on the electoral register with ease.  Practices that undermine politics and electoral processes are unhelpful in a society where cynicism and disaffection with politics are on the increase.  The electoral register allows individuals' names to appear in more than one register, which gives them the opportunity to vote several times in the same or different polling stations.  The current system also allows people with addresses in this State but domiciled in other jurisdictions to be registered.  In an age of technology, this is unacceptable.We need a proper debate on this matter because the way in which we do politics has changed.  The various party political machines kept a close vigilance on electoral registers but that may no longer be the case.  The breakdown in community networks means that people do not necessarily recognise voters as they arrive in polling stations.  One way to address this is through the PPS number.  I appreciate that complications will arise with regard to using this.  People may see it as an invasion of privacy or find a barrier to the idea, but it must be seen as a practical solution.The problem is not universal.  Many registers are in fine shape.  Nevertheless, when we examine voting numbers, we see turnouts of 69%, 70% or 75%.  These are not accurate figures because registers may include duplications or names of people who no longer live at the address on the register.  At a time when there is considerable cynicism towards and distrust of politics, people look at a turnout figure of 55% or 65% and wonder what happened the other 40%.  Turnout figures are often misrepresentations.I am calling for this matter to be examined.  The recommendations of the joint committee should be considered and a debate begun.  Many people on both sides of the House want to ensure we have an up-to-date electoral register.  We should look at the possibility of having a central register.  At present registers are under the auspices of 34 local authorities.  A marked register is being compiled centrally.  Each of the 34 local authorities has sent their marked registers to Leinster House to be checked.  This is an anomaly.  The updating of electoral registers could be done centrally, from start to finish.
#FergusODowdFG	unknown-#FergusODowdFG-party	unknown-#FergusODowdFG-dob	unknown-#FergusODowdFG-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-05-04 00:00:00	Prelude	395	I thank the Deputy for raising this issue.  I speak and reply on behalf of my colleague, the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Phil Hogan.In law, the preparation of the register of electors is a matter for each local authority.  It is its duty to ensure, as far as possible and with the co-operation of the public, the accuracy and comprehensiveness of the register.Local authorities have undertaken extensive voter registration campaigns in recent years, with assistance from the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government, to ensure the electoral register is as up to date and as accurate as possible.  This involves striving to ensure, on the one hand, that everyone entitled to be on the register is registered and, on the other, having appropriate measures in place to counteract any possible abuses.  Electoral law reflects this balance to be achieved between an accessible registration system and potential abuse.  It also provides for significant measures relating to voter identification and the prevention of personation aimed at the prevention of fraud.I agree with the issues raised by Deputy McHugh.  There are much bigger changes of population in urban areas than in traditional rural areas.  Rural registers tend to be more accurate than urban ones.  Nowadays, people often do not answer the door when someone knocks.  It is difficult to communicate or to get into gated dwellings.  There are major issues to be examined.  An Post should be consulted or even asked to compile the register.  An Post delivers letters and its staff know where everyone lives.  Local authorities are no longer in that business and do not have the same local knowledge.The Minister, Deputy Hogan, has acknowledged that further improvements can be made.  The use of PPS numbers is one of these initiatives.  While the PPS number or any other unique identifier could assist registration authorities in ensuring the register of electors is as accurate as possible, there are a number of issues that arise, which would require careful consideration.  For example, it is unlikely that the existing PPS database could populate the electoral register with PPS numbers because of the lack of matching identifiers between the two databases.  Therefore, a specific national canvass would likely be required with the associated resource implications.  Privacy and data protection issues may also arise.  There may be a reluctance by people to give their PPS number for registration purposes.  Finally, the PPS system does not necessarily capture the current residence of voters or their citizenship, both essential for electoral registration purposes.It will be understood, therefore, that there are no quick and easy solutions to the perceived problem. The register is important and needs careful consideration. The importance of engagement by voters who have a responsibility to ensure they are on the register also needs to be emphasised.The programme for Government contains a commitment to establish an electoral commission to subsume functions of existing bodies and the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government.  An electoral commission will be an important element in a reformed and revitalised electoral system and the Minister is considering how the necessary measures to establish such a commission can be advanced, including its structure and functions.  The Minister will, in that context, consider the issue raised and I will bring to his attention the points raised by Deputy McHugh.

I understand the allocation of funding and the delegation of powers relating to the construction and maintenance of national roads is a matter for the NRA under section 19 of the Roads Act.Despite that situation, I had the privilege of meeting the new Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Leo Varadkar, in the recent past regarding concerns at unhelpful commentary in the national media about the future viability of the Gort to Tuam bypass.  I welcome the prompt action of the Minister whose office facilitated me with an up-to-date position on the project as a consequence of our discussions.  The Minister has afforded considerable time and understanding to my concerns at the work-in-progress issues regarding the Tuam to Gort project.  I acknowledge the Minister's capacity to identify with the concerns I shared with his Department and the concerns of the people of Galway and of the west.  We welcome his support for investment in the Atlantic corridor which is critical to my region.The Gort to Tuam scheme is being tendered by the National Roads Authority as a PPP.  As such, we are reliant on private sector funding for the construction and for its operation.  The contract for this critical infrastructure should have been awarded in 2010 and the construction should be under way as we speak.  As a consequence of developments in the financial markets relating to the bank crisis and the need to establish the EU-IMF relationship regarding the nation's funding, however, the market perception of Irish sovereign risk has given rise to concerns on the part of the private investor.  I hope next Monday's special sitting of the Dáil will go some way towards engendering confidence on the part of those investors that we are good players within Europe.This project must progress at the earliest opportunity.  The strategic importance of this section of the north-south corridor will be significant in laying the foundation for the economic recovery of the region.  The sustainability and competitiveness of more than 400 firms that provide thousands of much needed jobs in the west and mid-west are highly dependent on this critical capital investment.  It needs to take place without delay.The programme for Government states that our economic recovery must be export-led.  The west, Galway in particular, needs to have connectivity to its international markets to attract foreign direct investment and to retain the multinational employer base we currently enjoy.  I need not further impress on the Minister the economic significance to the region of the Tuam to Gort bypass project and the positive impact this infrastructure would have on sustainable spatial planning.I call on the Minister to keep the House updated on developments surrounding the progress of the funding aspects of the Gort to Tuam bypass and, in particular, to share any progress on the project with the county and city managers of Galway.  In the very unlikely event of this much needed bypass being further delayed beyond any acceptable period, I would be grateful if the Minister would instruct the National Roads Authority to have in place an immediate plan to proceed with a bypass at Tuam as a stand-alone project.

Noting this I have referred the issue raised by the Deputy to the NRA for direct reply.  I would ask the Deputy to advise my office if he does not receive a direct reply within ten days.With regard to the specific project, the House may wish to note that the N17-N18 Gort to Tuam project is being tendered by the NRA as a public private partnership, PPP, but due to concern in the capital markets regarding Ireland's overall financial situation the NRA has had difficulty concluding this PPP contract.The successful awarding of a major PPP contract involving private funding is challenging at any time but is particularly challenging in current circumstances where Ireland has been the subject of intervention by the IMF and the European Union.  Until financial credibility is restored the international debt funding market will be reluctant to lend funds to finance projects in Ireland, the repayment of which is ultimately dependent on the Irish State.This project remains a priority for the Government and the Government is committed to this PPP.  The NRA has my full support in seeking to get the project to a financial close this year.  I can undertake to keep the Deputy and other Deputies for the region informed of progress as it is made, and also the county and city managers.  The NRA and my Department have not given up on this PPP and intend to pursue it for as long as we can.Should the project not become possible I would agree with the Deputy's suggestion that an alternative arrangement should be made to proceed with part of the project on a traditional Exchequer funding basis but I want to make it clear that we are still trying to get this PPP over the line.
#SeanSherlock	Labour	14028	Cork East	speech	unkown-language	2011-05-04 00:00:00	Prelude	398	No additional posts were allocated for Traveller pupils under DEIS in each of the past three years because Traveller pupils in all schools, including those in the DEIS programme, were supported under the Resource Teacher for Travellers scheme, which, the Deputy will be aware was discontinued by the previous Government.However, up to this year, Traveller pupils were not included in the valid enrolment for the purposes of implementing the more favourable Pupil Teacher Ratios in DEIS schools.  As I indicated in my response to his question of 24 March, Traveller pupils have been included in the valid enrolment for the purpose of allocating additional staffing under DEIS from the 2011/12 school year.  I can now advise the Deputy that 81 posts have been provided for this purpose.
#RuairiQuinn	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-party	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-dob	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-05-04 00:00:00	Prelude	399	Responsibility for running schools on a day-to-day basis is devolved from the patron to the board of management and this was statutorily underpinned by Section 14 of the Education Act 1998.Section 24 of the Education Act 1998 provides that the appointment, suspension and dismissal of teachers are the responsibility of boards of management.  In the case of VEC schools, section 20 of the Vocational Education (Amendment) Act 2001 provides that the appointment of teachers and other staff are a matter for each VEC.  Removal from office of a VEC officeholder is provided for by section 8 of the Vocational Education (Amendment) Act 2001 and requires a decision of the Minister.Under Circulars 59/2009 (VEC schools) and 60/2009 (all other schools) procedures were agreed relating to both professional competence issues and procedures relating to work, conduct and matters other than professional competence.  This agreement was made under the terms of Towards 2016 and the procedures were issued in September 2009.The procedures serve a dual purpose in that they provide a framework which enables schools to maintain satisfactory standards, and for teachers and principals to have access to procedures whereby alleged failures to comply with these standards may be fairly and sensitively addressed.Matters of professional competence are dealt with through a process which allows for informal counselling and the use of internal and external supports such as the Employee Assistance Service and relevant educational support services.  Only when the informal procedures are unsuccessful in addressing professional competence issues are the formal stages invoked which may at the end of the process have recourse to disciplinary action (up to and including dismissal).Matters of conduct follow a similarly staged procedure.  However, in the cases of serious misconduct at work or a threat to health and safety to children or other personnel in the school the stages outlined above do not normally apply and a teacher may be dismissed without recourse to the previous stages.  A teacher may also be placed on administrative leave on full pay pending an investigation and the conclusion of any appeal process.As is the norm with any profession it is a matter for the individual teacher, in the first instance, to maintain appropriate standards of work and conduct, and to personally address such issues if and when they arise.  Furthermore it is a teacher's responsibility and obligation to ensure that he or she avails fully of all opportunities of assistance towards remediation of such issues.

#RuairiQuinn	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-party	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-dob	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-05-04 00:00:00	Prelude	401	My Department is currently developing new procedures and systems for the provision of temporary accommodation with a view to achieving best value for money.  These include the development of standard specifications for temporary accommodation, the development of new contractual terms to incorporate buy-out and relocation options to cater for individual local circumstances and appropriately protect the interests of my Department and school authorities.A change in policy implemented by my Department is to provide devolved grant aid for the purchase (rather than rental) of additional accommodation where the need for such accommodation is likely to exist for more than 3 years.  Furthermore, since July 2008, it is also policy to offer schools being approved for devolved grant aid for additional accommodation the option to use their capital grant aid to build a permanent classroom(s) rather than purchase a prefab.  These policies will reduce the usage of prefabricated accommodation and, particularly, the incidence of long term rental of prefabs.In September 2009, 2,037 prefab units were been rented by Primary and Post-Primary schools and this number has been reduced to 1,707.  It should be noted that a prefab unit may consist of one or more classrooms and/or ancillary accommodation and that expenditure incurred on the maintenance or upkeep of rented prefab units is generally included in the rental contract between the prefab provider and the school authorities.  €29.2m has been allocated in 2011 to cover the rental cost of accommodation at primary and post-primary levels including an allocation of €25m to cover the rental cost of prefabs.Prefab rental contracts generally range from six months to three years with an option to renew at the end of each contract period. The following list provides the detailed information on the contract periods for the prefab rentals currently on hands.Roll No.School NameAddressTown/ TownlandCountyDesc. of rentalStart DateApprox.

In addition, the current status of all projects on the school building programme is published on my Department’s web-site and this programme will be regularly updated throughout the year. My Department's most recent projections indicate that enrolments at post-primary level will rise from current levels of circa 312,200 pupils to about 336,600 pupils by the year 2017 and at primary level enrolments are expected to increase from the current total enrolment of circa 505,600 pupils to an expected enrolment circa 567,300 pupils by the year 2017.It is within this context that the Forward Planning Section of my Department is finalising its analysis of all areas in the country in order to determine the level of additional school provision which will be required at both primary and post primary level up to 2017. This analysis will inform the development of a multi-annual plan for capital investment in schools.

A small number of new technological universities, with their own legislative framework and a distinct mission that is faithful to the ethos of the technological sector, working with existing universities, institutes of technology and other education providers, can enrich the diversity and quality of the Irish higher education landscape.The establishment of any technological university will require the enactment of legislation.  More immediately, it will also be necessary to publish the detailed performance criteria for a re-designation process and initial work is under way in developing these.  I am committed to publishing these criteria at an early stage.  I will consider the scope and timeframe for legislative proposals as part of my wider consideration of implementation priorities.
#CiaranCannon	unknown-#CiaranCannon-party	unknown-#CiaranCannon-dob	unknown-#CiaranCannon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-05-04 00:00:00	Prelude	405	1Teachers or teacher equivalents that are directly providing tuition to pupils in schools, in special programmes or in adult or further education settings are exempt from the moratorium on public sector recruitment.  This includes adult literacy tutors.Funding for adult literacy services has increased significantly over recent years to €30 million in 2011.  The number of adult literacy participants was 54,000 in 2010.I am aware that there is significant demand across the range of part-time and full-time further education and training programmes, including adult literacy.  As part of its Labour Market Policy, the Government will make literacy and basic workplace skills a national priority, with literacy training incorporated into a wider variety of further education and training programmes.  The Government will also address the widespread and persistent problem of adult literacy through the integration of literacy in vocational training and through community education under its lifelong learning policy.
#RuairiQuinn	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-party	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-dob	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-05-04 00:00:00	Prelude	406	The Government's Programme for National Recovery 2011-2016 includes a commitment that administrative functions relating to maintenance and school building projects currently carried out by school principals will be devolved locally and that the devolution of an annual capital budget to schools will be piloted to allow schools to plan for capital projects.  In order to expedite the process of delivering projects and to maximise the output from within existing resources, my Department has been exploring alternative methods of delivering major projects.  As well as the public private partnership method of delivery, my Department has also initiated a process whereby a local authority and a number of VECs have been given responsibility for managing the delivery of major projects.  This process has the potential to offer the Department of Education and Skills another mechanism within which school buildings could be delivered in the future.  In addition to the major capital projects funded by my Department, there are grant schemes in which responsibility for project managing and overseeing the delivery of these projects within budget is devolved to the school authority.  Schemes such as the Summer Works Scheme, the Permanent Accommodation Scheme and the Emergency Works Scheme operate on this basis.  The further implementation of the commitments in the Programme for National Recovery 2011-2016 will be informed by progress in the new devolution arrangements under way.

I will consult my Government colleagues on this matter and other commitments in the programme for Government with a view to the timing of the implementation thereof at which stage I will make my Department's intentions in this regard public.
#RuairiQuinn	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-party	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-dob	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-05-04 00:00:00	Prelude	408	All full-time higher education programmes covered by the free fees scheme are open to unemployed people.  Unemployed people on full-time third level programmes may also be eligible for support under the Department's student grant schemes.  The provision of grants is subject to a means test and other eligibility criteria.  Further information on how to apply for a student grant is available on the student finance website, www.studentfinance.ie.  A competitive call for proposals for €5 million was issued by the HEA at the end of January under Springboard, a new multi-annual higher education labour market fund to enable unemployed people to access innovative part-time higher education opportunities from certificate to postgraduate levels (Levels 6 to 9 on NQF).  The closing date for applications from providers for funding was 18 March 2011.  It is expected that full details of the part-time programmes to be provided under Springboard will be available by the end of this month.  Springboard has been designed to help unemployed people who hold awards at NFQ Level 5 or 6 or equivalent with a previous history of employment in construction, manufacturing or other sectors of the economy in which employment levels are unlikely to recover to pre-recession levels.  The fund also targets those with a previous history of employment with higher levels of qualifications who may also require additional upskilling or reskilling to enable them to re-enter employment.

The Comptroller and Auditor General will assist the authority by testing the completeness and correctness of the information supplied by each university and the accuracy of any calculations of excess payment amounts produced.  I will inform the Committee of Public Accounts of the outcome of this exercise as soon as it becomes available.  My Department has sought and received unequivocal commitments from each university where unapproved allowances were paid that in future it will adhere to the provisions of the Universities Act.  In the context of annual reporting arrangements provided for in the code of governance of Irish universities, each university is required to submit an annual statement to the Higher Education Authority affirming that Government policy on pay is being complied with.

In general, pay policy is determined by the Government on the advice of the Ministers for Finance and Public Expenditure and Reform and having regard to the provisions of the Croke Park agreement as appropriate.
#RuairiQuinn	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-party	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-dob	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-05-04 00:00:00	Prelude	411	In 2003, the then Minister for Education and Science was the designated authority for recognition of qualifications for the purposes of employment for the regulated profession of primary teacher.  Applications for recognition of qualifications were received by the Department from time to time, either from individual graduates or from institutions.  The Qualifications (Education and Training Act) 1999 provided for the establishment of the National Qualifications Authority of Ireland and the Further and Higher Education and Training Awards Council for the accreditation of non-university education and training awards at further and higher levels.In 2003, Hibernia College made an application to HETAC for validation of its Graduate Diploma in Primary Education in the format prescribed, setting out the programme objectives and outcomes, structure and outline content, assessment arrangements for learners, and facilities and staff expertise available.  A panel of assessors examined the documentation and visited the college.  The Programme Accreditation Committee of HETAC considered their report and accredited the programme.  A certificate of course approval was issued in July 2003.  As the Minister for Education and Science was the designated authority for recognition of qualifications for purposes of employment for the regulated profession of primary teacher, Hibernia College contacted the Department to ascertain whether this qualification would be recognised for the purpose of employment as a primary teacher.  The Department considered the course proposal and the decision of the then Minister was that he would recognise the qualification of Graduate Diploma in Primary Education of Hibernia College for the purpose of employment as a primary teacher provided all of the conditions set by HETAC were met, including those relating to quality assurance.  The Department did not procure the delivery of the course referred to by the Deputy but was approached by the college with its proposal.  The college has not received any funding from the Department to run the course.Hibernia College is a privately owned institution providing a privately run course.  Neither my Department nor any other State body has a role in regulating the number of students enrolled by this privately run college.  Section 38 of the Teaching Council Act has since come into force and the Teaching Council is now empowered to review and professionally accredit programmes of initial teacher education.  It is open to any other providers to make an application for recognition if they so wish and any such application will be considered by the Teaching Council.
#RuairiQuinn	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-party	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-dob	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-05-04 00:00:00	Prelude	412	I take the issue of bullying in schools very seriously.  I am committed to ensuring schools tackle bullying in all its forms, including homophobic bullying.  Under the Education (Welfare) Act 2000, all schools are required to have in place a code of behaviour and this code must be drawn up in accordance with the guidelines of the National Educational Welfare Board.  The board's guidelines, which were issued to schools in 2008, make it clear that each school must have policies to prevent or address bullying and harassment and that schools must make clear in their code of behaviour that bullying is unacceptable.  The guidelines further state that as well as making explicit that bullying is prohibited in the school and having an anti-bullying policy, the code of behaviour should indicate what action the school will take on foot of alleged breaches of the school's bullying policy.  Every school must have in place a policy which includes specific measures to deal with bullying behaviour, within the framework of the school's overall school code of behaviour.  Such a code, developed through consultation with the whole school community and properly implemented, can be the most influential measure in countering bullying behaviour in schools.  Responsibility for tackling bullying falls to the level of the individual school, as it is at local level that an effective anti-bullying climate must be established and at that level that actions should be taken to address allegations of bullying.My Department has also issued Guidelines on Countering Bullying Behaviour as an aid to schools in devising measures to prevent and deal with instances of bullying behaviour.  These guidelines were drawn up following consultation with representatives of school management, teachers and parents, and are sufficiently flexible to allow each school authority to adapt them to suit the particular needs of a school.  As a further aid to post-primary schools, my Department has published a template that can be used by post-primary schools in developing anti-bullying policies.  The anti-bullying policy template is based primarily on the key document Guidelines on Countering Bullying Behaviour.  However, it also takes account of more recent legislative and regulatory changes.  It refers to issues of contemporary concern, such as the need to tackle text bullying, cyber-bullying and homophobic bullying.  The education of students in primary and post-primary schools in relation to anti-bullying behaviour is part of the Social, Personal and Health Education curriculum.  Social, Personal and Health Education is now a compulsory subject at primary level and in the junior cycle of post-primary schools.
#RuairiQuinn	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-party	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-dob	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-05-04 00:00:00	Prelude	413	The Programme for Government states that education will be a priority for this Government and that we will endeavour to protect and enhance the educational experience of children, young people and students.  To that end, we are committing during the tenure of this Government to the publication of a plan for the implementation of the Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs Act 2004 (EPSEN) to prioritise access for children with special needs to an individual education plan.  The Deputy will be aware that a number of sections of the EPSEN Act have already been commenced, principally those establishing the National Council for Special Education and those promoting an inclusive approach to the education of children with special educational needs.The EPSEN Act also provides for the establishment of the Special Education Appeals Board to hear and determine appeals under the Act.  The appellant sections of the Act have not yet commenced.  Three members were appointed to the board for a three-year term in April 2007 in advance of the then expected full implementation of the EPSEN Act.  Board members developed the processes and procedures which would be required to allow for a smooth appellant system once the relevant sections of the Act, which would allow appeals to be undertaken, are commenced.  Once the sections in question are commenced, the board will have specific statutory functions and responsibilities under the EPSEN Act.  In the interim there are no grounds for any appeals to be made to the Special Education Appeals Board.  Accordingly, once the initial period of office of the members of the board elapsed, the previous Minister for Education and Skills decided not to make new appointments for a further term.
#RuairiQuinn	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-party	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-dob	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-05-04 00:00:00	Prelude	414	I wish to advise the Deputy that the 1998 Education Act requires boards of management of each school to publish the policy of the school relating to participation by students with special educational needs, including students who are exceptionally able.  The measures schools take in this regard are required to be stated in the school plan. It is the duty of the board of management to ensure that appropriate education services are made available to such students.  Primary and secondary level schools use strategies such as curriculum differentiation, curriculum enrichment and acceleration to facilitate the development of pupils who are exceptionally able.  Syllabi and curricula for second level schools have been designed in such a way to enable teachers cater for the wide range of pupil ability.The revised primary curriculum, which has been supplied to every primary teacher, recognises the importance of developing the full potential of the child and caters for pupil diversity, including meeting the needs of exceptionally able pupils.  Content is outlined in the curricula at both levels and process is also heavily emphasised.  Enabling children to learn how to learn is stressed and facilitated.  The development of language skills, investigatory and problem-solving skills, higher-order thinking skills and working individually, and as a member of a group, are all encouraged at both levels.  While the use of information and communication technologies and the use of class and school libraries are of benefit in project work with all pupils, they have a special importance for pupils who are exceptionally able.The National Council for Curriculum and Assessment (NCCA), in collaboration with its counterpart in Northern Ireland, the Council for Curriculum Examination and Assessment (CCEA), has produced draft guidelines for teachers of exceptionally able students.  These guidelines issued to all Primary and Post Primary schools in November 2007 along with a questionnaire for feedback.  The NCCA/CCEA guidelines are designed to raise awareness of the social, emotional and academic needs of exceptionally able students and to assist teachers in planning their teaching and learning.  The guidelines provide advice to schools on identification of gifted children, set out profiles of students, and whole school and classroom strategies and case studies which demonstrate how schools can best meet the needs of such students.  The general strategies include differentiated teaching, acceleration and enrichment approaches in the context of participation in mainstream schools.The Special Education Support Service is a service under the management of my Department which provides support for teachers to assist them in meeting the needs of all pupils with special educational needs, including those pupils who are exceptionally able.  The service is available to schools who may be seeking advice or support relating to a specific special education issue in the school.  More information on the range of programmes offered by the Special Education Support Service is available on www.sess.ie.  In addition, the professional development service for teachers provides training in differentiation, in terms of differentiating for all pupils, whether less or more able.  Issues around exceptional ability and giftedness are addressed as part of the school planning process which is facilitated by the professional development service.  Finally, the programme for Government sets out this Government’s commitment to examining supports in place for gifted students and specifically to the creation of improved links with third level institutions on a regional basis, to provide gifted students with access to new programmes or educational resources.
#RuairiQuinn	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-party	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-dob	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-05-04 00:00:00	Prelude	415	Issues relating to local authorities are a matter in the first instance for my colleague, the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government.  The Redundant Apprentice Placement Scheme 2011 is funded by my Department and administered by FÁS. It is a national scheme introduced earlier this year which aims to facilitate up to 1,000 eligible redundant apprentices to complete the on-the-job training phases 3, 5 and 7 of their apprenticeships with FÁS approved employers in either the private sector or, for the first time, the public sector.  FÁS has met the County and City Managers Association to draw its attention to and provide information on the Redundant Apprentice Scheme 2011.In the public sector, the placement of redundant apprentices is co-ordinated between FÁS regional offices and the relevant local authority with support from the Office for Local Authority Management.  As at 22 April 2011, 103 redundant apprentices had been placed with local authorities under this scheme.  Other initiatives taken by FÁS to assist redundant apprentices to progress in their apprenticeships include Changes in Progression Rules, whereby redundant apprentices unable to complete their relevant on-the-job training phases are now permitted to progress to the next Off-the-Job training phase.  Under the Phase 7 Equivalent Assessments Scheme, redundant construction trade apprentices unable to complete on-the-job Phase 7 assessments at an employer undertake Phase 7 Equivalent Assessments at a FÁS training centre.  The Recognition of Prior Learning Scheme allows redundant apprentices who have successfully completed all apprenticeship training Phases 1 to 7 but who have not completed the statutory four years in employment as an apprentice to validate their competence by submitting a portfolio of evidence of trade related work experience gained at home and/or abroad and/or trade related training and education.  Under the Fee Waiver Scheme, FÁS day and/or evening courses fees are waived for redundant apprentices.

These submissions are being examined and oral consultations with stakeholder groups are ongoing.  I expect that the National Literacy and Numeracy Strategy will be drafted by the end of June 2011.  The strategy will contain a series of specific short-term and longer-term actions to improve the teaching and learning of literacy and numeracy in our schools.  The implementation of these actions will be overseen by a National Literacy and Numeracy Implementation Group supported by a National Literacy and Numeracy Forum.  The implementation group will benefit from the participation of national and international experts on literacy and numeracy acquisition and assessment while the wider National Literacy Forum will facilitate ongoing inputs from the education partners.

In accordance with the published criteria for large scale building projects, the project for this school has been assigned a Band 1.4 rating. The progression of all large scale building projects will be considered in the context of my Department's School Building and Modernisation Programme. Information in respect of the current school building programme along with all assessed applications for major capital works, including this project, is available on my Department's website at www.education.ie.As the Deputy is aware, the Forward Planning Section of my Department is continuing its analysis of all areas in the country  in order to determine the level of additional school provision which will be required at both primary and post primary level up to 2017. Overall primary requirements in the area referred to by the Deputy will also be fully considered in this context. However, in light of current competing demands on the Department's capital budget, it is not possible to give an indicative timeframe for the progression of a project for the school in question at this time.

This process is a key objective of the Programme for Government for the education sector and a personal priority which I am pleased to have been to convene it so quickly.The terms of reference of the Forum are to advise me on:how it can best be ensured that the education system can provide a sufficiently diverse number and range of primary schools catering for all religions and none;the practicalities of how transfer/divesting of patronage should operate for  individual primary schools in communities where it is appropriate and necessary;how such transfer/divesting can be advanced to ensure that demands for diversity of patronage (including from an Irish language perspective) can be identified and met on a widespread basis nationally.The Advisory Group which I have appointed to conduct the Forum will receive and assess the various views and perspectives of participants and to then provide me with policy advice having regard to the Terms of Reference.The outcome of this process will inform future thinking and policy making on a range of issues, including the matters raised by the Deputy.  In the meantime, I have deferred the introduction of legislation to enable VEC patronage at primary level.   The Community National Schools, of which I am Patron, will continue to be managed by my Department.
#RuairiQuinn	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-party	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-dob	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-05-04 00:00:00	Prelude	421	I would like to clarify for the Deputy that my plans to give parents access to more information regarding schools relates to how each individual school communicates with the parents of children attending or about to attend that school about that school's operation and performance. It is not about the construction of national league tables for primary schools.There is no room for complacency about educational standards and self evaluation by schools is important in identifying what is being done well and where there is a need for improvement. As a system of self evaluation develops I am anxious that in all cases work done by a school in that respect is shared with parents locally so that parents can be enabled to have a clear insight into the teaching and learning experience in the school.In fact the parental role as part of a school's ongoing quality assurance and improvement is recognised in the 1998 Education Act, through the requirement for boards of management to establish procedures for informing the parents of students in the school of matters relating to the operation and performance of the school. My plans essentially involve ensuring that all schools deliver in a consistent and structured manner on that statutory intent.
#RuairiQuinn	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-party	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-dob	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-05-04 00:00:00	Prelude	422	It is the aim of my Department to ensure that there is an adequate supply of suitably qualified primary teachers to meet demand.  Four of the five providers funded by my Department do not use religious affiliation as an entry requirement. St. Patrick's College, Mary Immaculate College, Froebel College and Coláiste Mhuire Marino were established as Catholic Colleges of Education. However, they each now have links with universities and accept students of all faiths and none. Entry to the Bachelor of Education is based on points achieved in the Leaving Certificate examination.  The situation with the Church of Ireland College of Education is somewhat different as its remit is to provide an adequate supply of primary teachers capable of upholding and maintaining the distinctive ethos and spirit of Protestant national schools. Entry is based on points achieved in the Leaving Certificate Examination and appropriate numbers of places on the Bachelor of Education Degree programme are reserved for students who are members of recognised Churches in the Protestant tradition. Remaining places can be made available to other candidates.The content of the Bachelor of Education programme is, currently, a matter for the individual Colleges of Education.  In accordance with Section 38 of the Teaching Council Act 2001, the Teaching Council is empowered to review and professionally accredit programmes of initial teacher education.  The Teaching Council has initiated reviews of a range of initial teacher education programmes and will consider course content in this context.The Bachelor of Education courses provided by the Colleges of Education include compulsory modules on religious education. The content of these courses varies between the different institutions and, in general, has a strong focus on methodology. They aim to ensure that student teachers understand the spiritual and religious development of the primary school child in a general sense and that they are aware of the content and methodologies of the programmes developed by the Catholic Church, the Board of Education of the General Synod of the Church of Ireland and Educate Together. They also aim to ensure that the student teachers are enabled to plan an RE programme which can be applied in schools of varying traditions and ethos.  As with all elements of the programme this area evolves and is reviewed by the Colleges in accordance with the changing educational landscape.The recently established Forum on Patronage and Pluralism in the Primary Sector offers a platform for consideration of the very many issues that arise in the context of divesting of patronage by the Catholic Church and transfer of patronage generally.The Forum will take a multi-dimensional approach involving consultations with the key education stakeholders, including parents and other interested parties in order to ensure the widest possible consultation on this important issue. I would hope that the work of the Forum will deliver clear agreed specific modalities for the transfer of patronage which will allow for progress to be made on actual transfers during 2012.I am confident that the Colleges of Education and the Teaching Council will respond to the outcomes of the Forum in reviewing course content and the requirements for same, respectively.

The Early Start programme aims to provide an educational programme for children aged 3-4 which would enhance their overall development and offset the effects of social disadvantage. The specific objectives of the programme are:To enhance the children's language, cognitive and social/emotional development by engaging them in structured play activities which are characterised by high quality adult/child interaction.To assess the strengths and needs of each child in relation to language, cognition and social/emotional development and to plan and deliver a programme of learning to meet the identified needs in these key areas of learning.To devise strategies which actively engage parents in the education of their children.In 2010, just over €6 million was expended on this programme.  In recent years, the State along with Atlantic Philanthropies have funded Prevention and Early Intervention Programmes in areas of disadvantage. These include YoungBallymun, Tallaght's Childhood Development Initiative and the Preparing for Life Programme in Darndale. The evidence accruing from these intervention programmes as to what works most effectively for young children at risk of educational disadvantage will inform further targeted interventions.
#CiaranCannon	unknown-#CiaranCannon-party	unknown-#CiaranCannon-dob	unknown-#CiaranCannon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-05-04 00:00:00	Prelude	424	While current figures on the number of teen parents in second level are not readily available, the most recent statistics available indicate 2,223 teen births in 2009. Of these, 1201 were to mothers aged 18 years or younger.For young parents of school-going age, the most pressing issues are considered to be a sensitive response to their needs, appropriate counselling/ mentoring and medical assistance, minimal disruption of tuition, and appropriate access to childcare.  Individual circumstances will differ and accordingly, school management practice will vary from case to case.  Generally, when it comes to the attention of the school that a pupil is pregnant, the school authorities check to ensure that the pupil is receiving appropriate medical assistance and counselling advice. Schools endeavour to be sensitive and understanding to the pupil's needs while trying to ensure that her education is not neglected.Home tuition is provided to pregnant schoolgirls who are absent from school during the latter stages of pregnancy or immediately following the birth of a baby when attendance may be impractical. In 2009/10, home tuition was approved for 63 pregnant girls attending post primary schools.Funding was being provided by my Department in 2010/11 for the educational element of 8 Teenage Parenting Support projects as a specific gender element of the School Completion Programme under DEIS in preventing early school leaving among teenage mothers and fathers. These are as follows:1. Carlow Teen Parenting Programme2. Cork Teen Parenting Programme3. Donegal Teen Parenting Programme4. Barnardos Teen Parenting Programme5. Coolock Teen Parenting Programme6. Galway Teen Parenting Programme7. Limerick Teen Parenting Programme8. Louth Teen Parenting ProgrammeFunding was also provided to Waterford Student Mothers Project in 2010/11.In 2009, 485 young parents were referred to the Teen Parenting Support Programme (TPSP). This included 441 young mothers. It also includes 35 young fathers who are supported independently from the mother of the child.Each Teenage Parenting Support project has made links with a School Completion Programme in their area, assisted by the SCP National Coordination Team and the Teenage Parenting Support Initiative Coordinators. The young parents supported by the Teenage Parenting Projects are given the opportunity to reach their full potential through continued participation in education and training. This will improve their life opportunities and reduce the likelihood of the young family experiencing poverty and social exclusion and being long-term dependants on state support. Furthermore, my Department is represented on the National Advisory Committee-Teen Parents Support Initiative which meets twice a year.An analysis by the Teen Parents Support Programme of 1349 young mothers who engaged with TPSP between mid 2005 and 2008 shows that, at the time of referral, 46% (623) were in education/training. Of these, 65% were in second level schools. A further 339 were early school leavers. Data on the relationship between pregnancy and early school leaving was collected on 217 of the above 339 early school leavers. It showed that 50% of the young women were still in school at the beginning of their pregnancy. Of these, 98 left during the pregnancy and 10 left after the birth of their children. This demonstrates the importance of supporting pregnant and/ or parenting teens to remain within the school system.Between 2005 and 2008, 61% of all mothers who had not completed their Leaving Certificate received education-related supports from TPSP staff. This refers to mothers both in and out of education and includes 294 young mothers who received financial support through the School Completion Programme.Data collected on 262 of the 339 early school leavers shows that during 30 months of engagement with TPSP, 21% (56) returned to education or training and 19 of these 56 young mothers received financial support from the School Completion Programme.  Under the Community Childcare Subvention Scheme administered by the Department of Children and Youth Affairs, there is a tiered system of payments in place for parents in receipt of Social Welfare. The scheme allows eligible parents, including teenagers completing their second level education, to access reduced childcare costs at community childcare services participating in the scheme. Parents who are secondary school students are granted Band A status which means that the childcare provider will get a maximum subsidy of €100 per child (€130 for a baby) for a full time place.

While I would not necessarily be bound by the specifics of every recommendation in the report, and in particular the specific issue of future financing will be the subject of further consideration as set out in the Programme for Government, I believe that, taken in the round, the strategy represents the broad basis on which higher education policy should be developed over the coming decades.  The overall implementation effort will require strong partnership and involvement across the system in delivering on the various detailed actions required.  Having considered overall implementation priorities, it is my intention to make a comprehensive statement over the coming weeks in relation to my agenda for delivery on priority strategy actions and the overall development of our higher education system.
#RuairiQuinn	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-party	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-dob	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-05-04 00:00:00	Prelude	426	In 2006, my Department commissioned the Educational Research Centre (ERC) to commence a comprehensive evaluation of DEIS, the action plan for educational inclusion.  The aim of the evaluation is to monitor the implementation of the programme and assess its impact on students, families, schools, and communities at primary and post-primary levels.  The evaluation has involved the testing of pupils together with attitudinal studies focusing on pupils, teachers and a wide group of other stakeholders.  An advisory group was established to support the evaluation.The forthcoming report, which is expected shortly, is the second in a series of reports and deals with the evaluation of DEIS at primary level with a particular focus on change in English reading and mathematics between 2007 and 2010.  A previous report on DEIS focusing on rural disadvantage is available for download from the Educational Research Centre website (www.erc.ie).  I envisage that the forthcoming report will also be made available following consideration within my Department and by the Advisory Group.In parallel with the ERC's research on pupil attainment in DEIS schools, the Inspectorate of my Department conducted evaluations of planning in a sample of 36 DEIS schools.  Evaluations were completed in 18 primary schools in spring 2010 and in 18 post-primary schools in the period September to December 2010.  Reports on the effectiveness of planning and target setting in each of the schools have been provided to the board of management of each school.  A national composite report on the effectiveness of DEIS planning in the primary schools has been completed and is expected to be published by June 2011.  A composite report on the effectiveness of DEIS planning in the sample of post-primary schools is under preparation and is expected to be available by August 2011.
#RuairiQuinn	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-party	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-dob	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-05-04 00:00:00	Prelude	427	The Deputy will be aware of my Department's commitment to ensuring that all children, including those with autism, can have access to an education appropriate to their needs in school settings.  This facilitates access to individualised education programmes, fully qualified professional teachers, special needs assistants and the appropriate school curriculum with the option, in line with each child's ability, of full/partial integration and interaction with other pupils.My Department's policy is to provide for children with special educational needs, including autism, to be included in mainstream schools unless such a placement would not be in their best interests or the interests of the children with whom they are to be educated.  Some children may be supported in a special class attached to a mainstream school.  These students have the option, where appropriate, of full/partial integration and interaction with other pupils.  Other children may have such complex needs that they are best placed in a special school.  Students with special educational needs have access to a range of support services including additional teaching and/or care supports.  In special schools and special classes, students are supported through lower pupil teacher ratios.  Special needs assistants may also be recruited specifically where pupils with disabilities and significant care needs are enrolled.The Deputy will be aware that the establishment of a network of autism-specific special classes in schools across the country to cater for children with autism has been a key educational priority in recent years.  In excess of 430 classes have now been approved around the country at primary and post primary level, including many in special schools.  My Department has put in place a training programme for teachers in autism-specific interventions including Treatment and Education of Autistic Communication Handicapped Children (TEACCH), Picture Exchange Communications System (PECS) and Applied Behaviour Analysis (ABA) through the Special Education Support Service.The Deputy will be aware that the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) is responsible, through its network of local Special Educational Needs Organisers (SENOs), for allocating special needs resources to schools to support children with special educational needs.  The NCSE operates within my Department's criteria in allocating such support.  The NCSE will continue to support schools, parents, children and teachers and special needs assistants will continue to be deployed to schools to meet children's needs in line with my Department's policy.  SENOs with their local knowledge and expertise are a valuable resource to parents in sourcing an educational placement.  The Deputy will also be aware that my Department provides grant aid under the Home Tuition Scheme to provide early education intervention for pre-school children with a confirmed diagnosis of autism or to parents of children with autism who are awaiting an educational placement.The Deputy may wish to contact my colleague, the Minister for Health and Children or the HSE directly in relation to the reference to children awaiting assessments, diagnosis and Early Intervention services in the details provided with his question.  Similarly the Deputy may also wish to contact the Minister for Social Protection regarding the reference to issues surrounding the Domiciliary Care Allowance and the Carer's Allowance.

#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-05-04 00:00:00	Prelude	430	It must be recognised that emissions from the transport sector remain significant.  The carbon tax is about sending price signals to the sector as a whole.  The carbon tax does not differentiate between private and public transport per se, however, the impact on public transport will be far less than on private transport by virtue of the fact that the carbon tax is dispersed amongst more people, for example, using a bus compared to an individual in a car.Consequently, the carbon tax will be proportionately less for users of public transport which should be an incentive for its use.  In addition, the carbon tax provides an incentive for both private motorists and providers of public transport to invest in fuel efficient cars and buses when they are making future purchasing decisions.  In relation to the fuel rebate scheme, a derogation under EU Directive 2003/96 on Energy Taxation allowed the application of a reduced rate of Mineral Oil Tax to fuel used for the purposes of certain road passenger services.  Arising from an EU Commission decision, that derogation has expired and the arrangement was, therefore, terminated by the Finance Act 2008.  It would not be possible, having regard to the relevant provisions of EU law, to re-introduce a scheme of that nature for those services.
#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2011-05-04 00:00:00	Prelude	431	I propose to take Questions Nos. 53 to 55, inclusive, together.I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that Revenue is an integrated Tax and Customs administration, and all Revenue staff are available for assignment to any required functions in accordance with currently identified priorities and risks.  Currently (30 April) the Revenue Commissioners have 881 staff serving in the Border, Midlands, West region.  The corresponding figures for staff employed at the same point in each of the previous years requested are as follows (all full-time equivalents): 2006, 885; 2007, 945; 2008, 972; 2009, 962; 2010, 888.These staff play an important part in ensuring compliance with all taxes and duties including customs obligations and excise duties and are supplemented by staff from other Revenue Regions and Revenue's Investigation and Prosecution Division as required for specific planned operations, particularly in relation to excises and smuggling.  Revenue is aware that it plays a frontline role in protecting society from the importation of illicit drugs.  As a stakeholder in the Government's National Drugs Strategy, Revenue plays an important role in implementing the Supply Reduction Pillar.Strategic and Operation Plans, which are managed on a national basis, have been put in place to ensure Revenue meets its commitments under the strategy.  This ongoing commitment is bolstered by the deployment of the two Revenue Customs Cutters, the RCC Suirbhéir and the RCC Faire, two X-Ray scanners and 13 detector dog teams, coupled with the management of the Customs Drugs Watch programme.Revenue works proactively with an Garda Síochána and the Naval Service as part of the Joint Task Force on Drugs Interdiction.  Along with effective operational interventions, Revenue has also used its contacts within international law enforcement agencies to proactively profile drug trafficking networks.
#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-05-04 00:00:00	Prelude	432	I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that all private aircraft arrivals at Ireland West Airport Knock are monitored on an ongoing basis, and based on risk analysis, profiling, review of intelligence etc., a decision is made on whether or not to search a private aircraft.  While private aircraft are boarded from time to time at Ireland West Airport Knock, to check for drugs and other contraband, it is not the policy of the Revenue Commissioners to publish precise details of such enforcement activities, as this could prejudice current or future operations.  The Commissioners further advise me that passengers and crew from private aircraft who enter the State are subject to the same checks as other arrivals, including individual profiling, and are liable to be checked by Revenue staff and screened by the drug detector dog.In line with best practice in customs administration worldwide, Revenue regards the development of information and intelligence as critical to the detection of evasion and smuggling, including drug smuggling.  This is very important in the case of Ireland and other EU Member States where the operating environment for Customs has been shaped to a significant degree by the introduction of the Internal Market and the related principles of freedom of movement within the EU.  Of specific relevance are the abolition of routine and systematic Customs checks on goods and passengers moving within any part of the EU.  The approach has of necessity been to balance the freedom of movement principle in regard to people and goods with the need to control smuggling.

Given that the rate hardly covered the administration costs of registering a vehicle, in particular when the pre-registration examination cost from 1 September 2010 is deducted from the VRT rate, it was decided in the  2011 Budget  to increase the rate to €200.  There is no discretion for cars that are used solely for charity fund-raising events.

As the Deputy is aware, the Joint Administrators of QIL (in administration) last week announced the sale of certain QIL assets and liabilities to Liberty Mutual Direct Insurance Company Ltd, representing the best option for policy holders of QIL.  The Joint Administrators also identified solvency breaches in QIL for which they have to seek assistance from the ICF.  They indicated that the reason for this is the fact that QIL recorded a total loss of €706 million for the year ending December 2009, due mainly to operating losses in the UK market and a write-down in the value of assets, particularly in relation to the company's investment in Quinn Property Holdings.In addition, they estimate that losses in 2010 will amount to €160 million, mainly reflecting UK business written immediately prior to their appointment.  These losses have been incurred due to the policies and strategies pursued by the previous management.  These losses are expected to lead to a call on the Insurance Compensation Fund (ICF) in the region of approximately €600m, however the approval of the High Court will first have to be obtained.At present the ICF has reserves of €30m.  Additional money can be raised by the Central Bank through the placing of a levy of up to 2% of an insurance company's aggregate income under Section 6 of the 1964 Insurance Act.  In addition, under Section 5 of the same Act, I, as Minister for Finance, can if recommended by the Central Bank, advance moneys to the Fund to enable payments to be made expeditiously.  These advances must be repaid to the Exchequer by the ICF.  To date no request for funding has been made to me.The Insurance Corporation of Ireland, a subsidiary of Allied Irish Bank, collapsed in 1985. It should be noted that no levy was placed on the industry after the ICI collapse as compensation to meet the company's liabilities was provided by a combination of AIB funding, commercial loans and State loans which have since been repaid.However, a levy of 2% of gross premium income was introduced on 1 January 1984 following the collapse of PMPA in October of the preceding year. The levy was paid by all non-life insurers at this rate until 31 December 1991 and a reduced levy of 1% applied for the period 1 January 1992 to 31 December 1992, when it was discontinued as sufficient moneys had been collected to successfully complete the administration of the former PMPA.

This matter is the responsibility of the Central Bank Commission and the Minister for Finance had no role in the matter.  However, the Central Bank has informed me that the final consultancy cost is expected to be in the region of €30m, including VAT.It is important to note that the costs relate to the three firms and third party sub-contractors.  These costs also cover additional work that is being carried out during the second quarter of 2011 in relation to the assessment of INBS loan losses and review of Anglo loan loss methodologies.Details of all firms, including third party sub-contractors are available in the Central Bank's  Financial Measures Programme Report, which is available at: http://www.financialregulator.ie/ industry-sectors/credit-institutions/Documents/The%20Financial%20Measures%20Programme%20Report.pdf.
The Central Bank has also informed me that in light of the requirement under the EU-IMF programme to use consultants under a very tight deadline for urgent financial stability purposes, it was not possible to apply normal tender processes. However expert firms were selected from a larger list.  The Central Bank invited those firms to tender and those able to provide submissions at short notice were reviewed.  A selection panel (including a Central Bank appointed risk adviser) was used to assess presentations from firms.  Firms were also asked to provide fee estimation and were then selected.Firms were chosen on the basis of their expertise and knowledge, with each having a specific role in specified areas.  BlackRock is a leading global provider of investment and risk advisory services to public and private clients and was commissioned to leverage their extensive expertise to provide a bottom-up loan loss forecast for the Irish banks in both a base case and a stress scenario over the next three years and lifetime.  Barclays Capital provided expert advice on banking sector reorganisation and deleveraging issues.  The Boston Consulting Group provided project management resources across the Financial Measures Programme, an assessment of the loan loss forecasting exercise and it also contributed to expert advice for the PCAR and PLAR.

Such exempt buildings would principally include those used for public worship, education and health care provided on a not-for-profit basis, and charitable purposes.  The basis of valuation for all commercial property, inclusive of premises occupied by small and medium size enterprises, is net annual value, i.e. the rental value of the property and, in the interests of equity, all such valuation revisions are determined by reference to the values of comparable properties on the same valuation list.The legislation also provides for the revaluation of all commercial and industrial property in the State and the Commissioner of Valuation who has sole responsibility for all valuation matters under the Act is implementing the revaluation programme on a nationwide basis.  The purpose of revaluation is to bring more equity, fairness and transparency into the local authority rating system and following completion of the initial revaluation programme, I am satisfied that there will be a much closer and uniform relationship between rental values of property and their commercial rates liability and that this relationship will thereafter be maintained by means of recurring revaluations provided for in the Act.Under the Valuation Act 2001 the commercial rates income of the local authority will be capped in the year following a revaluation. Any increase will be limited to the rate of inflation.  The purpose of revaluation is to redistribute the commercial rates liability more equitably between ratepayers rather than to increase the total amount of commercial rates collected by a local authority.The revaluation programme began in November 2005 in the South Dublin County Council area and has since been rolled out to the areas covered by Fingal and Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown County Councils.  The revaluation of South Dublin was completed in December 2007, Fingal was completed in 2009 and Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown was completed in 2010.  In the next phase, the revaluation of the Dublin City Council area will commence with the signing of the valuation order on 5th May, 2011. This will entail the valuation of circa 25,000 properties and the new list will be published in December 2013.  It is intended to roll out the programme to further local authority areas later in 2011 and the necessary process of consultation, as provided for under the Act, is underway with the local authorities of Waterford, i.e. Waterford City and County Council and Dungarvan Town Council.  Preliminary work is also under way on the revaluation of Limerick City.The Commissioner is actively reviewing options which might hold potential for accelerating the delivery of the revaluation programme within a shorter timeframe.  While I have no immediate plans to amend the Valuation Act 2001, my officials are reviewing various provisions of the Act to achieve greater efficiencies, including streamlining the appeals process. I should point out that while the lists of rateable valuations produced and maintained by the Valuation Office are the basis on which rates are levied, the amount of rates to be collected is a matter for each local authority to decide.

There is an exempt annual threshold of €4,004 (€77 per week).  However, where this threshold is exceeded, the entire amount is chargeable.  The standard rates of charge are:—2% on the first  €10,036,—4% on the next €5,980, and—7% on the balance.As the Deputy is aware, the Finance Act 2011 introduced a concession which applies from 1 January 2011 for individuals in possession of a medical card or a Health Amendment Act card.  Accordingly, the maximum rate of charge of USC for individuals in receipt of employment/pension income and in possession of a full medical card or a Health Amendment Act card is 4% irrespective of the level of their income.Employers and payroll operators have been advised by Revenue that where an employee or pensioner makes them aware that he or she is the holder of a full medical card or a Health Amendment Act card the employer should immediately apply the lower rate of USC to salary or pension payments already made in respect of the period since 1 January and to make a repayment of any overpayment of USC at the earliest possible date.Where an employee does not make the employer or payroll operator aware of the fact that he or she has a medical or Health Amendment Act card during the year, Revenue will, on receipt of an appropriate claim after the end of the tax year, process the repayment arising in a timely manner.A comprehensive publication of "Frequently Asked Questions" (FAQs) in relation to the USC has been posted on the Revenue website and is updated at regular intervals.  These FAQs are intended to guide employers and payroll operators in addressing all issues related to the operation of USC.

The numbers are small, having regard to the size of the taxpayer base, but these programmes are an important part of Revenue's compliance strategy, and are essential in maintaining public confidence in the tax system.Revenue does not maintain records that would allow for compilation of data by reference to actions taken against individuals or small and medium enterprises.  However data is available on the number of judgements and their value, obtained for each of the years requested, broken down between individuals and companies and, by definition, all liquidation cases are companies.  It is understood that the Deputy is not seeking data in relation to legal proceedings for excise offences or customs criminal investigations.Revenue employs the services of six firms of external solicitors to effect recovery proceedings on its behalf.  The following table summarises the number of cases referred by Revenue to its solicitors, the value of debt in those cases and the debt recovered for each of the years requested. It should be noted that recovery may be effected by the firms concerned without the need to initiate formal legal proceedings before the courts.YearNo. of Cases Subject of referral to External SolicitorsValue of Debt ReferredDebt Recovered€m€m20067,018205.270.920076,143165.175.220086,578237.265.120096,832297.546.220106,668261.1432011 (Q1)1,69062.48.2IndividualsCompaniesYearNumberTotal amount inc. costs:NumberTotal amount inc. costs:€m€m200658018.917110.12007708301647.42008791252216.920091,0894333013.420101,50764.248920.8(Q1) 20111034.133917As part of the process of enforcing judgements obtained by Revenue, further legal action may be taken through the courts where the debt remains unpaid.

Bodies such as the Director of Public Prosecutions, Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement, Central Bank and Garda Síochána are statutorily independent in the exercise of their executive functions.  Consequently, I feel it would be inappropriate of me to make further comment, at this stage, which might prejudice the outcome of any such investigations.
#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-05-04 00:00:00	Prelude	443	As the Deputy may be aware, responsibility for the normal ongoing business of the bank, which includes staffing levels and the pay and conditions of the bank's staff, is a matter for the Board of Anglo.  Significant progress has been made by the Board in reducing staffing levels in the bank.  Anglo Irish Bank publishes information on its staffing levels and costs in its annual report and accounts.  The accounts for the financial year ended 31 December 2010 indicated that average staff levels in that year were 1,332 compared to 1,681 for the fifteen month period to end 2009, a reduction of 349.  Note 9 to those accounts also sets out the costs associate with these staff as well as other administrative expenses of the bank over these periods.The bank has also further informed my Department that the total headcount as at end December 2010 was 1,296 and that this has been further reduced in 2011 due to the fact that in February 2011, 210 staff transferred to AIB when the deposit books of the bank transferred to AIB.These are aggregate staffing levels in the bank and the turnover of staff has been even greater.  The bank has informed me that, since 2009, around 410 employees have joined the bank but that the number leaving over the same period has been even greater, at in excess of 1,000.  The bank also stated that where staff have been added, these were primarily to address turnover and resource requirements in the areas of asset recovery, risk management and control functions which are critical to the efficient work out of the bank's assets and the achievement of the maximum return for the shareholder.As regards future staffing requirements, a joint restructuring and work out plan for both Anglo Irish Bank and Irish Nationwide Building Society was submitted to the European Commission on 31 January.  Once a final decision is reached on this plan the number of staff and the required skill sets for the merged entity, will have to be considered by the Board of the new merged entity in conjunction with the NTMA.

When compared to the number of FÁS training places delivered in 2010 this is a reduction of 24,000 places. This reduction occurred because of the following reasons:FÁS budget for training the unemployed was reduced by €37 million in Budget 2011,FÁS will be providing more courses of longer duration in 2011 thereby reducing capacity,FÁS must invest more resources into ensuring the quality of its courses, andThere have been significant reductions in FÁS staff due to the Employment Control Framework.The Programme for Government contains a commitment that the Government within the first 100 days of taking office will provide a Jobs Initiative.

The schools involved have already received their staffing allocations for next year.For schools other than DEIS schools in receipt of enhanced pupil teacher ratios, alleviation measures are being provided to assist schools with high concentrations of Traveller pupils who were previously supported by RTT posts.  Any proposed alleviation measures must be considered in the context of the limited resources which are available to my Department. As such, alleviation measures are being concentrated on schools which have 33 or more pupils supported by RTT posts.The decision to withdraw Resource Teacher for Travellers was taken by the previous Government in the last Budget. The Deputy will understand that the economic situation means very difficult decisions have had to be taken. The requirement to make expenditure savings and to ensure that staffing numbers remain within the Public Service Employment Control Framework prevent me from re-visiting this decision.
#RuairiQuinn	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-party	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-dob	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-05-04 00:00:00	Prelude	448	My Department is currently working with the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel to prepare legislation which will give effect to the previous Government's decision to amalgamate the National Qualifications Authority of Ireland (NQAI), the Higher Education and Training Awards Council (HETAC) and the Further Education and Training Awards Council (FETAC). Drafting of the legislation is at an advanced stage and it is hoped to publish the Bill in the near future, with the new amalgamated body to be established before the end of the year.The previous Government decided to reduce the number of VECs from 33 to 16, and on the merger of particular VECs. I am anxious to ensure that progress continues to be made in the work on bringing about a reduction in the number of VECs. I extended an invitation to the Irish Vocational Education Association (IVEA) to submit alternative rationalisation proposals, as they had expressed concerns regarding the configuration of the proposed new entities. The IVEA has indicated to me that it will be responding shortly. I have made clear to the IVEA that while I am open to considering proposals on alternative configurations, the invitation does not mean that the process of rationalisation will be slowed or diminished in any way. In considering the submission from the IVEA regarding particular mergers, I will be seeking savings and ensuring that the new structure will involve a substantial reduction in the number of individual bodies but with each one of greater scale than is the case at present. I am confident that this merger will ensure an even higher quality educational service for students and the public alike. Regardless of the final shape of the re-configuration, there will still be a requirement for co-operation and joint endeavour between all of the new local bodies. The current work on arriving at a single grant awarding body for the student support schemes is a good example of avoiding duplication and achieving improved public service delivery. The rationalised new bodies will position the VEC sector to turn these challenges into opportunities.The new National Strategy for Higher Education provides a clear policy direction for the future development of roles and relationships between higher education institutions.  It reaffirms the importance of having a coherent network of institutions with a diversity of missions and a strong emphasis on consolidation and collaboration on a regional basis within both the university and Institutes of Technology sectors, to underpin quality, offer wider choice, more flexible learning opportunities and a high quality research system. A clear development pathway has also been laid out in the Strategy for amalgamated Institutes of Technology which meet specified performance criteria to seek re-designation as technological universities.  A small number of new technological universities, with their own legislative framework and a distinct mission that is faithful to the ethos of the technological sector, working with existing universities, institutes of technology and other education providers, can enrich the diversity and quality of the Irish higher education landscape.  It is my intention to publish the detailed performance criteria for a re-designation process at an early stage.The scope for further rationalisation of State bodies or agencies in the education sector will be examined in the context of the Comprehensive Spending Review announced recently by Government.  The Review is scheduled to be concluded by end September 2011 and the results will be brought before Government for consideration and decision in the annual Budget and Estimates process.

It further states "When registration for the sector and recognition of qualifications for the purpose of the post is achieved then incremental salary will be allowed from the date of registration."It is my understanding that the person referred to by the Deputy is in dispute with the Teaching Council regarding the receipt of her application for registration and has requested that her registration be backdated.  The Teaching Council have investigated the matter and decided that backdating her registration is not appropriate in this instance.

The NCSE operates within my Department's criteria in allocating such support. This now includes a requirement for the NCSE to have regard to an overall cap on the number of SNA posts.This number is 10,575 whole time equivalent (WTE) posts. This is a significant number of posts and unlike other areas of the public sector vacancies are being filled up to this number. It also represents continual increases in the number of SNAs over recent years. For example, there were 10,543 WTE SNA posts in place at the end of 2010 and 10,342 at end 2009.It is considered that with equitable and careful management and distribution of these resources that there should be sufficient posts to provide access to SNA support for all children who require such care support to attend school, in accordance with Departmental criteria.The NCSE has issued a circular to all schools advising of the allocation process for the 2011/2012 school year. A key feature of the amended scheme will be to provide for an annual allocation of Special Needs Assistant support to eligible schools.The NCSE asked schools to submit all applications for SNA support to them by 18th March, 2011 and intend to inform schools of their annual SNA allocation as soon as possible, in advance of the coming school year.My Department and I will be glad to consider any suggestions from school management or parent representative organisations as to how the allocation of SNA resources can best be managed within the context of the overall limit on SNA numbers established. In this regard I am committed to making whatever improvements are possible to the resource allocation system.

#RuairiQuinn	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-party	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-dob	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-05-04 00:00:00	Prelude	456	The main policy framework within which the upskilling agenda takes place is the National Skills Strategy published by the Expert Group on Future Skills Needs (EGFSN) in 2007.  The National Skills Strategy proposes a vision of Ireland in 2020 in which a well-educated and highly skilled population contributes optimally to a competitive, innovation-driven, knowledge-based, participative and inclusive economy.The drivers of change that result in higher levels of skill requirements for enterprise identified in the National Skills Strategy remain valid today as increasing globalisation and the proliferation of new and emerging technologies require continued responsiveness to capitalise on our human capital resources.  Under the strategy, by 2020 an additional 70,000 persons within the workforce require to upskill from levels 1 and 2 on the National Framework of Qualifications (NFQ) to level 3, 260,000 persons to progress to levels 4 and 5 and 170,000 persons to progress to levels 6-10.Significant progress has been made to date under the strategy despite the need to refocus significantly on the unemployment activation agenda.  For example, the percentage of the labour force with higher education qualifications at NFQ levels 6-10 rose from 33% in 2005 to 41% by the end of 2010 while the percentage at NFQ Levels 1-3  fell from 27% to 20% and the percentage at NFQ Levels 4 and 5 remained at 40%. However, significant challenges remain in attaining the 2020 strategy targets in full.The EGFSN advises the Government on current and future skills needs of the economy and on other labour market issues that impact on Ireland's enterprise and employment growth.  The EGFSN works directly in consultation with enterprises to identify specific current and future skills needs.  Higher education institutions are represented on the EGFSN and as a standard practice, engage with employers in the review and development of higher education programmes. This analytical approach enables education and training providers to adapt their provision to address skills needs.  It is also used to underpin labour market activation programmes such as the recent Higher Education Authority's "Springboard" initiative which is a competitive call for proposals for the provision of part-time higher education places for unemployed persons.The EGFSN produces sectoral reports with the objective of quantifying skills and labour requirements in sectors in the medium term as well as making recommendations to Government and education and training providers as to how skills needs can be met.  This can entail, for example, developing new modules that build on existing qualifications of graduates; introducing work placement programmes to enhance graduate employability; conversion courses; or new programmes to upskill existing employees where new technologies, higher productivity requirements, new work practices or regulations are impacting significantly on skills and qualifications requirements.
#RuairiQuinn	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-party	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-dob	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2011-05-04 00:00:00	Prelude	457	I propose to take Questions Nos. 82 and 83 together.I wish to advise the Deputy that Special Needs Assistants (SNAs) are allocated to schools to enable them support pupils with an assessed special educational need who also have a significant medical need or a significant impairment of physical or sensory impairment.  Students with an assessed special educational need who present with significantly challenging behaviour may also qualify for some SNA support.  The qualifying criteria for the allocation of SNA support is outlined in my Department's Circular 07/02.The National Council for Special Education (NCSE) is responsible, through its network of local Special Educational Needs Organisers (SENOs) for allocating resource teachers and SNAs to schools to support children with special educational needs.  The NCSE operates within my Department's criteria in allocating such support, which now includes a requirement for the NCSE to have regard to an overall cap on the number of SNA posts.  This number is 10,575 whole time equivalent (WTE) posts.  This is a significant number of posts and unlike other areas of the public sector vacancies are being filled up to this number.  It also represents continual increases in the number of SNAs over recent years.  For example, there were 10,543 WTE SNA posts in place at the end of 2010 and 10,342 at end 2009.It is considered that with equitable and careful management and distribution of these resources that there should be sufficient posts to provide access to SNA support for all children who require such care support to attend school, in accordance with Departmental criteria.  The NCSE has issued a circular to all schools advising of the allocation process for the 2011/2012 school year.  A key feature of the amended scheme will be to provide for an annual allocation of Special Needs Assistant support to eligible schools.  The NCSE asked schools to submit all applications for SNA support to them by 18th March, 2011 and intend to inform schools of their annual SNA allocation as soon as possible, in advance of the coming school year.My Department and I will be glad to consider any suggestions from school management or parent representative organisations as to how the allocation of SNA resources can best be managed within the context of the overall limit on SNA numbers established.  In this regard I am committed to making whatever improvements are possible to the resource allocation system.

First, the application was submitted late and, second, the application was incomplete as it was not accompanied by any of the necessary supporting documentation.  The grant awarding body has advised that the student has now regularised matters and that it will be in a position to issue a decision on her application shortly.

It is a policy research think-tank and forum on EU affairs based in Dublin.  It provides members with information on impending EU policy developments and in-depth analysis of their implications for Ireland and Europe.  My Department is a corporate member, as are several Departments.  The only financial supports given to the institute by my Department have been the annual membership subscriptions.  These amounted to some €70,000, from 1998 to 2011.
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	21234	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-05-04 00:00:00	Prelude	460	The Competition Authority has published a number of reports resulting from studies it carried out on various sectors or professions since 2004.  The reports usually contain a suite of recommendations aimed at improving competition in the relevant area and are addressed to the responsible Department or body.  Such reports have included the medical and legal professions.Given the responsibility of my Department for competition policy in general, I will be reporting to Government shortly on the progress achieved by a number of Departments in the implementation of these recommendations.  However, it should be noted that responsibility for any proposals aimed at ending apparent restrictions on competition in a particular sector rests with the Minister with responsibility for that particular policy area.  For example, policy proposals concerning the legal and medical sectors are matters for my colleagues, the Ministers for Justice and Equality and Health and Children, respectively.I am not aware of any restrictions on competition in the accountancy profession. There is however a strong preference in the market for the services of the big four audit firms.  This is a feature worldwide and arises from the range and depth of their skills.  The European Commission's Green Paper on Audit proposes various ways to address the issue, including mandatory collaboration between Tier 1 and Tier 2 audit practices.  My Department will participate in any negotiations on these issues at EU level and will implement any regulations or directives, as appropriate, consequent on the Green Paper.
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	21234	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-05-04 00:00:00	Prelude	461	The moratorium on recruitment directed that from 27th March 2009, no public service post, however arising, may be filled by recruitment, promotion, nor payment of an allowance for the performance of duties at a higher grade.  Where vacancies arise Departments must reallocate or reorganise work or staff accordingly.  Any exceptions to this principle, occurring in very limited circumstances only, require the prior sanction of the Minister for Finance.Former Civil Servants who retired under the Incentivised Scheme of Early Retirement are ineligible for re-employment in the Civil Service.  Where, exceptionally, a business need exists to re-engage an individual with specialised skills who has availed of the scheme, this may only be done with prior Department of Finance sanction and for a limited period.  Pension abatement will apply to any such appointment.  In all cases the final public service employer should ensure that total superannuation benefits paid to a person who benefits under this Scheme should not exceed 40 years.
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	21234	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-05-04 00:00:00	Prelude	462	I understand that the Deputy is referring to difficulties being experienced by rights holders in the Irish music industry as a result of the downloading of copyright material on the Internet.Under existing legislation, any person who illegally uploads or downloads unlicensed music is liable for copyright infringement under the terms of the Copyright and Related Rights Act 2000.  Under Section 127 of the Act any such infringement is actionable by the copyright owner and in any such action, all relief by way of damages, injunction, account of profits or otherwise, is available to the plaintiff as it is available in respect of the infringement of any other property right.  Such a person, whose Internet Protocol address may be identified through various detection methods, may be pursued by the copyright holder following a judicial process (the obtaining of a so-called "Norwich Pharamacal" Order) from the courts.  Under this procedure, a court may order an Internet service provider to disclose the names of the alleged infringers through their IP addresses, subject to certain safeguards.The Deputy may also have in mind the recent ruling by Justice Charleton in a High Court case where the major record companies took an action, seeking injunctions pursuant to Sections 37 and 40 of the Copyright Act, against an internet service provider. In that case the Justice refused the application.  The implications of this judgement, and of consequent legislative change(s), is currently being considered by my Department in consultation with the Attorney General's Office and the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources.
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	21234	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-05-04 00:00:00	Prelude	463	As Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Innvovation one of my main priorities is to ensure that the manner in which State support for enterprise activity, entrepreneurship stimulation and job creation is delivered, is properly targeted and is effective and coherent. I want to ensure that it is cost effective and that the resources available to the State are used to maximise business activity and sustainability across all sectors in order to drive economic recovery.The County and City Enterprise Boards have been the principal deliverers of State support to the micro-enterprise sector since their establishment in 1993. The role of the CEBs is to support micro-enterprises employing up to 10 people in the start-up and expansion phases and to stimulate and promote economic activity and entrepreneurship at local level.  The CEBs deliver a series of Programmes to underpin this role and they can provide both financial and non-financial assistance to an eligible micro-enterprise.  This sector is a key component of the indigenous small business sector.  The micro-enterprise sector will be key to our economic recovery.  Parallel to the work of the CEBs is, of course, the work of Enterprise Ireland, whose remit includes the support of start-ups that have the potential to employ more than 10 and to achieve €1m in exports.  These are start-ups that are typically highly innovative and are in a position to sell globally from their earliest stage.The Programme for Government recognises that there is a multiplicity of enterprise and job support functions being carried out by local, regional and national agencies.  The Programme also recognises the need to streamline such functions, to increase shared knowledge capability and resources while saving on administration costs.  However, a critical focus in achieving any such streamlining, is to ensure that we do not compromise on service delivery to the end user.  While unnecessary overlap or duplication between agencies and organisations must be eliminated, as Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Innovation, it is my priority to ensure that above all else there is a coherent and cohesive delivery of State support to the indigenous business sector based on clear enterprise policy principles laid down by my Department.In relation to the CEBs, I think that their current structure is, in any event, in need of review and reform to move away from their current set up of 35 separate, legal entities with the resultant administrative overhead costs and inflexible staff deployment that this entails.  However, any changes to the CEB structure must not compromise the State's engagement with and support for our important micro-enterprise sector.As the Deputy is aware, the restructuring of the CEBs has been an issue in the public domain since the publication of the Report of the Special Group on Public Service Numbers and Expenditure Programmes (the "McCarthy Report") in July 2009. Subsequent to the publication of the McCarthy Report, Ministers of the last Government and their Departmental officials have had a variety of consultations and discussions with the main stakeholders involved, including CEB senior staff and Boards, Enterprise Ireland and the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government.  I understand that some discussions also took place with the County Managers Association at Ministerial level.  I am now actively considering the future structure of the CEBs and, in seeking to finalise any decision on their future, I can assure the Deputy that all points of view and, in particular, the needs of the end-user of the services of the CEBs will be fully taken into account.
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	21234	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-05-04 00:00:00	Prelude	464	An Exchequer allocation is provided each year under the Estimates process for the funding of the County and City Enterprise Boards (CEBs).  Allocation of funding to individual CEBs is carried out each year by the Central Coordination Unit (CCU) within Enterprise Ireland.  The CCU remit is to provide operational, technical and administrative support to the CEB Network. In determining these allocations a systematic approach is adopted by the CCU to ensure the maximum degree of objectivity and equity of treatment.  This approach involves the provision of funding on the basis of a standard allocation to each CEB as well as an extra allocation that is determined mainly by population but which also takes account of issues such as local unemployment trends, capacity to spend, existing commitments and regional spread.The CCU works closely with the CEBs throughout the year to ensure that the CEBs allocated funding is utilised to the maximum extent possible. Should it arise during the year that some Boards are not in a position to spend all of their annual allocation it is reallocated by the CCU to any Boards that are in a position to spend additional funds within the year, subject to assessment of the rationale and the justification for the level of funding being requested.  This general approach has been in place for the last few years and represents good management of the funding available for support of the micro-enterprise sector, particularly in the current difficult economic climate.Information on the Exchequer allocations for the 35 CEBs over the last four years is below.  In general most boards have fully used these allocations apart from where small amounts have been returned to the Exchequer at year end, or in the circumstances outlined above where monies were redistributed within the network.

The basic salary costs involved (including Employers PRSI) in 2010 was just over €340,000. It should be noted, however, that the staff member at Principal Officer level, whose full salary costs are included in the figure cited, is not exclusively assigned to the Micro-Enterprise Policy Unit but has responsibility for two other Business Units within the Department.  One other staff member works part-time.
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	21234	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-05-04 00:00:00	Prelude	466	In 2008 the European Commission put forward a proposal to amend the Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council on the term of protection of copyright and related rights (2006/116/EC).  Following first reading and examination in the European Parliament, a revised proposal was agreed in the Parliament in 2009.  This proposal was then discussed by the Committee of Permanent Representatives in Brussels but there was not a sufficient majority  amongst Member States to allow it to proceed to European Council level.In March of this year we received notification that Denmark, who had previously had a reserved position on the proposal, had carried out national consultations and was now ready to consider the European Parliament's first reading as an acceptable compromise.  Accordingly, the Danish Government has now invited the Hungarian Presidency to consider the proposal to amend the Directive concerned as an item on the agenda for the Council.

The Health Service Executive (HSE) has advised that in January 2011 it refused a mortgage interest supplement in this case on the grounds that the spouse of the person concerned was engaged in full-time employment.The HSE has further advised that this decision was subsequently appealed to and upheld by the HSE's designated Appeals Officer.
#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-05-04 00:00:00	Prelude	469	Under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme, an exceptional needs payment (ENP) may be made by the Health Service Executive (HSE) to help meet an essential once-off cost which the applicant is unable to meet out of his or her own resources. There is no automatic entitlement to this payment.  Each application is determined by the HSE based on the particular circumstances of the case. Eligible people would normally be in receipt of a social welfare or HSE payment.The HSE has advised that an application for assistance under the ENP scheme from the person concerned was refused in January 2010 and that this decision was subsequently upheld by the HSE Appeals Officer.  The person concerned applied for an ENP on 22 March 2011. This ENP application was also refused and the person concerned was notified of the decision and of his right to appeal to the HSE appeals office. To date no appeal has been submitted to the HSE.The person concerned is currently in receipt of Invalidity Pension, a personal rate of €193.50 per week.  He is also in receipt of a Fuel Allowance of €23.90 per week.

The person concerned has been notified of the decision.The legislation provides that an Appeals Officer may decide a case before him/her on the basis of the documentary evidence.  This course of action was taken in this case as it was considered that an oral hearing was not warranted.The Social Welfare Appeals Office functions independently of the Minister for Social Protection and of the Department and is responsible for determining appeals against decisions on social welfare entitlements.
#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-05-04 00:00:00	Prelude	471	PRSI differs substantially from the Universal Social Charge in that the Universal Social Charge is a tax on gross income whereas PRSI represents a contribution by, and in respect of, workers, which allows those workers to establish entitlement to a range of short and long term social insurance benefits.The basis and rationale for charging PRSI and the Universal Social Charge also differ significantly.  PRSI in respect of employees is payable by both the employee and the employer, whereas liability for the Universal Social Charge falls solely on the individual taxpayer.  The rate of PRSI contribution for employees and the self-employed differs substantially (14.75% is payable in respect of Class A employees, while 4% is payable by self-employed contributors).  This is reflected in the range of different benefits to which entitlement may be established.  The Universal Charge is applied to gross annual income (whether from employment or self-employment) where it exceeds €4,004 (€77 per week).The calculation of the likely additional yield if PRSI were charged on the same basis of assessment as the Universal Social Charge is not possible at this stage as it would involve estimation of additional income for the Social Insurance Fund as well as the costs attached to social insurance entitlements which are likely to arise.  Difficulty with the estimate is compounded by whether the rate of employer contribution would also change and whether, and at what level, a floor would apply.
#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-05-04 00:00:00	Prelude	472	The Department of Social Protection operates a range of employment support measures designed to encourage and support social welfare recipients of working age to reduce their dependency on welfare payments. Supports available include the back to work schemes, community initiatives and the part time job incentive scheme.  The Back to Work Enterprise Allowance (BTWEA) is designed to provide a monetary incentive for people who are long term dependant on social welfare payments to make engagement in self-employment financially attractive and viable, while allowing them to retain a reducing proportion of their qualifying social welfare payment over two years (100% in year 1 and 75% in year 2). The Short Term Enterprise Allowance (STEA) is payable to a person who qualifies for Jobseeker's Benefit and who wishes to commence in self employment and is payable for the duration of their Jobseeker's Benefit entitlement.  At the end of March 2011, there were 8,789 participants in the BTWEA scheme, 632 people availing of the back to work employee strand, which is closed to new applications since 1 May 2009, and 1,206 participants in the STEA.The Rural Social Scheme (RSS), Community Services Programme (CSP) and Tús are community initiatives administered by the Department that provide income support and employment opportunities through the delivery of services to the community. There are 2,600 participants engaged in the RSS, which provides income support for farmers and fishermen/women who are currently in receipt of specified Social Welfare payments, to provide certain services of benefit to rural communities.  There are 2,700 people engaged in the CSP, which supports the delivery of good quality local services in areas such as management of community facilities, operating community enterprises and operating community services that address disadvantage, while providing funding to employ people with limited work opportunities.Tús is a new initiative, announced in the Budget of December 2010, which will be an important element in the delivery of employment and community services and which aims to provide short-term, quality work opportunities for those who are unemployed and provide certain services of benefit to communities. The scheme aims to provide for the phased placement of 5,000 people in the community and voluntary sector.A part-time job incentive scheme is also available which allows persons who are long-term unemployed to take up part-time employment for less than 24 hours per week and receive a weekly income supplement. There were 161 participants on this scheme at the end of March 2011.FÁS also operates a range of training and employment programmes in co-operation with community, voluntary and statutory organisations, including, principally, the Community Employment (CE) programme and the Work Placement Programme (WPP).  The CE programme is designed to help people who are long-term unemployed and other disadvantaged people to get back to work by offering part-time and temporary placements in jobs based within local communities. There are 23,300 places available in 2011.The WPP was established to provide an opportunity for people who are unemployed to take up voluntary, unpaid work experience placements within companies.  Following a Government Decision in November 2010, an enhanced work placement programme involving 5,000 placements in the public sector and an additional 500 placements for graduates in the private sector was approved. As of 31 March 2011, FÁS recorded a total of 1,804 participants on the WPP. In addition, FÁS were advertising 1,321 opportunities for the WPP waiting to be filled.
#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-05-04 00:00:00	Prelude	473	The National Employment Action Plan is the main activation measure for jobseekers and provides for a systematic engagement of the employment services with unemployed people. Under the Plan, all persons between the ages of 18 and 65 years who are approaching three months on the Live Register are identified by the Department of Social Protection and referred to FÁS for interview with the aim of assisting them to enter/re-enter the labour market.The Employment Action plan process is a key element in addressing the progression needs of those on the Live Register.  It provides a stimulus to job search and affords an opportunity to explore, under professional guidance, the full range of employment and training services offered by FÁS.  In this context, FÁS will deliver at least 90,000 training places for the unemployed in 2011.The Department of Social Protection also operates a range of employment support measures designed to encourage and support social welfare recipients of working age to reduce their dependency on welfare payments. These include the Back to Work Enterprise Allowance (BTWEA) and the Short Term Enterprise Allowance. In addition, the Back to Education Allowance scheme (BTEA) encourages and facilitates people on certain social welfare payments to improve their skills and qualifications and, therefore, their prospects of returning to the active work force.The Programme for Government states that a new National Employment and Entitlements Service will be established under the management of the Department of Social Protection.  The objective is to integrate the employment support services currently provided directly by the Department of Social Protection with those currently provided by FÁS into a single service. This service will also process payments in respect of employment related benefits and other benefits payable by the Department of Social Protection. The integration of employment services and related benefit payment services within the Department of Social Protection will provide a ‘one stop shop' for people wishing to establish their benefit entitlements, seek employment and / or seek advice about their training options.  The focus will be very much on the individual, his/her rights to a payment, his/her access to an opportunity to engage in employment, training or upskilling, as appropriate and his/her responsibility to engage with such opportunities as they are provided.A key objective of the Government in relation to the new service is that it will offer users a high level of personalised employment support and prioritise the provision of more intensive support for those on the live register who are identified as being most at risk of long-term unemployment.  This will be achieved through the use of proactive approaches and modern case management systems.  A number of pilot projects have already commenced in relation to the development of case management, the identification of those who are most at risk of falling into long-term unemployment, and the provision of appropriately tailored responses to their needs.  These pilot projects will be completed and evaluated in the coming months after which approaches will be developed for their roll-out nationwide as part of the National Employment and Entitlements Service.

This should improve a person's life chances.It should be noted that responsibility for skills training undertaken by FÁS currently resides with the Department of Education and Skills. The future development of the training and skills services of FÁS is a matter for the Minister for Education and Skills.With regard to the timeline for the development of the National Employment and Entitlements Service, I am determined that this will be completed in the most expeditious manner possible and my officials are already actively engaged in a programme of work towards this end. While this will be a multi-annual programme of work requiring the development of the new service, the assignment of functions to the Service and the development of its organisational processes and operational systems, many aspects of the new service will be delivered within the coming 12 months.The administration of the supplementary welfare allowance scheme has already been transferred to the Department of Social Protection with the secondment of the Community Welfare Service from the Health Service Executive at the beginning of this year.  The intention is to have the staff fully transferred into the Department by the end of September this year.  This will enable us to integrate the payment of all benefits into one organisation simplifying customer processes.Planning for the transfer and integration of the Employment Services and Community Employment Services of FÁS to the Department has already commenced and it is envisaged that the transfer of staff will commence later this year.  Again this will enable us to simplify and integrate the delivery of employment support services to customers.A key objective of the Government in relation to the new service is that it will offer users a high level of personalised employment support and prioritise the provision of more intensive support for those on the live register who are identified as being most at risk of long-term unemployment.

In recognition however of the strategic national importance of transmission infrastructure and noting the concerns expressed in the context of the North-South project, my predecessor commissioned an independent study on Comparative Merits of Overhead Electricity Transmission Lines versus Underground Cables. The study was conducted by international consultants Ecofys, in partnership with an expert in underground cable technology, Professor Dr Heinrich Brakelmann of the University of Duisburg-Essen, Germany, and with Golder Associates, a global group specialising in ground engineering and environmental services. This study is available on my Department's website at the following address:  http://www.dcenr.gov.ie/Energy/ Electricity+Transmission+Grid/
The study was completed on a national basis and is not project specific.In addition, I will shortly appoint an independent international expert commission to review and report on a case for, and a cost of, undergrounding (all or part of) the Meath-Tyrone 400KV power lines, as outlined in the Programme for Government.The health effects of electromagnetic fields are a matter in the first instance for the Minister for Environment, Heritage and Local Government.

Among other things, it seeks to increase peoples' work readiness and employment prospects through the development of a range of services to support, prepare and assist people enter the labour market, the development of strategies with local enterprises to increase local employment prospects and the development of strategies to increase self employment prospects.While Pobal administers the LCDP on behalf of my Department, the programme is delivered locally through 52 Local Development Companies.  In the normal course of events, applicant groups should apply directly to these companies who are the principal decision-makers regarding the delivery of actions and allocation of funding under the programme. Neither my Department nor Pobal have any role in this regard.  However, if the Deputy wishes to provide me with the details of the network group in question, I would be happy to put the group in contact with the appropriate Local Development Company.Pobal also delivers a range of publicly funded programmes for other Government Departments and agencies and questions in relation to these programmes may be directed to the relevant Minister.

In the case of works to improve the energy efficiency of a dwelling, authorities are required to undertake a pre-works and a post-works Building Energy Rating (BER) assessment.  The amount of grant paid to housing authorities is proportional to the level of energy savings achieved.  Where an overall energy saving of more than 300 kWh per M2/year is achieved, a grant of up to 90% of cost or €18,000, whichever is the lesser, is recouped to the authority, reducing to 50% or €6,000, whichever is the lesser, in cases where an energy saving of between 50 and 100 kWh per M2/year is achieved.Longford County Council received an allocation of €425,000 in respect of improvement works to their social housing stock in 2011. It is a matter for the Council to select the properties to be upgraded and to determine the nature and the scale of the works to be undertaken in each case. In 2010, Longford County Council advised my Department of their intention to carry out improvement works to six houses in McHugh Park. So far, a total of €6,300 has been recouped to the Council in respect of insulation and damproofing works carried out at these houses. The Council envisage that the energy savings in each of the six properties will be around 55 kWh per M2/year.

I understand that planning permission for mixed use development was granted by the Council on 19 November 2003 subject to a number of conditions.  It is the responsibility of the developer to implement planning permission and to comply with any conditions attaching to that permission.Enforcement of planning control is a matter for the Council which can take action, inter alia, where the terms of a permission have not been met.  I understand that there are ongoing legal proceedings being taken by Dublin City Council regarding compliance with this permission.  I have no role in the matter.  Under section 30 of the Planning and Development Act 2000, I am specifically precluded from exercising any power or control in relation to any particular case with which a planning authority or An Bord Pleanála is or may be concerned.In addition to the above, the national Building Regulations set out the legal requirements for the design and construction of new buildings, including houses, extensions and material alterations and certain changes of use of existing buildings. The related Technical Guidance Documents provide technical guidance on how to comply with the Regulations.   Compliance with the Regulations is the responsibility of the owner or builder of a building.  Enforcement of the Regulations is the responsibility of the 37 local building control authorities who are empowered to carry out inspections and initiate enforcement proceedings, where considered necessary.  Where building defects occur, their remediation is a matter for the parties concerned, namely the building owner, the relevant developer and the builder's insurers, in line with any contractual arrangements agreed between the parties.While I do not intend to establish a commission of enquiry, it should be noted that this estate has been identified in the National Housing Development Survey database, published in October 2010, which established an authoritative baseline analysis of unfinished housing developments to assist in fully understanding the scale and extent of the issues involved; the analysis is informing the work of the high-level Expert Group on Unfinished Housing Developments, established in November 2010, in identifying practical and policy solutions to address the difficulties associated with unfinished housing developments effectively and promptly.  I expect the Advisory Group's Final Report to be submitted to me shortly; I will consider its findings and recommendations as a matter of urgency and will bring proposed actions and recommendations to Government for approval.Consumer protection in the area of quality construction of new dwellings is a critical issue and I have also asked my Department to prioritise the formulation of policy proposals that will enhance compliance and enforcement of the building regulations in general.

In relation to waste water treatment capacity, the study recommended that, in addition to the expansion of the Ringsend waste water treatment plant, a future regional wastewater treatment plant should be constructed in the Portrane/Donabate area of Fingal.  Fingal County Council decided that certain aspects of the GDSDS should first be subjected to a Strategic Environmental Assessment.The Strategic Environmental Assessment assessed sixteen strategic drainage options for the Greater Dublin Area and concluded that a new regional wastewater treatment plant should be built in the Northern Greater Dublin Area and that the outfall should be located along the North Dublin coastline following a detailed site selection process.All of the local authorities accepted the outcome of the Strategic Environmental Assessment and Fingal County Council has appointed a consultant to prepare a Preliminary Report for the scheme, including a recommendation on the optimum location for the proposed treatment plant. The location of the new plant is to be determined based on the site selection criteria set out in the Environmental Report of the Strategic Environmental Assessment.

In the case of Dublin City Council, this was 19.5 weeks, and in the case of Fingal County Council, this was 18 weeks.  The time taken to relet the unit following completion of necessary works was indicated as being four weeks for Dublin City Council and one week for Fingal County Council.In the context of current constraints on the public capital programme and the reduction in new social housing supply, returning vacant stock to use, in as short a time as possible, continues to be a major priority for my Department.  As well as internal local authority resources, Exchequer funding is provided by my Department to assist and incentivise authorities in maintaining an active voids reletting programme.  My Department remains committed to the funding of improvement works programmes which are an important source of additional supply of accommodation to meet housing need.

The new arrangements will be publicly announced once my Department is in a position to implement them.The granting of Irish citizenship through naturalisation is a privilege and an honour which confers certain rights and entitlements not only within the State but also at European Union level and it is important that appropriate procedures are in place to preserve the integrity of the process.I should remind the Deputy that queries in relation to the status of individual Immigration cases may be made direct to INIS by Email using the Oireachtas Mail facility which has been specifically established for this purpose.

The Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act, 1956, as amended, provides that the Minister may, in his absolute discretion, grant an application for a certificate of naturalisation provided certain statutory conditions are fulfilled. The conditions are that the applicant must—be of full age;be of good character;have had a period of one year's continuous residency in the State immediately before the date of application and, during the eight years immediately preceding that period, have had a total residence in the State amounting to four years; andhave made, either before a Judge of the District Court in open court or in such a manner as the Minister for special reasons allows, a declaration in the prescribed manner, of fidelity to the nation and loyalty to the State.In the context of naturalisation, certain periods of residence in the State are excluded. These include:periods of residence in respect of which an applicant does not have permission to remain in the State;periods granted for the purposes of study; andperiods granted for the purposes of seeking recognition as a refugee within the meaning of the Refugee Act, 1996.It is open to any individual to lodge an application for citizenship if and when they are in a position to meet the statutory requirements as prescribed in the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act 1956 as amended.I should remind the Deputy that queries in relation to the status of individual Immigration cases may be made direct to INIS by Email using the Oireachtas Mail facility which has been specifically established for this purpose.

#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-05-04 00:00:00	Prelude	491	Applications for refugee status in the State are determined by an independent process comprising the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner (ORAC) and the Refugee peals Tribunal (RAT) which make recommendations to the Minister for Justice and Equality on whether such status should be granted.During 2010, the median processing time for asylum applications by the ORAC was 6 to 7 weeks from the date of application in the case of prioritised applications, and 9 weeks from the date of application in the case of non-prioritised applications.  There were 541 cases on hand in the ORAC on 31 December, 2010.  The median processing times for RAT appeals in 2010 was 33 weeks in the case of substantive appeals (cases involving an oral hearing) and 9 weeks in the case of accelerated appeals (appeals on the papers).  On 31 December, 2010 there were 888 appeals on hand.I would point out that some cases can take significantly longer to complete due to, for example, delays arising from medical issues, non-availability of interpreters or because of judicial review proceedings.  All asylum applications and appeals are processed in accordance with the Refugee Act 1996 and high quality and fair decision-making in all cases continues to be a key priority at all stages of the asylum process.  For the sake of completeness, I should also state that persons who are refused a declaration under Section 17 of the Refugee Act 1996 (as amended) enter what is commonly referred to as the "leave to remain" process which generally has two elements to it; an application for subsidiary protection and further consideration to be given under Section 3 of the Immigration Act 1999 (as amended). This is separate to the asylum or refugee status determination process.The processing of cases at this point is also complex and extremely resource intensive given that where an application for subsidiary protection is lodged in addition to representations for consideration under Section 3 of the Immigration Act 1999 (as amended), the subsidiary protection application must be considered first to assess whether the applicant has an identifiable need for international protection. The investigation of such applications requires a fresh examination of the entire asylum file, the documentation and country of origin information submitted in support of the application, as well as an examination of objective, reputable, up to date country of origin information before a conclusion can be arrived at as to whether or not the applicant is likely to be exposed to ‘serious harm' if returned to his/her country of origin. Where such an application is refused, consideration must then be given to the case in accordance with the provisions of Section 3 of the Immigration Act 1999 (as amended), at which point the Minister must make a decision whether or not to make a deportation order in respect of the person. All of this must be done in strict compliance with the Constitution, together with relevant international law including the European Convention on Human Rights.  It will be seen that these are not quick or easy decisions to make and, given the life changing consequences for the persons involved, these are decisions which must be taken with the most scrupulous care and attention.I am taking steps to speed up the processing of these applications by redeploying staff from primarily the refugee determination bodies.  The Immigration, Residence and Protection Bill 2010 which provides for the introduction of a single procedure to determine applications for protection and other reasons to remain in the State, should substantially simplify and streamline the existing arrangements.  This re-organisation of the protection application processing framework will remove the current multi-layered processes and provide applicants with a final decision on their application in a more ‘straight forward' and timely fashion.

The Community-based CCTV Scheme was launched in 2005 to provide financial assistance towards the capital costs of establishing a community CCTV system. To date, two major rounds of the scheme have been advertised, in 2005/2006 and 2007, under which 45 substantive schemes have been approved funding. Any further plans for an extension of Community CCTV are dependent on a number of factors, including the progression of the schemes already grant aided, the availability of funding and overall policy considerations.  Garda CCTV systems are planned and implemented on the basis of the Garda Commissioner's identified operational needs and priorities, taking into account available resources.

While the advance payment due under the scheme issued on 16 November 2010, the balancing payment is outstanding as issues have since come to light relating to a portion of those payment entitlements leased-in by the person named. It is expected that this matter will be resolved shortly, following which a balancing payment will issue to the applicant.
#SimonCoveney	unknown-#SimonCoveney-party	unknown-#SimonCoveney-dob	unknown-#SimonCoveney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-05-04 00:00:00	Prelude	502	I can confirm that Ireland will be taking a very strong stance in the upcoming negotiations on the next EU multi-annual financial framework to ensure that CAP funds are protected.  Ireland is committed to maintaining a strong and effective CAP which will support a vigorous consumer-focused agricultural production base in Europe.I am committed to continued decoupling because I believe that decoupled payments provide the best basis for stability and security in income support to farmers while allowing them the freedom to respond to the demands of the market.As to payment models, there is very little support among my colleagues in other EU member states for the current model of decoupled payments based on the 2000 to 2002 reference period.  For that reason I am seeking maximum flexibility to tailor the payment model to our own circumstances in Ireland.I agree that there is a need to avoid massive changes in payments between farmers.  This is one of the reasons why I have sought flexibility in the payment models within member states and why I will be insisting that any changes that might be made to the current regime will be introduced very gradually over a lengthy period of time.   As to the scale of beef imports from South America, I am well aware of the dangers posed by the current negotiations for a free trade agreement with the MERCOSUR group of South American countries.  Food Harvest 2020, our strategy for growth of the Irish agri-food industry to 2020, envisages a 20% growth in output value for beef over the period.  A MERCOSUR deal would raise serious questions regarding the viability of this strategy.  Given the importance of the export-led agri-food industry to our economic recovery, an agreement with MERCOSUR to allow large quantities of South American food into the EU high value beef market, replacing Irish exports is something I cannot support.Indeed the initial presentation last week from the EU Commission of its impact assessment of a free trade agreements with the MERCOSUR group of South American countries was quite shocking and confirmed the point I have been making for the past number of weeks that a MERCOSUR deal would damage EU and Irish agriculture.  Ireland cannot afford to allow the Irish and European agri-food sectors to be sacrificed to get a trade agreement.As the deputy is aware the young farmers installation scheme was closed to new applicants on 14 October 2008 and I have no plans to reopen entry to the scheme at this time.   An allocation of almost €1 million has, however, been provided in 2011 to meet the remaining commitments under the young farmers installation scheme and the preceding equivalent schemes.Under the terms of the 2010 agri-environment options scheme, all applications must be administratively checked before payment can issue to any individual and this process is ongoing.  This work is being prioritised and payments will issue at the earliest possible date.  While with the prioritisation of funding to deliver €5,000 AEOS scheme for 2011 and 2012, I have made provision for €25 million per year for five years to fund 2011 applications to join the scheme.  I have fixed the maximum payment to any individual farmer applying in 2011 at €4,000.  Further participation, beyond 2011, in agri environment schemes will have to be determined within the limits of the level of funding which will be available to my Department.Because of the overall funding constraints and in order to ensure that as many applicants can be accepted into the scheme, the rate for designated land will be €75 per hectare.I want to assure the deputy that I am strongly committed to the development of the beef and sheep sectors.  The Food Harvest 2020 Report, developed in consultation with stakeholders across the agri food sectors, establishes a road map for development and I am personally chairing a high level group to oversee its implementation.The Government has already committed significant funding to these sectors.  Already in 2011 approximately €16.4 million has been paid through the suckler cow welfare scheme in respect of animals born in 2010, and depending on the number of successful applications, this figure has the potential to double by year end.  In the sheep sector, some €54 million has been made available from the EU direct payments envelope for the three year grassland sheep scheme, while some €8 million has been committed for the sheep fencing/mobile handling equipment scheme.  My Department also provides some €28 million in grant in aid to Bord Bia, which is active on EU and third country markets in promoting Irish beef and sheepmeat.In relation to the funding of discussion groups, I am of course aware of the significant benefit of such arrangements in the dairy sector.  In so far as future expenditure commitments are concerned, including for discussion groups in the beef and sheep sectors, the realities of the public finances mean that difficult choices will have to be made when it comes to allocating scarce Exchequer resources.  I can assure the Deputy, however, that my approach to these matters will be informed by the need to ensure that scarce public resources are utilised to best effect to facilitate the development of the beef, sheep and other agrifood sectors.

#DrJamesReilly	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-party	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-dob	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-05-04 00:00:00	Prelude	504	The Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE) programme, which was introduced in January 2010, is a universal programme which provides children with one free pre-school year prior to commencing primary school.There is no entitlement under the programme to any additional provision.  The programme does, however, include a number of provisions to take account of children with special needs.  These include an exemption from the upper age limit for qualification under the programme where a child is developmentally delayed and would benefit from starting primary school at a later age.  In addition, children with special needs can apply to have the pre-school year split over two years on a pro-rata basis, for example availing of the scheme for 2 days a week in the first year and for 3 days a week in the second year.While some children with special needs are availing of the free pre-school year in specialist services, many are availing of it in mainstream settings, or a mixture of the two.  In February 2010, shortly after the introduction of the programme, to ensure a coherent approach to service provision and supports for children with special needs across both specialist and mainstream settings, the Office asked the Office of Disability and Mental Health to set up a Working Group to look at existing services and supports for pre-school children with special needs and the way in which these are allocated.  This group is expected to report shortly.A limited number of children with severe disabilities who had availed of the programme in the introductory short-year period of January to June 2010, were approved on an exceptional basis for re-entry to the scheme in September of that year, the first full year of the programme.  Each request was examined taking account of the information provided in detailed assessment reports.  I understand that an application for a second free pre-school year was made on behalf of the child referred to by the Deputy but that the information provided did not confirm a diagnosis of severe disability and re-entry to the programme was not approved.

The Irish Expert Body on Fluorides and Health, which was established in 2004, monitors new and emerging issues on fluoride and its effects on health and related matters.  The expert body advises that the balance of scientific evidence worldwide confirms that water fluoridation, at the optimal level, does not cause any ill effects and continues to be safe and effective in protecting the oral health of all age groups.  I have no plans to discontinue the policy of fluoridation of public water supplies, which continues to make an effective contribution to oral health in Ireland.
#DrJamesReilly	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-party	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-dob	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-05-04 00:00:00	Prelude	506	The Government's central policy objective for people with disabilities is that people should be supported "to lead full and independent lives, to participate in work and society and to maximise their potential".  In line with this policy, the Government's Programme for National Recovery 2011-2016 contains a commitment to "ensure that the quality of life for people with disabilities is enhanced and that resources allocated reach the people who need them.".Research, both international and national, confirms that the needs of people with a disability are most appropriately met and provided in their home and community and that this provides a more sustainable model for the provision of care.  The Government's commitment to people with disabilities is one whereby the focus of any supports should be based on individual need as much as possible and, while there is no "one size fits all" solution, the focus of supports should favour the individual rather than an organisation or service provider.A review of the efficiency and effectiveness of disability services funded from the health Vote is currently underway and will be completed later this year.  As part of this review an expert reference group was established to review current policy in relation to disability services.  Although it is important not to pre-empt any recommendation that may arise out of this process,  a key theme emerging is the need for a shift in funding from organisations to individuals.  This might or might not involve the transfer of actual funds to the individual.  While direct payment may be considered in the future, a shorter term goal would be the transfer to the individual of choice and control over support and care decisions through the mechanism of individualised budgeting.I understand that the Health Service Executive is supporting a direct payments model for two people with a disability in the Cavan-Monaghan area.  In addition, my Department through the Genio Trust is supporting a new innovative initiative for five individuals to manage and direct their personal assistant supports by receiving direct payments to purchase the supports they decide they need.  The evaluation of this initiative will inform the implementation of the policy proposals currently being developed.

Local Authorities submitted written proposals to my Department which were assessed by a selection panel. A decision has yet to be announced regarding the outcome of the Smarter Travel Areas Competition.The future of the Programme is being considered in the context of the available budget for 2011 and the National Recovery Plan. However, this programme is one I believe has considerable merit. While the scope and scale originally envisaged for the scheme is no longer possible given the current fiscal situation, there may be some scope to proceed with a scheme scaled back in size. I believe that Smarter Travel Areas have the potential to provide a basis for future evidence based investment in the range of sustainable travel measures.The local authorities concerned will be notified of the outcome of the review in due course. Finally, given the current status of the Competition as outlined, it is premature at this stage to confirm review processes for future initiatives and funding provisions for existing Competition applications. I intend to formally delegate the Smarter Travel Areas under the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport to the Minister for State for Public and Commuter Transport, Deputy Alan Kelly, in the coming days.
