Day after day it is as if they do not exist.  In fairness to Deputy Harney, she is in the Chamber for the opening of the Dáil session if she is around.Yesterday, the Governor of the Central Bank stated that he expects the economy to contract by at least 6% and that it will have contracted by 10% by the end of the year.  He cited unpublished estimates on what is now a very serious situation.  Two weeks ago, the Tánaiste stated the public finances were under control.  Last week, the Taoiseach indicated he was not aware of the scale of the problem until the Cabinet meeting where figures were produced.In light of all the calls, from the Minister for Finance and others, for national solidarity and requests for suggestions and constructive proposals, is the Taoiseach prepared to make available to Opposition spokespersons for finance the options and information being presented to the Cabinet by the Department of Finance in respect of spending options and raising revenue to deal with the crisis?  Is he prepared to make available the options sent to the Government by an bord snip which were transferred to it from every Department?  If we are to make any constructive suggestions or proposals in the national interest to deal with this financial crisis then at least we should be made aware of what is on the table.The presentation given in good faith by the Minister for Finance to Opposition spokespersons was very stark and bald in its outcome which was merely the shortfall in tax and the overspend on the current side but there was nothing in terms of the proposals being considered by the Government.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-03-11 00:00:00	Prelude	7	With regard to what the Governor of the Central Bank had to say, he and many others have been revising not only national forecasts but international forecasts.  Last week we also saw this in the European Commission.  It is important to acknowledge that the situation creates a very serious challenge for this economy, as it does elsewhere.  It is particularly the case for Ireland and we intend to address the issue in the supplementary budget.With regard to the question raised by Deputy Kenny on any views the Opposition has or interaction that could take place, this would be a matter for the finance spokespersons and the Minister for Finance.  I must say, and Deputy Kenny is aware of this, that budgetary matters are confidential.  They are within the Government remit in terms of——

#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-03-11 00:00:00	Prelude	16	For quite a long time, the Governor of the Central Bank has been pointing out in the quarterly reports the dangers to the economy of proceeding down the road of construction in the main.  Following his announcement yesterday, it is clear  the situation is exceptionally grave, although he did not provide the unpublished estimates he mentioned at the Oireachtas committee meeting yesterday.I respect the fact that the budget is absolutely confidential to the Cabinet.  Budgetary decisions are confidential and that is the Cabinet's constitutional business.  However, the options being considered and given to the Cabinet by an bord snip and by different Departments are only that.  They are only options from which the Cabinet can choose either to select some of those options or ignore them and come up with their own considerations.The Fine Gael Party, through our spokesman, Deputy Bruton, has been raising the issue for a few years of the way budgets should be constructed, about how efficiency can be levered out of the economy in terms of securing value for money and projecting signposts ahead on the economic landscape so that people in their personal and business lives can plan for investment and what they want to do.  I am being told by retailers around the country that they cannot get an overdraft for €3,000 or €5,000 and they face redundancy as a consequence.  These are the practical, human considerations that apply every day.I agree with the Taoiseach when he claims that budget matters decided by the Cabinet are confidential, but if he expects the Opposition parties to make any kind of constructive proposals to the Minister for Finance, then the least to which we should be entitled is the range of taxation proposals and options for spending cuts being considered by an bord snip and, consequently, the Department of Finance through to the Cabinet.  Is there any reason the Taoiseach will not give that full range of proposals and options to the Opposition parties?  We have not got a copy of the report by PricewaterhouseCoopers.  We are now told that the Government is only being given very stark figures on the economy, such as a €3 billion shortfall on tax and a €2 billion shortfall on the spending side.Aside from the constitutional confidentiality requirements, is there a reason the Taoiseach will not give us the full range of proposals so that we can offer constructive suggestions?  This party has put forward proposals for drastic change in the way budgets are drafted and on regulation regarding the spending of the people's money.  Is he prepared to give us the options considered by the Government, from which it has an absolute right to make its decision at the end of the day?

#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-03-11 00:00:00	Prelude	19	The one thing we can all say is that the decisions that must be taken will be difficult.  There are no easy options here.  In fact, we have seen a deterioration taking place as the year has progressed, which has mirrored what is happening in the international economy.  Whatever about people's ideas on reforms of budgetary processes for the future, a supplementary budget must be brought into this House in early April.  The Cabinet met this morning and we intend bringing that budget before the House on 7 April.  That will enable Members to debate the budget on that Tuesday and the following Wednesday and Thursday.  Perhaps we should come back a week earlier than suggested so instead of returning on 28 April, we should come back on 22 April and resume the debate.
#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-03-11 00:00:00	Prelude	20	I thank the Taoiseach for finally giving us the date of the second budget for 2009.  I would like to pursue further the issue of providing information to the Opposition.  The Taoiseach and the Minister for Finance have invited the Opposition parties to engage with the process and to put forward proposals.  The Labour Party is very willing to do that.  However, there is a certain amount of basic information that we need.What is the second budget intended to achieve?  What is the gap in money terms that the second budget is intended to close?  When the Taoiseach announced last week that there would be a second budget, he told us that the shortfall was between €2.5 and €3.5 billion.  When our spokesperson was briefed by the Department of Finance, we were told that the shortfall was €3.5 billion to €4.5 billion.  Since then, there has been speculation that it may be as high as €5 billion.  There is quite a gap between the Taoiseach's original estimate last week of €2.5 billion and the €5 billion that is now speculated.  What is the Government attempting to achieve in the budget?  Where between those two figures does the real figure rest?  We need to know this before we can start out on any exercise.Is it intended to do that for the remainder of 2009?  If the Government brings in a budget on 7 April, many of the measures contained in it will have to be introduced in a finance Bill and these will not kick in until the beginning of May at the earliest.  Therefore, we are talking about an eight month period.  Is it intended to make up the gap within eight months?Do the projections for our public finances given to the European Commission between now and 2013 still stand?  Can the Taoiseach tell us the current Government estimate of revenue and expenditure?  What is the projection for that between now and 2013?I presume the Department of Finance would have received by now some revised estimates for 2009 from the line Departments.  We need this information if we are to address the expenditure side.  Individual Departments will have worked out what will happen to various programmes and what capital projects might go ahead or be postponed.  I presume this information has been made available to the Department of Finance and we need it if we are to put forward realistic proposals to the Government for the budget.  In support of what Deputy Kenny said, I ask the Taoiseach to provide that information to the Opposition parties.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-03-11 00:00:00	Prelude	21	For the purpose of accuracy, Deputy Gilmore's first reference to the €2.5 billion to €3 billion shortfall was related to the Exchequer returns, which were to be officially announced within 15 minutes.  Obviously, I provided that information to the Deputy.  The shortfall was estimated by the Department of Finance regarding revenues at that point.  That is what the Exchequer returns are about and I gave the Deputy this information, which was in line with the information subsequently provided by the Department of Finance.The second point relates to expenditure pressures which were arising as a result of increased unemployment and so on.  The Department estimated this to be between €1 billion and €1.5 billion.  That would bring the discrepancy to between €4 billion and €4.5 billion, and this relates to the Department's estimate at the end of February of the deficit on the tax side and what was emerging on the expenditure side.It is a matter for the political judgment of the Government to decide what further necessary steps we will take beyond those points.  We wish to ensure we deal with the matter for the remainder of 2009 in a way which would be seen to be credible by international markets based on the emerging figures.  One of the difficulties that Deputy Gilmore and others have, no more than ourselves, is the fact that the deterioration we have seen in the last quarter of 2008 and the beginning of 2009 is a moving target in terms of the problems of addressing accurately what the ultimate position will be in the contraction of the economy during the course of this year.  It was said at budget time it would be in the region of 2%, it was said in January it would be approximately 4% and the indications are now that it could be 6% or 6.5%.This shows the fragility of the economy and the need for the Government during the course of the coming period leading up to the budget to decide the balance and the correct approach, both in terms of imposition of further taxation to meet the revenue shortfall and in addressing the expenditure overruns as they are emerging, such that we have a budgetary position which is more in line with our publicly stated position to the European Commission.  I believe that not only is it necessary to indicate this for the course of the year, but it is also necessary to try to put it into a multi-annual framework, such that we can show the country and the international community our intentions in addition to what will be required this year.  We do so in order that we can be as open and as frank about these issues with the people.  This is the approach of Government and the process has begun.Political decisions will be required before any final decisions are taken and this will require a good deal of political discussion within Cabinet during the course of the coming weeks.  In the meantime I suggest that if Deputy Gilmore so wishes, his finance spokesperson should consult with the Minister for Finance to see in what way he can further assist in respect of any additional queries he has with regard to the broad framework I have outlined.
#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-03-11 00:00:00	Prelude	22	Correct me if I am wrong, but the position as I understand it is that the object or target that the Taoiseach is trying to achieve in the second budget is to find between €4 billion and €4.5 billion.  I understand from what he has said that his intention is to do so for 2009.  What assessment has been made by the Government or by his advisers?  Will he make available to us information as to the impact such a hit on the public finances will have on the wider economy?  It is rather a big hit if one takes between €4 billion and €4.5 billion out of the finances for the remainder of 2009.  Several commentators speculated as to what this would do to jobs and businesses and in respect of the wider impact on the economy.  It would be very helpful if we could have available to us the advice that the Taoiseach has available to him regarding the economic implications of such a move.In his reply the Taoiseach stated that he wished to put this in a multi-annual context and I understand why he wishes to do so.  This is why I have asked him to let us have the Government's projections for revenue and expenditure between now and 2013.  I refer to 2013 because that is the date given.  I am aware he is smiling, but the Taoiseach provided a document.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-03-11 00:00:00	Prelude	23	I know that.

It is one matter to discuss the multi-annual context, but let us see the colour of it.  We are entitled to be told the details of the estimate and projections for that multi-annual period.We also require a third element, to which Deputy Kenny and I have already referred.  The Opposition parties are prepared to engage constructively with this process.  However, we must have available to us the information that the Taoiseach has at his disposal.
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-03-11 00:00:00	Prelude	25	Deputy Gilmore is correct.
#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-03-11 00:00:00	Prelude	26	We must have available to us the information provided to the Minister for Finance from the various Departments.  For example, I refer to expenditure information on education, health, the roads programme, public transport or any of the programmes and expenditures which arise.  We must have access to that information, because we cannot fly blind.I appreciate the Taoiseach's remarks to the effect that we can have a Dáil debate on the matter.  That is a public exchange, which is fine, and it may be useful.  However, if the Taoiseach wishes for the Opposition parties to meaningfully engage in the initiative to address the state of the public finances he must make available to us the information available to him.  This is either a genuine exercise or it is a political smokescreen.  I hope it is a genuine exercise, but the test of that will be whether the Taoiseach is prepared to make available to us what he has been told by the line Departments in respect of expenditures, projections and the revisions of Estimates.

#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-03-11 00:00:00	Prelude	37	Hold on one moment.  The process has begun and the Government must make the decisions.  I am providing the estimates emerging from the Department of Finance as of this time.  It is a matter for the Government to make a final decision on the matter.  We are in a budgetary process which is not complete, which has recently begun, and which is supplementary to the process in which we engaged last year.  That is for the purposes of accuracy.We have forwarded a stabilisation update, as it is known, to the European Commission indicating over a five-year period how we intend to try to restore the public finances to balance in line with the rules that apply under the Stability and Growth Pact, which amounts to the terms and conditions under which we are members of the eurozone.  That is a requirement we must meet and we have done so.The Deputy is aware of the broad aggregate figure submitted.  We must take into account the continuing deterioration that is occurring.  Regarding the multi-annual framework to which I referred, I am trying to explain that it would be good for the public if the Government indicated its intention in respect of the budget not only this year, but the following year and perhaps into the following year again.  The Deputy has asked me to state exactly the position up to 2013.  It is not possible to find an economist who could state accurately the position in the past three months, because this is an unprecedented situation.  There has not been such a level of accuracy that far out.  Therefore, the Government has indicated its intentions in terms of our Stability and Growth Pact commitments.We are bringing forward a supplementary budget because the circumstances demand it in view of the deterioration we have seen in the public finances, even since the beginning of the year.  We have brought forward a €2 billion saving as an immediate response to that and as a first signal of our intent.  We must now proceed with a budget that will deal with taxation and expenditure and with necessary further corrections for this year.  We would intend indicating also during the course of the following year where we are going with further requirements.  The Minister for Finance has indicated as much and the best response I can provide is that the Deputy should consult with him.  The Minister will engage with the Deputy and will inform the House of the position, to the greatest extent possible and consistent with his budgetary responsibilities.  We must all engage on the seriousness of this issue given the magnitude and scale of the problem that we face and our ability to confront it collectively if possible.

Preparations are in hand on the final arrangements to give effect to this decision and the details will be announced in due course.  It is not possible to estimate the expected savings at this stage.As a result of the recent Government decision, my Department will achieve further savings of €583,000, which is a total saving of 2.8% on my Department's overall administrative budget for 2009.  These savings have been identified across a number of the Department's administrative and programme subheads, including travel and subsistence, consultancy, telecommunications services, office equipment and premises and training.  My Department's Revised Estimate for 2009 is €34.603 million, which is a reduction of 8% on the 2008 Revised Estimate.

Is it intended that the 8% reduction in professional fees will apply to the Central Statistics Office, Office of the Attorney General and Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions?  Are professional fees incurred by the Taoiseach's private office or the private offices of his Ministers of State?  If so, will the 8% reduction apply to such fees?  Do professional fees include the engagement of consultancy services by the Taoiseach's Department?
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-03-11 00:00:00	Prelude	42	On the engagement of consultancy services, as I have indicated, we have significantly reduced consultancy services in recent times.  The reduction is considerably more than 8% and may be more than 50%.  Some time ago, I answered a question on that specific point to that effect.On the Deputy's specific question on professional fees, the reduction will include professional fees incurred in the following categories: services of a medical, dental, pharmaceutical, optical, aural or veterinary nature; services of an architectural, engineering, quantity surveying or surveying nature; services in accountancy, auditing or finance; services of financial, economic, marketing, advertising or other consultancies; services of a solicitor or barrister or other legal services; geological services; and training services provided on behalf of Foras Áiseanna Saothair.  Those are the general areas to which the 8% across-the-board reduction in professional fees applies.  I do not have specific details on how the reduction applies to my Department but I will try to obtain them if the Deputy wishes.In terms of the application of the reduction in professional fees, I understand it will apply to all areas in which the State is being provided with professional services.

We have had questions about the tribunal, which comes within the remit of the Department of the Taoiseach, on a number of occasions in the House.  There is a degree of uncertainty about how much longer the tribunal will be in existence, when it will report and whether it will hold further public hearings.  Will the 8% reduction apply to legal fees arising from the tribunal?Is it intended to present a Revised Estimate for the Department of the Taoiseach arising from the reductions of 8% in professional fees, the reductions in consultancy services of the order of 50% to which the Taoiseach referred and the Department's expected compliance with the more general reduction in expenditure across Departments?  If so, when will it be presented?
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-03-11 00:00:00	Prelude	44	A Revised Estimate will not be presented before the supplementary budget which will take precedence.  A Department of Finance circular on the implementation of the 8% reduction in professional fees has been issued to all bodies and programmes in the Department's Vote.  The Department is reviewing contracts in place for professional services to revise fees downwards by 8% from 1 March 2009 for services to be rendered on or after this date.  The 8% reduction will apply to all tribunal legal fees and my Department has been in touch with the Moriarty tribunal to that effect.  That is the position.

Is he aware of or can he confirm reports last November indicating that, collectively, Departments, including his own, were expending in the order of €1.7 million per week on private consultancy engagements, in other words, the figure for the year was in the order of €90 million?Cé mhéad airgead a chaithfidh Roinn an Taoisigh ar sheirbhísí comhairleachta — consultancy services — i 2009?  Cé mhéad airgead a chaithfidh an Rialtas go ginearálta ar na seirbhísí sin i mbliana?  An bhfuil figiúr ag an Taoiseach le haghaidh 2008 chun comparáid a dhéanamh idir an méid a chaitheadh an bhliain seo caite agus an méid atá geallta ag Roinn an Taoisigh agus ag gach Roinn eile do 2009?
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-03-11 00:00:00	Prelude	46	Caitheadh €275,000 ar sheirbhísí comhairleachta an bhliain seo caite.  Tá an figiúr níos ísle — €118,000 — i mbliana de bharr cinneadh an Rialtais.  The figure is, therefore, €118,000 rather than €275,000.  Tá laghdú de 57% i gceist ón Meastachán a fhoilsíodh i 2008.A small number of possible consultancy requirements for 2009 have been identified to date.  I am satisfied procedures are in place which will ensure expenditure undertaken on consultancy is necessary and relevant guidelines are being followed.  Every effort is made by my Department to minimise expenditure on consultancy services.  However, where it is necessary to engage consultants to avail of their particular expertise or experience, the procurement of consultancy services is subject to public procurement guidelines and, where applicable, EU procurement rules and guidelines, with selection criteria geared to select the most economically advantageous tender.It is also our policy that skills transfer from consultants to departmental staff takes place as an integral part of all consultancy engagements.  The purpose of this is to increase the knowledge and expertise of departmental staff and reduce and, if possible, eliminate future dependence on consultants in the areas concerned.

Does the Taoiseach not agree it is important that this is pointed out specifically, not only in percentage terms of intent, but in realistic terms?  He has demonstrated it in the figures with regard to his own Department — I thank him for that — but if those figures are accurate, as were reported back in November, will the Taoiseach undertake to advise the various Opposition parties of the expected expenditure across all Departments in the current year so we can have the opportunity to understand and, I hope, appreciate the comparisons?
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-03-11 00:00:00	Prelude	52	It is important to mention the context.  We are talking about a total spend by Government, throughout all Departments and agencies, of €55 billion.  Consultants are required for particular areas of expertise, perhaps for very complex projects and so on.  Consultants are employed from time to time to protect the taxpayer's interests.  If the figure of €90 million mentioned by the Deputy is correct, in the context of a total spend of €55 billion, that is around 0.1% or 0.2% of total expenditure.  In an operation as complex as a modern Government, I do not believe that should be regarded automatically as being out of line with expectations, given the complexity and breadth of the work undertaken by Governments on an ongoing basis.

I understand there may be constitutional difficulties with reducing judges' salaries, but I am not sure there would be a difficulty in constitutional terms in requiring judges to contribute towards their pensions.

Will these savings go back to each Department's budget?  For example, the Department of Health and Children must save more than €1 billion on the general health budget.  Will the savings under discussion go back to this or any other Department, or will they go into a general pool of Government savings?
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-03-11 00:00:00	Prelude	61	In the context of overruns and budgetary pressures, the question of reducing costs to the Exchequer is not a matter of diverting funds but of saving them in budgets that are already under stress.  The Minister for Health and Children outlined in last night's debate the extent of the overrun and the fact that a certain amount has been catered for in the service plan.  The net figure she gave is less than the figure mentioned by the Deputy.  It is not a question of saving some money which can then be put towards the health service.  What we are doing is saving money that is being spent by the health service in respect of those who have a contractual relationship with the health service for the provision of services.  It is a question of reducing output costs rather than providing extra money for subsequent spending in other areas.
#JanOSullivan	unknown-#JanOSullivan-party	unknown-#JanOSullivan-dob	unknown-#JanOSullivan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-03-11 00:00:00	Prelude	62	Could the Taoiseach clarify that?  For example, in the health budget there is an overrun because of money paid to pharmacists under the Hickey judgment and other issues.  However, there will be savings of 8% on money paid to pharmacists, so can these two things be balanced against each other?
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-03-11 00:00:00	Prelude	63	I do not think they can be balanced against each other.  The overall budgetary pressures on health — for example, the reduced contribution from the health levy due to the lower numbers of people in employment — are a countervailing pressure point to the saving obtained due to the 8% reduction in professional fees.  If the Deputy understands my point, in the context of the full budget, the achievement of a saving in one area does not allow one to ring-fence that saving and put it towards improvement of services in that general area, because there are budget overruns on the other side which must be catered for.

#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-03-11 00:00:00	Prelude	66	The reduction in consultancy fees was to take effect from last Sunday, 1 March.  Where projects have been running for some time, will the reduction take effect in respect of those projects from last Sunday?  For example, in early 2008 the Economist Intelligence Unit — a brilliant name — undertook on behalf of Government to carry out an independent benchmarking review to assess the comparative efficiency and effectiveness of key Irish economic regulators.  That was the remit.  The cost was supposed to be €306,000 and the report was to be published last September.  It was then pushed out to November and then to mid-February.  It is now almost halfway through March and it still has not been published.  When will this report be published, and will the reduction in consultancy fees in this case take effect from last Sunday?  In other words, will the work done since last Sunday, whenever the report is published, be subject to a reduction of 8% in consultation fees?
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-03-11 00:00:00	Prelude	67	I cannot give the specifics as to when the report, which is still in preparation, will be published.  However, the Department of Finance circular, which sets out the rules for the implementation of the 8% reduction, has been issued to all bodies and programmes within the Department Vote, as I said.  Our Department reviews contracts in place for professional services to revise the fees down by 8% from 1 March for services to be rendered on or after that date.  The answer to the Deputy's question is that it is envisaged the fee will be reduced by 8%——
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-03-11 00:00:00	Prelude	68	From that date?

As its title suggests, the Programme for Government 2007-2012 is a programme of priorities to be delivered over a five-year period.  Progress in delivering the programme is kept under review.  On 24 September 2008, the Department of the Taoiseach website published statements regarding the progress made by Departments in implementing each of the commitments in the programme for Government.On questions on this topic in the House on 18 February, I informed Deputy Gilmore, "The programme for Government is also predicated on balanced public finances and clearly, the crisis with which we are now contending means this is a major challenge and the top priority of any Government".  With regard to the specific commitments in the programme for Government, I said that "the priorities are being reassessed by Ministers in the context of the budgets now available to them".  We are now in the process of preparing for a supplementary budget, and this work is ongoing.

An bhfoilseoidh an Rialtas clár nua?  Is léir nach gcuirfear i bhfeidhm an chláir a tharraingíodh suas i 2007.  Cad a bheidh in áit an chláir sin?  An gcuirfidh an Rialtas clár leasuithe os comhair an Oireachtais?The programme for Government includes commitments that are cost neutral.  Can the Taoiseach advise the House which of these will proceed?  At least let us examine the programme for Government to determine what exactly is being done to deliver on the commitments entered into between the parties comprising this new coalition.  Does he not accept that a revised programme for Government is essential?  He is coming forward with an additional budget for this year.  In the same vein, a programme for Government drafted in the context of the 2007 general election clearly has not got the potential for delivery.  It is a requirement that the programme be redrafted and brought before the Houses of the Oireachtas for debate.  Will he fulfil that requirement?
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-03-11 00:00:00	Prelude	74	As I have stated on previous occasions, the work of the Government is focused on the issues of today in terms of dealing with the supplementary budget and setting out our priorities.  I have made it clear that the programme for Government, which was predicated on a growth rate of 4% per annum, clearly cannot be fully implemented during the course of this term.  It is obvious we are in a completely different situation from the one on which all parties based their programmes when they went to the people in 2007.  Our programme was more conservative than most but the point is the situation has totally changed and every programme for Government contains within it the provision that all commitments are predicated on sustainable public finances.  There is no point in suggesting these are free riding and unconditional in all respects or that in the event of 100% of a programme for Government not being implemented, one has failed to implement it.  The programme for Government is couched on the basis of maintaining and upholding the public finance position because that is the only way one can have a sustainable position, whatever one is going to do.That is the clear position of the programme for Government and we are consequently clarifying for the Opposition the areas in which we will proceed.  On the basis of annual output statements and in the aftermath of budget debates, Ministers are able to go before committees to set out the issues and areas they intend to progress during a given year.  In many cases, we will have to defer measures and will have to retrench in some areas because we are clearly in an unsustainable position.  To critique the Government because all commitments in the programme for Government will not now be implemented is a very skewed reading of the programme because the Deputy is deciding to take out of the equation the fact that the public finance position is paramount in respect of all programmes for Government, be they ones I have negotiated in the past or ones I have sought to observe from the Opposition benches.  Every programme for Government is based on that.

Tá a fhios ag gach éinne nach féidir é a chur i gcrích go hiomlán muna bhfuil struchtúr eacnamaíochta na tíre láidir go leor.  Ba mhaith liom cúpla ceist a chur faoi mholtaí agus polasaithe nach mbaineann costas ar bith leo.  Mar shampla, is féidir linn athstruchtúrú a dhéanamh ar an chóras cheadúnais bus gan chostas ar bith a chruthú.  Tá sé sin sa phlean, ach níl nuacht ar bith faoi.  Molaim gur chóir don Rialtas rud éigin a dhéanamh faoi thruailliú torainn, nó noise pollution, agus faoi chomhlachtaí bainistíochta, nó management companies.  Níl costas ar bith ag baint leis na moltaí atá leagtha síos.  Táimid ag feitheamh le reifreann ar chearta leanaí.  Tá an Teachta Shatter ar an gcoiste atá ag déileáil leis an ábhar sin.  An mbeidh an reifreann ar siúl in éineacht le toghchán ar bith? An bhfuil sé ar intinn ag an Rialtas moltaí agus cuspóirí a leagadh síos maidir le príosúnaigh?  Tá sé sin sa phlean, ach níl scéal ar bith faoi ach oiread.  Tá ceithre mholadh luaite agam.  Níl costas ar bith ag baint leo.  Is féidir leis an Rialtas iad a chur i gcrích gan an plean a athrú, cé nach bhfuil cúrsaí eacnamaíochta na tíre ró-láidir.The absent Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Gormley, who rarely comes in here, stated at the weekend that he wants to stay in Government because there is a national development programme to implement.  I am not sure whether that is the reason he wants to stay in Government given that one would probably need a blow torch to remove Green Party Deputies from the seats to which they are welded in absentia.  The Taoiseach made the realistic point that the economy is not going in the direction we would prefer and therefore the national development programme cannot be implemented as intended.In February, I raised the question of restructuring the national development programme and made a number of proposals which are labour intensive but would not entail major costs.  These proposals would employ Irish contractors and labourers, thereby giving people respect and opportunities to pay their taxes while at the same time constructing school buildings, primary health care centres and other facilities.  The Taoiseach responded by saying the Government was working on the matter and that the broad estimate of the total number employed through the capital investment programme is 100,000 people.  Has more work been done on the matter and will we see an analysis of how the national development programme can be rewritten to front load it with labour intensive projects that would get people back to work?  In this day and age, people who are healthy, well educated and able to work should not be walking around or doing nothing.  The Government should employ itself on this useful exercise.

#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-03-11 00:00:00	Prelude	86	As the Deputy noted, clearly areas such as legislative change or issues which do not entail large costs can and should be progressed.  I agree with that.Two issues arise in regard to the question of prioritising capital investment programmes.  We must concentrate on areas which give rise to social needs or economic returns.  Our scarce resources must be concentrated on work that is strategically important in terms of enhancing the competitiveness of the economy so that we are in a position to take advantage of the upturn whenever it comes.  As an export oriented and open country, we are dependent on a world economic recovery.  We derive our wealth from what we sell abroad to a far greater extent than from what we produce and consume domestically due to the position of our economy, what we produce and where we spend and sell our products and services.  It is therefore important that we use the recessionary period, during which there are scarcer resources, in a way that is focused on those priorities.  That is not to say we are not mindful of providing labour intensive projects as well but the balance must be struck.  We cannot just put in place projects which, when they are added up, do not provide the same economic rate of return as the more strategic work in transport, infrastructure or other necessary areas.  Finalising our national motorway programme needs to be done and it would not make sense to divert money from that towards other areas that might be more labour intensive but would put at risk the major investment already made in the programme.  We are in a position to complete it now at a time when outputs are far greater for the spend, given the more competitive tendering now available.  There is no disagreement about finding that balance and there is a continuing high level of investment in overall terms of 5.3% this year in terms of capital spend.In terms of the economic crisis and our financial position, we must be careful and see how we can maintain the capital programme and focus it on those areas that are strategically important.  We must take advice from various State agencies that will ensure we support enterprise, improve competitiveness and continue to invest for the future while contending with the present difficulties.

Ardaítear dhá fhadhb dá bharr sin.  Tá an clár Rialtais tábhachtach mar is é sin an conradh idir na páirithe sa Rialtas.  Níl a fhios againn anois cad é go díreach an conradh idir na páirithe sin ós rud é nach féidir iontaoibh a bheith againn as an chlár Rialtais.  Ní féidir linn bheith ag súil le freagracht ón Rialtas nuair nach bhfuil clár Rialtais ann mar bhunús don fhreagracht sin.Bhí an clár Rialtais bunaithe ar mhéadú 4.5% sa gheilleagar le linn saol an Rialtais ach is léir nach mbeidh an ráta sin ann.  Cén figiúr a bhfuil an Rialtas ag obair air faoi láthair?  Is dócha gur figiúr laghdaithe atá i gceist anois.Baineann beart amháin sa chlár Rialtais le cúrsaí cánach.  Mar a deir sé sa chlár: "Our first priority remains low and middle income earners — therefore our first task will be to use tax credits and bands to keep low income earners out of the standard rate band and average earners out of the higher band."  An bhfuil sin mar pholasaí don Rialtas fós agus an mbeidh an polasaí sin mar bhunús don cháinfhaisnéis nua?
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-03-11 00:00:00	Prelude	88	Tá a fhios ag an Teachta go bhfuil an ghéarchéim eacnamaíochta atá againn faoi láthair chomh tromchúiseach sin nach mbeimid in ann an córas cánach a bhí againn go dtí seo a fheabhsú mar a bhí muid in ann staid an ghnáthphobail a fheabhsú gach bliain le deich mbliana anuas.  Ní féidir linn sin a dhéanamh as seo amach.  Beidh athruithe ag teacht ó thaobh an córas cánach de.  Níl cinneadh déanta ag an Rialtas go dtí seo, tá múid ag déanamh scrúdú ar na roghanna atá againn agus beidh ar gach éinne fanacht go dtí an buiséad nua go bhfeicfimid na cinntí atá déanta againn.  Tá an eacnamaíocht go ginearálta lag i mbliana, beidh laghdú 6.5% sa gheilleagar, nó níos mó b'fhéidir.  Is géarchéim í seo nach bhfaca muid riamh sa tír seo.The programme for Government was laid down on the basis of growth of 4.5%, which provided greater resources and, therefore, an ability to indicate further reforms and improvements in the tax area in addition to those already brought forward by successive Fianna Fáil-led Administrations since 1997.  The new situation means we must look in the short and medium-term at sustainable systems of taxation for the country in the present circumstances that will be helpful for the investment climate, difficult as it may be, and that will allow us to compete for foreign direct investment while assisting indigenous industry.The whole thrust of policy in the past was to minimise to the greatest extent possible tax on income, labour and business so we could ensure the greatest number of people possible could obtain work in our country.  A great many did and got jobs commensurate with their talents and abilities.  The situation has changed internationally and domestically and we must now see a way forward that broadens the tax base and ensures we raise sufficient funds to meet the requirements of basic public services.The gap that has arisen, despite our low debt, is significant and must be closed.  We have said many times that we tried to devise a taxation system based on the ability to pay, consistent with the promotion of enterprise, the maintenance of the maximum number of jobs and as fair a system as possible.  That always has been our objective and the record of successive Fianna Fáil-led Governments has been exemplary in that respect.  We must now look to see how we can reconfigure this in a way that will maintain jobs in the future.This must be done against the background of a fragile economy and the swift change in our fortunes makes it all the more difficult.  We cannot avoid the necessary adjustments if we are to fulfil our responsibilities, difficult as they may be for those privileged to be in Government at the moment.I do not agree the programme for Government is irrelevant.  The programme was based on different assumptions but through annual departmental statements and outputs, and debates on the budget, education or any other sector of the economy, Ministers can outline their priorities.  Those priorities are the focus of debate because they must be addressed in the new circumstances in which we find ourselves.  The Government's work is focused on getting this necessary work done.  We have seen much work done in the first three months of the year in terms of the financial crisis and the legislative response to it and the need to provide for capitalisation.  There has been much debate in the House on the emergency legislation that has been brought forward.We will do whatever is required to meet the top priorities of the day.  In this case it is our economic well-being.  Those are the issues that must take precedence over all else.  The Deputy is suggesting that the commitments in the programme for Government are meaningless, but they were conditional.  I reiterate that all programme commitments of successive Governments were conditional.  Any programme for Government worth the name has a budgetary parameter, without which it would be rendered meaningless.

Does the Taoiseach accept that the decision last week not to publish such a strategy has had a serious effect on the 160,000 family carers throughout the State who are providing an essential support service to people who in other circumstances would cost the Exchequer untold millions of euro?  Will the Taoiseach heed the call of carers' representative groups to develop and publish a national carers' strategy in line with the commitment in the programme for Government?  In recognition of the current economic difficulties, will he also note that carer groups are asking the Government to deliver on the non-pay elements?  The Taoiseach should accept that there is an onus of responsibility on the Government in this respect.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-03-11 00:00:00	Prelude	90	At the outset, the Government made a commitment to social partners and carer representative groups that a national carers' strategy would not just be a paper exercise.  The current economic situation has made it impossible to consider introducing any developments in services for carers at this time, beyond what we have been able to provide in recent years.  There have been significant improvements in recent years.  In that context, rather than publishing a document which does not include any significant plans for the future, it was considered that the best course of action would be not to publish a strategy at this time and to be open and honest with people who work in this area.  I have a lot of admiration and respect for them.  The Minister for Social and Family Affairs arranged meetings with representatives of carers groups in advance for that purpose.Over the past ten years, support for carers has greatly increased.  This year, the Department of Social and Family Affairs is providing some €650 million in payments to support carers.  Over 45,000 people will receive a carer's allowance payment.  That figure includes some 16,000 people who receive the half-rate carer's allowance in addition to another social welfare payment, which is a change I introduced as Minister for Finance.  It was agreed with the late Séamus Brennan who was Minister for Social and Family Affairs at the time.Over 51,400 carers received the annual respite grant of €17,000.  The figure of 161,000 carers, which is frequently quoted — it was mentioned by Deputy Ó Caoláin — is from census returns and includes anyone providing a minimum of one hour's care per week.  The numbers in receipt of carer's allowance or benefit and the respite care grant represent the vast majority of people providing full-time care.The Department of Health and Children and the Health Service Executive, together with the Department of Social and Family Affairs, are committed to working with carers representative groups in the valuable work they do to support carers.  The submissions received as part of the consultation process and the work carried out by the interdepartmental working group will inform our thinking in the future.  In current circumstances, however, it is important to focus on maintaining the level of services we have been able to provide up to now in better times.  These are far more difficult times.

Last year, the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government introduced legislation dealing with vehicle registration tax, VRT, changing it from engine capacity to emissions.  That has destroyed the sector for pre-July 2008 second-hand vehicles, where sales have fallen by 75%.  The Government has not collected at least €100 million in unpaid VRT due to the way this legislation has been enforced and the number of vehicles coming in from Britain or Northern Ireland.

To have the budget on 7 April will facilitate a debate during that week and it will be reverted to subsequently on our return.

The question of a Finance Bill can be dealt with on our return in the normal way.
#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-03-11 00:00:00	Prelude	108	I want to raise three matters.  The Taoiseach will recall that for some time the Labour Party has been seeking the appointment of an inspector to examine what went on in the banking system and particularly in Anglo Irish Bank.  The Government rejected that request and said the Director of Corporate Enforcement would carry out the necessary investigations.  As the Taoiseach is aware, the Director of Corporate Enforcement has requested legislation to strengthen his powers.  When I asked about this last week the Minister for Finance, who was taking the Order of Business, suggested that while the Government was considering it, it did not seem to be an urgent consideration.  Has the Government considered that request from the Director of Corporate Enforcement?  If so, when will the necessary amending legislation be brought before the House?I also want to ask about reports of an arrangement which appears to have been made between UCD and Trinity College with regard to the distribution of funding for the programme for research in third-level institutions.  It is causing considerable anxiety to the other university institutions.  I would like to know if the Minister for Education and Science will take an opportunity to attend the House to clarify that matter.On Friday evening last, the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Gormley, told his party conference that he had succeeded in getting a reversal of the decision to cut back the Equality Authority's funding.

#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-03-11 00:00:00	Prelude	112	Regarding the first matter raised, the Minister for Finance will take up any requirements that the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement will have for any of its legislative responsibilities and take them forward as quickly as possible.  The Director of Corporate Enforcement has the right to apply to the House for the appointment of an inspector, if he feels it is necessary.  That is an ongoing matter in investigations.The Government has been briefed on the UCD-TCD innovation alliance and the initiative will be launched today.  The Irish Universities Association was fully briefed on the proposal last night.  I am confident that in the interests of the entire university sector the association will welcome today's announcement of greater co-operation between the two universities.  It would be inappropriate to comment on the details of the plan in advance of today's announcement.The Government welcomes any proposals which will help Ireland improve its performance and international standing in research innovation and make positive contributions to economic renewal.  New ideas such as this should not be seen as threat to anyone.  It is an example of new thinking which is to be welcomed and should encourage others to think outside the box.  The Minister for Education and Science has made clear that funding under the PRTLI-5 programme will continue to be allocated through the current process of competitive assessment of proposals.Given the current difficult economic circumstances, it is time for everyone to pull together.  I am confident the university sector will welcome co-operation between our two largest universities.  Stronger alliances make the sector stronger from an internal point of view also.  The third and further level sectors must be thinking of ways that they can make a greater contribution to economic recovery.  I look forward to further collaboration emerging in the future.The review of the Equality Authority's funding is taking place.  Arrangements will be put in place that will ensure the issues that are arising will be dealt with.

Why, therefore, is there such a delay in transposing and implementing the third EU directive on money laundering?  Ireland is one of the last EU member states to bring forward domestic legislation in this area.  It has been long since promised and is on the pink sheet for this session but there is still no sign of it.  Will the Taoiseach use his influence with his colleague the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to expedite this long overdue legislation?

Many such companies are going broke and there is no one to whom people can pay their money.  This means that properties cannot be sold because there is a lien on them.  As a result, difficulties have arisen.  Which Minister has been charged with introducing the promised legislation on this matter?  Is it possible that the legislation might be published between Easter and the summer recess?  Will the Taoiseach indicate whether there might be light at the end of the tunnel on this matter?

It is important that the voices of the democratic representatives of the people are heard loud and clear at a time when the democratic institutions which have been established by the Irish people are being challenged by a tiny and unrepresentative group of evil people who have no mandate and no support for their actions.  Those actions are futile and tragic.  The people to whom I refer cannot and will not succeed.  This debate, and those taking place in other democratic assemblies, makes that abundantly clear.On behalf of the Government and all Members of the House, I express our sympathies to the families of those who were killed and injured in the recent attacks.  I send my deepest condolences to the families, friends and colleagues of Sapper Mark Quinsey, Sapper Cengiz Azimkar and Officer Stephen Carroll.  This week, there are grieving families in Birmingham, London and Banbridge.  There are deeply traumatised communities in Antrim and Craigavon, which have once more seen evil rise in their midst.  They are all in our thoughts and prayers.I also send my best wishes to those who were injured in the attacks, including a young teenager from Antrim and a man who came to these shores from Poland to make a better life for himself and who now lies critically injured in hospital.  We pray for their speedy recovery and offer our support to their families and friends at this difficult time.We had hoped to never again witness events such as those that occurred this week.  The murder scenes, the increased security and the grief of those who have lost a loved one to mindless violence conjure up images of a dark past we thought we had put behind us.  We are absolutely determined to ensure that there will be no going back.  I assure the House that, despite all of the successes of the peace process, the Government and the Garda Síochána have continued to commit significant resources to the fight against the dissident groups.  The Garda has had many successes in this work.  As the Chief Constable of the Police Service of Northern Ireland, PSNI, stated, the work of the Garda in this area has saved lives.  The work of the Garda will continue and will be intensified in order that justice will be done and that this evil will be rooted out from Irish society, North and South.The Ministers for Foreign Affairs and Justice, Equality and Law Reform met the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland and his security Minister at Hillsborough last night.  They reviewed the latest situation and ensured a continuance of the closest possible political and security co-operation between the two Governments and our law enforcement agencies.  The Garda Commissioner will meet the Chief Constable of the PSNI tomorrow.  Co-operation between the police forces on this island has never been closer.  They are working hand in glove to apprehend the killers and to combat the organisations who planned these murders.The unity of this House is mirrored by a unity within Northern Ireland, between North and South and between Britain and Ireland.  In recent days, I had discussions with Prime Minister Gordon Brown, First Minister Peter Robinson and Deputy First Minister Martin McGuinness.  My ministerial colleagues are in ongoing contact with their counterparts in the British Government.  We are also in touch with all of the political parties and all of our friends across the community in Northern Ireland.  Everybody is absolutely united.The people and all of their democratic representatives reject this violence.  We will overcome the evil and unrepresentative minority that wants to drag us back to the past.  If anyone doubts our unity or our resolve, they should listen to the debate in this House and that taking place in the Northern Ireland Assembly.  If anyone thinks that Northern Ireland has not changed, they should examine pictures taken yesterday of the First and Deputy First Ministers with the Chief Constable of the PSNI.  If anyone hopes to drag us back to a time of hatred and division, they should hear the clear message given by the First Minister and the Deputy First Minister.  It was a message of hope and determination and also one of support for our democratic institutions and for the forces of law and order.  It was proof, if such were needed, that we are not going back to the bad old days.In recent days, the eyes of the world have once more turned towards our small island.  They have seen images that may have seemed drearily familiar.  However, they also seen something else, namely, an unprecedented coming together of all of the traditions on this island and all of the people of this country.  Furthermore, they have seen an island resolved to be reconciled, not divided.In the words of the motion before the House, we stand "united together with the Irish and British Governments, the First and Deputy First Ministers of Northern Ireland, the members of the Northern Ireland Executive and Assembly, democratic representatives and all the people of this island, and friends of Ireland around the world".  We also stand in support of the democratic institutions and in absolute opposition to violent attempts to undermine the peace process.Next week, the eyes of the world will once again be upon us as we celebrate our national day.  I will be in America with the First and Deputy First Ministers and we will once more give that united message of peace and resolve in the face of this threat.I reiterate the words of the motion that this House will pass today.  Those words speak more loudly than any act of mindless violence.  The Irish people are united.  Our peace process and our democracy are unshakeable.  I commend this motion to the House.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-03-11 00:00:00	Prelude	175	I thank the Government for accepting the suggestion I made yesterday that the House should pass an all-party motion condemning the recent murders and that a clear message should be sent out on behalf of every Member that this kind of heinous crime will not be tolerated on the island of Ireland.  I wish to acknowledge the presence of the British ambassador in the Distinguished Visitors Gallery.  I thank the Taoiseach for agreeing to this debate and I congratulate him on the positive way in which the Government approached the preparation of the motion before the House.I am sure Members share my sense of revulsion at the cowardly murders of three members of the security forces in Northern Ireland in recent days.  Our thoughts and sympathies should rightly be with the families of the victims — Officer Stephen Carroll of the PSNI, Sapper Mark Quinsey and Sapper Cengiz Azimkar.  It is horrific to think that certain persons were given an instruction to deliberately assassinate members of the security forces who were going about their legitimate duties.  As stated yesterday, the predetermined nature of these murders indicates that they were carried out by very evil people with warped minds.  Those who carried out these atrocities have absolutely no mandate for their actions.  They clearly and openly defy the expressed will, through the ballot box, of the people of Ireland, North and South, to leave violence in the past and to live together in peace.  In their actions they attempt to threaten the democratic process itself, and this cannot and will not be tolerated.  These activities have no place in this country.These are testing times for the devolved institutions in Northern Ireland.  I commend the leaders of the parties in the North on their firm and composed response to these murders.  I welcome the response of the representatives of the loyalist paramilitary groups, who said they do not intend to take retaliatory action.  I also welcome the meeting today between the Ulster Political Research Group and the Sinn Féin Lord Mayor of Belfast, Councillor Hartley.  These developments represent a new maturity in the relationship between the representatives of the communities and send a signal to their respective constituencies that their leaders are committed to working together for the betterment of all the people and communities of Northern Ireland.  I acknowledge the strong and clear stance taken by the Sinn Féin leadership and, in particular, by Mr. Martin McGuinness, Deputy First Minister, who have demonstrated their party's adherence to its decision to leave the armed struggle in the past.  I also acknowledge Deputy Ó Caoláin's consistent remarks in this regard.I urge all parties to continue to appeal to their supporters to co-operate fully with the police investigations in order that those responsible can be brought to justice and suffer the full rigours of the law.  I urge the Garda Síochána and the security and intelligence forces in this jurisdiction to provide every possible assistance to the investigation so there can be no suggestion that any of those involved in these murders can hope for refuge in this State.I have raised with the Taoiseach for some time the growing threat posed by dissident groups.  The recent decision of the PSNI Chief Constable to bring in outside assistance from MI5 was a clear signal from him of the increased risk of attacks of this nature.  The media reports today that a large bomb has been prepared by the Real IRA for an attack in Britain underline the need for a strong security response.  The murders are appalling but this business of preparing bombs for use in Britain just cannot be contemplated.  I hope the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform and the Minister for Defence will not hesitate to use their respective security and intelligence services in ensuring justice is done as quickly as possible.I am also concerned about reports that the Real IRA is actively recruiting new members from this jurisdiction.  This was brought to my attention yesterday.  It is essential to ensure that young men, vulnerable in many respects, are not lured into these organisations by some romantic notion of Irish republicanism and the continuation of an armed struggle.  To achieve this we must continue to highlight in any way we can the necessity of implementing in full the Good Friday Agreement in order that people will understand and see that co-operation and power sharing are the way forward.  We must ensure that it is considered both the normal and effective way of delivering for everybody.  We must also ensure our security forces have the necessary resources to monitor the activities of the dissident groups in this State.  A concentrated effort to disrupt their recruitment methods and other activities will prevent other atrocities being carried out.Fine Gael, as always, stands ready to support the forces of law and order in confronting this threat.  As I said yesterday, while there are many issues that divide the Government and Opposition, the Taoiseach can rest assured that in dealing with this matter and on his journey to America next week, he will have the full support of this party in respect of whatever action the Government must take.  I am pleased to support the motion before the House as it represents a clear and unequivocal statement of democratic Ireland's rejection of these attempts to plunge this island back into dark days of conflict, mayhem and murder.In this month, the eyes of the world will be on our country, as we prepare for our national day.  Ireland is one of the few countries that has a national day.  I hope that in passing this motion the Dáil is strengthening the message that the Taoiseach and Ministers need to deliver in the course of their international duties, which is that all the people of Ireland want to live in a country of peace, harmony, unity and strengthened resolve to build on the potential of the Good Friday Agreement, which so many people through so many walks of life for so many years worked so hard to implement.
#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-03-11 00:00:00	Prelude	176	On behalf of the Labour Party, I support the motion proposed by the Taoiseach.Last January in the Round Room of the Mansion House we celebrated the 90th anniversary of the first Dáil, which was the exercise of a democratic mandate, under universal suffrage throughout this island, calling for self-determination for the Irish people.  Those who gathered in the Mansion House on 21 January 1919 had a true democratic mandate for their actions.  They were entitled to the loyalty of those who accept basic democratic principles.  We in this House, as successors of the men and women of the first Dáil Éireann, enjoy the same mandate, grounded on the consent of the people.Last June we marked the anniversary of another momentous occasion, the tenth anniversary of the referendums North and South on the Good Friday Agreement.  That was the first time since the general election of 1918 that a popular mandate was again firmly secured throughout this island.  The mandate was for peaceful co-existence and for co-operation to build a better future for our children on this island.  Every Irish man and woman with any sense of respect for the ideals of popular sovereignty and democratic rule must recognise that this Oireachtas and the Northern Ireland Assembly owe their existence to the settled will of the Irish people.The outrages of this week, the bloody murders of Sappers Mark Quinsey and Patrick Azimkar and of Constable Stephen Paul Carroll, were offences against three men, three mourning families and three circles of relatives and friends.  They were also offences against the two young men who were seriously injured and their families and friends.  However, these murders are more than that.  They are nothing short of acts of treason against the Irish nation.  These crimes are anti-national, anti-patriotic and anti-republican, because they display nothing but contempt for the settled will of the Irish people.There is nothing noble or patriotic about these groups.  We know that there are links between what are called "dissident" republican groups and criminal gangs involved in the drugs trade in this jurisdiction.  They support each other, exchange weapons and provide logistical support for each other.  These groups are simply criminal gangs who wrap the national flag around themselves in a futile attempt to provide some veneer of justification for murder.  The police and prosecution authorities will have support from every part of the House in hunting down the offenders and bringing them to justice.The crimes came as a profound shock to many of us in this part of Ireland.  We must admit, perhaps, that Northern Ireland and its ongoing security concerns had dropped down the public agenda here.  If so, we cannot blame Sir Hugh Orde, who only last week warned of the danger of an imminent attack from dissident republicans.  We also cannot blame the Independent Monitoring Commission, which published its 20th and latest report last November and highlighted the threats posed by dissident republicans.  The IMC gave a warning that was grim, timely and, it turns out, well-founded.  According to its report:Three things are clear.  First, in the six months under review (and indeed in the weeks following the end of that period) dissidents — mainly CIRA and RIRA — have been especially active.   From May to the end of the period under review there was a more concentrated period of attacks than at any time since we started to report on them four and a half years ago.  We believe that dissidents have also been undertaking planning and preparation for other attacks.  Second, if it were not for the fact that the police on both sides of the border have been successful in disrupting dissident operations and arresting suspects, the number of reported incidents would have been higher.  Thirdly, dissidents have turned their efforts more directly to trying to kill PSNI officers, using a variety of tactics and methods.The commission said that the Continuity IRA had not only undertaken direct attacks against members of the PSNI but had also engineered public disorder, with a view to exploiting the exposure of police officers which it expected to result from it.  In addition, it indicated that the organisation had continued to seek to enhance its capability and continued to plan and take part in a range of serious criminal activity, including drug dealing, robbery and tiger kidnapping, extortion, fuel laundering and smuggling.  Last July it threatened that staff of the UK revenue and customs and of the Northern Ireland vehicle licensing authority would be targeted if they continued to help the PSNI.The IMC's final conclusion was that the Continuity IRA remains active, that it focused particular efforts on attacks on members of the PSNI which could have resulted in the loss of life, that it continues to try to enhance its capabilities through recruitment, training, the acquisition and manufacture of weapons and raising funds, and that it is engaged in the same range of serious criminal activity as before.  It indicated that, "The organisation remains a very serious threat."We owe it to the police and security services and to their families — to every inhabitant of this island, North and South — to do everything possible to destroy this organisation root and branch.  In seeking to do so, the PSNI has a potential advantage that was not available to its predecessors.  As the first Garda Commissioner, Michael Staines, put it, "The Garda Síochána will succeed, not by force of arms or numbers, but by their moral authority as servants of the people."  The same principle holds true of policing services everywhere.Under the Patten reforms the PSNI has become a transformed service, with a transformed mandate.  It enjoys increased acceptance and support throughout the community.  All democratic public representatives, North and South, must do everything possible to further develop that community support.  The tactics of the Continuity IRA cannot prevail against a service supported by the community it serves.The parties in the Northern Ireland Executive, together with the two Governments and all the parties here, must now confront the growing perception that the absence of progress on the devolution of justice and policing has created a political vacuum, or may have caused disaffection among republican supporters, which the dissidents think they are able to exploit.Given that there were two separate attacks, involving three murders in the space of 48 hours, there must be a danger that the people of Northern Ireland are now facing a concerted campaign of murder and violence.  One of the main concerns, particularly in regard to the Antrim attack, was the way in which it was carried out.  I would never want to use the word "professional" in regard to such loathsome murderers, but the manner in which the killings were carried out suggests a level of expertise and experience that was not evident in attacks carried out previously by that group.  It suggests that it may have acquired either new recruits or new expertise, which has given it a new capability.  Perhaps the Minister responding to the debate might indicate if there is any intelligence available to suggest that is the case.The objective of those who carried out those attacks is clear.  They want to turn back the clock.  They want to see Northern Ireland plunged again into sectarian conflict.  They want to bring down the Assembly and the Executive.  They want to again see the political parties in Northern Ireland at each other's throats.  They want to deprive communities in Northern Ireland of civilian policing.  They want to see the British army back on the streets of Northern Ireland.  They must not be allowed to succeed.  All democrats, North and South, Nationalist, Unionist and other, must stand together in the face of those attacks and ensure this tiny and unrepresentative minority are not allowed to usurp the will of the overwhelming majority of people on this island.Finally, in paying tribute today to British army sappers Mark Quinsey and Patrick Azimkar and police constable, Stephen Paul Carroll, we should also acknowledge the deaths of the approximately 3,500 people who died in a futile campaign of violence that went on for approximately 30 years.  It left a terrible legacy in terms of the numbers dead and wounded and communities scarred by violence.The negotiation of the Good Friday Agreement offered a new dawn of hope.  The progress in the years after the Agreement was painfully slow and frustrating, but the institutions in Northern Ireland have shown a new resilience in the face of those attacks.  The way in which the parties in the Assembly stood together in condemnation of those attacks provides real grounds for optimism.  Those groups must not be allowed to rob the people of Northern Ireland of the better future they all deserve.
#JohnGormley	unknown-#JohnGormley-party	unknown-#JohnGormley-dob	unknown-#JohnGormley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-03-11 00:00:00	Prelude	177	I was in Wexford at our party conference late on Saturday night when I learned of the brutal murders of Mark Quinsey and Patrick Azimkar.  I was at home with my family late on Monday night when I heard of the brutal killing of Stephen Carroll.I use the names of those men here to again put them on the record of Dáil Éireann.  I do it to remind myself and all of us that, first and foremost, we are talking about human lives.  We are talking about the deaths of men who were husbands, sweethearts, sons, brothers, cousins, neighbours and friends.  We are talking about the callous taking of human lives.  We are talking about so many others close to those men whose lives are now blighted and who are in our thoughts as we share their sorrow.  This morning, with a heavy heart, I read the words of Stephen Carroll's wife, Kate, when she spoke of how her life is now destroyed.  The grief and sorrow she and the other bereaved families are suffering requires no further explanation.The attacks on Saturday and Monday nights were not just attacks on the security services.  They were not just attacks on the police service nor on the British army.  They were attacks on our communities, our cousins, brothers, sons, sisters and grandfathers.  They were cowardly and callous attacks on everything the people on this island, and in these islands, have worked to create over the past decade, namely, a peaceful society in Northern Ireland that provides everybody living there with opportunities of dignity, equality, prosperity and safety.Monday night's attack in Craigavon has killed the first member of the Police Service of Northern Ireland since that organisation took over from the RUC.  The PSNI was established following the Patten report with a mandate to provide a police service that could enjoy the confidence of everybody in the community.  Under Chief Constable, Hugh Orde, it has met its responsibilities well and is staffed by officers hailing from backgrounds that fully reflect the diversity of the people that call this island home; Catholic and Protestant, Northern and Southern, Polish and Chinese.Saturday night's attack in Antrim was no heroic act.  It was inspired neither by freedom, nor borne out of inequality.  It was a cowardly slaughter of two young, unarmed soldiers living their daily lives, taking delivery of their dinner on an otherwise unremarkable weekend night.  Mark Quinsey and Patrick Azimkar were not figures of hate in the community in which they were stationed.  They were there doing their jobs.  Constable Stephen Carroll was shot in the head with a sniper's bullet while responding to a resident who had her windows broken.  He was, like the dedicated members of our own Garda force, working to keep his community safe.  He was simply doing his job.Despite the challenges and the ongoing frustrations that prevent an inclusive and integrated society from fully developing in Northern Ireland, there is a sense of normality now in everyday life that gives comfort to communities that have lived through decades of horrific violence.  It is the very ordinariness, the mundane nature of two young men paying a delivery man for pizza on a Saturday night, of a policeman responding to a call from a homeowner with a smashed window, that the psychopaths who committed these murders are fighting against.There is an obligation on all of us to help end that division and to establish one society in the North in which everybody feels at home, and a community of ideals and aspirations on this island of which everybody is proud to be part.  There is also an obligation on us to have politics which address the bread and butter issues, the ordinary and sometimes mundane things which are central to all our lives and to bring about a society in which the murderers of Mark Quinsey, Patrick Azimkar and Stephen Carroll enjoy neither refuge, nor support nor tolerance.In Wexford on Saturday night, when news of the murders of Mark Quinsey and Patrick Azimkar came through I was with party colleagues from all parts of the island of Ireland.  The Green Party members who travelled from various parts of the North had come to Wexford to debate the real issues of life in a region which had emerged from a 35-year nightmare of violent strife.As we salute the memory of Mark Quinsey, Patrick Azimkar and Stephen Carroll here, let us redouble our resolve that there will be no return to the darkest days of our recent history.  I would like to commend the role of our colleagues in the Sinn Féin Party who have stood solid in the cause of peace.  I hope all of us here and, in particular, the parties of Northern Ireland can unite in this political crisis and that democracy and the Good Friday Agreement will triumph.

I reiterate the determination of Sinn Féin to ensure that those responsible will not succeed in undermining the peace process nor divert us from the peaceful and democratic pursuit of our republican objectives.  These killings have no legitimacy and no moral or political basis.Tá Sinn Féin ag tacú leis an rún seo.  Sinn Féin fully supports this motion.  Níl bealach ar bith eile os comhair phobail na hÉireann ach bealach na síochána.  Níl cead ag mion-ghrupaí dul i gcoinne na straitéise síochána a bhfuil tacaíocht aici ó phoblachtánaigh ar fud na hÉireann agus thar lear.  Leis an fhírinne a rá, is grupaí frith-phoblachtánacha iad agus tá siad ag dul i gcoinne an phróisis síochána a bhfuil tacaíocht aige ó mhuintir na hÉireann.The tiny splinter groups that carried out these murders are pursuing a militarist agenda, primarily designed to justify their own existence and perpetuate their own factions.  They are totally divorced from republicans throughout Ireland and abroad.  They have nothing to offer but misery in their attempts to drag back into conflict the communities they falsely claim to represent.We have seen a process of demilitarisation in the Six Counties as a key part of the peace process.  The British army was taken off the streets and its numbers in the Six Counties were significantly reduced.  Barracks and posts, including those along the Border, have been closed.  What will these attacks achieve, apart from grief to families and renewed fears among communities?  They will serve only to delay the ongoing process of demilitarisation and may lead to the deployment of more rather than fewer British troops.Remilitarisation is what these groups want, but they should not get what they want.  These groups will not succeed in their attempts to derail the peace process, which has the full support of the overwhelming majority of the Irish people and of all political parties.I commend the First and Deputy First Ministers and the Executive in the Six Counties for the leadership they are giving.  The best response to the events of recent days is to carry forward with even greater determination the politics of partnership and peace.  The actions of these factional groups have no popular support.  Rather than hastening the day of Irish unity and national independence, they try to undermine the only strategy currently on offer that has the potential to deliver our republican objectives.  However, they will fail in that effort to undermine the republican peace strategy.We in Sinn Féin remain resolute in our commitment to achieve our stated goals by peaceful and democratic campaigning.  This approach has the support, and indeed the growing support, of the Irish electorate, North and South.  Those who want to turn back the clock would do better to turn over a new leaf and, if they are sincere in their stated wish to end the British presence in Ireland, invest their energies and talents in positively working for that objective.The objectives of Irish unity and freedom can only be achieved by the united and concerted effort of all republicans seeking to persuade people of all opinion, including those who have been traditionally hostile to our goals, of the good sense and the tremendous opportunities that can and will flow from the reunification of Ireland and the establishment of a truly pluralist, inclusive and democratic republic across the whole island of Ireland.  Irish republicans will not be diverted from the peace strategy we have adopted democratically and pursued successfully.There may be some who, while not supporting the groups who carried out the killings, may baulk at the condemnation of the killings, in particular the killings of members of the British army.  Those killings were wrong, and I want to make that clear here today.  They were wrong because they were in breach of a peace process entered into in good faith by Irish republicans, a process out of which came all-party negotiations and all-party agreements which, while falling short of our ultimate objectives, are respected and upheld and adhered to by Irish republicans and endorsed by the majority of the Irish people.The Irish Republican Army leadership and volunteers have long since declared that the war is over.  The unrepresentative factions, who do not deserve the name "republican", are engaged in a futile effort to reignite conflict and resume war, but they will fail.  They are, in the case of the so-called Continuity IRA, the remnants of a group that departed from mainstream republicanism as far back as 1986.  In the case of the so-called Real IRA, they had their genesis in those who departed early in the peace process.What their history has been since then, I do not know.  However, this I do know.  They can only continue to exist by exploiting the gullibility of young people who have no concept of what real repression and conflict are like.  They seek to blind those young people to political realities, including the progress made by their own communities in recent years and the tremendous potential for future progress, including their own potential if they engage positively in peaceful and democratic political activity.  Splinter groups are trying to turn back the clock to conflict.  Once again, I emphasise, they will not be allowed to succeed.During the development of the peace process, securocrats within the British system attempted to thwart progress because their existence depended on the continuation of conflict.  I have no doubt that there are still people within the British system who would also like to turn back the clock, to justify their own existence and to perpetuate their militarist organisations.  This must not be allowed to happen either.It is vital that all responses to these killings are strictly within the law, compliant with human rights obligations and carried out by the PSNI.  The need for effective, efficient, non-political and community-based policing is even greater now.  The British Army, MI5 or any other covert force should have no role in this response and, in fact, no role in Ireland at all.In conclusion, I join with others here in stating that these killings will not derail the progress made in the past decade and a half, but will renew our determination to advance the politics of peace and partnership, democracy and equality.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-03-11 00:00:00	Prelude	179	The unity of purpose evident in what all speakers have said in the House sends a clear signal to all that, in the words of the motion, "Dáil Eireann stands united together with the Irish and British Governments, the First and deputy First Minister of Northern Ireland, the members of the Northern Ireland Executive and Assembly, democratic representatives and all the people of this island, and friends of Ireland around the world, in full support of the democratic institutions and in absolute opposition to violent attempts to undermine the peace process".This reaffirmation of the primacy of politics and the unassailable strength of the peace process is what all of us should carry with us from this debate today.  It will underpin our resolve as we continue, undeterred, to sustain and strengthen the peace we have built on this island and to work together to build a better society, North and South.By contrast, the murderers who have this week brought bloodshed back onto the streets of our country have thrown down a blatant and arrogant challenge to the overwhelming majority of Irish men and women who want to build on this island a sovereign, democratic Irish Republic, embracing all the people of our nation.  We seek a republic absent of sectarianism, a republic in which people of all backgrounds and traditions can feel equally at home and where people can express their identity free from fear or intimidation.In 1998, the people of Ireland, North and South, voted by a majority in favour of the Good Friday Agreement.  This was the first occasion since the general election of 1918 — the election at which the people selected the representatives who sat in the first Dáil — on which all the people of this island voted on the same day on the issue of their constitutional status.The Good Friday Agreement provided an agreed basis for addressing partition and clarifying the constitutional position of Northern Ireland.  Under its terms, the British Government has entered into a binding international treaty obligation to withdraw from Northern Ireland, if and when a majority of the people in Northern Ireland should ask it to do so.  At the same time, the Irish people, North and South, accepted that Northern Ireland remains in union with Britain unless and until the majority in the North desires otherwise.  Currently, a majority in the North wishes to remain in union with Britain.  That majority, and not the British army, comprises the British presence in Ireland.  The people who make up this majority are not aliens.  They are Irish men and women who, like all of us on this island, are immigrants by descent or birth.When the people of this island voted by an overwhelming majority to adopt the Good Friday Agreement, they endorsed the common recognition by the Irish and British Governments that is "the birthright of all the people of Northern Ireland to identify themselves and be accepted as Irish or British, or both, as they may so choose".It falls to our generation of Irish republicans to convince those in Northern Ireland who currently support the union with Britain that their future is best secured in a closer accommodation with the majority with whom they share the island.  We have accepted the right of a majority in the North to say "No" but we will not cease our efforts to bring them with us through peaceful and respectful persuasion.Murder wins no converts to the republican cause.  On the contrary, it serves only to alienate, entrench division and give new life to sectarianism and intolerance.  It was wrong to murder two young British soldiers doing nothing more than taking delivery of their Saturday night dinner.  It was wrong to shoot down a Polish pizza man and his Irish colleague who were doing their best to earn an honest living.  It was wrong to kill an Irish policeman seeking to protect the vulnerable members of his community.  Their murders were callous and cowardly.  These dreadful and cynical acts were entirely wrong in every sense.  However, to claim to have carried out these wicked deeds in the name of the Irish Republic is more than wrong; it is a betrayal.  Let there be no doubt or delusion; those who this week claimed to kill in the name of the Irish Republic served only to betray the Republic and the nation on which it is founded.The sad truth is that those who resort to the gun and the bomb in the name of republicanism do not have the stomach for the long haul.  Their vision is so clouded by hatred, so distorted by the shadow of the heroic gunman, that they are unable to see that resorting to short-term gratification through violence and the mantra of "Brits out" will never deliver the republic they claim to espouse.  An Irish republic worthy of the name needs to be constructed on the solid foundations of friendship, tolerance and inclusion.  Our republican flag stands not for conquest, but for peace and reconciliation between the green and orange.The modern republican vocation requires stamina, patience and forbearance.  It obliges us to jettison old resentments and to live with our neighbours as they are rather than as we would wish them to be.  We who seek to build this modern republic must respond to this week's betrayal by recommitting ourselves to our goals.  We must reject violence, hatred and intolerance.  We must renew our determination to build a better, fairer, more peaceful and prosperous Ireland.  We must strive even harder to work the institutions established by the Good Friday Agreement and to co-operate with the British Government to that end.  Above all, we must refute any attempt to re-open wounds on this island that are still in the early stages of healing.The republican road will be long and, most likely, tortuous.  Some or many who walk this path may not live to see this new land.  However, violence offers no short cuts.  It will simply bring us back to where we started — a black and dismal place to which we must never return.  The only way to a modern Irish republic runs across the high ground of peace and friendship between the people of this island and the peoples of Ireland and Britain.At this difficult time, I salute the party leaders in the Assembly for setting aside party politics in order to send a clear and united message both of condemnation for what has occurred and determination that it will not prevent Northern Ireland from continuing on its current path towards a better and shared future.  I pay particular tribute to the First Minister, Mr. Peter Robinson, and the Deputy First Minister, Mr. Martin McGuinness, who have shown great leadership, dignity and resolve in this very difficult week for Northern Ireland.  In particular, their joint appearance yesterday with the Chief Constable sent a powerful signal that both communities in Northern Ireland stand together in rejecting violence and criminality and in opposing any effort to undermine the extraordinary progress that has been achieved over the past decade.I am proud this House has so clearly expressed its solidarity with the Assembly and the people of Northern Ireland.  The fact that all parliamentary representatives on this island have spoken with one voice underscores the fact that those who committed the attacks in Antrim and Craigavon represent no one but themselves.  They are a tiny minority on the fringe of society who would seek through their murderous acts to drag Northern Ireland back to the darkness and despair of violence and fear.  They will not be allowed to subvert the expressed will of the people of the island to live in peace and partnership.The Government has, of course, remained in close contact with the British Government throughout this week.  The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform and I met the Secretary of State, Mr. Shaun Woodward, and the Minister of State, Mr. Paul Goggins, at Hillsborough last night to discuss the matter.  We took the opportunity to express in person the Government's condolences for the loss suffered by the PSNI and the British army and to emphasise that the thoughts and prayers of the Irish people are with the bereaved and the injured.Co-operation between the Garda and the PSNI has been excellent and they have had considerable successes, although this can be cold comfort at a time like this.  The Chief Constable and the Garda Commissioner will hold a meeting this Thursday to discuss how best to continue to work the current arrangements effectively and maximise co-operation in dealing with the dissident threat.I emphasise the importance of the discussion we have had in this House today because it has underlined the primacy of politics at this difficult time for Northern Ireland.  The Governments and the political parties will remain steadfast in demonstrating daily the strength, stability and effectiveness of the power-sharing institutions and the political and democratic process.  The message that goes out from this House today is that those who seek to subvert the will of the people will not succeed because we — the people of these islands, whatever our political, religious or community identity — will not let that happen.
#JohnGormley	unknown-#JohnGormley-party	unknown-#JohnGormley-dob	unknown-#JohnGormley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-03-11 00:00:00	Prelude	180	I move: "That the Bill be now read a Second Time."The purpose of the Bill is to amend the Local Elections (Disclosure of Donations and Expenditure) Act 1999 to provide for the introduction of limits on expenditure by candidates and political parties at local elections.  It is my intention to have the limits in place for the local elections to be held on 5 June next.There are currently no limits on local elections expenditure.  Under the Local Elections (Disclosure of Donations and Expenditure) Act 1999, as amended, all local election candidates are required to submit a statement of election expenditure and donations received at the election, and the source of the funds to meet that expenditure.  These requirements were put in place in 1999 and operated for the 1999 and 2004 local elections.The approach I am adopting now is to amend the Local Elections (Disclosure of Donations and Expenditure) Act 1999 to provide for a cap on spending at local elections, in addition to any other incidental provisions that may be necessary.  The introduction of spending limits will be provided for by way of the insertion of a new Part IIIA in the 1999 Act specifying limits for spending in each electoral area.The purpose of introducing spending limits is to create as level a playing field as possible to ensure that candidates of modest means are not put at a disadvantage in contesting local elections.  The putting in place of the limits on expenditure at the 2009 elections will bring local elections into line with the other electoral codes where spending limits already apply.In October 2008, I consulted the Joint Committee on the Environment, Heritage and Local Government on the issue of spending limits.  A policy research document prepared on behalf of the committee and presented at that meeting offered useful practical guidance.  There were a number of complexities that needed to be considered and I discussed these with members of the committee.  In considering the proposed limits, I have taken into account the various views expressed by stakeholders during the consultative process. The consultative committee on local government reform, which was involved in the preparation of the Green Paper on Local Government, also considered the issue of expenditure limits.  That committee included representatives from all of the main local government associations and representative bodies, the Association of County and City Councils, the Association of Municipal Authorities of Ireland, the County and City Managers' Association and the Local Authority Members' Association.In setting spending limits, a balance had to be struck.  The limits have to be realistic and reasonable.  If they were set too low, they might unduly impede campaigning, particularly by new candidates.  Were the limits too high, it would defeat the objective of discouraging excessive spending.Based on past experience, expenditure by candidates varies widely, with candidates in more populated county and city council areas tending to incur greater expenditure.  There is also considerable variation in the population of electoral areas.  For example, among the county and city councils the electoral area with the smallest population is Drumlish in County Longford with 6,453 people.  At the other end of the scale the Pembroke-Rathmines electoral area in Dublin city has the largest population, with 60,277 people.In setting the spending limits, I have taken account of these differences.  Therefore, candidates in more populated county and city council areas will be able to incur greater expenditure.  For the 34 county and city councils, a sliding scale with four separate spending limits, based on the population within each individual electoral area, will apply.  A top limit of €15,000 will apply in the most populated areas, with limits of €13,000, €11,500 and €9,750 to apply to candidates in other county and city council electoral areas, depending on their population.Given their different administrative responsibilities, I have concluded that there is a case for setting different limits for county and city councils on the one hand, and borough and town councils on the other.  Therefore, I decided that all candidates standing for election to borough and town councils will be subject to a flat spending limit of €7,500.It is common for candidates to contest simultaneously local elections for a county council and an urban-based borough or town council.  In these circumstances, a candidate will be able to spend up to the limit for the county council electoral area, plus one quarter of the limit for the borough or town council electoral area as the case may be.  In view of the economies of scale for a candidate who contests two polls on the same day, it is reasonable in such a situation to reduce the limit for spending in the case of the relevant borough or town council election.  The spending limits will apply at the forthcoming local elections for which polling will take place on 5 June.  Future local elections will also be subject to spending limits.Each section of the Bill is explained in the explanatory memorandum which was circulated with the Bill.  I will now comment on the principal provisions in the Bill.  Section 2 provides for amendment of the 1999 Act to update definitions of expressions used in that Act.Section 3 provides for the repeal of section 6(1)(b)(v) of the Act of 1999 to take account of the Supreme Court judgment in the Kelly case on the use of public funds for electoral purposes.  This is the case from 2002 of Desmond Kelly v. the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Ireland and the Attorney General.  Section 6(1)(b)(v) of the 1999 Act deems certain types of expenditure not to be election expenses, such as certain payments, services or facilities provided from public funds by a range of individuals and bodies.  That provision is contrary to the judgment in the Kelly case and, accordingly, it is proposed to repeal it.Section 3 also provides for the amendment of section 6(3)(a) of the 1999 Act which has determined the spending period at local elections for the purpose of disclosing election expenses.  The existing formula in section 6(3)(a) of the 1999 Act for setting the spending period, is by reference to the period commencing on the making of the order by the Minister appointing polling day at a local election, and ending on polling day.  The Bill provides that the spending period will now be specified by a separate order of the Minister made after the order appointing polling day.  The spending limits period will commence between 50 and 60 days before polling day and end on polling day.Section 4 provides for the insertion of a new Part IIIA in the 1999 Act.  That Part contains two sections relating respectively to spending limits at local elections and to the setting of the spending period for the reckoning of election expenditure incurred by or on behalf of candidates, or political parties at a local election.Section 4 inserts a new section 12A in the 1999 Act which will provide for the introduction of spending limits at local elections.  It sets out the specific limits on election expenditure by candidates and political parties for each category of electoral area, calculated on the basis of the population of such areas.  For the 2009 local elections, population data from the 2006 census report is being used as the basis for determining the spending limits in county and city council electoral areas.  In order to avoid ambiguity about future elections, I intend to propose an amendment on Committee Stage.  This amendment will specify that population data used in setting spending limits will be from the census report setting out the final result of the most recent census of population.The spending limits for local elections will apply to individual candidates in the first instance.  Candidates nominated by a political party will be deemed to allocate automatically 10% of their spending limit to the party's national agent for use at a national level.  However, there will be scope to vary this figure upwards or downwards by written agreement between the candidate and his or her political party.A new section 12B includes a revised formula for determining the period for the reckoning of election expenses incurred by or on behalf of a political party or a candidate at a local election.  It provides that after the Minister has made an order under section 26 of the Local Government Act 2001 fixing polling day at a local election, he or she may by order specify the period during which election expenses at the local election concerned are to be reckoned for the purposes of Part III A of the 1999 Act.  Section 12B also provides that the date on which the spending period commences at the election must be not less than 50 and not more than 60 days prior to polling.  The spending period ends on polling day at the election.The existing requirements provided for in the 1999 Act on the furnishing of statements of election expenditure by political parties and candidates at the local elections will continue to apply at the 2009 and future elections.  The key additional requirement is that candidates and political parties are required to comply with the relevant spending limits specified in section 12A of the 1999 Act.  Political parties and candidates at the election will have to continue to comply with the existing requirements of the 1999 Act on the furnishing of statements of election expenses and donation statements within 90 days following the polling day at the election.  These include the statements by the national agent of a political party to the specified local authority, and by the designated person of a political party, or a candidate at the election, or third parties to the local authority concerned.In the case of a candidate at the election, the statement of donations and election expenses must include details of the election expenses incurred and the source of the income, including details of each donation which exceeds €635.  Statements by political parties and third parties of expenditure at a national level will be made available for inspection by the specified authority, which is Dublin City Council.In the case of a candidate of a political party whose candidature is authorised by the party, the national agent of the party may, by agreement in writing, authorise the designated person of the party within an electoral area to incur a proportion of the election expenditure at the election which the candidate is entitled to incur at electoral area level under section 12A(1)(a).  The designated person must submit a declaration of spending to the local authority, as they have done heretofore under the existing requirements.Section 5 provides for the insertion of a new subsection in section 19 of the 1999 Act to require local authorities to include in their annual reports the aggregate details of election expenditure in respect of each candidate as well as details of donations received by candidates.  This will assist in publicising the information contained in the statements of election expenditure and statutory declarations furnished to local authorities.Statements of election expenditure and statutory declarations furnished to the local authority are required by section 14 of the Act of 1999 to be provided to the elected members of the local authority.  The 1999 Act requires a local authority to register every statement of election expenses and every donation statement it receives under section 13 of the Act, and to acknowledge receipt of the statement.  A local authority must also give public notice by way of publication of a notice in a newspaper circulating in its functional area indicating the time and place that the statements can be inspected; the notice must also include the names of those who have not furnished statements.Local authorities are required to retain for a period of at least three years from the latest date for the furnishing of statements of election expenses and statutory declarations, every statement of election expenses and statutory declaration as well as any relevant court orders arising from any legal proceedings connected with the election which relates to the local authority.A local authority must permit any person to inspect free of charge any documents furnished to it by a national agent or designated person of a political party or candidate at the election.  It must permit such a person to take a copy of such document or an extract from the document on payment of a fee not exceeding the reasonable cost of copying.Under section 18 of the 1999 Act, a local authority is required to draw up and issue guidelines to candidates and political parties on matters provided for in the Act.  This will also include guidance on spending limits at an election.  Such guidelines on the local elections will be of great assistance to candidates and political parties at the election, and will make for a greater understanding of the requirements of the legislation governing local elections and spending limits.Section 6 provides for the amendment to section 19C(1) of the 1999 Act to widen the scope of section 19C, by inserting a reference to section 12A.  This will enable the Minister to vary the spending limits at local elections from time to time, in order to take account of changes in the consumer price index since the coming into operation of the provision.  This will ensure that the Minister could vary, by order under this section, the monetary amounts set out in section 12A  which specify the limits on expenditure by political parties and candidates at local elections, having regard to changes in the consumer price index.  This would be done by order of the Minister under section 19C, and it would obviate the need for primary legislation to do so.Section 7 provides for the amendment of section 20 of the 1999 Act.  The amendment provides that where a member of a local authority elected at a local election incurs expenditure in excess of the expenditure limits set out in section 12A of the amended 1999 Act, and where he or she is convicted by a court following proceedings initiated under section 20(3A), in addition to any penalty which the court may impose, he or she will be disqualified for membership of any local authority.  The disqualification in such a case will apply and will have effect for the remainder of the term in office of the members of that authority.Section 8 of the Bill provides for the amendment of section 21 of the 1999 Act to strengthen provisions for offences and penalties in that section, and to introduce additional offences and penalties in respect of non-compliance with spending limits at local elections.  It provides that a national agent or a designated person of a political party or a candidate at the election is guilty of an offence, if he or she incurs election expenses in excess of the relevant expenditure limits.The amendment of section 21 also provides for offences and penalties where a person incurs election expenses on behalf of a political party, unless the person is the national agent or a person authorised by such an agent acting within the limit of such authorisation, or on behalf of a candidate, unless the person is a designated person or a person authorised by such a person acting within such authorisation.  Penalties of up to €25,000 are provided for where somebody guilty of an offence is convicted on indictment or, at the discretion of the court, to imprisonment for a period not exceeding three years, or to both the fine and term of imprisonment.Section 9 deals with the position in litter legislation on the existing exemption from prosecution for exhibitors of public meeting, election or referendum posters.  That legislation is silent on the start date from which such posters may be erected.  I am aware that in practice, many local authorities do not allow candidates to erect posters until an order appointing polling day is made. The Local Elections (Donations and Expenditure) Act 1999, to be amended by section 4 of the Bill, allows for a spending period for determining candidate expenses in local elections to be specified by order of the Minister.   I have decided that this period will be not less than 50 and not more than 60 days prior to polling day at a local election as the date for the commencement of the spending period, and the polling day at the relevant election as the date on which the spending period ends.  This may inadvertently result in candidates believing they may lawfully erect election posters for a period of 50 to 60 days prior to local elections — a time period which is too long and which may lead to greater levels of litter arising from these posters.To control litter arising from posters and to remove any uncertainty which could be created, I propose that the maximum time period prior to an election during which posters may be exhibited should either commence from the date the polling day order is made, or be a designated time period of 30 days prior to polling day, whichever is the shorter time period.In the case of any future referendum, I do not propose to restrict the time period involved to 30 days.  Instead, I propose to allow posters to be erected from the date the order appointing polling day is made.  If the amendment is accepted, posters which advertise a public meeting for up to 30 days prior to the date of that meeting will be permitted.  The amendment to the Litter Pollution Act 1997 will clarify the position on the time limit for the erection of posters for public meetings, elections and referenda, and remove any confusion which may exist in this regard, leading to greater control of postering and a reduction in littering.  I do not propose to amend the provision which currently allows exhibitors to remove any posters they erected up to seven days after a poll.I am satisfied that the introduction of spending limits for candidates and political parties at local elections will herald a new era of openness and transparency in the electoral process.  Putting in place spending limits will ensure that national and local elections will all be subject to similar spending rules, and should contribute to simplifying the law in this area.I commend the Bill to the House.
#JamesBannon	unknown-#JamesBannon-party	unknown-#JamesBannon-dob	unknown-#JamesBannon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-03-11 00:00:00	Prelude	181	I wish to share my time with Deputy Clune.I welcome the Minister to the House.  This Bill addresses important issues relating to the amendment of the Local Elections (Disclosure of Donations and Expenditure) Act 1999 and the Litter Pollution Act 1997, and it broadly succeeds as such. However, it fails for its lack of scope and depth, particularly the timescale proposed for limits on election spending and the failure to include a reference to the provision of an electoral commission, which is essential for the impartiality of all electoral matters.  Nonetheless, I am delighted the Minister has acknowledged the work of the Joint Committee on the Environment, Heritage and Local Government on the electoral register, with which I will deal shortly.The  Electoral Act 1997 has been the principal instrument for regulating electoral spending.  This Act introduced limits on election expenditure as part of a reform of broader issues, including public funding for political parties and a disclosure requirement on political donations over a certain threshold.  These limits have operated in line with inflation only in respect of Dáil elections, general elections, by-elections, European elections and Presidential elections.  The Electoral (Amendment) Act 2001 added further restrictions, such as the capping of the size of political donations, the prohibition of foreign donations and requirements for a mandatory political donations account, with full disclosure to the Standards in Public Office Commission.  However, local elections were outside the net and equity certainly played no part in election spending.  The disparities from party to party and candidate to candidate made a mockery of democracy, leaving candidates from weaker parties or those of limited means at a decided disadvantage.While I fully support the Minister's stance on election spending, I also agree with those who feel the damage has been done long before the new proposed 60 day time limits for spending on the local elections, which is double the current 30 days prior to a general election.  This timescale will have to be examined.  The actual spending limits for the local elections in my constituency of Longford and Westmeath sees Ballymahon, Drumlish and Granard in County Longford with a candidate spending limit of €9,750, while the Longford electoral area has a limit of €11,500 and Westmeath has an overall candidate spending limit of €11,500. This demonstrates the differing rates in practice and on the surface it may appear to make sense in terms of electoral area size.  However, it fails to account for the greater distance travelled in rural areas.  A rural constituency is sparsely populated and it costs more to canvass.  One could travel two miles down a road simply to canvass one house, whereas in a town or city walking the length of one street may allow many houses to be covered in a short space of time.  In terms of time and money, the rural canvass costs more.Given the changing face of politics and the pressure brought to bear on individual candidates and political parties, electioneering starts the moment one election is over and runs right up to the next election.  Spending could be said to be well past its peak in the eight weeks before polling day.  While the proposed linking of the limits to the size of the electoral area is not without its problems, especially for rural constituencies, and will certainly go some way to providing fairness and equity to the electoral process, the timescale is worrying.  Perhaps the Minister could give some thought to bringing in a limited spend to bear across the fixed time between local and European elections.  I realise this would be a good deal more difficult to enforce for a general election, given the unpredictable nature of that process.The announcement at the weekend that the self-seeking grasp of big business is to be cut from around politics is welcome.

I appreciate the Minister's efforts and he has our full support in that regard.  The wealthy called the tune, reaping the benefits of the Celtic tiger years and now low and middle income taxpayers are picking up the tab.  However, it is difficult to have confidence in the Minister, Deputy Gormley, when as soon as he announces a crackdown on bankers' pay, his colleague the Minister for Finance, Deputy Brian Lenihan, pulls the rug from under his feet in the blink of an eye.  The Minister for Finance has shown the Minister's words to be empty rhetoric.  Guaranteeing that banker's pay would be capped, while knowing that the Minister for Finance had already rejected the idea——

It is only by a clear out of the corruption that has beset the country that confidence can be restored internationally in Irish integrity.Monkeys hanging from trees and poles played a part in scuppering a Lisbon treaty "Yes" vote.  Apart from the recognisable simian anti-treaty campaigners, the 47 varieties portrayed on posters throughout the country were instrumental in bringing in a "No" vote.  While the Bill does not highlight the problems associated with the Lisbon treaty referendum per se, section 9(e) specifically relates to advertising for a referendum, albeit in connection with litter.  However the issue of the content of posters must also be considered and addressed.It is essential that whatever is necessary is brought to bear to ensure that the Lisbon treaty re-run is not hijacked again by politicians at the expense of the issues involved.  Posters highlighting individual politicians should be banned from the public arena in the lead up to the re-run of the Lisbon treaty referendum.

#JamesBannon	unknown-#JamesBannon-party	unknown-#JamesBannon-dob	unknown-#JamesBannon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-03-11 00:00:00	Prelude	194	Allied with the lack of information that was the hallmark of the disastrous Lisbon treaty referendum, the confusion associated with posters featuring party politicians brought the campaign to an inevitable conclusion.  Bluntly put, politicians on every side of the divide must rise above the promotion of their personal image to highlight the pros and cons of this important issue.The survival of the country as a member of the EU is not dependent on local or national politics, but rather the subjection of national bickering to secure our European future for voters throughout the country.  Photos of local politicians on Lisbon treaty posters clouded and obscured the essential message.  Many voters were confused and party loyalties directed what should have been independent and well informed opinion.  I call on the Minister to take whatever steps are necessary to direct a sensible campaign in the lead up to the second Lisbon treaty vote.  Posters should only be permitted to feature a point of view and not be used as a form of self promotion.While the Bill seeks to limit the period during which posters may be exhibited at elections, it should also make provision to separate the form of poster permitted for elections as opposed to referendums.  Given the obvious lack of thought in the lead up to the first Lisbon treaty vote, it is now essential that the i's are dotted and the t's are crossed.At local and general elections, posters can be counter productive.  The public is fed up with the early appearance of posters which can be compared with the extension of the Christmas period.  To the electorate, the appearance of posters evokes the same reaction as the appearance of the festive season in mid or early September.  Election posters appear early and disappear late.  What starts as a poster well fixed to a pole or tree may become in the course of the lead up to the election a scruffy, defaced offering hanging on by a thread or else blowing about the street.  Perhaps election posters should be limited to free dedicated poster sites and not permitted to appear like a rash around our streets.  An excess of posters can be counter productive and the irritation factor for the public especially regarding the litter factor can in fact work against candidates.Perhaps as a member of the Green Party, the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government would consider an allowance for the recycling of posters.  This is an initiative that would lessen the public's aversion to the rash of posters that, once the election is over, add to our waste problems.The extension of the role of local authorities in the Bill at the expense of a provision to set up an independent electoral commission is disappointing.  While local authorities have done the best job possible in the circumstances, the care of the electoral register is not within their remit and has placed an undue burden on staff and resources.  Currently some 34 registration authorities are legally responsible for preparing and maintaining the register, despite it not being a core function of local authorities.  This undoubtedly leads to a lack of priority being given to maintaining data.A review carried out by Fine Gael on the future of the electoral register in Ireland has indicated that the need for a single, independent body to foster integrity and public confidence in the democratic process and to regulate party and election finances is a foremost consideration.  An electoral commission which would regulate all matters pertaining to the electoral register would fill the void that has been created by the decentralised multi-agency approach taken to the register in the past.  An accurate register of electors is essential if one is to have an open and fully transparent voting process in a democracy.While it is not productive to hark back to mistakes made by the Government, it is self-evident that the electoral register has been woefully neglected.  The Government's startling apathy towards the register culminated in the finding of more than 800,000 errors, which is totally unacceptable.  Every person entitled to vote must be able to do so and all citizens must have confidence in the accuracy of the electoral register.While the rights of citizenship are continually emphasised in democracies, citizens' duties and obligations, which in this country broadly prescribe that we owe certain duties or obligations to the State, including the payment of taxes and the undertaking of jury service, should be expanded to emphasise the duty as opposed to merely the right to exercise one's electoral franchise.  In 32 countries worldwide it is compulsory to vote.  In 19 of these countries, including Australia, compulsory voting is pursued through enforcement and in Belgium it dates back to 1892.The Government must support the establishment of an electoral commission and compilation of a new national rolling electoral register.  It is essential to resolve the problems associated with the register of electors and the associated necessity of having a single overarching body responsible for the compilation of the electoral register.  The Chief Electoral Officer in Northern Ireland or Electoral Commission in the United Kingdom could serve as a model.Administration of the electoral system has been piecemeal and lacks a cohesive approach.  The Joint Committee on the Environment, Heritage and Local Government has consulted a number of bodies in other jurisdictions.  The Fine Gael Party supports and promotes the overriding consensus that a single body be established to compile and manage the electoral register.  This should be an independent body free from Government and political interference.  What is wrong with this proposal?  It should be acceptable to all those who have nothing to hide or brush under the carpet.  The CEO of the Northern Ireland Electoral Office is not a member of the civil service there.  His or her terms of reference are similar to those of a judge which gives the office an independence from government or political interference.We must introduce a system which is recognised as a model of good practice in electoral registration and administration.  All eligible persons should be able to participate in the democratic process by registering and voting, free from intimidation and threats.  It is essential to secure the integrity of the electoral process.  Once a new body, whether an electoral commission or national electoral office under a chief executive officer with local offices, is established, it should have a broader remit than compiling and maintaining the electoral register.  The CEO should be designated the electoral commissioner or chief electoral officer.  The body should have complete responsibility for the electoral register, the electoral process, specifically initiatives such as e-voting if this can be satisfactorily introduced, counter-fraud measures and electoral identity cards.While the introduction of electoral identity cards may be contentious in so far as the debate on this issue of identity cards is characterised by strong opposing viewpoints, such a card, provided it featured a photograph, would eliminate fraud.  Members should strongly support the introduction of electoral identity cards as part of an overall revamp of the electoral process and as a valuable tool to complete registration.  Registration for an electoral identity card could run hand in hand with electoral registration and while the card would not contain personally sensitive information, such as PPS numbers, date of birth or address, such data would be kept on record.  An electoral identity card could also be used to open a bank account, for the purposes of airline security, to gain entrance to pubs and clubs, thus bypassing the need for students to carry passports which are currently being misused, and to buy alcohol and tobacco.Legislation must be urgently drafted to empower a new body or commission to carry out a clearly defined mandate; transfer electoral roles to one body; revise the existing register, as outlined; give statutory standing to a continuous registration process; provide resources for staffing, marketing and research; and update the registration process with an emphasis on compulsory registration.  It is my considered opinion, based on methods used in other jurisdictions, that all matters pertaining to the register and the full electoral process should come under the sole authority of a single body.While the Fine Gael Party does not propose to table a large number of amendments, it will seek clarity on the wording of paragraph (i) on page 5, which is confusing and appears to indicate that a political party could incur 10% of the expense incurred in a local election.  The Minister went some way towards clarifying this matter but further clarification is required.The Minister also referred to the disqualification of a member of a local authority who breaks the law.  However, he did not indicate how the resultant vacancy would be filled.  He must clarify how this will be done, for example, by way of a by-election or co-option.
#DeirdreClune	unknown-#DeirdreClune-party	unknown-#DeirdreClune-dob	unknown-#DeirdreClune-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-03-11 00:00:00	Prelude	195	I thank my colleague, Deputy Bannon, for sharing time and welcome the opportunity to speak on the Bill.  I have been aware of the Minister's consultations on the legislation and have read some of the transcripts of meetings of the Joint Committee on the Environment, Heritage and Local Government.  The Minister and joint committee have been open to consultation and have invited submissions on the legislation.I am particularly pleased the Local Authority Members Association is taking the Bill seriously.  Its submission focused on expenditure limits during local elections and the need to take cognisance of the different types of electoral areas and so forth.  For example, we have borough, city and county councils, rural and urban areas and sparsely and densely populated areas.  The tiered expenditure limits the Minister proposes will go some way towards addressing these disparities.  The elections in June will be a test run for the legislation.From my experience of standing in local elections, the money one spends is not as important as the number of people one meets, the number of doors one knocks and the extent of one's connection with the local community.  Having been elected to Cork City Council on two occasions, I believe there are few better ways of making an impact on the electorate other than direct contact.  The limit of €7,500 proposed for a candidate standing in an election to a borough council does not appear to be excessive.The Acting Chairman, Deputy O'Flynn, served on the same local authority as I did and will be aware of the importance of connecting with people and working on the ground if one wants to be elected.
#JohnGormley	unknown-#JohnGormley-party	unknown-#JohnGormley-dob	unknown-#JohnGormley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-03-11 00:00:00	Prelude	196	My Department is advancing the preparation of necessary legislation to give effect to a new charge to be levied by local authorities on non-principal private residences, as announced in budget 2009.  It is expected the new Bill setting out the necessary legislative provisions will be introduced shortly and the Government's intention is to have it enacted as soon as possible thereafter.  I expect this charge to make a significant contribution to local authority income in 2009.The Government has already indicated, in light of the further deterioration in the public finances, that public expenditure provisions and revenue-increasing measures will be reviewed in the coming weeks with a view to adhering to the planned budget strategy for the current year.  I am at present reviewing all my Department's expenditure programmes in consultation with the Minister for Finance.  Pending the conclusion of these deliberations, it would be premature to anticipate the outcome of the review or the detail of any potential proposals that may emerge from it.  However, there will of course be reductions.  My intention is to rigorously assess all areas of current and capital spending with a view to prioritising those that support the maintenance of jobs, position the economy for recovery, address essential social objectives and support the achievement of key environmental compliance requirements.The Minister for Finance has already indicated the timeframe within which the Government intends to complete the review now under way.  It is open to the Opposition parties to respond to the recent invitation to put forward their own suggestions for addressing the critical economic and fiscal difficulties we face and we will give full consideration to any such proposals.  In the meantime, as outlined, I will be assessing all expenditure and seeking greater efficiencies, and my Department will be consulting local authorities and the bodies under the aegis of the Department.

The leader of our party asked this morning for additional assistance and information regarding these matters before we can come to any conclusion.  We will not have responsibility without power, and we will not have an input without information.  The Minister cannot expect us to participate on that basis.Would this not be a good time to dispose of the e-voting machines?  This would result in a substantial saving.  Nobody can understand why it is taking the Minister so long, after almost two years in office, to bite the bullet in this regard.There has been a massive increase in applications for schemes such as housing aid for the elderly and housing adaptation grants since their introduction.  Is it sustainable for the Department to continue these schemes without clearing the backlog?  What proposals are there to clear that backlog?  Finally, is the Minister in favour of introducing a property tax on principal private residences in the context of his proposals for the budget?
#JohnGormley	unknown-#JohnGormley-party	unknown-#JohnGormley-dob	unknown-#JohnGormley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-03-11 00:00:00	Prelude	198	The concept of a property tax is being examined, as the Deputy knows, by the Commission on Taxation, which is due to report in September.  We will consider all its proposals.  It is investigating a range of proposals including a carbon tax and some form of property tax.  We have been assured by the Minister for Finance that the carbon tax will be introduced but, again, it is premature to talk about the sort of property taxes, if any, that are being considered or that will be recommended.  That does not preclude us, however, from going ahead with the €200 levy to which I referred in my reply.  The legislation will be introduced and it will be a significant step forward in terms of broadening the revenue base for local authorities.Applications for schemes such as housing aid for the elderly have increased, but, in terms of what local authorities can and cannot do, we are also looking at a substantial decrease in the number of planning applications, for example.  Thus, I do not think there will be a problem with a backlog.  The only problem will be whether we can sustain the investment from my Department over the current period or will need to make substantial cutbacks.  In essence, the Deputy's question is about sustaining such services through capital investment.  The frank answer is that under the current circumstances, of course we will have to make adjustments.  There is no question about that.  We will consider all aspects, including the question of the voting machines, which I am considering in detail.  As I have said many times, I will be in a position to make a judgment on that as soon as I get the progress report.

Has the Minister carried out an evaluation of the impact on the local government fund of the massive deterioration in the number of motor vehicles sold in 2009?  How will we make up the shortfall?
#JohnGormley	unknown-#JohnGormley-party	unknown-#JohnGormley-dob	unknown-#JohnGormley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-03-11 00:00:00	Prelude	202	The Deputy is right to point this out.  A total of 85% of new vehicles purchased this year are in the low-CO2 category, which shows the success of that scheme and that it is having the desired effect.  However, there has been a reduction in new car sales this year.  Two thirds of the money going to local government comes from motor taxation, while one third comes from the Exchequer.  My officials are investigating this.  They are aware there is a shortfall due to the reduction in car sales and we are mindful that local government funding will be reduced as a result.  That is simply a fact of life and we will have to consider alternatives.  The way we fund local government, by relying on motor tax, is not sustainable either environmentally or economically.  We must consider more sustainable forms of revenue, including the possibility of moving away from reliance on motor taxes and commercial rates.  Instead we must consider possibilities such as those mentioned, including a tax on second properties.  This should prove to be an enormous success and will, I hope, be the beginning of a new way of funding local government.

Since its establishment, it has engaged in extensive business transactions involving the purchase, management, development and sale of lands in the area.  The authority is self-financing, operating on the profits of its business dealings, and does not receive Exchequer subvention.  Any liabilities incurred by the authority in the course of its activities are expected to be met from its own resources.Under section 30 of the Dublin Docklands Development Authority Act 1997, the authority may, with the consent of the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, given with the consent of the Minister for Finance, borrow money and in this regard may incur liabilities not exceeding €127 million.  Any moneys borrowed and any interest accruing thereon may be secured on the revenue, funds or property of the authority.  The authority has stated that it is fully solvent and in a position to meet all its liabilities for many years to come.  I expect the authority's 2008 accounts, which will be submitted to me before the end of June, to show that the authority continues to be self-financing.

These concerns include well known conflicts of interest, the deal done on the site of the former Irish Glass Bottle site and the fact that the authority could not or would not pay the interest on its loans in the second half of 2008, although it has since paid it.  However, that a State body was not in a position to or did not wish to pay a portion of the interest due on a sizeable loan is certainly disquieting.Has the Minister inquired into the matters raised with the Oireachtas Joint Committee on the Environment, Heritage and Local Government regarding the executive of the Dublin Docklands Development Authority and does he have concerns in respect of them?
#JohnGormley	unknown-#JohnGormley-party	unknown-#JohnGormley-dob	unknown-#JohnGormley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-03-11 00:00:00	Prelude	206	The Deputy will be aware that a "Prime Time" programme was made on the Dublin Docklands Development Authority which referred to some of the issues he raised.  I have appointed Mr. Gerry McCaughey, who has been described as a green entrepreneur, as the new chairperson to the authority .  Mr. McCaughey understands the necessity of good regulation and I believe he will move the authority in the right direction and ensure that it operates to the highest standards.  I have also appointed Ms Yvonne Farrell, an architect, to the board.The authority made a significant and high profile joint venture investment in the acquisition of the Irish Glass Bottle site.  I am very familiar with this site as I live close to it.  The authority considered it necessary to become involved in the acquisition of this property because of its key location on the Poolbeg Peninsula and its significant development potential.  It remains an important development asset and a long-term investment.  The authority is satisfied that its interest in the property will, in due course, facilitate it in achieving its long-term objectives for the sustainable regeneration and development of the Poolbeg area and will bring substantial benefits in terms of high quality physical development and community gain.The authority and its joint venture partners are in commercial negotiations with the relevant banks regarding the refinancing of the loan facility for the acquisition.  This is in line with other commercial lending in current market conditions.  Interest payments on the loan were suspended for a period but the authority has confirmed that all interest due to date has been paid.  It has been informed that its joint venture partners are also fully up to date with their interest payments.

Members were given assurances by the authority when it appeared before the Joint Committee on the Environment, Heritage and Local Government that the budgets for its education development and social regenerations programmes would be maintained.  However, it appears that the committee was misled because I have evidence to suggest that cuts are being made to the programmes as we speak.Was the new chairman of the authority, for whom I have the utmost respect, given terms of reference or ministerial instructions on addressing the problems that have emerged?  Does the Department intend to commission an independent valuation of the site given that it cannot rely on the authority to carry out an independent valuation?

Mr. McCaughey has been fully briefed by my officials and the CEO of the authority, Mr. Moloney, on the potential for and difficulties with the site.  I have no doubt that he will thoroughly investigate these matters and will come to his own conclusions.  I understand he is at present considering legal and governance issues.  These relatively complex issues will be addressed by Mr. McCaughey and the CEO of the authority.

This would support the achievement of additional operational efficiencies by the board in the delivery of its functions.  My Department is currently undertaking the necessary preparatory work for this review and I hope it will yield a preliminary outcome by autumn 2009.The PRTB has not brought specific concerns to my attention in regard to the use of licensing arrangements as a mechanism for circumventing the provisions of the Act.  Nevertheless, I will arrange for the issue to be considered as part of the review.  As I indicated to Deputy Ciarán Lynch at a recent meeting to discuss issues around the operation of the Act, I would welcome any evidence that indicates the Act is the subject of abuse or circumvention in the manner outlined.  I will ensure that such evidence is carefully examined in the course of the review.
#CiaranLynch	unknown-#CiaranLynch-party	unknown-#CiaranLynch-dob	unknown-#CiaranLynch-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-03-11 00:00:00	Prelude	210	My question for the Minister of State pertains to landlords' use of sham licences to deprive tenants of their rights and the PRTB of its jurisdiction.  While certain renting arrangements fall outside the scope of the Act, some landlords use sham licences to circumvent their responsibilities.  One such licensing arrangement which I have brought to the Minister of State's attention is advertised on the website of the Irish Property Owners' Association.  I ask him the number of tenancies held under licence which should be with the PRTB and whether he agrees that sham licences are problematic in that they deprive tenants of their legal rights.The PRTB faces an increasing burden of work because it must decide on cases involving contests to these licences.  A number of instances have been documented whereby the board has had to decide on this issue.  Does a licensed tenancy come within the board's dispute resolution remit and how often has it defeated licence agreements in the District Court?  Although the Minister of State may claim the issue has not been brought to his attention, I am sure the PRTB will tell him that a significant problem has arisen.  A coach and four can be driven through the legislation by landlords who want to deprive tenants of their rights.

Such issues are understood to be the subject of an insignificant proportion of the cases received by the board.  It is, however, mindful of the need to ensure tenancy registration requirements are not avoided through licensing and other arrangements and will continue to adopt a robust approach to the matter.On foot of the matter being brought to my attention, I have included the issue of licensing in the review.  I will presently be in a position to sign off on the terms of reference of that review.The notice posted on the website of the Irish Property Owners' Association has also been brought to my attention and officials of my Department have been in contact with the association.  I am told that the notice was posted four years ago and will be reviewed.  The association did not see a problem with the notice when it was posted.Licences are applicable where a person stays in a hotel, hostel, guesthouse or digs, or shares a house with its owner under the rent-a-room scheme.  The only exception to this is where a person stays in rented accommodation at the invitation of a tenant.  If the tenant of the property is the owner's son and he invites others to live with him, some provisions of the Act will apply.If the Deputy supplies evidence to suggest that provisions of the Act are being abused in a licensing arrangement, I will forward it to the PRTB.  I have discussed at a recent meeting the issues he has raised today.
#CiaranLynch	unknown-#CiaranLynch-party	unknown-#CiaranLynch-dob	unknown-#CiaranLynch-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-03-11 00:00:00	Prelude	212	I certainly will forward such evidence to the Minister of State.  He said the notice was posted four years ago.  I printed this off at 2.25 p.m. so it is still being advertised as we speak.Is the Minister of State aware of the knock-on consequences of these licence agreements?  In Cork city, a tenant cannot obtain a parking permit if the landlord is not registered with the PRTB.  Tenants cannot avail of many facilities as a result of arrangements under these licences.We have just been debating the Electoral (Amendment) Bill.  The issues of registration and accommodation also arise.  The groups most affected by this are the most vulnerable in society, those moving from homelessness into accommodation, students with no experience as tenants and non-Irish citizens living in the State who are not familiar with Irish law.  Clear abuse is taking place with tenants' rights being undermined.Also, a number of landlords are undermining the Residential Tenancies Act 2004.  I know of landlords doing so around the University College Cork area in Cork city.  This is not a new issue, it has arisen since the Act was put in place in 2004.

A tenant has the authority to bring a case to the Private Residential Tenancy Board even if that person is not registered and the PRTB has the authority to act and has acted in such situations.  There are two options open to anyone in this situation.  He can direct evidence to me or to the Department and it will be dealt with and he is also entitled to go to the PRTB and it will act on the matter.The Deputy has mentioned properties near University College Cork.  We have no direct evidence but we have passed on the information, as we do with any evidence we get.
#CiaranLynch	unknown-#CiaranLynch-party	unknown-#CiaranLynch-dob	unknown-#CiaranLynch-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-03-11 00:00:00	Prelude	214	I take on board the Minister of State's commitment to resolve the issue but is he saying to me he is aware the PRTB has taken action on this?  That would contradict the statement he made a couple of minutes ago that the issue has not been brought to his attention.  Has it been brought to his attention or not?
#MichaelFinneranFF	unknown-#MichaelFinneranFF-party	unknown-#MichaelFinneranFF-dob	unknown-#MichaelFinneranFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-03-11 00:00:00	Prelude	215	I did not say it had not been brought to my attention.

It does not consider this to be an issue but, having said that, I have decided to include a review of licences in the overall review of the legislation.
#JohnGormley	unknown-#JohnGormley-party	unknown-#JohnGormley-dob	unknown-#JohnGormley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-03-11 00:00:00	Prelude	220	On publication of the public expenditure Estimates associated with Budget 2009 in October 2008, the Department's overall capital expenditure envelope amounted to €2.145 billion.  Most of this funding related to capital expenditure grants for housing, infrastructural and other capital programmes, chiefly implemented by local authorities.  At the end of February 2009, total capital expenditure by the Department amounted to €223 million.This level of capital expenditure has continued to sustain important local authority capital programmes relating to social and affordable housing provision; continued expansion of investment in sewage treatment and water supply infrastructure; the provision of fire stations and public libraries; upgrading of waste recycling facilities; improvements to our national parks and other heritage improvements.In the reply to an earlier question, I referred to the Government's preparation of a supplementary budget to ensure that the projected general Government deficit does not worsen in 2009.  This can be expected to include a combination of expenditure adjustments and revenue raising measures.  In line with the Government's continuing commitment to productive capital investment, the Department will continue to have sufficient capital resources to allow local authorities to meet their capital commitments arising in 2009, that capital projects underway will proceed as planned across all local authorities, and that our most critical investment priorities can be maintained.The capacity to commence new capital projects will reflect the extent of capital provisions finally determined for the current year.  I will review the priority needs of all programmes in deciding on the extent to which new commitments are entered into by the Department and by local authorities.  I am acutely aware of the value of key infrastructural investment programmes in terms of employment creation and maintenance, economic recovery and social and environmental support.  I intend to sustain these programmes to the highest level possible into the future.It is normal practice for local authorities to supplement Exchequer capital grants with  borrowing and I am aware of the wishes of councils to continue to avail of borrowing facilities in 2009.  Local authority borrowing forms part of the overall general Government balance for national financial reporting.  As part of the overall management of national borrowing levels, a limit also applies to local government sector borrowing.  I will be addressing priority borrowing needs in the local government sector for 2009 in consultation with the local authorities over the next few weeks and I will facilitate urgent needs.
#PhilipHogan	unknown-#PhilipHogan-party	unknown-#PhilipHogan-dob	unknown-#PhilipHogan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-03-11 00:00:00	Prelude	221	Many projects the Minister was intending to proceed with in 2009 will be not be possible because the funding is being cut and the development levies required for some of those projects at local authority level has dried up.  Many local authorities face financial difficulties arising from those issues.  How many new projects will go ahead in 2009?  How many borrowing requests received by the Minister have been refused?
#JohnGormley	unknown-#JohnGormley-party	unknown-#JohnGormley-dob	unknown-#JohnGormley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-03-11 00:00:00	Prelude	222	I will go through some of the issues raised by the Deputy.  On a previous occasion Deputy Hogan asked about the housing capital programme.  In broad terms, €1.4 billion of Exchequer capital funding is available for housing in 2009.  We must work towards the fullest achievement of our broad range of housing objectives against the background of the significantly altered economic context.  The approach must involve maintaining momentum in meeting social housing needs against a background of significantly increased pressures.The 2009 provision of over €500 million will meet the ongoing commitments for some 150 schemes in progress under the water services investment programme and provide for continued investment under the rural water programme.  Prudent management and profiling of the highest priorities will allow us to commence in 2009 on some new schemes and I will be examining the position closely in light of the final budgetary position which is currently being determined.
#PhilipHogan	unknown-#PhilipHogan-party	unknown-#PhilipHogan-dob	unknown-#PhilipHogan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-03-11 00:00:00	Prelude	223	What about the borrowing requests?
#JohnGormley	unknown-#JohnGormley-party	unknown-#JohnGormley-dob	unknown-#JohnGormley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-03-11 00:00:00	Prelude	224	When all of the requests for capital borrowing are taken together, they exceed €500 million but these are beyond the requirements for this year.  I envisage being able to accommodate half of this in 2009 with the rest spread over 2010 and subsequent years.  I am finalising my consultation with the councils and the determining priority must be that we see how labour intensive projects are.
#PhilipHogan	unknown-#PhilipHogan-party	unknown-#PhilipHogan-dob	unknown-#PhilipHogan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-03-11 00:00:00	Prelude	225	We are heading for difficulties with the water framework directive.  Can the Minister assure the House the provision he announced in the capital programme for 2009 for water and waste water services will be fully intact when the budgetary process is completed.?
#JohnGormley	unknown-#JohnGormley-party	unknown-#JohnGormley-dob	unknown-#JohnGormley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-03-11 00:00:00	Prelude	226	I cannot give such an assurance because there was provision for a record amount of €560 million.  We are looking at investment of over €500 million, which is still a substantial amount that represents an increase on last year.  We have commitments related to the water framework directive and it is not just about compliance with our EU obligations, it is also a matter of putting in place infrastructure so we will be in a position to benefit from the recovery when it takes place.
#JohnGormley	unknown-#JohnGormley-party	unknown-#JohnGormley-dob	unknown-#JohnGormley-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2009-03-11 00:00:00	Prelude	227	I propose to take Questions Nos. 38 and 45 together.An Bord Pleanála has a statutory objective to determine appeals and referrals within 18 weeks.  Consideration of the performance of the board must take account of the legacy of record levels of case intake over recent years and the assumption of significant new functions under the Planning and Development (Strategic Infrastructure) Act 2006.In 2007, the board received a record 6,664 new cases, up 12% on 2006, and determined 6,163, which is a 10% increase on 2006.  This high intake, coupled with an increased workload on strategic infrastructure cases, resulted in a significant backlog at the end of 2007 and challenged the board in meeting its statutory objective.  In 2008, almost 5,600 cases were received and 22% of cases were disposed of within the 18-week period.In light of the demands on the board, sanction was given in 2007 for an additional 35.5 permanent staff, bringing the total complement to 172.  Board membership has also been increased from ten to 11, on a temporary basis.The board is now focused on dealing with the backlog and restoring compliance with its statutory objective.  Caseload is expected to continue to decline with about 5,000 new cases anticipated over 2009.  In the two months to the end of February, the board determined over 900 cases with 584 cases determined in February, the highest monthly output on record.  Cases on hand have fallen 16% compared to the same period last year.To assist the board, I recently initiated arrangements, through the offices of the county and city managers' association, to secure the temporary secondment to the board of senior planning staff from authorities in the greater Dublin area.  I expect a positive response that would allow the first staff to transfer within the coming weeks.In the context of the Planning and Development (Amendment) Bill, I also intend to provide for a reduction in the board's current quorum of three to two, for the purpose of determining certain classes of routine cases.
#JimOKeeffe	unknown-#JimOKeeffe-party	unknown-#JimOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#JimOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-03-11 00:00:00	Prelude	228	Does the Minister accept that, in these difficult times, any bureaucratic obstacle to development must be removed forthwith?  There must be a strong emphasis on the encouragement of development.  Three suggestions occur to me.  First, one does not have to jettison good planning to ensure that the process is working effectively.  The involvement of a pre-validation process can ensure that.  In some local authorities invalidation runs at 40%, while in others it is below 8%.  That situation should be clarified.Second, I am glad that steps are being taken at last concerning planning appeals.  I worked on the basis that only one quarter of all appeals last year were disposed of within the statutory timeframe of 18 weeks.  I think the Minister said the figure was 22%, which is less than one quarter.  Whatever resources are needed should be given to An Bord Pleanála to clear that backlog, including freeing up local authority planners.Third, I know developers are not the favoured class of people in the world today, but without development this country will be in even greater trouble.  Can the duration of planning permissions be extended under the terms of the new legislation for something like three years?  This would encourage finance to get developments under way.I am making those three suggestions to the Minister not to help developers, but to help development.
#JohnGormley	unknown-#JohnGormley-party	unknown-#JohnGormley-dob	unknown-#JohnGormley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-03-11 00:00:00	Prelude	229	The Deputy is right to make that distinction.  People may say that while they like housing, they do not like developers but who builds the houses?
#JimOKeeffe	unknown-#JimOKeeffe-party	unknown-#JimOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#JimOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-03-11 00:00:00	Prelude	230	Exactly.

We want to ensure good development and good quality housing that is properly planned.  Not only are the Deputy's suggestions worthy of consideration, but I will also be bringing them forward.  They are vital for people who have invested large amounts of time and money.  In the Deputy's own part of the country recently I was told that an individual had invested considerable sums — up to €600,000 — yet the pre-application stage was sent from one planner to another.  That lack of consistency bedevils our planning system.  I am trying to bring consistency to all levels of planning, as well as consistency between local authorities.  Many of the issues the Deputy has raised will be addressed in the new Planning and Development (Amendment) Bill.
#JimOKeeffe	unknown-#JimOKeeffe-party	unknown-#JimOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#JimOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-03-11 00:00:00	Prelude	232	May I ask one supplementary question?  If the Minister accepts they are good ideas, will he, in the name of God, put them into operation as quickly as possible?
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-03-11 00:00:00	Prelude	233	I will call the Minister again.  I want to get Deputy Finian McGrath in.
#FinianMcGrath	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-party	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-dob	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-03-11 00:00:00	Prelude	234	I have three short questions.  Did I hear the Minister correctly when he said there was a 10% increase in appeals to An Bord Pleanála?  As regards the backlog of appeals, does the Minister still share my view, and that of many people in Dublin North Central, that the proposal of the Dublin Port Company to fill in 52 acres of Dublin Bay, currently before An Bord Pleanála, is environmental vandalism?  What is his current view on the position?
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-03-11 00:00:00	Prelude	235	It is quite improper to raise in the House a matter that is currently one for determination by an independent statutory body.

#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-03-11 00:00:00	Prelude	237	It would be quite improper and, if I recall, unlawful for the Minister to venture such a view.
#FinianMcGrath	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-party	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-dob	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-03-11 00:00:00	Prelude	238	I take that point but I just wanted to ask the Minister what his current view is on the particular proposal to destroy Dublin Bay.  When the Minister is dealing with the planning legislation, it is important to have sensitive community and environmental development throughout the city of Dublin.  Up to this we have seen a lot of crazy, wildcat stuff.
#JohnGormley	unknown-#JohnGormley-party	unknown-#JohnGormley-dob	unknown-#JohnGormley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-03-11 00:00:00	Prelude	239	To answer the Deputy's first question, it was not 10%; it is up 12%.  On his second question, it is not in the Minister's gift — indeed, as the Leas-Cheann Comhairle said, it is illegal to comment on any application or to try to influence any application.  However, in my role as Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, I have extended the special protection area for Dublin Bay.  It is an area I consider to be of immense ecological importance.  That is why it was done.  It has been welcomed by most people who are interested in Dublin Bay.  As the Deputy knows, we have also set up the Dublin Bay task force.  We are looking at regenerating the bay as a real resource — something that Dubliners can be proud of.  Compared to any other city, we are lucky and privileged to have such a bay.
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-03-11 00:00:00	Prelude	240	I know that both the Minister and the Deputy are interested in this matter but it is well beyond the scope of the question.

#TerenceFlanagan	unknown-#TerenceFlanagan-party	unknown-#TerenceFlanagan-dob	unknown-#TerenceFlanagan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-03-11 00:00:00	Prelude	242	As the Minister said, there is a sizeable backlog of applications before An Bord Pleanála.  In my own constituency of Dublin North East, the majority of planning decisions that end up with An Bord Pleanála go over the 18-week period.  What extra measures can the Minister take to ensure that these planning applications are determined within the timeframe?  I know he has appointed 35 more planners, but will that ensure that in future decisions are made in a more timely manner than at present?
#JohnGormley	unknown-#JohnGormley-party	unknown-#JohnGormley-dob	unknown-#JohnGormley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-03-11 00:00:00	Prelude	243	The short answer is "Yes".  I hope we can comply with the 18-week period because the peak of applications has now gone.  In the Dublin area in particular, we will be moving staff from local authorities to An Bord Pleanála.  We will also reduce the quorum required for routine applications from three to two.  All these measures will ensure that we actually comply with the 18-week period.  We will do that as quickly as possible.
#DenisNaughten	unknown-#DenisNaughten-party	unknown-#DenisNaughten-dob	unknown-#DenisNaughten-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-03-11 00:00:00	Prelude	244	I have a couple of brief questions.  In the context of this legislation, can the Minister ensure that something can be done about commercially malicious appeals that are taking place?  The Minister of State, Deputy Finneran, can provide some examples of where that happened.  Objections were lodged purely to delay a commercial operation so that they could get their own operation up and running.Can there be more co-operation with planners at local authority level to provide a checklist or information to local engineers concerning basic errors that are being made in planning applications?  In that way, applications could be streamlined in the first instance.As public representatives, we have all come across cases where engineers, allegedly acting on behalf of individuals — usually young couples — literally rob money from them by putting in planning applications which they know in their heart and soul have no possibility of being granted.  Despite this, they gather the fees for such applications, while the local authority is blamed as a result.

I have no doubt this happens but proving it in law may be difficult.  This point has been made repeatedly to me but it is difficult to deal with it in legislation.The Deputy is correct that a template would be helpful to applications, streamlining the process and pointing out any potential pitfalls.  Some local authorities provide this but, again, it is a question of getting consistency between the various authorities.Concerning engineers making applications on behalf of gullible people, one cannot legislate for gullibility.  I do not know why an engineer would be putting in an application.  I would have thought an architect or a planner would be far better qualified to do that.

However, cases have fallen by 16% compared to the same period last year.  While I cannot give a precise time on clearing it, steady progress is being made.
#JohnGormley	unknown-#JohnGormley-party	unknown-#JohnGormley-dob	unknown-#JohnGormley-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2009-03-11 00:00:00	Prelude	252	I propose to take Questions Nos. 39, 75, 88, 172 and 182 together.Bogs are important natural habitats and are home to unique ecosystems containing rare flora and fauna.  Both blanket bogs and raised bogs are protected habitats under European and Irish law and representative samples have been designated as special areas of conservation, SAC, under the habitats directive or natural heritage areas, NHA, under the wildlife Acts.Ireland has some of the most ecologically important bogs in the European Union.  In 1999, when the first of these sites was designated for nature protection, all commercial cutting on these bogs was stopped and the then Minister granted a ten-year grace for those who were cutting turf for their personal domestic use to find alternative sources of fuel.  This period expires this year for 32 raised bog SACs.Blanket bogs, which occur predominantly on the western seaboard but also in County Wicklow and the midlands, can tolerate a certain amount of turf extraction without compromising their value as habitats.  It is envisaged that cutting on blanket bog SACs and NHAs can continue, except in sensitive areas, under the current restrictions, which prohibit commercial extraction and the use of sausage peat cutting machines.Raised bogs occur predominantly in the midlands.  There are over 1,500 raised bogs in the State, of which only 139 are designated for nature protection as SACs or NHAs.  The continued cutting of turf, by hand or machine, and associated drainage on these designated raised bogs is incompatible with their preservation.  Even with the restrictions in cutting introduced in 1999, over one third of the best bog habitat on these sites has been lost in ten years.  More needs to be done if we are to meet our obligation to protect this important habitat.The habitats directive imposes a legal obligation on the State to take measures to ensure the protection of this essential and irreplaceable part of our natural heritage.  In the light of scientific evidence, it would not be appropriate to grant an extension to the derogation in these areas.  It is necessary to put arrangements in place to facilitate the transition to a full cessation of turf cutting on 32 raised bogs by the end of this year, and on the remaining number of designated raised bogs in 2012 and 2014.  My Department will establish an interdepartmental working group to consider how best to achieve these cessations over the coming years and to assess the resources that will be required.  This group will consult with interested parties, and report back to me later this year.
#DenisNaughten	unknown-#DenisNaughten-party	unknown-#DenisNaughten-dob	unknown-#DenisNaughten-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-03-11 00:00:00	Prelude	253	Is the Minister aware that 97% of the 32 raised bogs designated as SACs are already in State ownership through one or another agency?  The remaining 3% of these bogs comprises half-acre plots allocated by the Land Commission.  Is the Minister aware that the Corine maps, used to give the calculation that one third of the bogs allegedly evaporated over the past ten years, not only measured degraded bog but cut away bog over the past 100 years?  Will the Minister publish or place in the Library the Fernandez report?

I am aware of the sensitives around this issue and I have spoken to those involved.  It is an issue that goes back to 1999.  I have done everything I can to ensure a fair resolution.  The transition phase approach is probably the best.We need to be careful with this issue.  It was exploited irresponsibly at the time of the Lisbon treaty debate.  There was a misperception that we were stopping turf cutting on all bogs, including blanket bogs, which was never the case.  It is a small number of bogs that are in question.  The Deputy pointed out the small percentage in private ownership.We are trying to resolve this issue in a way that facilitates the tradition of turf cutting but, at the same time, ensures we meet our EU obligations.  If we ignore those obligations, we will face substantial fines.  That is not the motivating factor behind resolving this matter but we need to be mindful of it.Ireland has the best raised bog habitats in Europe.  I will facilitate any requests the Deputy has on this issue.  If he wants to meet with me or have me meet a delegation I would be happy to do so.
#SeymourCrawford	unknown-#SeymourCrawford-party	unknown-#SeymourCrawford-dob	unknown-#SeymourCrawford-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-03-11 00:00:00	Prelude	255	Two years ago, an effort was made by departmental personnel to stop turf cutting on the Bragan Mountains in north Monaghan, affecting over 200 farmers.  A resolution was found to the problem then but it will re-emerge again soon.  I would like to take up the Minister in his commitment to facilitate Members in examining the problem in this area, particularly considering the current economic climate, difficulties with farm incomes and the dependence on turf as a winter fuel.  I would like to work with the Minister to discover if we might arrive at a solution to this problem.

However, we have tried to resolve the disputes that have arisen.  There is a scheme in operation which involves the voluntary purchase of designated bogs and under which more than €7 million was paid out last year.  The interdepartmental group to which I referred earlier will examine the additional measures necessary to achieve a complete cessation of cutting on raised bogs that are designated as SHCs or NHAs.Quite a number of Deputies have taken an interest in this subject and I will keep them well informed with regard to anything that emerges from the deliberations of the interdepartmental group in the coming weeks and months.  The transition to a full cessation of cutting will take place in respect of 32 raised bogs this year.  However, there are some 139 raised bogs in total that have been designated and the transition in respect of the remainder will occur in 2012 and 2014.We also have the option of providing turf cutters with other plots.  This option may not suit everyone but it is open for consideration.  We will examine the various options that exist and it is hoped that a satisfactory resolution will be reached.

#DenisNaughten	unknown-#DenisNaughten-party	unknown-#DenisNaughten-dob	unknown-#DenisNaughten-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-03-11 00:00:00	Prelude	262	I acknowledge the offer the Minister made in respect of our meeting to discuss this matter.  Is he aware of the fact that a number of people in east Galway carried out a study in respect of almost half of the bogs covered by the Fernandez report?  This study shows that Fernandez overestimates the loss of bogs by at least 93%.  In light of the Minister's acknowledgement that approximately 3% of bogs are in non-State ownership, how is it possible that one third of bogs have disappeared over a ten-year period?  Carrowbehy bog in County Roscommon has grown by almost 13%.  Even though most of Cloonshanville bog, with which the Minister of State is familiar, is in State ownership, it is alleged that 5.25% of it has disappeared over the ten year period during which very little turf cutting took place.The figures which are being presented and on which the Minister is basing his decisions simply do not stand up to scrutiny.  Everyone accepts the need for preservation.  However, I again ask him to reconsider the position in respect of the small percentage of bogs that are not in State ownership.
#JohnGormley	unknown-#JohnGormley-party	unknown-#JohnGormley-dob	unknown-#JohnGormley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-03-11 00:00:00	Prelude	263	I would be happy to investigate the claims made by the Deputy.  However, the national parks and wildlife service, NPWS, is clear as to what is required.  The NPWS liaises, at all times, with the Commission, which is adamant that we have overstepped the mark to a major degree and that we have been given a great deal of latitude.  The cessation to which I referred earlier was unilaterally declared by Ireland, which, as such, was taking a liberty in making such a declaration.We are facing into a difficult situation.  Perhaps the Deputy might put his claims to the interdepartmental group in order that they might be examined and their validity or otherwise established.  Claims and counter-claims have been made and there is a need to establish the actual facts.  As already stated, the NPWS has made it clear that there has been a sharp deterioration in the quality of our raised bogs, which, as far as it is concerned, are disappearing at an alarming rate.

#JohnGormley	unknown-#JohnGormley-party	unknown-#JohnGormley-dob	unknown-#JohnGormley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-03-11 00:00:00	Prelude	265	Under section 247 of the Planning and Development Act 2000, a person who has an interest in land and who intends to make a planning application may, with the agreement of the planning authority concerned, enter into pre-application consultations in respect of the proposed development.  The section also provides that the planning authority must not unreasonably withhold its consent to a request for such consultations.In June 2007, my Department issued guidelines for planning authorities in respect of development management.  These guidelines are a step-by-step guide to all stages of the planning application process and they begin with pre-application consultations.  The guidelines were issued under section 28 of the Planning and Development Act 2000 and planning authorities are obliged to have regard to them in the performance of their planning functions.  A copy of the guidelines is available on my Department's website.The guidelines strongly promote the benefits of pre-application consultations, because they provide a planning applicant an opportunity to discuss the merits of a proposal for development at an early stage.  They state that every effort should be made to facilitate, as far as is practicable, reasonable requests for pre-application consultations and that planning authorities should aim to facilitate such requests as soon as possible, but in any event within two to three weeks.  Pre-application consultations also provide a planning authority with an opportunity to play a proactive role in guiding a project, from its inception, in accordance with proper planning and sustainable development principles.Overall, in the region of 25,000 pre-application consultations take place annually.  As the number of planning applications has fallen significantly — from 92,600 in 2006 to 64,000 in 2008 — planning authorities should be in a position to commit additional staff resources to facilitate requests for pre-planning consultations.
#JimOKeeffe	unknown-#JimOKeeffe-party	unknown-#JimOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#JimOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-03-11 00:00:00	Prelude	266	Question No. 45 in my name, which was answered with Question No. 38, relates to the backlog in the planning appeals system, whereas this question relates to the beginning of the planning process.  Does the Minister agree that the objective of planning is to deliver a high-quality built environment and to also encourage rather than impede development?  Does he agree that all the relevant processes should be designed to achieve this objective?Despite the changes to which he refers, does the Minister agree that considerable difficulties remain and that there is a lack of consistency among local authorities?  Does he further agree that even though there are problems with regard to the pre-planning process, county managers should be going out of their way to encourage pre-planning discussions in order that, in so far as is possible, any relevant issues could be dealt with prior to an application being lodged?I am also concerned about the validation process.  Why is there an enormous difference regarding the percentage of applications declared invalid in counties Dublin, Limerick, Waterford and Galway, in which the invalidation rate is 40%, and the percentage that obtains in counties, Sligo, Wexford and Louth, in which the rate is less than 8%?  Surely there is a need for the Minister to intervene in this regard.  Invalidation costs applicants money and delays the process.
#JohnGormley	unknown-#JohnGormley-party	unknown-#JohnGormley-dob	unknown-#JohnGormley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-03-11 00:00:00	Prelude	267	As indicated in reply to Questions Nos. 38 and 45, there is a lack of consistency among local authorities.  I presume the Deputy is referring to the local government service indicators relating to pre-application consultations, which indicate that there is a major difference from local authority to local authority.  In the context of the forthcoming legislation, I wish to ensure that some form of consistency will be obtained across all local authorities.  It is sometimes difficult to pinpoint from where these differences originate.  One could state that local authorities operate in different ways and that they possess a certain level of autonomy.  In my view, however,  it does not make sense when one can just cross a border and see the difference in planning immediately.  There is a value, of course, in pre-application consultations but one of the difficulties is that sometimes people are under the impression that once they go into pre-planning, the matter is sorted, done and dusted.  That does not necessarily follow.  One must still go through the planning process.
#CiaranLynch	unknown-#CiaranLynch-party	unknown-#CiaranLynch-dob	unknown-#CiaranLynch-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-03-11 00:00:00	Prelude	268	Unquestionably, planning departments in recent years were being crisis driven, such was the volume of applications.  It is a fact that the application processes have slowed significantly but there is a culture pertaining from that period affecting local people and residents in terms of access to planning departments.  As Deputy Jim O'Keeffe can confirm, at one time the public could not telephone the planning department of Cork County Council outside a couple of hours per week.  The department would take calls only during those times.  I am concerned that the culture that developed in this period, whether it was right or wrong, would continue in the future.As the Minister will have witnessed, both as a public representative and a member of a local authority, different approaches are taken by different local authorities at the operational end with regard to access, consultation and public recourse, despite the legislation.  An opportunity has been presented to us now.  The Minister should produce a code of practice or guidelines on consultation processes.  Certainly, one-stop-shops could be set up within council departments where staff could be redeployed to provide more customer-driven and customer-focused approaches such as pre-planning consultations and advising residents' groups.  Is this something of which the Minister has taken cognisance and does he envisage some type of standard being put in place regarding the operational end of the process, as opposed to the legislation?
#JohnGormley	unknown-#JohnGormley-party	unknown-#JohnGormley-dob	unknown-#JohnGormley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-03-11 00:00:00	Prelude	269	Yes, I am aware of this.  The guidelines were supposed to deal with many of these issues.  The guidelines are very clear and advise people of the requirements.  People are told if, for example, there is a need for an environmental impact assessment, a necessity to obtain an IPCC licence or waste licence in certain cases and about the need to comply with other planning guidelines where relevant, such as retail planning guidelines, the sustainable rural housing guidelines, guidelines on child care facilities and so forth.  All of this is explained to the applicants at the time.  The planner must include a summary of the key points discussed at pre-application consultation and the guidelines state that the matters discussed or agreed at pre-application consultation meetings are without prejudice and cannot bind the planning authority to act in a particular manner in the determination of any subsequent application.  However, where the recommendations in the report are likely to depart significantly from the matters discussed or agreed at the pre-application discussion stage, the matter should be highlighted on the application for the attention of the decision maker.  This will help to ensure applicants are treated consistently and reasonably throughout the course of their application and that where there is a change of direction on the part of the planning authority, it is clear to the applicant why this is the case.

It is important the Minister ensures greater time and effort is put into the pre-planning decisions taken by councils.  Last week, the Minister publicly acknowledged that loopholes existed whereby developers did not have to provide environmental impact statements for some developments.  What changes will the Minister make to the legislation to ensure this does not happen again?
#JohnGormley	unknown-#JohnGormley-party	unknown-#JohnGormley-dob	unknown-#JohnGormley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-03-11 00:00:00	Prelude	276	In reply to Deputy Crawford, I have already acknowledged that the constant changing of planners is causing difficulty for many applicants and is costing them a great deal of money.  I was speaking to people in Kinsale recently who had very unfortunate experiences.  They wasted a great deal of their time, energy and money because of this.  There was no consistency.  There were three different planners dealing with an application.  That is not fair and cannot be condoned.  It is absolutely necessary to achieve consistency and I will examine ways of ensuring we do that in the new legislation.Deputy Flanagan appears to be referring to the question of retention.  We need to tighten up the system in that regard.  Too often in the past people would go ahead and build — not something like a garden shed but a major building — and subsequently apply for retention.  It was worth their while because the amount of money they had to pay in fines was not sufficiently punitive.  We must ensure there is a disincentive for people to act in that way.  There is an onus on us, as a result of European legislation, to deal with this.

Would he consider issuing guidelines for planners to bring it home to them that the objective is good quality planning but that the ethos should be to encourage rather than impede development?

As I said to Deputy Crawford and others, that type of consistency is required across the board so people are left in no doubt.  Sometimes planning is quite a subjective issue.  We must move away from subjectivity so the applicants can understand where they stand and that if they do X, Y and Z, they have a chance of getting permission.
#JohnGormley	unknown-#JohnGormley-party	unknown-#JohnGormley-dob	unknown-#JohnGormley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-03-11 00:00:00	Prelude	279	The €300 million gateway innovation fund, GIF, was established, as part of the National Development Plan, NDP, 2007-2013, as a strategic targeted intervention to stimulate gateway development in the context of the national spatial strategy and thereby further the NDP cross-cutting objective for more balanced regional development.  Following a call for proposals for funding from the GIF which issued to gateway lead authorities, the main local authority in each gateway, in June 2007, a total of 39 project proposals were received from the nine gateways with a total projected cost of almost €1.2 billion and a total request for funding from the GIF of €718 million.  The projects submitted ranged across a broad spectrum of areas and included proposals for  transport and connectivity infrastructure, major city or town centre regeneration schemes, enhancement of public open spaces, recreational amenities and cultural facilities.In light of the deteriorating economic circumstances, a decision was taken last year not to approve projects or progress allocations from the GIF.  It is a matter for gateway local authorities to decide whether their proposals can be advanced through other sectoral or local programmes.  I propose to circulate with the Official Report a list of the projects for which funding was sought from the GIF.GatewayProject ProposalsCorkNew Eastern Gateway bridgeMidleton Northern Relief RoadWatermain extension to WhitegatePort of Cork new bulk terminalGalwayArdaun bus/cycle carriagewayConcert/Conference/Education VenueDublinAirport Box Development — roadsCanal Route DevelopmentLiffey Valley NecklaceCoastal WalkWaterfordPedestrian /cycle bridgeViking Quarter Public Realm PlanMount Congreve GardensWaterford Knowledge CampusLight RailWaterford Port dredgingLimerickCity Centre Orbital traffic routeCity centre pedestrianisation and urban realmLink roads around MoyrossPark and Ride (Sixmilebridge)CyclewaysConcert HallShannon Town Arts/Culture centreSt John’s Sq.

I did not table the question but I still have an interest in it because Cavan and Monaghan were designated as gateway towns.

I have tried to give the Deputy a comprehensive answer but, in essence, we do not have as much money as we would like.
#JohnGormley	unknown-#JohnGormley-party	unknown-#JohnGormley-dob	unknown-#JohnGormley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-03-11 00:00:00	Prelude	282	The Government is committed to preserving and protecting our water resources as a key element of environmental policy and to putting critical infrastructure in place to support industrial, commercial and other development.  The management of municipal waste water treatment plants is generally the responsibility of water services authorities.  In addition, my Department co-ordinates and finances a major programme of investment in improved waste water infrastructure as part of the water services investment programme.  The waste water schemes included in the programme are derived mainly from regular assessments of needs, undertaken by all local authorities at my Department's request, as an input to the overall strategy for meeting waste water services infrastructural requirements.  Among the criteria that local authorities are required to take into account in undertaking those assessments are compliance with relevant national and EU requirements and, in particular, the need to ensure compliance with the EU urban waste water treatment directive.Compliance with the general requirements of the directive in regard to secondary waste water treatment has increased significantly over the past decade, rising from a compliance level of 25% in 2000 to some 92% at present, with all remaining schemes needing to be undertaken included in the water services investment programme 2007 to 2009.  In its most recent three-year report on water quality, published in November 2008, the Environmental Protection Agency noted an overall slight improvement in water quality in the environment.  Improvements in waste water infrastructure as well as measures introduced to control diffuse sources of pollution from agriculture would have contributed to the improvement.  I am satisfied that the policies and resources are in place to ensure the highest emission standards from our municipal waste water treatment plants.

The scheme has been of great significance but, unfortunately, 50% of farmers have to wait for a much longer time for their grants.  What percentage of the grant does the Department pay towards local authority schemes?  I refer in particular to the scheme in Carrickmacross, of which the Minister is aware, and the implications for industry if the percentage is not improved significantly.  Given the difficult climate that we are in currently, it is very hard to retain employment.  It is important that the situation would be recognised.

I cannot give the exact amount for it but I am happy to look that up.  I have a list of the various schemes and I am looking to see if Carrickmacross is listed.  I am afraid I cannot see it on the list.  That is not to say it is not going ahead, it is just not listed on the documentation supplied to me.  I will get that information for the Deputy to find out exactly how much we are paying towards that and I will get him a timetable also as to when it will happen.Written Answers follow Adjournment Debate.

Broughan — the urgent need for the Minister for Education and Science to ensure that the special education services mixed class at St. Helen's senior national school, Portmarnock, is fully maintained given the outstanding special education services provided at the school and if he will also ensure there are no cutbacks to the 119 special education classes across Ireland; and if he will make a statement on the matter; (8) Deputy Mattie McGrath — issues in regard to South Tipperary General Hospital; (9) Deputy Niall Blaney — the need to review Garda numbers in Border areas; (10) Deputy Richard Bruton — the need to indicate to Mount Temple School, Dublin 3, the steps that need to be taken prior to the commencement of construction; (11) Deputy Charlie O'Connor — to ask the Minister to confirm actions open to him to deal with the difficulties with the building programme at Ard Mhuire national school, Belgard, Tallaght; (12) Deputy Lucinda Creighton — the urgent need for the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government to delay the Poolbeg planning scheme section 25 process, given recent revelations in the financial sector, to allow time for the commercial, financial and legal relationships between the Dublin Docklands Development Authority, Becbay Limited, Anglo Irish Bank and certain developers to be clarified; (13) Deputy Mary O'Rourke — the need to have the case of a person (details supplied) in County Westmeath reviewed.The matters raised by Deputies James Bannon, Mary O'Rourke, Niall Blaney and Richard Bruton have been selected for discussion.
#DeirdreClune	unknown-#DeirdreClune-party	unknown-#DeirdreClune-dob	unknown-#DeirdreClune-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-03-11 00:00:00	Prelude	286	Prior to the adjournment of the debate I welcomed the fact that the Minister is now attempting to put some structure on spending limits in elections, starting with the local elections this June.  We already have limits for the European elections.  The submission from the Standards in Public Office Commission contained a recommendation that the limits would come into play between 90 to 120 days before an election, which is where we are now, but the Minister has opted for 30 days.  It will be from April now, which is almost a two-month period.  I am sure that will be welcomed by many people.  Having been involved in elections myself, I am aware that there can be a frenzy in election spending, so limits are welcome.Since 1998 we have had controls on spending in Dáil elections, by-elections and subsequently in European elections.  From my experience of working with candidates and being a candidate myself, the limits have worked extremely well.  People have been very conscious of the limitations on them and of the need to have to make returns afterwards.  My party and other political parties are very conscious of abiding by the rules and regulations laid down in that area.  The timeframe has been short for general elections and because of that much expenditure has been front-loaded.  Nevertheless, the fact that a spending limit is in place has contributed to ensuring everybody is on a level playing field.In the table the Minister has produced on spending, approximately 10% can be contributed to the political party or that amount can be changed by a request in writing.  Perhaps the Minister will elaborate, on Committee and Report Stages, on how he envisages that happening.  Will the local authorities give permission or who will be the overseeing body?  For example, if political parties are to provide posters for candidates that would account for a considerable percentage of their costs.  It would probably be greater than the 10% which the Minister has outlined.  I am sure there is flexibility in that regard.  We can tease out the matter tomorrow when we discuss the Bill in greater detail.Another area dealt with by the Bill is the time period within which posters can be displayed.  Currently, the litter Act makes no reference to a restriction on the time posters can be displayed prior to elections, although we are all conscious of the stipulation regarding seven days after the election.  I support the Minister's proposal to restrict the display of posters to 30 days.  That is a worthwhile change because over-postering can alienate the electorate and cause annoyance in many quarters.  Posters lose their impact if they are up for too long a period.  We will see how the 30-day period will work in this election.  It is always good to have restrictions, rules and regulations within which people can work, as that contributes to and facilitates a level playing pitch.  Many town councils asked candidates in previous elections not to put up posters and I am sure this will happen again.  When all candidates are willing to do that, it works very well.  I am aware of one or two borough councils in my area that did this and candidates adhered to the agreement.I do not object to posters because they create some razzmatazz at election time.  They create an interest and are valuable for new candidates in getting their faces and names before the electorate.  Posters are part of our election system, but it is a good idea to corral postering into a 30-day period rather than allowing them go up two months prior to an election.  I welcome that proposal.  Perhaps we could also take a look at what other countries do.  Some continental countries, for example, have a central postering unit.

We are all well used to the idea of ethics and transparency in public office.  This Bill proposes that candidates throughout the country declare annually, regardless of whether an election is taking place, their interests in their local area and what property they own within the State.  This is an approach that has been successful in elections and most people comply with the regulations in an honest and straightforward way.  This has not been abused in recent years.It is important to have such regulations, particularly considering that when development plans are being prepared, local authority members sitting on the council may have an interest in lands in their area.  It is healthy for politics and democracy that individual representatives or would-be candidates have the option to declare their interests for the public record.  I am aware declarations of interest are not available on websites, but the fact they are available on a register for members of the public to consult is positive and has been good for democracy.  I endorse this.Today, the Fine Gael Party announced its views on how elections should be conducted and, perhaps, we will have an opportunity to discuss that tomorrow.  We suggest we should have an electoral commission with all elements of elections under the one umbrella, the register, transparency, spending and the rules and regulations established by the House and others.
#CiaranLynch	unknown-#CiaranLynch-party	unknown-#CiaranLynch-dob	unknown-#CiaranLynch-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-03-11 00:00:00	Prelude	293	The capping and control of electoral expenditure is an issue on which the Labour Party has long and consistently campaigned in the House.  I welcome the Bill, although it is coming at a late hour before the local and European elections.In the wider context of electoral reform, this Bill is not the end product.  A significant amount of further legislation must come before the House in order that elections are better regulated.  One of the obvious areas needing reform is the electoral register, which is totally skewed.  We had, for example, the situation in a constituency in County Cork where more people were on the register of electors than were registered by the census.  There is only one way to resolve such situations and that is by moving to a PPS system, as recommended by the Select Committee on the Environment, Heritage and Local Government to the Minister.  This is just one of countless issues that need consideration.The issue of expenditure on elections is one that demanded examination.  There is clear evidence, despite what others may have said, that it does not really matter how much money one spends.  As Deputy Higgins said, somebody spending €15,000 trying to get elected to a town council or in a local authority area must be extremely unpopular.  However, there is a connection between getting elected and how much money one spends.The report of the Standards in Public Office Commission of 2003 stated that it is recognised internationally that having election spending limits in place is an important factor in fighting corruption and safeguarding the integrity of the electoral process.  Six years ago that report recommended we should have this legislation.  The report also stated that spending is positively and significantly related to electoral success and that there is a direct correlation between money spent and election outcome.  This has been the determining factor for the decades since the foundation of the State.

#CiaranLynch	unknown-#CiaranLynch-party	unknown-#CiaranLynch-dob	unknown-#CiaranLynch-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-03-11 00:00:00	Prelude	295	The research commissioned by the select committee, which was passed on to the Minister, gave an interesting opinion on the system we have employed to date.  It stated that our current system of electoral spending was like inviting two people to participate in a race, with one participant turning up on a bicycle and the other in a sports car.  I hope this legislation will change this and move us toward a level playing field where democracy is achieved as a result of merit rather than on income.  Through this Bill, we hope to achieve a situation where self-regulation — the process we have had until now, but which has not worked — is abandoned and we move to the option of legislating for how much money can be spent on elections.Up to now, we have had a system in place where general elections were conducted within spending limits.  The legislation in that regard has been with us for some time.  There is, therefore, no excuse for the delay in bringing this legislation before the House.  All we are doing this afternoon is putting in place spending limits for local elections.  As we have already got reporting mechanisms in place, since 1999 local election candidates have been required to maintain accounts and records on spending and to furnish those accounts to the local authority after elections.There is, therefore, no justifiable excuse for not having limits, despite what the current and the previous Minister have said about complexities and difficulties.  There have been no difficulties or complexities found with regard to recording spending.  What we need, therefore, is a cap and a system for measuring spending.The Electoral Act 1997, introduced by the Labour Party Minister for the Environment at the time, Deputy Brendan Howlin, empowered the Minister to make regulations providing for the limitation of election expenses which might be incurred by or on behalf of candidates and political parties at local elections.  This power was subsequently scrapped by the then Minister, Deputy Noel Dempsey, in 1999.  His justification for scrapping that was questionable.  He said that due to the smaller size of constituencies and the local nature of elections, extensive expenditure would not be necessary and expenditure by each candidate would be lower than that in a Dáil election.  This was his rationale for not introducing limits.We have an example from 2004 of a current Member of the Seanad who spent in excess of €40,000 in a local election, a higher sum than the cap for a general election.  This is the type of madness that was evident in this period.  The appropriate structure was in place until 1997 when the then Minister for the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Noel Dempsey, skewed the legislation by introducing a new Bill.  This afternoon we are recognising the flaws and shortcomings of the decision made deliberately, or otherwise, in 1999.  We are playing catch-up ten years later.I welcome the publication of the Electoral (Amendment) Bill 2009, which, at last, gives effect to spending limits.  The delay in producing the legislation means we are now rushing it through the House.  A key aspect of the operation of democracy in Ireland will now be subject to only six hours of discussion.  The Bill will be debated in the Chamber until 7 p.m. and, tomorrow morning, for a very short while, amendments tabled by the Government and Opposition will be dealt with in a less than satisfactory manner.  Is this how the Government values democracy?  Fewer than a dozen hours will be spent debating the Bill.  Given the lack of sufficient time for debate, anomalies will arise.  After the local elections, we will be back in this House talking about these anomalies.I stated electoral spending is significantly related to electoral success and that the introduction of spending limits will be an important factor in fighting corruption and safeguarding the electoral process.  Any measure to level the playing pitch is to be welcomed but the structure the Minister has put in place to restrict spending is, at best, of limited impact.The 60 day lead-in time applying to the limits is far too short.  General elections occur when a Government collapses or when a Taoiseach, at the end of a Government's term in office, calls an election.  Local elections occur every five years and we know the date of the next based on date of the last.  The idea that a 60 day period will apply is a nonsense and a very significant shortcoming in the Bill.  The delay in introducing the legislation is such that some sort of window is required, but I hope this provision will be amended afterwards to facilitate the operation of future elections.  There are no restrictions in place for the period before the 60 day period and this needs to be rectified.Research done for the Minister by the research department in the Houses of the Oireachtas examines the 60 day period.  It states that, in practice, it is quite clear that some candidates — quite legally until now — spent large amounts of money in the 12 month to 24 month period before an election which dwarfed the amount that they could and did spend during the formal election period.  It states electoral expenditure outside this period is not subject to the limits imposed by the legislation, thus benefiting larger parties, which typically have greater financial resources, and wealthier candidates who can afford to spend extra moneys before an election is called or the election period commences.  Unfortunately, an obvious flaw pointed out to the Minister continues to feature.Let me make a common sense comment on posters.  If posters are still up one week after an election, candidates will be fined.  Will the Minister direct local authorities to start the clock only after making contact with a candidate if he or she does not get around to taking down a poster or two?  In reality, political parties are voluntary organisations and volunteers tend to put up posters.  After an election, the volunteers taking down posters may not be the ones who put them up in the first instance.  Thus, a poster may be missed, particularly in rural areas where there may be crossroads a little off the beaten track.

#CiaranLynch	unknown-#CiaranLynch-party	unknown-#CiaranLynch-dob	unknown-#CiaranLynch-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-03-11 00:00:00	Prelude	299	Awful things can happen.  I advocate a common sense approach whereby a candidate would be given some indication that a poster is still up.  If a candidate receives a telephone call about a poster, it will be taken down that evening.  Nobody leaves posters up after an election deliberately.Deputy Michael Higgins is correct that the Minister should refrain completely from placing posters in the same category as litter.  Not only should he do so by changing his language but also by changing the framework in which he considers posters.  Posters are not litter but a necessary aspect of the democratic process.  They inform people as to who candidates are and, particularly with regard to local elections, they play a very positive role in differentiating one electoral area from another.  One can claim to know the candidates in one's local electoral area because one can see their pictures outside one's door on posters, thus allowing one to discriminate between electoral areas.Before becoming a Member of the Dáil, I worked as an adult literacy organiser.  We ran a campaign to have candidates' photographs printed on ballot sheets.  This campaign succeeded and it has enhanced the democratic process.  Postering works along the same lines in that it is an easy means of communication that allows one to recognise the face of a candidate on the ballot sheet at the polling station.  This facilitates people, especially those with reading and writing difficulties, to exercise their democratic right to vote at a polling station.  Any restrictions on posters must be considered in light of the democratic deficit their abolition would create and not in light of their being constituted as litter and pollution.  If people have a difficulty with posters during an election, it must be balanced against the role of posters in facilitating democracy.  Common sense needs to be applied to the taking down of posters and postering must be regarded as a fundamental aspect of the democratic and electoral processes.During Committee Stage, the Labour Party will table a number of amendments.  I will mention an amendment the Minister will table on correlating population with the CSO and census reports.  This is an obvious shortcoming in the Bill and I am glad the Minister proposes to correct it because the Labour Party intended to table an amendment on it.When the Minister gives his conclusions at the close of the debate this evening, I will ask him to clarify a number of matters including how use of the Internet is measured in electoral costings.  Most candidates and every political party has a website where details of candidates, press releases, biographies and other matters are stored and may have been archived over the past ten years.  We need to tread very gingerly on this because the total cost of maintaining a website can be quite significant and if it was proportioned, it may cover the entire expenditure a candidate is allowed.  This needs to be clarified and examined by the Minister because it is an area where electioneering may or may not be carried out but where the candidate is providing information that may or may not be costed.  I would be interested to hear what the Minister has to say on this matter.Candidates, particularly in local elections, may advertise in free sheets and provincial newspapers which are published on a weekly basis.  Often, the publication date of a weekly newspaper may be Friday but it arrives on the shelves in the local town on Tuesday or Wednesday.  This advertising must be costed in a single fashion.  Will it be based on the publication date as stated on the newspaper on sale in the final week prior to the election if this means the candidate is advertising that week but because the publication date is the Friday that cost is not actually measured?  Is the schedule worked out over the 60 day period and one hopes that things even themselves out as best they can?Advertising, particularly during the final week prior to an election is quite a significant portion of any candidate's expenditure and if a Friday or Saturday is the publication day of a weekly newspaper, one ends up with an obvious shortcoming in terms of the account afterwards.  It is best that candidates have this information now so they do not find themselves in default of the legislation not because of any practice on their own behalf, but because of an absence of a clear direction within the legislation itself.Is the use of Oireachtas envelopes during the 60 day period costed?  There seems to be something very odd in the explanatory memorandum to the Bill because it does not seem to cover this area.  Remarkably, Part IIIA is not mentioned in the explanatory memorandum.  The effect of Part IIIA seems to be that providing Oireachtas envelopes to a local candidate will incur expenditure as part of the spending quota.  I would like to hear further feedback on this from the Minister.When there are party political broadcasts and leaders of political parties are speaking, it is either a good opportunity to sit down and digest one's dinner by watching or a good excuse to go for a few pints after nine o'clock having listened to the debate.  On Saturday night two weeks ago, the Taoiseach made a very interesting comment on his views on electoral spending.  The Labour Party will table an amendment which captures the sentiments he expressed that evening.  This amendment states:In page 4, between lines 6 and 7, to insert the following:"and(c) by the insertion of the following subsection after subsection (11):"(12) Where a political party incurs expenses and payments under this section as amended by the Electoral (Amendment) (No. 2) Act 2009 on a local election to which that Act applies and in particular to which Part IIIA of this Act as inserted by that Act applies, then for the year in which such local election is held and in each year until the following such election, that political party may not accept any donation exceeding €4,000 per year from any one donor and shall declare any donation exceeding €2,500 per year from any one donor.”.”.This amendment will give effect to the announcement made by the Taoiseach, Deputy Brian Cowen, to the Fianna Fáil Ard-Fheis on reducing the amounts and disclosure of limits to political parties.  He stated:I want to go even further.  As part of the ongoing reform programme which the Government is undertaking in this area, we will be proposing a major reduction in both the levels at which donations to national political parties must be disclosed and to the maximum allowable donations.  Specifically, we will propose the halving of the declaration limit from just over €5,000 per year to €2,500.  For the maximum allowable donation the figure would fall from roughly €6,500 per year to €4,000 per year.I understand the Taoiseach is busy these days and did not get around to submitting the amendment himself so the Labour Party has obliged him by tabling it.  I hope the Taoiseach supports his own sentiments when we vote on this tomorrow.  To keep the amendment in order, we limited it to parties which contest the local elections, but this covers the substance of the Taoiseach's commitment.  If the Minister wants to broaden it to cover all parties, then an instruction to the Oireachtas committee can be made but the Opposition has no control over this.  I look forward to hearing the Minister's response on this issue tomorrow, and to seeing the Taoiseach vote in support of the sentiments.I will turn to a matter which is at the heart of the issue.  At present, homeless people do not have the right to exercise their franchise.  This is a remnant of a different period in Ireland when only property owners had the right to vote.  Tomorrow, the Labour Party will table an amendment to correct this obvious anomaly.  At present, the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill is going through the Oireachtas.  When it was first published, the Government failed to included any mention of the homelessness issue.  This is significant legislation and a chronic problem was not mentioned.  Subsequently, the Government corrected this and mention is now made of the homeless issue.This is an opportunity for the Government to make amends for its earlier error.  There is no good reason for this not to be in place.  Homeless people can be registered with their local authority through the Simon Community.  In Dublin, this could be done through the single authority which deals with homelessness.  I can state for a fact that if homeless people were registered, the omission in the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill would not have happened because the Government would have realised that homeless people had a vote and that they mattered, and they would have been counted.  Not only are they without a home and a roof over their heads but they are without the basic right of any citizen of this country, namely, the right to vote.  I call on the Government to use common sense on this issue tomorrow and to support the amendment.  It improves democracy and participation in it.It is an established fact that expenditure is directly tied to outcome in elections.  The expenditure limits are welcome.  The Labour Party has campaigned for many years for this legislation and we welcome the fact that it is before the House.  It is unfortunate that the delay has created this 60-day period.  It should have been scheduled over a longer time.  In a Private Members' Bill I brought before the House, we suggested that it be scheduled over nine months.  Most of the research in this area suggests that it should be over a nine to 12 month period.The legislation is new and is being enacted before the local elections.  However, with the best will in the world, anomalies and shortcomings will be found in the Bill, so I ask the Minister to have the process examined.  When the Dáil resumes in the autumn, we can correct the flaws that are found so that we are not in a crisis in five years where we have to examine more legislation to deal with local elections just before they take place.

It is very important to have strict spending limits for all elections.  In the last election, I was vastly outspent by the Labour Party.  I had no billboard or glossy advertisements on the side of the newspaper bins outside shops across the constituency, unlike the Labour Party.  The idea that Fianna Fáil spends all the money, or that money gets one elected, is not always correct.I have a concern that the spending limits are far too high.  I appreciate that the Minister entered into consultation with the environment committee, but I do not know what went on as I am not a member of that committee.  A limit of €7,500 for a town or borough council election is far too high.  The largest borough council is in Drogheda, which is where I am from, even though I do not represent most of it.  Around 500 votes would get a candidate elected to Drogheda Borough Council and I cannot think of anyone who would want to spend €7,500 on an election for a seat on that council.

#ThomasByrne	unknown-#ThomasByrne-party	unknown-#ThomasByrne-dob	unknown-#ThomasByrne-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-03-11 00:00:00	Prelude	302	Spending money on food and drink for election workers was never part of the spending limits.  I have not read the provisions of this law, but one would not need that much money to get elected to a town or borough council.  Only a handful of votes are needed to get elected to town councils like Belturbet.  I would have thought that a limit of €2,000 would be in order, but I will go with the Minister as he has looked at this in detail and I have not done so.  He has examined the issue with the environment committee so I will have to accept his judgment, but I think €7,500 for a town or borough council is three times what any sensible person would spend.  I will obviously accept the Minister's advice and the Government's decision on this, but maybe he will listen to what I am saying.It is good that the limits for county council elections apply to 60 days before the election.  A legitimate front-loading of expenditure existed before spending limits came in, and I would have done that myself.  When the election period has started, it is quite strict.  If one looks at the spending returns, one notices that a lot of money within the general election limits was not spent.  The money I spent in that three week period was below the limit for a three-seater constituency.  I assume the Minister will have looked at those, and I think one would have to be doing very well to be able to spend these figures in a local election.The cost of posters is high.  Most of us get them from this country, although not every political party does so.  If there is a provision in law that requires the printer of the poster to be named on it, this should be vigorously enforced.  If it is not in law, then I ask the Minister to include it.

The 60 days give people an opportunity to interact with the electorate, and many people make up their minds in that period.  Before that period, many people have no interest in local, European or national elections.  I cannot see any of these limits causing problems.  We certainly know of one Senator who spent a fortune on a local election and in an unsuccessful general election.  He was very critical of donations in other respects and is causing much trouble for his own party at the moment.  It is madness to spend that kind of money on an election.  It may work if it is spent effectively, but if people see big billboards or big fancy advertisements in newspapers, they will wonder how the candidate can afford it or who is paying for it.Sometimes it can be a disadvantage to have the most glossy posters and advertisements.  I would advise many of my candidates that an ordinary word processor is enough to get the message across in a local election.  The electorate will not be happy if large amounts of money are spent on glossy brochures, most of which they do not read anyway.  They are more likely to read a more personal document, which inevitably costs less but usually requires more effort from the candidate.  That is appreciated by the public.Since 1999, election candidates were always required to declare their election expenditure, a requirement that was brought in by my colleague from County Meath, the Minister, Deputy Noel Dempsey.  I prepared some of those forms for my father in a few elections.  When we saw the returns of other candidates, we were quite surprised as we felt we were vastly outspent.  When we listened to what people were saying they had spent and looked at what they spent, we were quite surprised that we were close to top of the list.  Spot checks were made by SIPO, which took a strong interest in it.  I am not sure if SIPO is involved in this aspect, as candidates must send their returns to the local authorities, but there should be checks to ensure that everybody is complying with the rules.I predict that the vast majority of candidates would spend far less than the permitted limit, because they simply do not have the money now.  Fundraising by politicians is more difficult at all levels.  It will get more difficult following the proposals made by the Taoiseach, but he has challenged us to try to raise more through small donations.  The current US President has succeeded in doing this effectively, although I am sure he got many large donations as well.  In the US, corporations are banned from donating to politicians and political parties.  I agree with that, because I do not see the value in allowing limited companies or plcs to participate in the democratic process.  There is a role for the people involved in those companies, as business people should be involved in politics, but they should be donating the money themselves, or their employees should do so voluntarily.  I do not see the point in allowing a company to take part in the democratic process.  It is banned in the US federal system and it might be something worth examining here.I do not have any urban councils in my constituency, but I am familiar with Drogheda Borough Council, in which about 400 voters used to vote in the Meath East constituency, something that is no longer the case thanks to the Constituency Commission.  I am also very familiar with Navan Town Council.  Although I do not wish to discuss individuals, my father is standing for election in one local electoral area and a different borough council area.  The one quarter limit will hit him hard, but I am unsure if he would spend it in any case.  However, even if he were to be able to spend it, there is only a very small crossover between the area of Drogheda east in the county council and Drogheda south in the borough council.  Less than 10% of voters in the borough district and probably a good deal less again in the county council district is at issue, proving there will be anomalies.However, it is reasonable that a reduction in the limit is proposed for candidates standing in both districts as usually there is a large cross-over.  Any candidate standing in the Navan Town Council and the Navan County Council elections is located within the Naval local electoral area.  All of the Kells Town Council area is within the Kells electoral area.  There are some anomalies throughout the country and I do not know what it is possible to do in that regard.  However, if someone wishes to spend a good deal of money running in such a constituency where there is only a small crossover the proposed legislation may be unjust.Candidates such as my father and others would be entitled to spend one quarter of the €7,500 limit in the borough council election, a substantial amount of money totalling just less than €2,000.  I do not know of any candidate in the elections who will spend more than that amount.  It would be madness to do so.  It is possible to have leaflets printed up very effectively and cheaply.  Many people do not put up posters for local elections and believe they are at a disadvantage.  Is there an argument for banning posters from local elections?  There may be but that would be undemocratic.While I have been mildly critical of the high level of the spending limits, it is clear the Minister has researched the matter thoroughly with the Joint Committee on the Environment, Heritage and Local Government and there is a rationale for those limits.  I am pleased about that and I am pleased he has engaged in consultation with the committee and with Members of the House.  In the short time available it may not be possible to examine the matter in detail at this stage.  If people spend such amounts during an election, the matter should be examined later.There is an argument that sitting councillors have a significant advantage over newcomers, but that depends to which party such people are connected, especially this year.  If limits are too low there is a disadvantage to newcomers.  I cannot foresee anyone standing for a borough council or town council election spending €7,500, although perhaps I will eat my words after the election.  The Minister would have examined the figures in this regard.I refer to posters and I speak as someone who was fined, wrongly I suggest, by Meath County Council.  I accepted my punishment for having posters up too early.  As the Minister makes clear, there is no legislation covering when posters may go up or when a candidate may start to put them up.  The €100 fine I received could have been challenged in court, but I was not going to waste the court's time on that issue.  It has more important things to do.  The Minister has made it clear that the legislation is silent on this aspect.It is probably correct to have a start date.  However, if people are active early with a limited number of appropriate, effective posters it does impress the electorate and suggests that such candidates are on the ball and willing to fight hard for the seat.  Perhaps we are creating an even playing field for candidates who are not as effective.  However, I suppose it causes some annoyance.I was glad when my posters became an issue of controversy during the election, because there was a complaint from a party on the opposite side of the House.  It gave me a good deal of national coverage at the time on the radio and in newspapers.  There was a photograph of my posters in the Irish Independent and it is not possible to buy such publicity, which was not counted as part of the election spend, and I was very pleased about that.  It would have cost me a good deal of money to put an advertisement in the Irish Independent and I thank the parties opposite for that.  It has been made clear by the Minister that hitherto, people putting up posters were not in breach of any legislation.  The legislation was silent on the matter and the Minister is changing that now.Some people put up posters advertising public meetings.  However, those rules are broken from time to time because the rules on such posters provide that they must definitively advertise a particular meeting.  Sometimes people put up their normal election posters and place the smaller poster for the public meeting on top of the original poster.  I wonder if that is acceptable.  Perhaps the Minister should examine this matter.I am pleased the Minister is clearing up the Litter Pollution Act because upon examination I realised the original legislation is poorly drafted.  It is very unclear regarding what is permitted.  The only clear matter arising from that legislation concerning posters was the seven day rule following an election.  All of us aim to comply with that, because the last thing people wish to see is posters remaining up.  However, most Members will have experienced the problem of people stealing posters during the election and putting them back up after the seven day period is past.

It is very difficult for us to do anything in that regard.  Rather than the council coming down hard on candidates, it may be possible to have some provision in practice to allow candidates a number of hours to remove posters if they are spotted instead of simply issuing fines immediately.  This would give a chance to people to take down posters.  Deputy Niall Collins made that suggestion.  He was a victim of such a situation and he is in the House now.

I also look forward to the legislation on donations and the proposed reduction in limits promised by the Taoiseach at the Ard-Fheis, which was welcomed by all sides.
#JohnDeasyFG	unknown-#JohnDeasyFG-party	unknown-#JohnDeasyFG-dob	unknown-#JohnDeasyFG-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-03-11 00:00:00	Prelude	313	I wish to share time with Deputies Hayes and Crawford.  I do not have an issue with the legislation or the spending thresholds it proposes to set.  However, I am unsure if it goes to the heart of the issue with regard to money and politics.  In addition to the type of political influence which affects local authorities and the decisions made by local authority members and officials, there is much discussion these days concerning golden circles.  Such relationships have, to some degree, allowed politicians to make decisions that have not been in the public interest and have led to spending money unwisely or even recklessly.  It is clear now that many of these decisions have been made because of naked political affiliation, the desire to maintain and preserve political power and far worse.  I am unsure if the public understands the number of golden circles in the country.  I have come to learn that the country is one big golden circle.Transparency International launched a report on Ireland's national integrity systems some weeks ago, a copy of which I have before me.  It did not receive much media attention apart from the usual response such as some articles in The Irish Times newspaper.  A section relating to local authorities in the report caught my eye.  It reported that the risk of fraud and corruption was especially acute within local government.  That risk is heightened by the lack of adequate safeguards against planning corruption, false accounting, misuse of resources, influence selling and fraud.A survey by the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government in 2006 revealed that few local authorities had adequate resources or systems in place for audit.  This should be of grave concern, given the economic incentives for corruption created by Ireland's planning system.  The report states that the regulation of urban planning continues to provide an artificial scarcity value on development land.  For example, the value of agricultural land increases exponentially when rezoned by local government for residential and commercial purposes.  According to the report, this system created an added incentive for corrupt transactions between developers and local officials and representatives.  However, a combination of factors rendered and continues to render local government highly vulnerable to corruption and fraud.  I agree with that analysis and I know it to be true.  Today, we learn the Joint Committee on the Environment, Heritage and Local Government will issue a report on rezoning and development plans.  While the committee's work in this area is helpful, I am not sure it goes to the core of the issue, namely, the nature of certain relationships.  The chairman of An Bord Pleanála has referred to zoning decisions which did not accord with sustainable development and which seemed to originate from pressure by local developers.The Minister indicated he plans to publish legislation this year which will put an end to opportunistic rezoning of land by county councillors.  I await the outcome of his plans because I wonder whether the House will take steps to address the issue raised by Transparency International and the culture which has, in some cases, badly tainted local government and government in general.  We need to start with zoning procedures in local authorities by mandating that all communications to officials and public representatives by individuals who have a beneficial or business interest be reported, disclosed and made public under law.

I would place such an onus on both parties, that is, the officials and councillors on the one hand and the landowner, lobbyist or developer on the other.  If developers thought for one moment that contacts with councillors or officials would be noted on the public record, they would think twice about making any such contacts.If we are to reform governmental procedures and establish a system that rejects the culture of the golden circle and the wink and nod, we must reform and transform the mentality and manner with which business is transacted with government.  The place to start is with the entity that is most vulnerable to political influence and patronage, namely, local government.I believe the majority of officials and councillors would support a disclosure measure in the area of rezoning.  While it would impose an additional layer of responsibility on members of local authorities, it would also reduce some of the pressure applied to them by vested interests.  The Minister is not present but it is clear his party is in a pivotal and powerful position in the Government, which is unusual.  The Fianna Fáil Party will do virtually anything to keep the Green Party on board for the next couple of years.  If the Green Party were to introduce legislation tomorrow to ban young maidens from dancing at crossroads, the Fianna Fáil Party would support it.  For this reason and because the Green Party has set itself up as the party of reform in government, it will be judged by how it reforms the decision making process throughout government as well as levels of transparency.As Members are aware, reform is not sufficient.  The Minister and his party need to address the inherent culture rather than tinkering with a system which remains chronically vulnerable to patronage and excessive political influence.  For this reason, it will be necessary to provide for a disclosed record of contacts between local authority members and officials, on the one hand, and those who would benefit from any rezoning measure, on the other.
#TomHayes	unknown-#TomHayes-party	unknown-#TomHayes-dob	unknown-#TomHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-03-11 00:00:00	Prelude	316	I welcome the opportunity to discuss this legislation before the forthcoming local elections.  Local democracy is important in ensuring people believe they have an input into democratic decisions at local level.  Although I do not propose to dwell on the issue, as I am required to confine my contribution to discussing the Electoral (Amendment) Bill 2009, I place on record my belief that we have underestimated the potential of local government.Two or three aspects of the legislation are of vital importance.  The register of electors is a key in every election.  For many years, however, the management of the register has been disgraceful.  Having fought many elections, I can categorically state that the first telephone call politicians receive on the day of an election is from someone who has turned up at a polling booth to find his or her name has not been included on the electoral register.  Registering the names of all those in a community who are entitled to vote is a simple job.  It is disgraceful that we have failed to reform the procedure for adding names to the electoral register.  The use of PPS numbers would be a simple solution, one that would ensure everyone's name is added to the register.  This proposal has been discussed on many occasions in the House.The Bill proposes to impose crazy spending limits on candidates in local elections.  I did a quick calculation which showed that between them the 50 and 60 candidates who stand for election to South Tipperary County Council could spend almost €1 million under the proposed limits.  The person who proposed the sums provided for in the Bill needs to have his or her head examined.
#KathleenLynch	unknown-#KathleenLynch-party	unknown-#KathleenLynch-dob	unknown-#KathleenLynch-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-03-11 00:00:00	Prelude	317	It is the Government's plan for revitalising the economy.
#TomHayes	unknown-#TomHayes-party	unknown-#TomHayes-dob	unknown-#TomHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-03-11 00:00:00	Prelude	318	The figures in the Bill are crazy.  The maximum amount being spent by my party for elections to town and county councils is €25,000, a much lower figure than the figures provided for in the Bill.  The expenditure provisions are off the wall.  At a time when we are sending out messages that people must be prudent, allowing election candidates to spend these sums is madness.  Before we proceed further, we must review the spending limits on election candidates.  While I support the introduction of expenditure limits, the sums proposed are unacceptable.Under the Bill, it is also proposed to limit the number of posters candidates may use and the period during which posters can be erected.  Election posters were erected months before the most recent general election.  For this reason, I welcome as positive measures to limit the period when posters may be used.The current provision under which posters must be removed within seven days of an election is too restrictive.  For the first two days after an election, candidates are either tied up at election counts or experiencing the joy or disappointment associated with election results.  Requiring candidates to remove posters within just a few days of an election is too prescriptive.  In my case, we genuinely forgot about a small number of posters which had been erected in a quiet area during the most recent general election campaign.  Local authorities should not rigidly enforce the law.  That needs to be considered in the legislation.I would like to see real reform of local authorities.  The one thing I cannot understand is that even though county management teams meet on a weekly basis the chairman of the local authority is not involved in decision making.  Until we change that, people will not have a real say in local authorities.
#SeymourCrawford	unknown-#SeymourCrawford-party	unknown-#SeymourCrawford-dob	unknown-#SeymourCrawford-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-03-11 00:00:00	Prelude	319	I welcome the opportunity to say a few words on the Bill.  It is clearly an effort to limit the amount of money any individual can spend on local elections, and in that context I welcome it.  It is important that a candidate is elected for his or her individual ability rather than simply because he or she can spend massively on the election campaign.  Local government is extremely important and we must protect it.  I will back my colleague in saying there is a need for more involvement by elected representatives, and reform must take place to ensure this occurs.  County managers and others simply have too much power at present.  I still find it difficult to understand why the limits do not extend further than 50 or 60 days before the election takes place, because in the past significant sums of money have been spent by individuals promoting themselves outside these time limits.  The amount of €15,000 is a significant sum of money for anyone to raise, as is the figure of €7,500 which applies to those on town councils.  Those figures must be reconsidered as they equate to overspending and are totally unjustified.It is one thing to impose spending limits, but it is equally important to make sure the controls are properly administered.  In the past, county councillors and others only had to provide a simple report on their spending and how they raised the funds.  Some of the returns were nothing short of a joke, showing that no money at all had been spent, while those concerned were clearly involved in personal advertising with posters and so on.Another issue with the Bill is how it ties in with litter legislation.  Only last night at a party meeting we had a long and interesting debate on whether parties and individuals within them should use posters.  Some people felt strongly that posters should not be used at all, while others felt they should be limited to a few days before the election itself, and only adjacent to polling booths.  I do not know whether it would be possible to get an all-party approach on such a proposal but, on a personal basis, I feel this is something we should aim for.  The point was made that as far as tidy town committees are concerned, the posters themselves are not the sole problem.  Often, when the posters are taken down a day or two after the elections the plastic ties are left behind and are visible on telegraph poles and elsewhere.  Coincidentally, this year the elections will take place at a similar time to the tidy town inspections; this is a major issue for some people.Another issue relevant to elections but not necessarily to this Bill is the extraordinary waste of money involved in paying for storage of the electronic voting machines.  It is bad enough that the Government had to waste more than €15 million on the machines, but to continue paying for private storage at a time when the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government cannot afford to fund schemes such as the Carrickmacross sewerage scheme or repair roads such as those damaged around Castleblayney by the building of the bypass is totally unacceptable.  While I appreciate the Minister has been in the job less than two years, it is time the e-voting machines were dealt with.  The time for hard decisions to minimise waste is overdue.Returning to the Bill, I notice the administration and oversight of the scheme is an extension of the current statutory responsibilities of local authorities on top of existing arrangements for the disclosure of donations and expenditure on local elections.  I hope those structures are kept to a minimum and that funding is provided by the Minister towards this because local authorities, especially in Border areas such as Cavan and Monaghan, are under extremely tight financial budgets due to loss of rates.  Regional business premises are either being wound up or closed down due to the general loss of jobs and, in particular, to cross-Border trading.  I suggest this Bill ensure that no extra charge is imposed on local authorities for its implementation.Our recent experience with the Lisbon treaty referendum and the massive spending engaged in by some individuals is ample proof, if it were needed, that there should be a limit on spending in any election or referendum process, whether local or national.  It is equally important that funding such as was spent on the Lisbon treaty campaign be fully accounted for so that everyone is on a level playing field.  I trust that when the Minister concludes this Bill he will move on to deal constructively with referendums and other elections.  My party will be tabling technical amendments to this Bill and I hope the Government will deal with them in a constructive and positive way.I fully support my colleague Deputy Hayes in his remarks that there is an urgent need for total reform of how local authorities do their business.  Local councillors are a marvellous bunch of people and they deserve the right to make decisions in a stronger way.  Too much decision making has been taken from them.  When I was first on a council, we got a block grant for roads and we could decide where it was spent.  Now, when the grant for roads is provided, every inch of road is named.  There may be worse roads but county councillors are not in a position to change the allocation.  This is an example of where change is required.  Councillors need to be given proper power.  I support the Bill in general.
#MaryWhite	unknown-#MaryWhite-party	unknown-#MaryWhite-dob	unknown-#MaryWhite-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-03-11 00:00:00	Prelude	320	I wish to share my time with Deputies Niall Collins and Peter Kelly.I am delighted to welcome the Electoral (Amendment) Bill to the House.  The legislation is above and beyond what the Green Party secured in the programme for Government and demonstrates our party's strong commitment to clean, transparent and accountable politics and elections.  If we do not have elections run on fair and transparent rules, we end up with a political culture shaped by money, corporate agendas and unfairness, and those with the deepest pockets have the potential to spend their way towards election victory.  This legislation will establish a level playing field at local election time and, in that context, it is very significant.  We should have had such limits at previous local elections, and I hope there will be more initiatives from my colleague, the Minister, Deputy Gormley, to break the link between big money or corporate money and politics in general.The most important aspect of the Bill — the spending limits for candidates — strikes a fair balance in setting realistic limits on expenditure incurred by candidates, particularly in this fast-moving, communications-heavy era.  There are now many demands on candidates: the visual presence of the person; posters; technological communications; the world wide web; mobile phone communications; e-mails; and, in recent years, blogging, including putting tweets up on Twitter.  There is an endless amount of promotion in which candidates can take part.  However, for the biggest local authority electoral areas, €15,000 money is a fair cap.Section 6 provides for the Minister to amend the limits as required.  A certain amount of fluidity is important for the future because costs, like everything else, will change.  Sections 7 and 8 makes agents and other designated people accountable for their actions in dealing with the expenses of candidates.  We all have election agents or campaign managers who look after us during elections, and they too must be included in the Bill to make sure there is no siphoning off of money to indemnify a candidate.  I am pleased that the legislation provides for this.The Local Elections (Disclosure of Donations and Expenditure) Act 1999 is to be amended by the insertion of a Part IIIA which outlines how the expenditure can be divided between a candidate and the candidate's party; this is done in a comprehensive fashion.  Section 21 prevents candidates from making advance payments to, for example, poster companies or literature printers in order to hide the full extent of their expenditure.  That is important in the interests of transparency.My local authority colleagues will be pleased with section 5, which requires local authorities' annual reports to outline the total spend of all candidates.  Giggles have been heard from the media in regard to the amount spent by individual candidates.I hope this legislation can be used as a springboard for tightening spending limits in general elections.  It has been argued this will be more difficult to achieve because of the uncertainty surrounding the timing of general elections but ways of regulating can be introduced to ensure candidates and their agents monitor the amount they spend on election material in a given calendar month.  When an election is called, they would know that somewhere between three and five weeks of campaigning remain and would therefore deduct what they have spent thus far in that month from the total limit of spending allowed within a 60-day period.  I encourage the Minister to consider such a provision.This Bill demonstrates the Green Party's commitment to ensuring that elections are free and fair and that spending caps allow all candidates, including those with the deepest pockets, an equal chance.
#NiallCollins	unknown-#NiallCollins-party	unknown-#NiallCollins-dob	unknown-#NiallCollins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-03-11 00:00:00	Prelude	321	The spending limits provided for in this Bill represent a welcome innovation.  I have been involved in elections at local and national levels and have found it surprising that no limit was imposed on spending on local elections despite the potential impact on major local governance decisions.  It is farcical that regulations are applied in general elections but do not in respect of local elections.  I am happy with the limits that have been imposed in the legislation and expect they will provide a level playing field for all who contest local elections.Deputy Tom Hayes made an interesting point regarding the amount of money that can be spent on elections for South Tipperary County Council under the new limits.  The €1 million to which he referred should, however, be considered in the context of the number of candidates contesting an election.  We clearly cannot limit the number of candidates in an election.The Litter Pollution Act 1997 should be amended to place an onus on local authorities to deal with the issue of posters in a more practical manner.  Subsequent to the last general election, my posters and those of other candidates began to reappear in significant numbers in various parts of the constituency.  I wrote to the local authority to explain that I had removed all my posters and, in fairness to the authority, no subsequent issues arose.  We removed posters as soon as we became aware of them.  However, I was litter fined in the aftermath of the Lisbon treaty referendum campaign because a poster was found hanging on a pole even though I had passed the pole in the morning of the day on which the offence allegedly took place and did not see the offending poster.  Clearly, somebody had maliciously hung my poster on the pole later in the day and the litter warden happened to be in the area.I took issue with the local authority but was told that I could pay the fine or go to court and take my chances.  I paid the fine for the sake of a quiet life but I pointed out to the authority that I would have removed the poster had I received a telephone call.  Indeed, I removed the poster within half an hour of being made aware of it.  We should amend the Act in this regard because there is no benefit to us in leaving posters in place beyond the prescribed period.  Local authorities should formally write to the person responsible for the posters before issuing fines.  Some process should be put in place in this regard because certain people like to make our lives difficult in the aftermath of elections and referenda.I concur with previous speakers on the need to radically review the register of electors so as to align it with PPSNs.  Deputies receive electronic copies of the register of electors so that we can access the names of constituents who contact us in order to store their details on a client database.  Only 65% of those who contacted me over the past 18 months are listed on the register of electors.  We need to introduce radical reforms in that regard.We should decide either to use or lose voting machines because it does not make sense to keep them in storage.  The wrong decision was made in respect of not using them.  They were used in pilot exercises in a number of constituencies but issues arose in terms of how results were released and the information flow from them.  Why was a practical exercise not conducted subsequent to the election whereby ballot papers from a particular electoral area would be put through the voting machines to test their accuracy?
#PeterKellyFF	unknown-#PeterKellyFF-party	unknown-#PeterKellyFF-dob	unknown-#PeterKellyFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-03-11 00:00:00	Prelude	322	This legislation puts a limit for the first time on what candidates can spend at local elections.  As a former councillor of 20 years standing, I believe this will help to develop a level playing field.  Furthermore, it replicates the transparency achieved in general elections since 1997, when I first had the privilege of being elected to the Dáil.  These limits take a measured approach and candidates will still be able to mount reasonable campaigns.  This is particularly the case for new candidates who are eager to create a profile for themselves.  At the same time, however, the limits ensure that no single candidate is at an unfair advantage due to his or her financial circumstances.Some people believe there is a connection between the amount a candidate spends and the number of votes he or she gets, but I disagree.  In all my years in public life, I have found that the amount of doors knocked and miles walked is the best indication of electoral success.  A candidate can put his or her face on thousands of posters throughout a constituency but if he or she is not available to the community through clinics and correspondence with constituents, he or she will not get elected.The political system in the United States of America puts much greater emphasis on fundraising.  The unique way in which President Barack Obama raised funds for his presidential campaign is well documented.  He received millions of dollars in small donations from individual Americans.  Much of this money was pledged through his website.  Will we see more of this kind of fundraising in this country?The issue of where candidates find their money is vital.  Greater emphasis needs to be put on regulating donations.  Issues arose in this regard during the Lisbon treaty referendum. I welcomed the Taoiseach's announcement at the Fianna Fáil Ard-Fheis of new proposals relating to transparency in regard to political fund raising and spending for referenda.  It is vital, in the interests of democracy, that the rules and controls applying to political parties are applied to groups that campaign to influence elections and referenda.Details of spending limits were announced on 10 February and we are currently discussing the Bill dealing with these matters.  A sliding scale with four separate spending limits, based on population within each electoral area, will apply in the 34 county and city councils.  A top limit of €15,000 will apply in the most populated areas.  Limits of €13,000, €11,500 and €9,750 will apply in respect of candidates in other county and city council electoral areas depending on population.  Owing to the different administrative responsibilities, a standard spending limit will apply to all 80 borough and town councils.  Candidates contesting election to these local authorities will be, in all cases, subject to a spending limit of €7,500.The legislation provides that the spending limit will commence 60 days prior to polling day and will end on polling day.  Spending during this period by candidates and political parties will be covered under the new scheme and such spending must be declared in statements of election expenditure.  While up to now all local election candidates were required to submit a declaration of election expenditure, no limit applied.  Candidates will continue to submit spending returns to their local authority and will be required to comply with the new spending limits.Building upon the existing system of election expenditure declarations by local election candidates will minimise complexity and maximise compliance with the new spending limits.  It is quite common for candidates to contest a county council, borough and town election.  In this regard, candidates will be permitted to spend the full amount in respect of the county council election plus one-quarter of the limit of the borough or town council.   The spending limit for local elections will, in the first instance, apply to individual candidates.  Candidates nominated by a political party will be automatically deemed to allocate 10% of their limit for use by the party's national agent.  However, scope exists to vary this figure upwards or downwards by way of written agreement between the candidates and party.There are 34 county and city councils which, in turn, are broken down into 171 local electoral areas.  The top limit of €15,000 will apply in the 43 most populated areas; the €13,000 limit will apply in 38 electoral areas; the €11,500 will apply in 66 electoral areas and, the lowest limit of €9,750 will apply in 24 county and city councils.  The spending limit of €7,500 will apply to all 80 borough and town councils.  The spending limits are evidenced based and have been informed by stakeholder consultation with local government representation on the basis of limits for general elections, past spending patterns and, in particular, characteristics of local government in Ireland.  Guidelines for candidates and others affected by the spending limits are currently being prepared by the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government and will be issued through local authorities.On printing, I appeal to all political parties and candidates to have their posters, leaflets and so on printed locally in Ireland.  Irish printers are the best.  They produce good quality, state-of-the-art work and will not be beaten on price.  Also, I request while I have this opportunity, that all Departments use Irish printers rather than merely paying lip-service to this request.  Members should check all printed material to see where it has been printed.  If not printed in Ireland, they should ask why that is the case.  All costs should be included in the price.  For example, the cost of sending abroad material for printing should include the cost of travelling to inspect same.On posters, the name, address, contact, fax number and e-mail address of the printer should be displayed on all posters as should the name, address and so on of whomever ordered and paid for the posters.

Nobody wants posters to remain on display after an election.Local elections are important for democracy.  I wish all candidates well.  Democracy is what the people want.  The vast majority of people want to live in peace, not war.  No one in their right mind wants murder.  Many innocent people were killed in the Omagh bombing, including a pregnant lady.  How savage was that mass murder and the murder at the weekend of other people?  I call on those involved, in the name of the Irish people, to stop this murder and to contest elections and become part of democracy, which is what the majority of us want.

It was obvious it would be introduced in respect of the forthcoming local election given its success when introduced some years ago in regard to general elections.This is an enormous undertaking locally in that it places a fair amount of responsibility on Accounting Officers which, I assume, if the issue is addressed on the same basis as Dáil constituencies, each county council area will now have to identify.  Colleagues on both sides have spoken about whether the upper limit of €15,000 is too great.  I do not believe, from my experience of the east Galway constituency, that too many candidates will spend that amount of money.  I genuinely believe it is quite high.  I am not sure if, prior to when it became law for people to declare what they were spending, people spent that amount.  The sum of €15,000 for a county council election is a fair amount.I wish to bring to the attention of the Minister of State a technical matter which might, perhaps, be addressed by the Minister or Minister of State when replying later.  The Minister's script stated that a proportion of the amount could be assigned to the national party, as is the case in respect of general elections.  I would like to know if it will be possible to vary the amount.  I recall 10% or 12% being mentioned in this regard.  It is important this can be done.  We are all aware of the enormous role of television in local or general elections and the desire of parties and candidates to get their messages out globally.  In his reply, I would like the Minister to explain whether or not there is a certain degree of flexibility concerning the balance between what is spent in county council areas and what can be assigned to parties nationally.  That is important because the limits can easily be breached during a general election.  As soon as one breaches such regulations, one's name will eventually appear in the newspaper, even though most people do not set to do so deliberately.  That point should be qualified.There is no doubt that some members of the public genuinely believe that political posters should not be allowed, although I do not agree with that.  Despite all the other types of technology, in fairness to new candidates, if they are not easily identifiable they have no hope of being elected.  Given that they are unlikely to be on television and the fact that up to now local radio stations have not been able to carry party political promotions, the role of posters is important even in this day and age.  The same can be said for photographs of candidates in local newspapers.  That is not to say, however, that we should litter the whole place with posters.  The cost of posters will ensure that will not happen anyway.  A standard-sized poster costs between €10 and €12 these days.  In addition, posters must be erected and taken down, which adds to the initial cost.  Therefore some posters may cost €20 each by the time an election is over.  Despite the huge cost involved, I would not like to think that anyone would want to outlaw them.  It would not be fair to do so.  In any case, I do not believe most members of the public want that to happen.In fairness to the Minister, some positive steps have been taken to ensure that the register of electors is kept up to date.  Whatever the reason, however, there are many black spots around the country which nobody seems to be able to get a handle on.  There is not much trouble with the rural areas, but there are difficulties in towns and cities where many people are not on the register.  I will not go into the matter in detail because I am going off at a slight tangent from the Bill.  Nonetheless, it is disconcerting for people who want to be on the register but do not appear on it.  This is not what democracy is about.The outreach programme was developed by the Ceann Comhairle.  I see outreach officers in action in schools in my constituency and it is a good concept.  I would like to think it would continue in whatever form is deemed relevant.  Given the discussions I have had with my colleagues in secondary schools in recent times, I believe the outreach programme is the right step forward.  I am surprised at the level of interest in the programme and I hope the concept will continue.Having spent many years as a member of Galway County Council, I believe there will have to be a major shake-up in the local authority system.  I am sure the day will come for us to have a chance to discuss this in greater detail.  The county manager and director of services have important roles.  In most counties, they meet on Monday mornings to plan the activities of the coming week.  It is a co-ordinated venture because local authority work is a big business now.  I could never understand why the chairperson of a council is not part of that planning discussion.  One may say it is an executive role, but the sooner we move towards that, even in a semi-permanent manner, the better.  On behalf of the electorate, the elected chairperson of a local authority should be present at such meetings with the professionals involved.  I see no reason why that could not happen.  It is only one small step but if it happened it would be significant.Deputy Kelly mentioned the printing of posters.  I sincerely hope that we have now arrived at the stage of having a buy Irish campaign, given all the problems we have in this country.  I have always found that in the run up to an election, be it local or national, somehow or other printers seem to add on a few extra euro.  I hope that when we buy Irish posters we will get good value.  We have the technology to do so.  Everything else has taken a knock on the head, so I hope that the cost of election posters will not be prohibitive.  There should be a fair bit of competition between the various firms involved.  We should spend all this money wisely for the benefit of our own print workers.I hope there will be a degree of flexibility in introducing this legislation.  It is new and will take many people a while to get used to.  I hope the channels of communication between the Department and the electoral commission on the one hand, and the candidates and their agents on the other, will include flexibility also.  There should be a fair amount of two-way communication so that somebody will meet the candidates and their agents.  They deserve that at least.  The situation may look simple enough but when it is in print as a result of this Bill going through it will be very difficult to understand.

As my colleague Deputy Connaughton said, it is not earth-shattering but it is a step in the right direction.  As a candidate in the last local elections to Dublin City Council, I can certainly say that some of the expenditure was obscene and far exceeded anything within the bounds of reality.  This spending competition puts pressure on candidates to outperform each other, not only in terms of electoral performance but also as regards who has the flashiest literature, the most posters, and the best car or van.  All of this adds to the existing pressure on candidates and it is not what political campaigning should be about.  In many ways, we have lost much of the colour and flair of campaigns we saw in days gone by.

I regret we have come to a point where elections have become so stage-managed and so reliant on glossy literature.  I welcome the Bill which marks an important advance in curbing such matters and getting back to the fundamentals of elections and electoral politics generally.  The spending limits proposed by the Minister are still substantial.  A spending limit of up to €15,000 is quite generous.  Within an election, it allows for quite an amount of expenditure on campaigning.  I am pleased it will not cover just the four-week electoral period but eight weeks in total before polling day.Various reports have been commissioned on the conduct of general elections in the past several years, in which spending limits have been applied since 1997.  With relatively stable Governments in the past ten years, all election dates have easily been anticipated.  Experts in the field have expressed concerns over the glaring problem that electoral spending tended to be front-loaded.  Parties and candidates were able to spend for 12 months in advance of polling day making the spending limits obsolete.  I am glad the legislation will address this anomaly for local authority elections and hope it will be extended to general election campaigns.We may, however, not have as long a lead-in for future elections as in the past decade due to growing political volatility.  Procedures should be in place for accounting of election spending to extend over a longer period.  I accept it will involve complications and pressures for candidates and political parties to step up to the mark to have accounts in order but that is a responsibility that goes with the territory.I do not agree with the Green Party's posturing over election posters.  They are not a blight on our landscape that should be relegated to the past.

#LucindaCreighton	unknown-#LucindaCreighton-party	unknown-#LucindaCreighton-dob	unknown-#LucindaCreighton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-03-11 00:00:00	Prelude	341	Electronic voting machines with electronic counts would remove the drama associated with the traditional hand count.  It would be the same for posters.  They add flourish and colour to campaigns and in the four-week run into polling day can switch people on to the campaign.  Often people are detached from political life, so it is great people can tune into election campaigns.  The Irish interest in election campaigns is different to that in most modern democracies, which we should cherish.In the past we have seen the colour in posters when it was not just about a candidate's mugshot and a party tagline.  I am reading a book which recounts some of the brilliant election campaigns in the 1920s and 1930s.  In the 1931 general election, Cumann na nGaedhael used dramatic themes and slogans in its election posters such as the shadow of the gunman and keeping the red out of the national flag.  If we could inject a little more creativity into our election postering it would be a welcome departure from the standard developed over the past several years.  We have all become a little too slick.  We should not become obsessed with curtailing the poster element of campaigns.  A balance must be struck in this regard and the Bill is trying to go in that direction.The transparency element of elections must be also enhanced.  I hope the Minister will adopt an approach to give the Standards in Public Office Commission more clout.  Today, the Fine Gael Party launched a series of proposals for Oireachtas reform.  One proposal concerns investigations of practices and procedures in the course of an election campaign.  Such investigations can only be started on the basis of a complaint to the Standards in Public Office Commission; it cannot initiate any investigations of its own volition.  If the Minister is serious about electoral reform, he should examine this.A more meaningful body is needed to examine electoral responsibilities.  The Standards in Public Office Commission could be given a greater role and scope in, for example, monitoring the conduct of elections and voter registration.  There are still large discrepancies with the electoral register.  Two years ago, there was an overhaul in most local authorities of the register but it has failed.  Up to 80% of the names in apartment blocks on the register in my constituency are incorrect.  There is also a problem with the duplication of the database system for Deputies and Senators.  We need to be careful in this regard with the use of a unique identifier such as a PPS number.If the Green Party and the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government are serious about preventing people from buying elections, he should look closer to home with the abuse of power with ministerial constituency offices.  Ministers can have up to nine people working for them, churning out material for their constituencies and overcompensating for the Minister's attendance to Cabinet duties.  It is unjust and, I would argue, an unconstitutional advantage that has been conferred on Ministers.  If the Minister is as serious about electoral reform as he claims to be, then he needs to take this issue by the scruff of the neck.  He must make the commitment that all Ministers will reduce their constituency workers to the maximum of two so that the playing pitch is levelled out.
#SeanFleming	unknown-#SeanFleming-party	unknown-#SeanFleming-dob	unknown-#SeanFleming-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-03-11 00:00:00	Prelude	342	I welcome the opportunity to contribute to the debate on the Electoral (Amendment) Bill 2009.  It is timely as the local and European elections, and possibly some by-elections, are scheduled for 5 June.  It is important the legislation is processed as soon as possible.This straightforward Bill is not establishing any new principles in the electoral process.  It is extending the well-established principles for national, European and presidential elections to the local authority level.  One could argue that this was an inevitable process and, from that point of view, it has not generated the level of knee-jerk reactions we might have had if we were breaking new ground.The legislation sets out to introduce spending limits on expenditure by candidates and political parties at local elections.  All Members will be accustomed to this procedure.  The legislation also provides for the administration and oversight of the scheme by local authorities as an extension of their current statutory responsibilities in respect of the existing arrangements for disclosure of donations and expenditure at local elections.  Everyone is aware that councillors are obliged to complete donation statements each year and have become used to doing so.  In such circumstances, I am sure that difficulties will not arise.  The legislation will incorporate the same procedure in respect of expenditure at local level and spending limits will apply.In the most recent local elections, people were obliged to provide information on how much money they spent.  Such information has been of assistance because it was used to set the new limits with regard to expenditure.  There was no limit on expenditure in the previous local elections, so we are breaking new ground.  I do not believe, however, that the new limits will pose a problem or that the need to keep track of expenditure will give rise to difficulties.  The difference between what happened in the past and what will happen in the future is that the limits will be specified in legislation and people will be in breach of their statutory duties if they do not comply with the provisions of the legislation.A number of provisions in the Bill relate to the timing of expenditure.  The Minister indicated that "the date on which the spending period commences at the election must be not less than 50 and not more than 60 days prior to polling".   He also stated: "The spending period ends on polling day at the election."  I have not read the small print in respect of when, for accounting purposes, the expenditure period will be considered closed.  I presume, however, that this will be at the close of the polls.  When the votes have been cast and the polling stations are closed, one can do nothing further.  Expenses incurred on count day, such as those relating to taking one's party workers and volunteers out for a drink when the polls have closed, will not count under the expenditure limits, and rightly so.  Such spending does not affect the outcome of an election because the votes have already been cast.I was struck by the language used in section 7 of the Bill.  I am Chairman of the Joint Committee on the Environment, Heritage and Local Government but I have admitted defeat in respect of this section because I could not make head nor tail of it.  The section states: "Section 20(5) of the Act of 1999 is amended by inserting "or section 21(3A) (inserted by section 8 of the Electoral (Amendment)(No. 2) Act 2009“ after “subsection (4)”.”  I have no idea what this means.  As a result, I was obliged to obtain my understanding of the legislation from the explanatory memorandum.Members could not be expected to understand what is intended in section 7.  Perhaps this is due to the way in which we do business, namely, we enact legislation and then amend it and then amend the original amendments.  Eventually, legislation is introduced which is unintelligible, even to the relevant Minister.  We are reliant on the officials in the Department to ensure that the drafting of the legislation was done correctly.  However, what is contained in section 7 is not plain English.  It would be of assistance to the entire political process if the legislation with which the House deals was couched in plain English.  I do not intend to criticise those responsible for drafting this legislation, I am merely offering it as an example.  The position with regard to Finance Bills and Social Welfare Bills is similar and dealing with such legislation becomes a mammoth task.  As already stated, I am relying on the explanatory memorandum for my understanding of the Bill and people will understand why that is the case.  I hope the officials have got matters right.  If we were to verify some of the detail in this legislation, we would be obliged to train as Parliamentary Counsel.Perhaps the Minister will clarify the position vis-à-vis section 5, in respect of which the explanatory memorandum states:Section 5 provides for the insertion of a new subsection in section 19 of the 1999 Act to require the publication by a local authority in its annual report for the year in which the election is held, of aggregate details of election expenditure in respect of each candidate at the election.  It also provides for the details of donations received by a candidate at the election to be published in the annual report.I do not have a difficulty with this information being published or otherwise made available.  However, I am not sure whether the annual report of a local authority should contain details relating to people who failed to be elected or who did not even reach the quota.  A local authority's report should focus more on that authority's normal activities.  I accept that this is being done in an effort to make the position more transparent.  At present, however, all Oireachtas Members must disclose details relating to the donations they receive.  Such details are supplied to the Standards in Public in Office Commission — they can be inspected at its offices — are published in newspapers and are available on the Oireachtas website.  In my view, publishing such information in the annual reports of local authorities represents an attempt to be overly transparent.Details such as those may become the focus of local authorities' annual reports and all the good work being done by such authorities will be forgotten, particularly when these reports come up for approval.  Matters of interest to ordinary citizens and the real content of local authorities' work may also be overlooked by the media because there is no doubt that people are interested in information relating to donations.  I am completely in favour of public disclosure, but perhaps another mechanism might be found to facilitate the publication of information relating to donations.I have a major difficulty with section 7.  This is a standard provision in most items of legislation which probably dates back to Victorian times.  It appears we have an obsession with money when it comes to drafting legislation.  According to the explanatory memorandum, the import of section 7 is that a person who is found guilty of the offence of spending too much money on election posters can be disqualified from membership of a local authority and that this disqualification "will apply and have effect for the remainder of the term in office of the members of that authority".Provisions similar to that contained in section 7 have been included in previous legislation.  As already stated, a person found guilty of the offence of spending too much on election posters can, under this section, be disqualified from membership of a local authority.  However, if one is a murderer, rapist or paedophile, one can serve as a member of a local authority.  I cannot fathom the obsession with spending in Irish law.  It is probably a hangover from Victorian times when if one did not pay one's debts, one was considered a person of no standing.  Like Oireachtas Members, local authority members who cannot pay their debts and are declared bankrupt are automatically disqualified from membership of those authorities.  However, one could commit every other type of crime — some of them extremely heinous — and one would not be so disqualified.I cannot understand why we are focusing on the serious but technical offence of overspending on posters or leaflets as one which should disqualify people from membership of local authorities.  That is daft and is a hangover from the period prior to Independence.  Disqualifying someone from membership of a local authority as a result of their overspending is not an appropriate sanction.  There are others ways in which we might deal with this matter.  If the purpose of section 7 is to dictate that people who are not fit for office should not be members of local authorities, I could identify 100 more serious crimes which should be included in it.  That said, however, members of the public are entitled to elect people to membership of local authorities, even if those individuals are not of good character.  In that context, I must question whether there is a need for any restrictions in the first instance.We recently celebrated the 90th anniversary of the first Dáil at the Mansion House.  I was struck by the fact that most of the Members of that Dáil were as láthair because they were imprisoned in this and other jurisdictions.  However, even those who were in prison were not disqualified from membership of the House.  Under the legislation before us, people who spend too much money on election posters will be disqualified from membership of local authorities.I have made my point but I do not know if I have been successful in getting the message across.  We debate this matter each year in respect of different items of legislation.  We will not move forward until there is a change of attitude in respect of financial matters.  I am not excusing those who overspend on posters or whatever, but it is awfully selective to identify this one aspect and bar such individuals from participating in our democracy as a result.  We must not forget that the people are entitled to elect whomever they wish.  This fact is not reflected in the approach that lies behind provisions of this nature.There has been much discussion in respect of the posters used for election campaigns.  Everybody is familiar with the issue.  Posters can be up for 30 days before an election and for seven days after polling day.  There is good existing legislation on this issue relating to national elections, as well as the Litter Pollution Act.  Those provisions should carry on under this legislation.  People are conscious of the environmental and Tidy Towns issues involved.However, in recent years we have taken the option of over-sanitising the electoral process, which has taken the craic and fun out of it.  Let us recall the Lisbon treaty campaign.  There were many posters up for that campaign and there was the biggest ever turn out for a referendum.  I am not saying there is a direct correlation but there can be a correlation with the level of political activity in terms of putting the issues before the people.  When I pick up my daily newspapers they contain full page advertisements for the various supermarkets.  I simply turn the page; one does not see them anymore.  Every supermarket has full page advertisements and I do not know whose advertisement says what.  However, it is different if one is going out of one's estate and seeing the posters.  They are only up for three weeks and it does not kill anybody.I believe in a good poster campaign.  Everybody is aware of the problems with canvassing.  One can canvass new estates but one will be lucky to find 50% or 60% of the people at home.  If people have moved into an area in recent years, they do not know who the local candidates are.  They also would not know the new candidates.  At best, in the course of the three or four weeks of a campaign, one will do well to meet 20% to 30% of the electorate.  One will never meet 100% of it; it is not physically possible in that time frame.  One cannot get leaflets into every house, so postering is one way of campaigning.I am very strict about posters.  I fully support the legislative requirement that all posters must be removed within seven days of the close of polls.  Local authorities, quite rightly, probably make an example of the politicians, as I have heard from throughout the country.  In the 2002 election, of a total of 1,000 election posters for myself and the rest of my party's candidates, two were still up eight days after polling day.  We were fined and paid the fine.  That was only right.A view has been expressed by many Members of the House to which I do not subscribe, even if I am in a minority.  There is a legislative requirement that posters must be removed within seven days of polling day.  I have heard Members say that if a poster has been left up, the local authorities should telephone the candidate's office and give them a day or two to take it down.  That is rubbish.  That essentially means there will be no seven day requirement and the person will wait for the telephone call.  I have heard several Members of the House suggest this.  It is a black and white issue.  The person has seven days to remove the posters and there should be no compromise on it.Candidates should put up as many posters as they wish.  I have never heard people complain about them.  They only complain if the posters are not removed after the election.  I urge candidates to ensure they remove the posters within the seven days.  Legislators should not ask local authorities to remind us.  They are already prosecuting auctioneers and others for putting up illegal signs and hoardings for their shops and businesses.  Those people do not get 24 hours to take down their posters; the litter warden simply arrives and imposes the fine.  The same should happen to politicians.  Members of this House should not ask for concessions in that part of the legislation.  There should not be one law for us and a different one for everyone else.Something unusual happened to me previously, and I thought I was the only one to whom it had happened until I heard that it had happened to several of my party colleagues after the last local election.  I guarantee that every poster put up by my party in my constituency was taken down within seven days.  Six weeks after the election a poster appeared.  I took it down myself.  A week later, another poster appeared.  Somebody started playing silly games in several constituencies.  The posters were pristine.  Obviously, somebody had taken them down when they were first put up.  They were clean and there was no weather damage.  They must have held onto them——

I have no hesitation in defending my action of taking down the posters.The legislation also deals with the expenditure limits.  I fully support limits.  However, I believe they are outrageously large.  I do not know if Laois is a typical county but the average spend by each of the candidates of my party in the last local election was €1,500.  We spent €30,000 on approximately 20 candidates.  The legislation permits €10,000 per candidate per electoral area.  I calculated that our party could spend up to €750,000 on the local elections if we ran our full complement of candidates.  It is daft.  I thought the object was to curtail expenditure to some extent.

I will ask that a comparison is made between how much a candidate can spend on a local election with what can be spent on a general election.  I would have assumed a candidate would have much less to spend, not just proportionately, in a local election.  When one considers that candidates can spend €10,000 per electoral area, it amounts to a very large amount across a constituency.  I am surprised at how high the limits are.  I do not believe they will present anybody with a problem.  I look forward to——

#SeanFleming	unknown-#SeanFleming-party	unknown-#SeanFleming-dob	unknown-#SeanFleming-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-03-11 00:00:00	Prelude	352	No.  The Minister is making provision for election expenditure but it is up to the individual candidates if they choose to take up that level.  I do not envisage candidates in my constituency taking up a fraction of what is permitted under the legislation.  I hope the figures will be re-examined.  Personally, I believe they are too high.There is a lacuna in the legislation.  If a third party receives donations and wishes to engage in political spending, it must register with the Standards in Public Office Commission.  However, an organisation that does not receive donations and uses its own money for political spending has no obligation to register with the commission.  Members will have seen some of the Ryanair advertisements that specifically and deliberately concentrate on a particular politician.

There must be something wrong with the system if it allows very direct political advertising but has no legislation to deal with it.  We must deal with that issue.  It might not be possible in this legislation but we must deal with it in the near future.Before introducing this legislation the Minister appeared before the Oireachtas Joint Committee on the Environment, Heritage and Local Government to discuss the Bill.  I look forward to him discussing it further on Committee Stage and dealing with some minor points of clarification and refinement.  Above all, I look forward to the provision of briefing information through the local authorities for candidates or their agents so they will fully understand the implications of the legislation.  The Standards in Public Office Commission provides an extensive briefing note for candidates in general elections, which is very helpful, but a briefing will be required to help candidates in local elections.  I look forward to that happening.The most important element in an election campaign is volunteerism, on which one cannot put a price.  The shoe leather, thank God, is not listed as an item of expenditure.  The best way to get elected is through the use of shoe leather in the house to house canvas and shaking the hands of voters.  I look forward to this legislation being passed by the House as quickly as possible.

It is not very significant legislation.  It establishes some limits for expenditure in elections but does not go so far as accomplishing the Taoiseach's commitment relating to either the cap or the limits.  This will be dealt with by the amendments proposed by my colleague, Deputy Ciarán Lynch.  This should have been an opportunity for a Minister in his first term in office, who speaks a great deal about reform, to do something substantial.Anybody who is serious about local government reform, and I have a personal view on the issue, would have reformed the City and County Management (Amendment) Act.  There is a very serious problem with local government in terms of participation in decision making, and the recent changes have not worked.  Those who will come out of these elections will find themselves on a plethora of special committees, policy committees, different forms of co-operation with an alleged voluntary sector, that sometimes meet and sometimes do not, but all of which are entirely dominated by the director of services.  The director of services is the tier immediately below the tier of city or county manager, but the latter tier not been reformed in recent decades.  It is an antiquated Act.I was listening to some of the contributions and I wish to explain why the city and county management is relevant.  It is sometimes assumed that abuses at elections are somehow or other an Irish thing in a post-colonial context.  K. Theodore Hoppen has written about electoral abuses.  The highest point of electoral abuses is in fact in the late 19th century.  If people look at estate records they will see that in the estate that is left over an enormous amount of money was spent on whiskey and on lemons for the punch that was served on polling day.  The notion of going from door to door to canvass began in the 19th century.  In addition, the practice known as groaning developed, whereby one collected a person in the parish, and then one went from house to house collecting other people.  When one came to a hostile person, everyone groaned collectively so that the district inspector's report stated that there was no violence but there was much groaning.

#MichaelDHiggins	unknown-#MichaelDHiggins-party	unknown-#MichaelDHiggins-dob	unknown-#MichaelDHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-03-11 00:00:00	Prelude	357	Therefore, abuses predate the establishment of the State and city and county managers arrived after certain abuses that were indeed native, such as, for example, the town clerk who was illiterate who used his barber to take notes as he was shaving him the following day.  There might have been reasons for the City and County Management (Amendment) Act and the centralisation of power in it.  There is none now.  If the Minister, Deputy Gormley, had courage about local government reform, he would have addressed that issue.I also find unacceptable the notion that the display of posters comes under the litter Act.  That is lazy, sloppy and offensive.  The fact of the matter is that there are international protections on the right to assemble in public.  It is a basic human right to assemble in public, distribute literature and communicate with each other.  There has already been an attempt to abuse the litter Act.  I had to run a campaign in Galway city to defend the right to distribute bileoga, leaflets that were simply giving information as to meetings and so forth.  They were regarded in the exact same way as people selling prams, bedding and furniture.  No distinction was made between polluting commercial leaflets and information about a political meeting.In the exact same way one had another ridiculous notion in regard to the destruction of the public space, that gathering of more than five people could potentially constitute an illegal assembly so one had groups of people pretending they were only part of a group of four or six.  I deplore the idea that somehow or another one could use inappropriate legislation, in this case the litter Act, to discuss the right to communicate, give information and to invite people to an assembly, and then in turn the right to assemble itself.  Where is all of that coming from?What is so superior about something covert, about the people who slip around without upsetting anybody, lest we hold a public meeting to say what we stand for?  I still conduct after-mass meetings.  I am very much in favour of the final rally at parties, should there be one.  I am entirely in favour of people saying what they stand for.  I do not admire all those candidates who will be going around in a few weeks' time trying to drop the name of their party to say, "I am only so-and-so's daughter" and "I am only so-and-so's uncle" and so forth, with the hope that by dropping the name of the party, as many will on this particular occasion, they can hope to survive politically.The truth of it is that the more politics we have the better.  There is a belief that there is some kind of gentility in the notion that we should have a small discreet poster stuck somewhere that nobody will see it and that is green and superior, when in fact it is one of the weaknesses of the Green Party that it seems to be shrinking democracy rather than expanding it.  At one stage it wanted to get rid of the Upper House and it would like to have fewer Members of Parliament, and no doubt it would like a small poster to match.  While I am at it, I must say Deputy Gormley's shameful remark, when he suggested that the Green Party is practically the only party that is not involved in appearing before tribunals for receiving money from builders, was particularly unworthy.  He knows of the Labour Party and he should not be ashamed or afraid to compete with us.I am sure the Ceann Comhairle would agree that in the present position in which we find ourselves, the idea that a poster would be up for seven days after an election is hardly the greatest crisis we will face in any of our parishes.  For the life of me, I cannot see what is wrong with an official telephoning a particular candidate to say one of his or her posters is up and that he or she will incur a fine if it is not taken down.  How is that treating candidates differently from anybody else?  It is far from claiming special privilege for people contesting elections.  Estate agents and auctioneers will have their signs up for a very long time at the rate things are going and they will not be taking them down in a hurry.The notion is quite interesting that one suddenly——

The idea is that nothing happens until 60 days before the election and then suddenly all the little mushrooms are up and off we go and we start counting them.  That is nonsense.One Member with whom I am sharing time has not materialised so I will give myself an extra minute.  There is a suggestion that one can do it all electronically and quietly.  However, elections should be about an invitation to participate.  They should be about genuine contests.  There is such a thing as political rhetoric.  I admire anyone from a political party who can stand up on a stone wall and say what they stand for.  I do not regard those people who whisper around the place saying, "I do not want to upset you now, but just in case, I am standing".  God be with all those people who are shy and may they be elected, but they are not superior.  An election should be about knowing what it is that one wants, inviting one's fellow citizens to support one, and having the guts to go about it.  When one puts one's face on a poster and all that goes with it, why would people get upset about that when they have not been upset by posters for Duffy's circus or Fossett's circus?  The posters will only be there for a temporary period in any event.Another issue relates to music.  Why should we not have bands with trombones and bugles if we feel like it?  There is something very strange about the notion that everything has to be quietened down.  Everything has to be moved to a point far beyond discretion, that things must be whispered.  Democracy is not about a whisper, democracy is about the roar of change.  We will be getting an awful lot of it in June and the Minister, Deputy Gormley, will hear it.
#KathleenLynch	unknown-#KathleenLynch-party	unknown-#KathleenLynch-dob	unknown-#KathleenLynch-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-03-11 00:00:00	Prelude	360	I fail to learn the lesson of going before Deputy Michael D. Higgins, which I should.  Coming after him is never an easy task.  He says I am up to it so I have to put my best foot forward.The Deputy is right that this is a joyless piece of legislation.  It is about restriction.  No one is saying that we should not have regulation.  Of course we should, and we should have openness and transparency.  We should put in place a system to ensure that people comply with the rules as laid down.However, the rules laid down with regard to posters are ridiculous.  Posters are not litter.  They are the mechanism by which we transmit a message to those we hope will vote for us.  That goes for all of us.  It seems the Green Party is, in some way, ashamed to be involved in politics and hopes to unburden its shame on the rest of us.  I have no problem telling people I am a politician.  It is hard to deny it because people know I am.  I have no problem in saying it because politics is a noble art.

That, I suppose, is the reason I have been elected.  We should not allow anybody heap blame on us because we are politicians and that is what this legislation is about.  I agree there should be a cap on spending.  I do not know anybody who spends €15,000 on a local election, but I am sure some people do.

#KathleenLynch	unknown-#KathleenLynch-party	unknown-#KathleenLynch-dob	unknown-#KathleenLynch-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-03-11 00:00:00	Prelude	364	A person would want to be very unpopular to spend that kind of money and not get elected.  However, some people have spent large amounts and not been elected.  In general, the electorate has good sense and usually elects people who represent or reflect its views.  Deputy Fleming said earlier that if people of ill repute put themselves forward and people want to vote for them, that is, perhaps, a reflection of an element of society.  I would suggest they should not be elected, but if they are the people's choice, that is what democracy is about.There are issues concerning local government in which the Minister should be involved.  I do not usually believe in making a personal issue of something, because politics has enough policy targets for us to take aim at without personalising an issue.  However, the notion that the Minister is purer than the rest of us has been put across.  The Minister is almost fit to explode with joy because he is a Minister, but any legislation he introduces is joyless.  The Minister speaks about "My Department".  It is not his Department, but the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government.  It is an instrument of the State and will outlive him, me and the Ceann Comhairle.  A person should not take possession of something in that manner.  The Department is not his but belongs to the State.I agree with Deputy Higgins that there are issues with which the Minister must deal.  Better local government gave us more officials, a layer of bureaucracy we do not need and costs a fortune, but it did not increase productivity nor increase transparency and openness.  Reform is needed within local government to make it freer to deliver the service it should deliver to citizens and make it more open and transparent and more prepared to take on new ideas.  These are the areas the Minister should be considering.We had a debate on the issue of the register of electors all last year and the one before, but the register is no better now than then.  Surely the Minister can find some mechanism that can identify electors uniquely so that even if they move house they will not appear twice on the voters' register.  We should be possible to do this with the technology that is available.  This is something we should take it upon ourselves to achieve.

#KathleenLynch	unknown-#KathleenLynch-party	unknown-#KathleenLynch-dob	unknown-#KathleenLynch-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-03-11 00:00:00	Prelude	366	We need to make other changes.  For example, the fact that a person is homeless should not mean that he or she does not have a say in how the country is run.  Everybody should have a say and although people should be traceable, they should not have to be registered at a particular address.  Some people do not have a vote not through their own fault, but through the fault of other people who make matters difficult for them.  For example, it is made difficult for people to register by demanding they go to a Garda station to get their application stamped, as if applying to vote was a criminal offence.  That is outrageous.  People should be able to fill their forms and return them to the local authority, which should have the wherewithal to check them out.  If people's PPS numbers were on the form, this would be easy.It is crazy for the Minister to start his local government reform by saying that posters are litter, that it is a criminal offence to leave them up beyond seven days after an election and that a candidate can only spend so much on his campaign.  This is clearly a Minister devoid of ideas who is looking for issues to raise in the public arena.  It would be a better day's work if he reformed local government in a way that made it more productive and more accessible to the citizens it is supposed to serve.The Minister must stop his Calvinist attitude towards politics.  There is some joy in life.  God knows, if politicians do not have a sense of humour and take some pleasure from their work, they should not be in politics.

I felt that if I got close to him, some of his goodness might rub off on me.  However, that would mean getting too close.He said that the Labour Party candidate outspent him in the most recent general election.  For the record, the Standards in Public Office Commission published spending figures show that Deputy Thomas Byrne, Meath East, spent €26,168 while the Labour Party candidate, Dominic Hannigan, Meath East, spent €22,465.56.

I hardly know where I am.  I listened to Deputy Higgins speak about shy people.  I am a very shy person — probably the least known Deputy in Tallaght — and must try to rise above it.  This is a good debate and I am sorry I was not here to hear what Deputy Byrne had to say.  I will pass on Deputy Lynch's good wishes to him.Many issues could be raised in this important debate in which we all have an interest.  I come from a background of having been a very happy local councillor.  I was first elected, after much pushing and many efforts to stop me, to the then Dublin County Council in 1991 for the then Tallaght-Rathcoole electoral area.  I was re-elected in 1999.  People often commented that I was very happy with that position.Some Deputies will know that I never expected to be a Deputy.  It came as a shock to me when my colleague, Chris Flood, came to me in January 2000, just after I had recovered from a health problem which made me give thought to what I wanted to do for the future, and asked me to consider being a Deputy.  I hope nobody here ever has a heart attack and has to make that sort of decision.  I remember saying to Chris Flood and former Taoiseach, Deputy Bertie Ahern, that I might not want to be a Deputy because I was a very happy local councillor.  However, they prevailed.  I remember the former Taoiseach saying to me that if I was happy to take the grief with the job, I should go and do it.I look back on my local authority days as a time I enjoyed.  I also regard myself as a happy and content Deputy.  I am very happy doing what I am doing.  While there will always be plenty of people trying to get rid of me, I am here and prepared to make my contribution.  Local authorities are a good grooming ground for Deputies, but not every local authority member makes it to the Dáil.  I never expected to do so.  It is good that we take an interest.  Councillors from my area, who I will not name, will be telling people I am too busy now that I am a Deputy in Dáil Éireann and advising them to go to them, the councillors, instead.  We must all deal with this.The Ceann Comhairle will know that most of the calls received by Members, who deal with legislation and spend time in Dáil Éireann, concern local authorities.  This is evident from an audit I carried out of the calls I received in my office over recent days.  I hold eight local clinics in my constituency in Dublin South-West and note that I am still being asked to deal with a considerable number of local authority issues.  Based on my local authority experience, people still want to deal with me because they still believe I can get the street lights fixed quicker than anyone else.  I suspect it is the same in the Ceann Comhairle's constituency.  I have often said that colleagues have come to this House in different ways, which is fair enough, but I believe local authority experience serves as a good grounding in politics.  It is important that this be said.Many issues could be referred to in this debate.  The details of the spending limits to be enforced for the 2009 local elections, which are to be held in 86 days, were announced by the Minister in February.  He told us the Bill will give effect to the limits and that it is scheduled to be dealt with this week and cleared in the Dáil.  He also stated that, for the 34 county and city councils, a sliding scale with four separate spending limits, based on the population within each individual electoral area, will apply, and that a top limit of €15,000 will apply in the most populated areas, with limits of €13,000, €11,500 and €9,750 to apply to candidates in other county and city council electoral areas, depending on their population.In south Dublin, particularly in the general Tallaght region, there are new electoral areas.  These encompass Clondalkin, Lucan, Rathfarnham, Tallaght central and Tallaght south.  Tallaght central, where I live and which stretches from the old Kingswood village by the Naas Road all the way through Tallaght to Templeogue, takes in houses in Dublin South West, Dublin Central and what was Mid County Dublin.  The population of this electoral area is 59,306 and that of the Tallaght south electoral area, which takes in that area of Tallaght not in Tallaght central and stretches up the mountain to Bohernabreena and across to Firhouse, is 48,387.  I am told the candidates' spending limit in both these areas will be at the top end, at €15,000.Tallaght central, where I live, is the kind of place in which I would love to be a candidate.  It is pretty diverse and at same time presents particular challenges pertaining to community development.  The area encompassing Tallaght central, old Kingswood village, the Tallaght west estates, Springfield, where I live, Belgard, Kingswood, Kilnamanagh and Templeogue is almost like three separate constituencies.  I wonder about the kind of reaction colleagues at the Dublin Central end, in Fortfield and Wainsford, etc., will receive when trying to convince people they are in Tallaght central.  Did someone in the Department believe "Tallaght central" was an easy title and constituted an easy way to deal with the matter?  Without wishing to be controversial, I believe the decision has consequences for community development.  To use a Dublin phrase, candidates will have to "make bits of themselves" and their message will probably have to be different in all sections of their electoral areas.  After the election, when the successful candidates are attempting to raise issues on the agendas of council meetings, it will certainly be a challenge.  There is no question about this.The challenges will be reflected in the turnout on 5 June.  I wonder about the make-up of the six seats in Tallaght central.  Will three seats reflect the Tallaght vote and three the Terenure-Templeogue vote, or will certain areas have a greater turnout than others, as happens?  How will the seats be filled given that there is such a large electoral area with such a huge population, amounting to almost 60,000?  Ultimately, will the voter be served properly?  Tallaght south, which stretches from the west Tallaght estates to Aylesbury and Old Bawn and almost to the border with Rathfarnham,  will be different again.  There will be difficulties in this regard.Let me refer to Tallaght, which I do not want to talk about too much.  I am not expected to draw the Ceann Comhairle into any discussion but I must state Friday, 13 March 2009 will be a momentous day for Tallaght.  The coming of Shamrock Rovers to Tallaght stadium, on its opening, will be celebrated by all.  If Deputy Timmins is driving home at teatime, he will contend with a lot of traffic.  Perhaps he will come to the match; I have a ticket if he wants to attend.

I should not draw the Ceann Comhairle into any discussion but he should be aware his name is very well respected in Tallaght on foot of his efforts on our behalf.  He was a very progressive Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism and helped Shamrock Rovers in a big way.  As we celebrate on Friday, we will not forget him.  I will raise a glass to him on Friday night.I worry about the kinds of electoral areas that have been created in south Dublin.  Colleagues can talk about other challenges.  While I am not an expert on Clondalkin, I know the five-seater constituency stretching from Brittas, which Deputy Timmins knows well, and Saggart and Rathcoole all the way over to Clondalkin has a population of 53,173.  I wonder about the sizes of the electoral areas and about the impact of six-seater constituencies on community development.  It will always be said that smaller parties and independent candidates like the constituencies with the highest number of seats.  Even five-seater constituencies in local authority areas incorporate many different places.  It is a pity we have not debated this.  I must face challenges concerning the two electoral areas in my constituency.Colleagues mentioned the electoral register and the associated difficulties.  Deputy Kathleen Lynch referred to voters having to go to the Garda station.  In fairness, some system had to be found because there was always a myth that people on the register were really in local cemeteries.  I am not being flippant when I say this because we all know these stories.  Over recent years, there are problems with registers of electors, not only in south Dublin.  It is a fact that on 5 June, when we are at our local polling stations, people will still be asking why they are not included on the register.  During the last election, the local bishop, who will not be embarrassed by my saying this, had to identify himself at the polling station, which may be fair enough, and then discovered his name could not be found on the register.  Issues will always arise over registers of electors.  Over the next 86 days, representatives of all political parties and none will be seeing what they can do to have people included on registers.A challenge arises over what I call the international community.  Indications in this regard have already been received from members of the international community in Dublin South-West and the two Tallaght electoral areas.  Perhaps this is to be welcomed but it will give rise to challenges concerning voting patterns and inclusion on the register.  Citizenship should be the first priority as far as registering is concerned.I hope we all continue to do what we can, at least to get people registered.  In Tallaght, Deputies Pat Rabbitte, Brian Hayes, Conor Lenihan and Charlie O'Connor have, over the elections, supported an initiative in west Tallaght by An Cosán to get people to register and to get the message across that voting is good for one.  We always make the point that people should be registered to vote and should be encouraged to vote and then we all have a chance of getting a vote from them.  My constituency is no different from many other constituencies and certainly no different from many urban constituencies where in some cases the voting turnout was quite low in successive elections.There is a responsibility on all of us to keep working on this and to get the citizenship message across.  This is why I supported the Ceann Comhairle's initiative to get out to the schools and to young people.  Next Friday, the senior school at St. MacDara's community college will invite all of the European election candidates and local Dáil Deputies to speak to the young people, who are the voters of the near future, about how important voting is and get across a positive message.  We all know how cynical everybody can be about politics, in particular young people.  I try to bring youth and school groups here and often I find they are quite surprised at what they see and what is being done.  Sometimes, they are a bit confused also.  It is a positive message to try to get across and try to overcome the cynicism that people can have.Will the Minister re-examine the issue of sheriffs?  I am not complaining about the county sheriff in Dublin only.  The sheriffs should examine in an innovative way how to facilitate those who want to vote.  We have had situations in my constituency where the location of polling stations has not always been optimum.  For example, in previous elections some of the west Tallaght polling stations were used for voters in the mostly rural area of Brittas.  Often, I made the point that we should try to make it more convenient for people to register to vote and on polling day and get the system right.  I hope that as part of the debate on this legislation that the Minister will examine this.Reference has been made to posters.  In my party there has been much debate on whether we need posters.  All of us remember the far-off days when polling stations were covered in posters on election day and most political parties had at least one canvasser for various candidates handing out leaflets.  We all thought that system would never change and when it did, generally speaking there was a sigh of relief and people were happy enough with the new system.  This proved that one can make changes and get away with them and people move on.  The debate on whether we need posters or the amount of posters we have is a good debate and I will be interested to see how it develops and how other political parties and Independent Members handle the Minister's initiative.The jury is out on this.  Deputy Michael D. Higgins made a reasonable point that everybody puts up posters and in any constituency one will see posters for concerts and other such events.  In my constituency, politicians and parties are finding innovative ways of getting over the regulations.  I got negative and positive publicity prior to the last election when I put up posters early on St. Patrick's Day.  I will not do it this year.  I got much grief from the council which issued very stern warnings and told me to get them down.  However, I was able to drive around my community at the time and see certain other parties putting up leaflets in a different way, such as to advertise meetings.  Today, if one drives through Tallaght one will see that a number of parties have posters advertising meetings.  They leave them up for a month after the meeting is held.  Not to give out about them because I never would, but the socialists are particularly adept at doing this.  They keep posters up for all sorts of issues, one week it is about bin charges, the next about litter, the next about Afghanistan and the next about President Obama.I wonder whether the regulations about posters should be clearer so at least we know what is expected of all of us.  I do not plan to put up any posters on this St. Patrick's Day or, I hope, not for a little while yet.  It is worthwhile to debate whether posters have a future.  We all know that many community organisations and resident associations in our constituencies always ask us why we put up posters and why we cannot all agree on it.  If we do not all agree or if legislation is not introduced to deal with it one must do what everybody else does.  At the same time, one wonders what would be the situation if we did not put up posters and we all agreed to abide by this.I listened to Deputy Creighton making a very relevant point on the competition for spending that takes place between everybody.  It is 86 days to the local and European elections and these regulations will be introduced 60 days prior to the elections.  Not only in Tallaght but all over the country people are spending huge amounts of money.  If one gets the Tallaght Echo this week one will see a big expensive advertisement.  I am not picking on those people, I am only stating that we cannot have it every way.  If we have control over spending that is fair enough.  However, as colleagues stated, in the last local elections and certainly in the last general election a great deal of money was spent by people who were not successful.  I fear that if this takes off and people keep spending a massive amount of money in campaigns ordinary community people will no longer be able to progress through the system.  I am not crying about this, I am only stating that this system and democracy should be such that everybody has an opportunity.  I look forward to strongly supporting the Bill and I appreciate the Ceann Comhairle’s courtesy to me.

I have a soft spot for Shamrock Rovers but I shout for Bray Wanderers.In many respects this is straightforward legislation.  However, nothing raises the heckles more or creates a mode of tension more than election time.  I want to deal with some measures in the Bill such as the spending period of 50 to 60 days.  I welcome the fact that there is a limit to expenditure.  However, I find it difficult to comprehend why the Minister based the expenditure levels on population.  He mentioned the number of electors in Drumlish in County Longford, that areas in central Dublin had a much higher figure and that places with a higher population would have a greater spend.  Surely covering an electoral area such as Drumlish is far more expensive than covering Tallaght, which Deputy O'Connor represents.  If there is to be a relationship it should be based on the geographical size of an area rather than the population.  From our constituencies we all know that a populated area requires far fewer posters than a geographically spread area.  The Minister should examine this between now and Committee Stage.  I guarantee him that it would be far more expensive to cover the Drumlish electoral area than it will be to cover the Ringsend electoral area.The second point I wish to make concerns the concept of returns to local authorities.  The document mentions a period of 90 days, but I do not know if that is a little excessive.  The longer one leaves things, the more difficult it is to get them in.  Many local authorities have been very sloppy in taking returns from local councillors, be it electoral returns or their annual declaration of interest returns.  A episode of "Prime Time" last year outlined the shortcomings of some local authorities.  I would say that very few local authorities have an up to date register of interests.  I urge the Department to make sure that officer appointed by the local authority is in place.  My understanding is that it would be an understatement to say that they were sloppy.Deputy Fleming mentioned that if a candidate over-spent under this legislation, then he or she may be barred from membership of a council.  That seems to be a little harsh, but one of the biggest crimes in any election is when a candidate lies and gives misleading information, such as providing literature that claims that a certain Deputy or Minister calls on his constituents to vote for a particular candidate so that the party can obtain two seats.  We do not have a system in place to censure such misinformation, which can have a positive or negative impact.  We do not even have such a mechanism within parties.  There is a general acceptance that this goes with the cut and thrust of politics, and that while it is difficult when we are going through it, when the game is over, all is fair in love and war.  That is not acceptable.  If somebody indulges in unethical practices during the campaign they should be censured.We are familiar with the various anecdotes about candidates did and did not do in the past.  I read American Pharaoh, the book about the late Mayor Daley.  Reading about some of the stunts he pulled, one could see how his origins were in Ireland and in our political system.  The stunts were masterful and it is worth reading the book to see what he did on occasion.  He was very innovative.I would also like to deal with related issues, such as the absence of local government reform.  The Bill deals with spending, yet we have seen nothing about local government reform.  We all know it is badly needed.  If I sit into a taxi in Chicago, there is a number in the back seat that tells me to telephone the son of the famous Mayor Daley.  If a light is not working, I can telephone a 1-800 number.  It might seem trivial to talk about such a thing in the Dáil, but the hours politicians spend trying to get a public light fixed is nothing but a disgrace.  It is a disgrace that it must be done in the first place, and it is a disgrace for being such a waste of time.  We do not have a mechanism in place.  I do not know how many telephone calls or letters are needed to do it.  Why can we not have a system whereby the citizen can contact a 1-800 number so that something will then be done?  I received a letter a few days ago from a local authority concerning a representation I had submitted on 7 April 2008.  Reform of local government needs to be addressed.Many local authorities received their bonuses this year.  It will be interesting to see how many, as I believe that they should not have been paid such bonuses.  We must grasp the nettle, and I hope that this Minister would bring in the concept of directly elected mayors.  Within the official ranks, there is huge opposition to this.  In a society where people are——

I had some eloquent points that I wanted to make.  I will finish on that note, even though you have caught me unawares.I welcome some of the provisions in the Bill but there are many things that are wrong with local government, such as the register of electors.  There should be a designated area for posters.  Councillor George Jones in Wicklow is trying to get this going, so it should be done.  Contrary to what Deputy O'Connor claims, there is nothing worse than driving along the roads and seeing these signs everywhere one goes, as one cannot keep one's eye on the road.  There would be no need to extend the period for their removal if they were in a designated area.When the Minister looks at electoral reform in a detailed manner, I hope he would examine the idea of putting names on the ballot paper by random sample, as opposed to alphabetical order.  There is a distinct disadvantage in appearing at the bottom of the register.  The names should go into a hat and come out accordingly.
#MichaelKitt	unknown-#MichaelKitt-party	unknown-#MichaelKitt-dob	unknown-#MichaelKitt-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-03-11 00:00:00	Prelude	384	I thank Deputies on all sides of the House for their contributions to the debate.  The comments they made focus on the Bill itself and on the electoral agenda in general.  We can go into more detailed aspects of the Bill on Committee Stage.I welcome those comments that acknowledged that the scheme of spending limits seeks to bring fairness to the electoral process and facilitate a more level playing field for candidates.  The Minister explained the reasons he did not want anything to be too high or too low.  I acknowledge the work done by the joint committee on the issue of spending limits, and the contributions of local government stakeholders in developing the scheme.  It is vital to work together on electoral matters, as they are central to the effective functioning of democracy in this country.It has been suggested in the debate that the spending limit period proposed in the Bill is not long enough.  Bearing the proximity of the local elections in mind, 60 days is the maximum period that can be realistically set for the 2009 elections.  This period will effectively be more than double the current limit for Dáil elections and European Parliament elections.  It will also more than double the period for which local election spending had to be declared under the current provisions in the Local Elections (Disclosure of Donations and Expenditure) Act 1999.  Many Deputies claimed that the limits were too high.  We know that some people spent huge amounts of money in the last elections to get themselves elected to local authorities.Deputy Bannon sought clarification of the arrangements that will operate for party candidates.  The spending limits for local elections will apply to individual candidates in the first instance.  Candidates nominated by a political party will be deemed to be automatically allocating 10% of their spending limits for use by the party's national agent at a national level.  For example, a party candidate with a limit of €7,500 would be deemed to automatically allocate €750 for use by their party.  However, there is provision to allow this figure to be varied upwards or downwards by written agreement between a candidate and the national agent of his or her political party.  The maximum that the national agent of the party can spend will be the sum of the amounts allocated by the individual candidates.Under the current arrangements for Dáil elections, candidates can allocate a portion of their limit for use by the national agent of their party.  This must be done in writing.  However, given the number of candidates involved in the local elections this approach would create significant administrative difficulties.  Therefore, a default position will apply whereby 10% of a candidate's limit will be deemed to be allocated for use by the national agent.  Deputy Bannon also raised the issue of how a vacancy would be filled in the event of a member losing his or her seat arising from prosecution for non-compliance with the provisions of the Bill.  It is my understanding that such a vacancy would be filled in the normal way as in the case of a casual vacancy through provisions set down in section 19 of the Local Government Act 2001.I welcome the comments from Deputies on the need to establish an electoral commission in Ireland.  The programme for Government commits to the establishment of an independent electoral commission which will take responsibility for electoral administration and oversight, implement modern and efficient electoral practices, revise constituency boundaries, take over the functions of the Standards in Public Office Commission relating to election spending and examine the issue of financing the political system.The commission will also take charge of compiling a new national rolling electoral register.  In this regard the Minister appointed consultants to carry out preliminary research on issues arising related to the establishment of the electoral commission.  The consultants' work was completed recently and the Minister published the report last month.  The report recommends the establishment of an electoral commission.  It covers issues such as the registration of political parties, the electoral register, constituency revision, running elections and referenda, funding and research and awareness activities.Issues related to the electoral register have been raised by several Deputies and have also been extensively examined by the Joint Oireachtas Committee on the Environment, Heritage and Local Government.  Many Deputies referred to the electoral register in this debate.  It is envisaged that this function would be taken on by the electoral commission.  The Minister is inviting interested organisations and individuals to provide views on the important issues raised in the report and I welcome the views of Deputies as part of this consultation process.Some of the debate related to the amendment to the Litter Pollution Act.  I refer to points raised regarding the control of election posters.  The Minister recently informed the Government, on foot of the public consultation in Autumn 2008 on election postering, that he intends to initiate pilot schemes in a number of local authority areas during the upcoming local and European elections.  These pilot schemes will investigate how various options identified through the consultation process would work in practice with a view to informing future policy development in this area.  I am aware from discussing the issue with members of Ballinasloe Town Council that they held a discussion on that matter and the various options.Election posters only become litter if they are in place outside the time limits specified in legislation.  I believe it is necessary to control postering to ensure the litter problem does not arise in the first instance.  The Minister does not propose to amend the current requirement to remove posters within seven days of elections, referenda or public meetings as he believes this is sufficient time to allow for the removal of posters.  I fully recognise the important role that posters can play in informing the electorate and raising awareness of upcoming polls.  It was never the Minister's intention to ban election posters.  The legislation does not propose to lessen the role played by posters in the electoral process.  As the Minister informed the House earlier, the amendment to the Litter Pollution Act will clarify the position regarding the time limit for the erection of posters for public meetings, elections and referenda and remove any confusion which may exist in this regard, leading to greater control of postering and a reduction in the risk of litter.The Minister made the important point that we had no limits for local elections on the most recent occasion.  Now we have a scheme which will cover this issue.  The Minister clearly stated that the legislation allows for the spending limit to commence up to 60 days before polling day and to the end on polling day.  It is important to point out that spending by candidates and political parties during an election campaign will be covered under the new scheme.  Such spending must be declared in statements of election expenditure.  Up to now, all local election candidates were required to submit a declaration of election expenditure, but there were no limits to what could be spent.  Candidates will continue to submit spending returns to local authorities as they have done heretofore, but now will be required to comply with the new spending limits.There has been a welcome for the proposal facilitating candidates wishing to contest simultaneously for both a county council and an urban based borough or town council.  The Minister stated that a candidate will be able to spend up to the limit for the county council electoral area plus one quarter of the limit for the borough or town council.  That is a welcome addition as there are many cases in which a candidate contests elections simultaneously.On examining the 34 county and city councils I noticed that they are in turn broken down into 171 local electoral areas.  I refer to the spending limits.  Reference was made to the €15,000 limit.  This applies in the 43 most populated electoral areas.  The limit of €13,000 applies in 38 electoral areas.  The limit of €11,500 applies in 66 electoral areas and the lowest limit of €9,750 applies in 24 county and city council areas.  There are 80 borough and town councils to which the spending limit of €7,500 will apply.I commend not only the Joint Committee on the Environment, Heritage and Local Government but also the Department for the consultations with local government representatives.  The Department has examined past spending patterns and limits for Dáil elections which are important for comparison.  There are particular characteristics of local government in Ireland such as multi-seat constituencies.  Usually, these range from three to seven seats.  It is rather different from other countries where there may be single seat constituencies.  All these matters have been investigated.Guidelines for candidates and others affected by the spending limits are being prepared by the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government and will be issued through the local authorities.  Again, I thank Deputies from all sides of the House and I hope the Bill is passed through the Dáil in a speedy manner.
#OlwynEnrightFG	unknown-#OlwynEnrightFG-party	unknown-#OlwynEnrightFG-dob	unknown-#OlwynEnrightFG-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-03-11 00:00:00	Prelude	385	I commend the Labour Party on tabling this important motion.  It is particularly timely in light of the unfortunate, if somewhat expected, increase in the live register figures in the past month.  That the unemployment figure is likely to exceed 450,000, as the Taoiseach has acknowledged, is a matter of great concern to everyone.I will speak principally to those aspects of the motion which are related to social and family affairs.  We are all aware of the increasing number of unemployed.  To date, no action has been taken to ensure a system is in place which will treat people who apply for social welfare entitlements fairly and with dignity.  In some areas people must wait for only two weeks to have applications for social welfare payments processed while in others the waiting time is up to 16 weeks.  Unemployment benefit applicants are worst affected by these delays which are having a massive knock-on effect on the community welfare system.The longer I am a Member of the House, the more I realise how little joined-up government we have.  The Minister for Social and Family Affairs, Deputy Hanafin, has stated that community welfare officers are not her problem as they are the responsibility of the Department of Health and Children.  The Minister must accept that she is responsible for recipients of social welfare benefits.  I have been unable to secure a satisfactory answer to the following question.  How can a community welfare officer obtain all the information he or she needs from a person to adjudicate on an interim supplementary payment application within five days or one week when the Department of Social and Family Affairs takes up to 16 weeks to arrive at a decision?  Community welfare officers, in making supplementary welfare payments, must have a good idea that applicants will be ultimately adjudged to be eligible for the payment.  They do not hand out money willy-nilly but make good assessments within a few days, without forcing people to wait for long periods, as the Department does.While I appreciate that additional staff have been transferred to work in the social welfare system, the number is not sufficient.  We must bear in mind the training requirements for those working in the Department.  These are technical roles and one cannot expect people to be able to do the job immediately.  Change is needed and more staff must be deployed to this area to enable applicants to access their entitlements.  The problem with making people wait for a payment is that it causes them to delay paying off debts.  Although mortgages are of greatest concern, people also have to pay ESB and gas bills and credit union and car loans.  They ran up bills or took out loans at a time when they did not envisage becoming unemployed.  Suddenly they find themselves in major difficulty and unable to pay their bills or repay their loans.A major problem has arisen in the administration of the mortgage interest supplement, largely because community welfare officers are extremely busy.  The Money Advice and Budgeting Service requires additional resources to enable it to employ people with expertise in the mortgage area who are able to negotiate with financial institutions on behalf of MABS clients.  The moratorium on repossessions does not go far enough as it applies only to the main financial institutions.  The problem persists among sub-prime lenders which are not subject to the moratorium.  These institutions actively encouraged people to consolidate all their loans, including those for holidays and so forth, in their mortgages using their homes as security.  People in this position now find that the mortgage interest supplement is only payable on the portion of their mortgage which relates to their home.  While it may not have been a responsible decision to consolidate loans in mortgages, people took this decision in a different climate and are now finding it difficult to cope.  Changes are needed in this area.  MABS, for example, should be resourced to tackle the problem.On the back to education allowance, we heard a great deal about education and training at the recent Fianna Fáil Party Ard-Fheis and the Government made an announcement in this area this evening.  We must ensure people do not have to wait 12 months to become eligible for the back to education payment but are instead facilitated to attend a third level course.  Under the current criteria, a person who loses his or her job in October must wait for 12 months before becoming eligible for the allowance.  At that point, however, the college term for the following year will have commenced and the person will have to wait 23 months before being able to commence a third level course.  Despite the 12-month eligibility condition many applicants must wait for much longer.  Even as matters stand, 12 months is too long to wait.While I accept exceptions have been made for employment action plan and redundancy areas, only a small number of people have managed to access courses through this stream.  I ask the Minister to review the eligibility criteria for the back to education allowance.  We need to ensure that rather than being a purely negative event, the loss of one's job will be regarded by some people at least as an opportunity to change career direction or up-skill.  Quicker access to the allowance would mean that losing one's job would not be a major crisis for some individuals.  The difference between the back to education allowance and jobseeker's allowance is €500 per annum.  The implementation of the former lacks common sense and must be changed.
#UlickBurke	unknown-#UlickBurke-party	unknown-#UlickBurke-dob	unknown-#UlickBurke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-03-11 00:00:00	Prelude	386	I thank Deputy Enright for sharing time.  I am pleased to have an opportunity to say a few words on this important motion.  Week after week, throughout the country, we hear announcements of job losses.  The Government has shown itself to be helpless to take action to stem the tide of unemployment and job losses.  In addition to the Minister and the Government, the agencies charged with the responsibility of creating jobs have failed to show initiative to create new jobs or safeguard existing jobs.I have raised previously with the Minister of State, Deputy Kelleher, a decision to shed a large number of jobs at the CIGNA company in Loughrea.  The jobs in question were not in manufacturing and were transferred abroad.  The loss of such a large number of service jobs was unique in the west.  The IDA, Enterprise Ireland and other agencies failed to intervene immediately to identify what could be rescued in the time available before the company closed its outlet.  When asked what action it could take, Enterprise Ireland stated it could provide a maximum of €5,000 for consultancy to generate new items of production.  This shows how much at sea the agency was with regard to this industry.  All I asked it to do was to be proactive in County Galway, which is haemorrhaging jobs, by auditing the needs of factories and industries it had helped to establish or nurture during the good times to ensure further jobs were not lost.  It has not done so.We were informed that a new economic forum — we no longer have task forces — has been established.  The idea that such a forum would not sit in the area where job losses have taken place is foreign to me.  The forum in question, which was established under the chairmanship of the county manager, sits at county buildings in Galway, far removed from the reality of what occurred.  With such a detached, arm's length attitude, we will not make any progress.  Nevertheless, I appreciate the Minister of State's successful efforts to attract funding from the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund to assist ongoing training for those affected by unemployment.People want to work and those who have lost their jobs want to up-skill to enable them to return to the workplace.  In this regard, I ask the Minister of State to consider two proposals.  Community employment schemes have been a valuable asset in creating jobs in areas in which no employment alternatives were available.  Under these schemes, community work was done which would not otherwise have been done.  Many people involved in these schemes acquired skills which allowed them, in the boom times, to create work for themselves and move off the live register.  I ask the Minister of State to ensure these schemes are supported.I also ask the Minister of State to take action to eliminate the barriers faced by those who wish to access the back to education allowance.  People do not want to sit at home and dwell on the fact that they have lost their jobs.  I ask that action be taken to ensure back to education allowances are available to those who need them in the near future.

We should not politicise things.  I am not accusing the Deputies opposite, but the general media comment that somehow the Government is unaware of the challenges confronting families across the country does a disservice to every Member elected to this House.  We meet constituents on a daily and weekly basis and we are fully aware of the concerns and plights of families throughout the country who are facing the prospect of unemployment.We must first acknowledge why we are in these difficulties.  There are many factors relevant to this debate.  The global credit crisis is causing major distress across the broader economy.  That is something most people are beginning to acknowledge.  I am delighted that even the Labour Party has acknowledged that the credit crisis is having a major impact on the jobs and lives of ordinary people in this State on a daily basis.

We must acknowledge the considerable international context.  Ireland must deal with the issues it can deal with in the context of our own budgets.  The Government recently announced there would be a supplementary budget in early April.  That is simply because we have no choice but to make difficult and unpopular decisions.  It is fine for people to come in here, table motions and speak on them, but we must be honest with ourselves.  Ireland is in a fragile state not only in the context of our own budgetary position——

Not only must Ireland get its own house in order, but the European Union must come in and assist vulnerable states.  I was surprised at the understanding and empathy from colleagues at the Council of Ministers.  They were understanding of Ireland's particular position.  I must point out again that we are not alone.  It is not uniquely Irish; it is something with which we must deal collectively in a Europe-wide context.

#MJNolan	unknown-#MJNolan-party	unknown-#MJNolan-dob	unknown-#MJNolan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-03-11 00:00:00	Prelude	414	The fear and, in some cases, anger that is out there must be seen to be appreciated.  It is in that context that I appeal to the Government to do what it can to ensure that as many jobs as possible are retained.  Some Irish companies are still operating profitably, while others are under threat because of the global economic crisis and the lack of domestic demand.  However, I appeal to the Minister to consider cases in which we do have jobs and contracts.I became aware last week of a particular case in which Iarnród Éireann awarded a contract for upgrading of equipment in Rosslare to an Irish company which then subcontracted its work to foreign companies.  I know of two companies that tendered for that business but did not succeed as they were slightly more expensive.  However, the work is now going to foreign companies, one of which is in Finland, although I do not know where the other one is located.  While it is possible to hide behind the independence of the Government, the Departments and semi-state bodies, there should be a certain loyalty on the part of Irish bodies in view of the situation we are in and the numbers on the unemployment register and they should look more favourably on Irish companies where there is the possibility of retaining jobs.  Once people go on the live register, it will be hard to find jobs for them.  I ask the Minister of State and all Ministers to notify their Departments that, where possible, and within reason, we should keep contracts in Ireland.I also ask the Minister to request that his officials use a light touch with regard to regulation of commercial organisations.  We are all aware of the difficulties being experienced in the catering trade.  The costs for companies in this area are relatively high compared to those of their European partners and the area of regulation is of concern to them.  They feel that at times they have been unduly pressurised and that they are spending time and money on book-keeping and record-keeping that would be more profitably spent increasing their business and reducing costs.I also request that more resources and manpower be provided to the Department of Social and Family Affairs, whose staff are working under extraordinary pressure to cope with the number of applications for jobseeker's benefit and allowance.  We are talking about people who have never in their working lives had to go near a social welfare office.  The role of MABS is also important.  It is doing a wonderful job, but it needs to be properly resourced and funded to deal with the urgent cases it sees on a daily basis.
#CyprianBrady	unknown-#CyprianBrady-party	unknown-#CyprianBrady-dob	unknown-#CyprianBrady-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-03-11 00:00:00	Prelude	415	I welcome the opportunity to speak on this motion because we are where we are in these particular times.  The Taoiseach recently described the current circumstances as the worst global economic situation in the past 70 years.It behoves us to ensure that the measures we introduce protect to the greatest extent possible those who are in employment or are seeking work.  The decisions we make over the coming weeks will influence those who are currently attending schools and colleges.  I was delighted that the Tánaiste set out her priority as "jobs, jobs, jobs".  We are all aware that the decisions we make will be tough for people and families but we must make them in the context of retaining employment and providing alternatives for those who have lost their jobs or are on short working hours due to the economic climate.  Families throughout the country are having to cope with two and three day working weeks.Having worked in employment exchanges in the 1980s, I understand the effects these changes will have on families and individuals.  We must do all we can do to encourage people to return to the workforce as soon as possible and to retain the jobs that currently exist.  We must plan for the time when the economy improves once again.  The most basic lesson in economics is that economies throughout the world experience peaks and troughs.  Recent announcements demonstrate that we are still managing to attract foreign direct investment in spite of the current economic climate,.Last night, the Tánaiste outlined how Departments, the IDA, Enterprise Ireland, FÁS and other State agencies are pulling together to focus on jobs and growth in the short to medium term.  When we needed agencies such as ANCO and Manpower, they worked for us.  FÁS and the other agencies are critical to employment and the experience they have gained through the programmes they have put in place will allow for a sustained focus on jobs.I made the point at a meeting with industry representatives last night that if one is without a job, one does not pay tax.  It is in everybody's interest to ensure that as many people as possible remain in employment and that we seek alternatives for those who lose their jobs.

I commend the Labour Party and, in particular, Deputy Shortall and my friend, Deputy Penrose, on allowing us to discuss a range of issues.  As Acting Chairman last night, I was enthralled by Deputy Penrose's contribution.  The Tánaiste acknowledged that the Deputy made several positive suggestions.Unlike Deputy Brady, I have not worked in a labour exchange but I have been a client of the exchange in Tallaght.  I have mentioned this to Deputy Enright on three occasions.
#OlwynEnrightFG	unknown-#OlwynEnrightFG-party	unknown-#OlwynEnrightFG-dob	unknown-#OlwynEnrightFG-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-03-11 00:00:00	Prelude	417	I know.
#CharlieOConnorFF	unknown-#CharlieOConnorFF-party	unknown-#CharlieOConnorFF-dob	unknown-#CharlieOConnorFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-03-11 00:00:00	Prelude	418	That experience helps me to assist people because I can understand the challenges they face.  I live in Tallaght, where 7,261 people were unemployed in January.  That is a huge figure for the third largest population centre in the country.I cut my political teeth as a founder member of Get Tallaght Working in 1984, when jobs were a major issue.  I am not afraid to speak about Tallaght's needs or the 24,000 young people who are still in school in Tallaght.  The infrastructure in Tallaght is tremendous but we need the same help as everyone else.  I will not compete with other Deputies or claim that jobs should be created in Dublin rather than Westmeath, Carlow, Tullamore or Wexford but we are all entitled to speak for our constituents.I concur with my colleagues on the need to do all we can to assist people.  Two weeks ago, I was anxious to invite my party colleague, the Minister for Social and Family Affairs, Deputy Hanafin, to Tallaght in order to visit the family resource centre and An Cosán in Killinarden and the local MABS centre and Citizens Information Bureau in Tallaght village.  She saw for herself the challenges that people are facing.The last call I received before coming to the Chamber this evening was from a constituent from Kilnamanagh who worked in SR Technics.  When the news about that company broke, I was concerned for north Dublin and the employees who would be affected.  My constituent wanted me to share his concerns about the job he held at the company for the past 31 years.  He is typical of many of the company's employees.  The Tánaiste and the Minister of State, Deputy Kelleher, must do what they can in this regard.  Workers have expressed concern that the Dublin Airport Authority is putting down deposits on hangars.  A case can be made for reaching out to the workers to see what can be done.  If it is true that the company is not prepared to consider offers for the Dublin facility, Government agencies should get involved.An innovative project from Institute of Technology Tallaght, ITT, provides an example of what is needed nationally to retrain, support and energise those who have been unfortunate to lose their jobs.  Increasing numbers are losing their jobs in the current economic recession.  Many may want to take the opportunity to gain a third level qualification but are unsure if they would be able to study at third level.ITT has developed a new and innovative programme for those who are unemployed and are seeking to retrain and up-skill for the knowledge economy.  A certificate in preparatory study for third level, special purpose award level 6 research, has shown that adult learners often lack confidence when they are faced with the prospect of returning to education.  ITT is opening up the college to prospective students and giving them core confidence building skills in the areas of communications, personal development and study techniques.  The programme also provides participants with tastes of a range of subjects in areas that would improve their prospects for future employment to help them choose the right programme.  While attending the programme individuals remain available for employment, which means their welfare benefits are not adversely affected.  Participants who successfully complete the programme gain an accredited special purpose award at level 6.  Once again, Tallaght is showing the way.Other speakers have criticised county enterprise boards but, with a little bit of tweaking, these organisations can continue to play a valuable role.
#MaryWhite	unknown-#MaryWhite-party	unknown-#MaryWhite-dob	unknown-#MaryWhite-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-03-11 00:00:00	Prelude	419	Behind the unemployment statistics are the lives of real people with mortgages and bills to pay and families to feed and support.  They face terrible uncertainty over whether they can find employment in the short term.  We must recognise this and focus on getting people back to work so they have the satisfaction of financial security.My colleagues, the Ministers for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government and Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, have provided some positive ideas through the recent national insulation programme and the water management investment scheme and have given an incentive to people to get back to work.  Almost 4,000 jobs will be sustained through investment in water infrastructure and an estimated 10,000 jobs through the energy efficiency schemes, the home energy saving schemes, the warmer home schemes and the social housing insulation schemes.  While this will not help everyone it is a significant start.Under the auspices of FÁS, the Government is providing for the re-education of those in certain sectors through new training places.  A new training fund is being established, which will facilitate those who face redundancy, help apprentices complete their studies and provide community employment schemes.  The county enterprise boards are pushing out the boat to help people with good ideas to get up and running with start-up finance.  I also acknowledge the Tánaiste's recent commitment to 51,000 training places delivered through FÁS, increasing to 78,000 over time.  That will give heart to those worried about their future.While we have focused on those in the construction sector or the lower paid sector, we must think of the highly skilled who are losing their jobs.  Almost 45% of architects are out of work.  Engineers, graphic design artists and editors have degrees, are highly trained and have skills but where will they go?  In previous times, Irish men and women went to America, England and New Zealand, but they are experiencing the same global downturn.  We must find creative ways to get ourselves out of this hole and make sure the skilled who have lost their jobs have the chance to re-enter the work force.  Many of those who have contacted me who are still in employment have taken a 30% pay cut to keep their companies going and they are happy to do it to get through these hard times.For these groups of unemployed, there is a difficult path back into the work force.  They are unable to re-skill in the same way as builders or carpenters can be trained to adapt to the national insulation programme so they must try something different.  This is where we can do it in Ireland.  With the knowledge economy and the roll out of broadband, many of these people could work from home on a global basis.  An architect in Ireland could draw up plans for a client in England, Switzerland, France or Spain.  Broadband is the key to development, particularly in a rural constituency like Carlow-Kilkenny or those of other colleagues in the Dáil who live in rural areas.  If we have top quality broadband rolled out, there is a chance people can network, set up their own businesses at home, connect to the global community and, perhaps, unemployment could kick-start their careers and spur them to set up their own business.  We must look at the skilled in the private sector who have lost their jobs as well as the unskilled because they will find it difficult.We hope there will be 100% broadband coverage by 2010 with 50% coverage by the end of this year.  There are no grounds for complacency.  Long-term unemployment is socially upsetting and has huge financial implications, with emotional effects on families, and not just on the husband or wife but on the children, who pick up on it when things are not right at home or people are in bad humour.  People are in bad humour because they do not have a job.The highly skilled must not be forgotten, the low skilled must be up-skilled and trained.  There was good news this week, with Hewlett Packard announcing 500 jobs.  Let us cross our fingers there will be further announcements like that.
#MichaelMoynihan	unknown-#MichaelMoynihan-party	unknown-#MichaelMoynihan-dob	unknown-#MichaelMoynihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-03-11 00:00:00	Prelude	420	I welcome the opportunity to speak on this debate.  People's lives are being affected by job losses and their knock-on effects.  The current international financial crisis is the greatest challenge since the Great Depression.  Historically, the collapse in 1929 was caused by an over-supply of products that no one wanted to buy.  The greatest difficulty we face is that there is a global economic downturn and we exported 80% of what we manufactured.  Our main markets were Britain, the European Union and America.  They are experiencing an even greater downturn than us — the USA lost 600,000 jobs in January — and there is no demand for our product.The Government and other State agencies must find out what will be needed in the market place.  Someone put it bluntly to me last night, saying that if there was a street where they had enough shovels, no one would try to sell shovels there.  We must be targeted in our approach.We face our greatest ever economic crisis.  We talk about the 1980s and 1950s but we must be innovative.  We must make a huge effort in research and development.  Many small and medium size business are experiencing huge difficulty with financing from the banks and that difficulty must also be addressed.  The Government is trying to do that with recapitalisation.  It will be difficult, however, because the privately owned banks have decided they will not put any more credit into the system.  Like ordinary people, they are afraid to invest.  The real difficulty is that small to medium sized enterprises that have grown in the last 15 years are stretched.  They need to be innovative and branch out.We should be encouraging these people to look at innovative ideas to get people back to work, manufacturing products that are needed and wanted in the market place.  The difficulty is that not just the domestic market but the international markets have collapsed and a huge stimulus package from the European Union will be necessary.  We must have a product available that we manufacture in Ireland.  We have an excellent workforce that is highly educated but it is up to the Government and State agencies to ensure we have the edge when there is an economic upturn.  This is the greatest challenge facing us since 1929.
#JackWall	unknown-#JackWall-party	unknown-#JackWall-dob	unknown-#JackWall-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-03-11 00:00:00	Prelude	421	I wish to share time with Deputies Tuffy, Upton, Sherlock and Jan O'Sullivan.

#JackWall	unknown-#JackWall-party	unknown-#JackWall-dob	unknown-#JackWall-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-03-11 00:00:00	Prelude	423	I acknowledge yesterday's announcement by Hewlett-Packard to provide 500 new jobs in County Kildare with the possible extension of that figure over time.  It gives a boost to Kildare in these current economic difficulties and it would be remiss of us if that were not acknowledged.Redundancy places much pressure and concerns on families.  Every Member has referred to the problems faced by those who have to attend social welfare and community welfare offices for unemployment payments.  As the numbers rise quickly, many people are forced to queue in the streets in all sorts of weather, despite the best efforts of social welfare staff.  Recently, I spoke about this to the manager in the Kildare town social welfare office and as a result five extra staff were appointed.Due to the backlog in processing claims and the delay in payments, many people have had to go to their community welfare officers.  The officers have been inundated with calls from people seeking assistance payments with mortgage relief and, in many cases, for just putting food on the table.I asked the Minister for Social and Family Affairs to provide back-up staff for community welfare officers to deal with the increasing numbers of claimants to be informed that Professor Brendan Drumm, chief executive of the Health Service Executive, would provide them.  Everyone knows from this evening's headlines that the Health Service Executive is cutting back nearly all its services.  There is no hope of community welfare officers getting any back-up staff.  Will the Minister address this staffing issue comprehensively to ensure people are assisted?  If we are waiting for Brendan Drumm to do it, it simply will not happen.I have raised with the Minister on a previous occasion the matter of apprentices in SR Technics.  Last week I met the apprentices with other Labour Party Members.  It is a pity that such highly trained personnel are not able to complete their apprenticeships.  I hope the Government will address this matter.Deputy White referred to the national building insulation programme, an initiative that will hopefully gain momentum.  There is, however, a problem with the grants being set too low.  For example, the grant for the insulation of a roof comes to €250.  The minimum costing I have got in my area from contractors is €700.  That leaves a substantial cash shortfall for the home owner which would be particularly difficult for senior citizens.  If this is allowed to remain, we will be wondering this time next year why the grants were not drawn down.No local authority has received funding for care of the elderly grants.  I put down several parliamentary questions on this matter to the Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, with responsibility for housing, Deputy Michael Finneran.  He claimed he was, against the tide, providing an extra 8% in grants yet no decision has been made in regard to providing the funding.Deputy Stagg and I recently attended a meeting of Kildare County Council which has committed grants of €2 million and uncommitted grants of €5 million, a total of €7 million.  The injection of that amount of money by a local authority would have an immediate positive effect on the building trade.  More importantly, the senior citizen would benefit accordingly.  Every local authority has lists of elderly people who need their houses repaired with, for example, downstairs showers installed.  It would be a wonderful initiative if the Government provided that funding in tandem with the national insulation programme.
#JoannaTuffy	unknown-#JoannaTuffy-party	unknown-#JoannaTuffy-dob	unknown-#JoannaTuffy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-03-11 00:00:00	Prelude	424	I propose all city and county development boards should be constituted as employment taskforces for the duration of this economic crisis.  The reason for my proposal is that the response to the recent job losses, for example, at Dell in Limerick was to establish an employment taskforce.  When Deputy Rabbitte was a Minister of State, he established job taskforces in response to job losses in Tallaght and other places.  Rather than waiting to establish a jobs taskforce in response to company closures, it might be a better approach to have the taskforce already established.  The make-up of an employment taskforce is the same as city and country development boards with all the agencies involved being on both.  These boards would be ideally placed, meaning new organisations would not have to be set up.  The South County Dublin Development Board has already set itself up as an employment support forum.  This is the model for other boards across the country.The job losses in south County Dublin, the local authority area in which I reside and represent, are the equivalent of several Dell closures.  This is being mirrored in many parts of the country.  Jobs lost here and there add up to sizeable numbers.  There is, however, not the same response if it were one single factory closure.  The county development boards would be able to ensure every responsible organisation with which they engage, such as the county councils, the VECs, FÁS, the IDA and the Departments of Social and Family Affairs and Education and Science, would come up with proposals and initiatives to support local job creation and jobseekers.  A board could ask, for example, what its county council could do to support existing businesses, to maintain existing jobs and to expand the workforce.  The local FÁS office could examine what it could do to provide opportunities for jobseekers through training, education and employment schemes.  Other organisations could examine the local demographic profiles and match them with the type of jobs we need to create for the future, particularly in sustainable and environmentally clean alternative energy.An OECD report suggested community employment schemes should not be expanded but alternative schemes examined.  I would, however, expand the existing community employment schemes.  In 1995, more than 40,000 places were available on community employment schemes while now there are only 20,000 places.  Unemployment has returned as a major problem, with graduates, construction workers and those who worked in manufacturing joining the dole queues.When I left college, I worked on what was then called a social employment scheme in the administration and clerical areas.  Eventually, I obtained a permanent job, trained further and became a solicitor.  We need to provide similar opportunities for people who are graduating now, otherwise they will be obliged to emigrate or go on the dole.  I do not necessarily believe that people on community employment schemes would be paid more than they would obtain in the form of jobseeker's benefit or allowance.  However, they would at least be able to go to work.  People want to develop their CVs, obtain work experience and learn new skills.  It is important that a higher level of training be provided on such schemes than has been the case in the past.An article in today's edition of The Irish Times  states that a report compiled in England shows that college is the healthiest option for school leavers during times of recession.  In other words, it is much better for them to attend college rather than go on the dole.  The Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Batt O’Keeffe, recently made the point that the abolition of third level fees did nothing to improve access to college.  The opposite is the case.  HEA reports show that, since the Labour Party abolished fees in 1998, participation rates in third level education have improved among the members of every socioeconomic group.The Government should give consideration to the serious damage it will do if it reintroduces third level fees.  School leavers will be discouraged from attending college and will end up on the dole.  As already stated, it is much better for people to be in employment — which would be ideal — attending college or on a community employment scheme.
#MaryUpton	unknown-#MaryUpton-party	unknown-#MaryUpton-dob	unknown-#MaryUpton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-03-11 00:00:00	Prelude	425	I welcome the opportunity to contribute to this debate.  Despite the outpouring of documentation from the Government in the form of various action plans, programmes for recovery, etc., nothing has been done to stem the haemorrhage of jobs out of the economy.  Large and small businesses across every sector are being affected by the current crisis relating to the loss of jobs.I join previous speakers in welcoming yesterday's announcement that Hewlett Packard is to create 500 new jobs.  However, the fact is that some 500 people are being made redundant every 12 hours.  While yesterday's announcement is welcome, against the background of 500 jobs being lost every 12 hours, these new jobs represent a mere drop in the ocean.We are beyond the point where blame for the scale of the economic crisis can be apportioned to those who over-egged the pudding in respect of the construction sector and turned our country into a grey as opposed to a green Ireland.  Wherever one goes, one will come across buildings and construction sites that are becoming derelict.  What is required is quick and systematic action.  However, we have not seen signs of such action as yet.  This matter was debated in the House last October.  In the interim, there has been no coherent or discernible strategy for getting people back to work or ensuring that they retain their existing jobs.  During the period in question, almost 100,000 individuals have joined the live register.Our first action must be to address the crisis faced by businesses if we are to stem the job losses that are costing the Exchequer an enormous amount of money on a daily basis.  Despite the State guaranteeing the major financial institutions, it is an open secret that the banks are not playing their part for the good of the Irish economy.  It appears they have shored up their own balance sheets, while ruthlessly cutting people's overdrafts and their access to cash.  This type of behaviour is very damaging for small to medium enterprises that are extremely dependent on cash flows and their ability to borrow even relatively small amounts of money.  Members have all heard evidence, some of it anecdotal in nature, of the refusal on the part of banks to provide people with even modest loans.  The unfortunate outcome is that when a small or medium enterprise is obliged to close down, five, ten or 50 people are obliged to join the dole queue.  The Government must ensure that the banks taxpayers now own provide money in order that jobs can be retained or created.We must offer real opportunities to those who were recently made redundant.  In order to do this we must reform the social welfare system.  Anyone who lost a job in recent months should be offered immediate access to training or re-education opportunities or — depending on their skills and ability and whether it is their choice — to enterprise schemes in order that they might start up their own businesses if they so desire.  This can be achieved if the will to do it exists.Community employment schemes must be revamped.  Almost all previous speakers and everyone to whom I spoke in recent days indicated that there is nothing to be gained from people being on social welfare when they could be doing something constructive and productive.  Community employment schemes cost relatively little if they are run properly.  Overall they would be of great value to communities because people's dignity would be restored by virtue of the fact that they would have something useful to do.  I am aware of an individual in my constituency who was doing extremely good work with teenagers at a boxing club but who was refused an extension in respect of the scheme he was on.  That person is now on the live register but he would have loved to continue doing useful work for himself and his community.I have been in contact with agencies such as Age Action and Energy Action which are concerned that they may be obliged to reduce their services.  If that were to happen, it would be a disaster.  Why can we not place the tens of thousands of construction workers who are on the dole on community employment schemes designed to upgrade local authority and senior citizen housing?  Elderly people living alone often require small maintenance jobs to be carried out.  Why can we not engage people to carry out those jobs rather than obliging them to remain on jobseeker's benefit or allowance?There are many people who have graduated from college but who cannot obtain employment in their chosen professions.  The State invested an enormous amount of money in training and educating these people but they are now unemployed.  I refer to physiotherapists, occupational therapists, engineers, architects, etc.  There is a major demand among elderly people for the services of physiotherapists, and schools and hospitals are crying out for speech therapists and occupational therapists.  Why is it not possible to employ some of these people in the areas to which I refer in order that they might use their skills and remain in touch with their professions?  If they were so employed, there would not be a need to retrain or up-skill them at a later date.  There is a need for these people's services and action should be taken in order that they might be in a position to provide them.The Labour Party has been criticised on a regular basis for not putting forward ideas.  My colleagues and I have put forward many ideas in respect of this motion and we hope that they will be taken on board.
#SeanSherlock	Labour	13244	Cork East	speech	unkown-language	2009-03-11 00:00:00	Prelude	426	I wish to provide an example of one of the ways in which we might assist people who have recently become unemployed.  I refer to the provision of State-backed loans to allow people to return to postgraduate education.  A number of months ago I was contacted by a friend of mine who resides in the west.  The man in question graduated from UCG in the mid-1990s and has since worked as a design engineer for a blue chip company.  He is highly qualified but he was made redundant because the American company for which he was working filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy.  After 12 years, my friend was offered a statutory redundancy package.  He now proposes to embark on an MBA programme but in order to do so he will be obliged to put up €16,000 from his own savings.  When one considers that he is getting married later in the year, there is no doubt this is quite an amount of money.He approached his local county council, the local enterprise board and FÁS but he was turned down by each for funding to assist him to retrain and up-skill so that when things get better he could return to the jobs market.  If that person was provided with a loan from the State, specifically for postgraduate studies, he told me he would be more than willing to draw it down if he could repay it as soon as he re-enters the workforce.  He would be willing to pay an administrative fee and even a low rate of interest on the loan.  I see the logic of his suggestion.  If we can fund the banks to the tune of €7 billion, I do not understand why we cannot direct those banks to provide lending for people in such circumstances.  They cannot pay exorbitant postgraduate fees at present because every cent they have must go on keeping life and limb together.  The money they have is real income that will be used, in this person's case, for survival and to keep food on the table.There must be lateral thinking about where we are going.  The old paradigms relating to how we allocated resources and money have gone out the window.  There is an opportunity now to come up with radical proposals.  Let us not be afraid to embrace radical proposals on how to get back on our feet.  If the person I mentioned was given that assistance, he would not squander it.  Everything he has done has been achieved through hard work.  That is, generally, the nature of the Irish psyche.  Nobody wants anything for free and if they can get some form of assistance, they are willing to pay for it if it is given in an equitable fashion.The Governor of the Central Bank addressed the economic regulatory affairs committee yesterday.  He said the country's competitiveness has been on the wane for some time.  If this Government intends to put forward a budget shortly, it must examine the issue of competitiveness and the cost of employing people in the current environment.  Employers' PRSI must be changed in some way to make it easier for employers to retain employees.  The Government must deal with this in its deliberations on the budget.
#JanOSullivan	unknown-#JanOSullivan-party	unknown-#JanOSullivan-dob	unknown-#JanOSullivan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-03-11 00:00:00	Prelude	427	My colleagues welcomed the announcement of extra jobs at Hewlett-Packard.  I welcome them too but, unfortunately, my constituency is about to lose 1,800 jobs in Dell and many more jobs in ancillary companies.  As Deputy Upton pointed out, the number of jobs created in Hewlett-Packard is the same as the number of jobs being lost every 12 hours.  We are in an extraordinarily serious situation.I am sorry the Minister of State, Deputy Kelleher, is not present as he might have been able to answer a question for me.  The EU globalisation training fund is available for Dell workers.  The fund was set up by the EU to compensate and provide training opportunities for workers who are losing their jobs due to displacement as a result of globalisation.  I have raised this matter twice with the Minister, Deputy Coughlan, but I was told that no application has been made for the fund.  The reason given is that the redundancy notices have not been sent to the Dell workers.  However, I have spoken to some of those workers and the redundancy letters went out to them over a week ago.  I seek a Government response on this important issue.  That fund is needed now.  The first group of workers will leave their jobs in April, so I urge the Government to apply immediately for the fund.  Funds from that fund have been provided to other European countries for job losses.I support the point made by Deputy Wall.  The Department of Social and Family Affairs has allocated extra staff to social welfare offices but the Department of Health and Children has not provided extra community welfare officers or extra support in community welfare offices.  Those officers are under huge pressure to deal with the number of people coming to their offices.  While awaiting decisions from social welfare officers, people must go to community welfare officers to get short-term payments, mortgage interest relief and the other payments to which they are entitled.  There appears to be no money in the Department of Health and Children.I made the point in the debate on health yesterday that while the Government has provided funding to the Department of Social and Family Affairs to address shortcomings arising as a result of the jobs situation, there does not appear to be any funding allocated from other Departments to the Department of Health and Children to address the issues that arise directly in that Department.  An extra €170 million, for example, will have to be found to provide for medical cards, while €100 million will be forgone from the health levy.  That burden should be borne across Departments.  I strongly support Deputy Wall regarding the problems people are encountering when they go to community welfare officers.There are many issues confronting people who must, for the first time, apply to the State for support in these difficult times.  I met a person today who had taken out insurance on his car loan to ensure that if he ever became unemployed, he could defer the payment of the loan.  He was signing on at the social welfare office but the staff at the office told him they could not stamp the form because they had not yet decided his claim.  He went to the community welfare officer but was told they could not stamp the form because his wife was working so he did not qualify for supplementary welfare.  Despite the fact that this man has paid for this insurance, he cannot get it because the system will not facilitate him.  It is an example, among others given by my colleagues, of the lack of humanity in dealing with the problems people face when they are unemployed for the first time.  These people really do not know how to deal with the system.  We must address the practical problems they face.The Oireachtas Library provides a very good research service.  It circulated a document to Members on the social and economic indicators for February.  That document has a section on exports.  It is estimated that Ireland's exports in 2008 amounted to €148.4 billion, which represents a fall of €3.9 billion compared to 2007.  Obviously, this is a huge area of potential for job creation and, unfortunately, job losses.  Some sectors are particularly strong, such as chemicals and pharmaceuticals, but the agrifood sector has decreased from €7.3 billion in 2007 to €6.8 billion in 2008, a loss of 6.4%.  We must build on our strengths and one of them is surely our reputation as a food producer.  Exports of beverages have decreased by 19.6%.We hear a great deal about the Green Party and it policies, and the Minister of State with responsibility for food is from the Green Party.  I have not heard a word from him about this issue.  Surely to goodness we should not be losing export trade in the agrifood industry, of all sectors.  I call on the Minister of State with responsibility for food to come forward with proposals on how we can produce more food and value added food products.  In the supermarket one can see vegetables for sale that have been imported from halfway around the world.  It must be possible for the Minister to produce some suggestions for this sector.There are many other areas that could be developed, such as campus companies.  There is much potential for such companies to develop and provide job opportunities.  There are also local stimulus plans.  There is a regeneration programme in Limerick which I believe is a local stimulus plan.  There should be others throughout the country.  We have many suggestions which we would love to see implemented.
#SeanHaughey	unknown-#SeanHaughey-party	unknown-#SeanHaughey-dob	unknown-#SeanHaughey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-03-11 00:00:00	Prelude	428	Several of the ideas contained in this evening's Private Members' motion from the Opposition are interesting and worth further exploration.  Over the past two evenings we have heard from the Tánaiste, Ministers and Deputies about the Government's very real commitment to address the current rising unemployment problem and to take the necessary remedial actions to secure the country's economic and social well-being.  However, we should also acknowledge that our present economic crisis is being replicated throughout the world.  We are not the only country to be suffering from a major contraction in the public finances and a significant increase in unemployment levels.  If we look to our neighbours in the European Union and the United States, we can see that they too are struggling with the same issues we face.I acknowledge that the scale of our current unemployment problem with approximately 355,000 people on the live register represents a daunting challenge.  However, we can overcome it and we will.  I am confident the Government will steer Ireland through our present difficulties and place us firmly on the road to recovery.  I accept it will be a difficult and lengthy journey.  Early next month on 7 April, the Government will introduce a supplementary budget to the House.  The budget will contain difficult decisions that will be necessary to get the public finances back on track.  The Government will take those decisions, as they will be in the long-term interests of the country.The current unemployment situation will inform the Government's thinking in regard to the supplementary budget.  The Government is acutely aware of the harsh economic realities facing the individuals and families who are now depending on the social supports they receive from being on the live register.  We are committed to providing every assistance to these individuals to enable them to get back into employment as soon as possible.The House heard yesterday and again this evening of the numerous measures and initiatives that are currently in place, which are specifically designed to assist people who are now unemployed.  Given the scale of the problem we have expanded the available supports and we will continue to examine how we can further improve the services to assist the unemployed.  The Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, the Department of Education and Science and the Department of Social and Family Affairs are all working closely to respond to the economic situation.  Together, they are ensuring that appropriate responses are developed and put in place to meet the up-skilling needs of those who are losing their jobs or facing uncertain employment prospects.By working closely together the Departments have already identified opportunities for increased collaboration between the institutes of technology, the vocational education colleges and FÁS.  Given the current economic circumstances it is important that we ensure we are maximising our substantial investment in our education and training system.  By doing so we can leverage increased supports to enable us to respond to the increasing numbers of unemployed.As Minister of State at the Department of Education and Science and the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, with responsibility for lifelong learning, I can say that co-operation between the two Departments on the delivery of education and training has never been better.  The two Departments are working closely together on employment activation.

This investment will provide Ireland with competitive advantage in the area of skills, which will be critical to our future success.I also wish to outline to the House what is happening in regard to the further education sector.  We will continue to provide supports under my Department's further education sector.  Over the past 12 years we have made significant progress in expanding the provision of further education, culminating in an investment of €414 million last year, which was a 400% increase on the equivalent 1997 figure.  That increased investment allowed 145,000 learners to receive education and training last year.

#LizMcManus	unknown-#LizMcManus-party	unknown-#LizMcManus-dob	unknown-#LizMcManus-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-03-11 00:00:00	Prelude	438	Losing one's job is like having a bereavement.  The impact can be as devastating and yet the individual is expected to carry on as normal even when the times we live in are anything but normal.  The global and national economic crisis means that those in work are fearful for their future and those out of work have nowhere to turn.  The Labour Party has tabled this motion in support of the thousands of people who find themselves unnerved, undermined and unemployed.It is disturbing that the Government response is so inadequate. The commitment to ensuring the dignity of jobseekers rings particularly hollow.  Even at the simplest level people who lose their jobs end up waiting, often for weeks, to have their applications processed.  That delay can lead to added hardship because a local authority may not process a reduction in rent, for example, until the claim is processed.That is not to be taken as any criticism of the staff in social welfare offices who are valiantly trying to keep up with the tsunami of applications.  In one unemployment office with which I am familiar the transformation has been shocking.  In August 2007 there were 1,768 people on the live register in Bray and there were approximately 20 staff.  In March 2009 there are now 4,308 people on the live register and an additional 1,300 lone parents claims are dealt with in the local office, which used to be dealt with centrally.  That means that in 17 months we have seen a 214% increase in activity with only a 35% increase in staffing.  While new people arrive there is a massive backlog of approximately 1,000 unemployment claims to tackle.Each one of those statistics is a person with a family affected and often with dependants to support.  They are young and old, women and men, professional, unskilled and semi-skilled.  On average, each one costs the State at least €20,000 to support.  Tinkering around with FÁS training initiatives is not enough.  Every organ of the State should be directed towards job retention and creation.  State funding needs to be directed strategically to keep people at work.  Every local authority should be involved in carrying out a building programme including improvements for elderly and disabled people, and in building social housing.  There should be a countrywide, comprehensive, energy efficiency retrofitting scheme.  In previous recessions Labour Party Ministers had a good record of major council house building.  Now we have an even more skilled and experienced cohort of construction workers willing and able to work and they are spending their time in line outside their dole office instead of on-site and building for the people.Every project in the national development plan should be subject to a rigorous assessment both for its capability to keep people at work and for its value in national terms to the economy.  For example, will the building of the metro ensure the jobs we want and the infrastructural benefit we need?  Maybe or maybe not, but we do know ,without any doubt, that investment in educational facilities from primary and even pre-school up to tertiary will bring a return in both jobs and societal value.  There is an urgent need for a serious jobs strategy, as Deputy Shortall has sought, but we are still waiting for the Government to come up with one.  Why is that the case when the problem is becoming so acute?
#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-03-11 00:00:00	Prelude	439	I have been very taken aback by the fatalism about unemployment that the Taoiseach, Deputy Brian Cowen, and his Government have continuously displayed.  We know the Government greeted the collapse of the building bubble with disbelief.  We saw it handle the banking crisis in a way that was inept.  We cannot allow the Government to approach unemployment in the same disastrous "know-nothing" way.This June and September thousands of young people will leave college as newly qualified graduates.  At the same time, many thousands more, particularly young men, will leave school hoping to get an apprenticeship.  These young people are the best and the brightest and signing on the dole should not be an option for them.I challenge the Government to develop new and innovative programmes to get such people into real work, traineeships, internships and apprenticeships.  I want the Government to set targets for how many teaching and arts graduates for whom we can gainfully create traineeships and graduate internships in primary, secondary, third level and adult education.  If the Government does nothing and people simply sign on, this will, at a crude economic level, cost the Government €200 per person per week.  However, it will also cost the dreams and aspirations of a new generation that should be required to contribute productively to the country.Professor Tom Collins in Maynooth recently sketched out the bones of such a scheme for the primary sector.  This is what I call positive thinking.  Properly done, we could persuade the European Union that this kind of scheme should receive the equivalent of European Social Fund support as part of one of the programme of measures that will kick-start the European economy, not least in Ireland.  However, with Fianna Fáil now hanging around the European liberals in Europe, I doubt we will hear of any positive job creation in Fianna Fáil's programme for Europe.If we could do this for teachers and for the education sector in general, we could then address it to disciplines such as architecture, law and business.  The skills of graduates in these areas could be utilised not just in the commercial sector, but in local authorities, community and voluntary organisations.  People taking part in such schemes would be required, as a condition of participation, to continue their education to further appropriate levels, be that apprentice qualifications or, in the case of graduates, a masters' qualification.The Government needs to think outside the box to give a sense of hope and purpose to people who are already unemployed or graduates, many of whom feel they have not much reason to graduate.  I speak about this with some confidence because in 1993-94, as Minister of State in the Department of Social Welfare dealing with poverty and unemployment issues, I helped to pioneer a series of back-to-work and work schemes.  Up to then, for example, students got the dole in summer time.  However, following the introduction of the schemes we created, student summer schemes provided many students with gainful and interesting employment in their local GAA clubs, community centres or elsewhere.  I remember sitting down with combined students unions that protested that as students they wanted to retain the dole.  However, the dole should not be a lifestyle option for anybody, least of all well educated students.Last week, I and other Deputies met staff from SR Technics.  These are highly skilled workers and apprentices most countries would kill to have, yet the Government seems entirely uncertain of how to create pathways from redundancy for them.  Our universities and institutes of technology must be challenged to start making themselves seriously attractive to people who have become unemployed.  So far, access programmes have been tinkering around the edges in terms of numbers.  If this is a national emergency and if the Taoiseach's numbers on unemployment are correct, then third level colleges must use their tremendous resources for the common good.A traditional FÁS course will not necessarily do the trick this time round.  In any event, FÁS as an organisation, like our banks, has problems that run so deep that it would be unwise to put all our hopes for up-skilling, training and re-education into that particular basket.  We should let our third level colleges compete and if FÁS can compete with a better offer, well and good.  The biggest bottleneck currently is that to avail of most Government schemes, people must first be registered unemployed for quite a long period.  The Government must create initiatives that will prevent people going on the dole in the first place.  It is a hopeless Government, but must it keep acting hopelessly towards the unemployed?
#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-03-11 00:00:00	Prelude	440	I thank all Members who contributed to the discussion and compliment Deputies Róisín Shortall and Willie Penrose on bringing the motion to the House.  I am extremely disappointed by the Government's response to the motion.  The amendment proposed by it is defensive, self-congratulatory and argues for business as usual.The Government is abandoning the unemployed.  In much of the commentary about our current economic circumstances, there has been little or no attention or consideration given to those losing their jobs.  We all agree that the solution for people losing their jobs is to get new jobs and back into employment as soon as possible.  However, while people who have lost their jobs are waiting for their new jobs to turn up, they must live and have an income.  They must have something to do every day and must have the sense there is a future for them.The Labour Party motion sets out eight specific measures to deal with the immediate needs of people who become unemployed.  The Taoiseach acknowledged last week that the number of people likely to be unemployed here may be 450,000 or more by the end of this year.  That is a significant number of people with immediate needs.  We propose that they be treated with dignity at social welfare offices and with respect when they turn up to a community welfare officer seeking assistance.  We want an understanding of needs and to ensure that measures are put in place to provide them with something to do and the opportunity to improve themselves while unemployed.  They must be provided with opportunities that give them a sense of hope while they are waiting for new employment.Unfortunately, however, what we got from the Government yesterday and this evening was the sense that it does not really grasp the scale of what is happening or realise the huge numbers of people becoming unemployed with real needs.  For example, the Minister of State at the Department of Education and Science spoke this evening about the moneys the Government has provided for further education.  He is missing the point.  In 2004, the Government put a cap on the number of people who could go into further education colleges or post-leaving certificate courses.The year 2004 was the height of our economic boom and full employment.  It was understandable then for the Government to decide it did not want people doing post-leaving certificate courses when they could well join the workforce.  We are in a different situation now.  The cap on those places should be lifted immediately so that people becoming unemployed can get educational opportunities.  We should use the infrastructure that exists to provide them.Let me put the problem in practical terms for the Minister of State.  In my constituency, the social welfare office or unemployment exchange is located in Cumberland Street.  Like at many social welfare offices and employment exchanges, I have seen many unemployed people go to that office for the first time over the past few months.  I have seen them queuing in the rain along Cumberland Street.The Dún Laoghaire College of Further Education is just behind that office and it is capable of providing courses for many of the people going into the social welfare office.  Next September, young people just leaving school will go to the social welfare office.  They will never have had a job, will not be able to get a job and will claim unemployment or jobseeker's payments.  Would it not be better for those young people to simply go round the back of that office to the college to do a course?  That would be better for them and their families.  It would also be less expensive for the State.  They would be doing a course for which at most they would qualify for a student grant, rather than being supported by unemployment payments for doing nothing.  It would be better for them to have something useful to do, pursue a course and be better equipped to take up employment opportunities in the future.The Government will have to break out of the straitjacket it is in regarding its thinking on the unemployed, the social services and the education services.  It should put the pieces together and ensure there are services, educational opportunities and a new way to deal with a new and growing wave of unemployment that will be with us for at least some time until the economy improves and employment is provided.
#JamesBannon	unknown-#JamesBannon-party	unknown-#JamesBannon-dob	unknown-#JamesBannon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-03-11 00:00:00	Prelude	441	I thank the Ceann Comhairle for affording me time to address this important matter, namely the views of the Minister for Finance on the desirability of all sections of the public service, including the Judiciary, developing policies and plans for cost-saving measures in the current economic climate.  The need to bring this matter before the House is driven by the series of knee-jerk reactions by the Government in response to the financial downturn, which totally lack cohesion, and by public concern at the perceived inequity.The remedial actions currently taken by the Government lack equity as they bypass the upper levels, including the President and the Judiciary, and leave the lower and middle income sectors to bear the brunt of the Government's pension levy.  I have already raised under Standing Order 32 the issue of the exemption of judges from the payment of the pension levy.  Although this exemption appears to be justified under Article 35 of Bunreacht na hÉireann, it is open to debate.  Such a levy could be said to be a form of taxation and the imposition of same may not in fact contravene the constitutional safeguard of remuneration, as judges do pay tax.  The pension levy has created a social divide which will not be bridged easily.  Judges are entitled to quote Article 35 of Bunreacht na hÉireann with regard to their remuneration.  However, the Constitution was never meant to be a veil for the Judiciary or anyone else.  It must be guarded and nobody should hide behind it.  The Judiciary and the Government would be well advised to focus on the preamble of the Constitution which places the power firmly in the hands of the people.As members of the Judiciary well know, no one is above the law.  Likewise, in these extraordinary times no one should be above making sacrifices for the well-being of their country.  If nothing else, noblesse oblige should impel our judges to make a voluntary contribution.  It is a question of perspective.  Why should those who are struggling to make ends meet see the Judiciary, who are at the top of the public service payscale, escaping the payment of this levy?The Minister chose to ignore calls from the Opposition not to include an exemption for the Judiciary in the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest Act which introduced the pension levy, thus enshrining it in law.  I am puzzled as to why this had to be and why he chose to copper-fasten the exemption.  Article 36 of Bunreacht na hÉireann allows the regulation of matters pertaining to judges, including remuneration and pensions, in accordance with the law, which is where a fresh look at this issue of the pension levy legislation could have made a difference.The term "remuneration", in general as well as in the context of employment law, covers more than salary and includes any benefits which are conferred on an employee in the course of his or her employment.  Nonetheless, it is still within the Minister's gift to turn his attention to cost cutting measures in the Judiciary under section 8(3) of the Court Services Act 1998, which states that "the Service shall, if so requested by the Minister, furnish to the Minister such information as the Minister may request relating to a number of matters."  This subsection envisages the provision of information other than, or in addition to, that contained in the annual report.  In this context, the Minister may request information in respect of any or all of the categories listed in the subsection.I am calling on the Minister to seek parity for low and middle income earners by requesting the Judiciary to furnish details of cost-cutting measures in line with those of other public sector workers.
#MaryWallace	unknown-#MaryWallace-party	unknown-#MaryWallace-dob	unknown-#MaryWallace-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-03-11 00:00:00	Prelude	442	I am speaking in this debate on behalf of the Minister for Finance, and I thank the Deputy for raising this issue.The drive to secure savings and efficiencies across all areas of the public service is now well advanced, and this process has been under way for some considerable time.  Even before the full extent of this unprecedented downturn in public finances became apparent, the Government was publicly committed to an ongoing programme of streamlining public expenditure.  In his 2008 budget statement, the then Tánaiste and Minister for Finance, Deputy Brian Cowen, announced an efficiency review of all administrative spending across the whole public service.  The Minister indicated that particular areas of interest included possible inefficiencies due to the multiplicity of boards and agencies, the need for better sharing of certain services, and efficiencies in management, travel and consumables in general.In July 2008, his successor as Minister for Finance, Deputy Brian Lenihan, announced a range of efficiency and savings measures, including those identified as a result of the budget day efficiency review.  Among the other measures were a reduction in the payroll bill of 3% for all Departments, State agencies and local authorities, other than health and education, by the end of 2009; a significant reduction in expenditure on consultancies, advertising and public relations by Departments and agencies in 2008 and a minimum 50% decrease in 2009.  The above measures were designed to minimise the effects on users of services in the areas of health, education and social welfare and were estimated to deliver savings of €440 million in 2008 and €1 billion in 2009.In addition to the above savings, the Minister instigated a review of agencies to determine whether they could share services, whether it would be appropriate to absorb some of their functions back into their parent Departments, or whether some agencies should be amalgamated or abolished.  In the 2009 budget, the Minister for Finance announced 30 rationalisation decisions that will reduce the number of State agencies by 41.  At the moment, nine of the 30 rationalisation decisions have been implemented, covering nine State agencies and the closure of the four Army barracks.  Legislation to give effect to the remaining decisions is in preparation.The continued fall in economic activity entering 2009 has meant that, even with these savings, the fiscal position has continued to deteriorate, which led the Government to announce further measures in February.  These further savings are estimated to achieve up to €1.8 billion in 2009 or €2 billion in a full year.  While further efficiency and capital savings were announced, the main element of this package of measures was the introduction of public service pension-related deduction.  The principle behind the public service pension-related deduction is that it should apply across the public service.  This is based on the need to reduce the public service pay bill and is also in recognition of the pension benefits enjoyed by public servants.One category to which the deduction does not apply is the Judiciary.  Our Constitution is quite clear on this.  Article 35.5 expressly states, "The remuneration of a judge shall not be reduced during his continuance in office."  We have legal advice confirming that the pension-related deduction should not be applied to the Judiciary.  Of course, the pension-related deduction is not the only action that the Government has taken to contain and reduce public service pay costs.  The increases under the review and transitional agreement for 2008-09 are not being paid, which will lead to further savings of up to €1 billion next year.The measures outlined above show the determination of the Government to restore balance to the public finances in the face of a continued international economic slowdown.  The Taoiseach today announced the Government's intention to present a supplementary budget to the House on April 7.  This supplementary budget will continue the process of adjustment begun by the earlier savings measures, as this is the only way to ensure the future fiscal stability and economic prosperity of this country.
#MaryORourke	unknown-#MaryORourke-party	unknown-#MaryORourke-dob	unknown-#MaryORourke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-03-11 00:00:00	Prelude	443	I thank the Minister of State for being here this evening from the Department of Health and Children.   I was moved to put down this motion on the Adjournment due to the sad tale which I read in a letter sent to me yesterday.  It was about a 16 year old girl who is suffering from severe scoliosis, which is a curvature of the spine.  She has been to her local doctor and her consultant in Crumlin Hospital.  He works in that hospital and in the Blackrock Clinic.  The parents were told that her curvature was above 45 degrees and that she would need surgery as the curve progresses with time.  The consultant carried out a full day of tests on her and the parents were informed that it would take up to 18 months for this girl to have her operation through the public system, and a similar length of time in the private system.The parents, the consultant and her local doctor feel that this should not be the case.  She is a young girl and has been very active in athletics.  She was into gymnastics, basketball, Gaelic football and has national medals in trampolining.  She is now in transition year at school.  At her age, the curvature develops very rapidly and the young girl could find herself misshapen.  The operation in question would be much more difficult at a later stage than if it were done now.I put down this matter without much hope that it would be taken on the Adjournment, but I ask the Minister of State to convey the following urgent message.  Any young person diagnosed with severe scoliosis should have his or her operation carried out with the least delay possible.  I hope that in replying, the Minister of State will be able to provide a positive direction for this young girl.
#MaryWallace	unknown-#MaryWallace-party	unknown-#MaryWallace-dob	unknown-#MaryWallace-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-03-11 00:00:00	Prelude	444	I will be taking the Adjournment matter on behalf of the Minister for Health and Children.Our Lady's Children's Hospital in Crumlin is Ireland's largest paediatric hospital and provides a wide range of secondary and tertiary paediatric care.  I have read the details of this case as supplied and I share the Deputy's wish that treatment be made available as soon as possible, either at Crumlin or by arrangement with another provider, possibly through the National Treatment Purchase Fund.  However, it would not be appropriate for me to discuss the specific circumstances of the case, the details of which have been brought to the attention of the HSE by the Department, as a result of the Deputy raising the matter with us today.The HSE is in discussion with the hospital authorities about the capacity of the hospital to provide surgery for a number of children with a similar condition.  The hospital has the necessary theatre capacity to undertake additional procedures, but an issue has arisen with regard to the provision of anaesthetic cover.  The HSE is to meet shortly with the three Dublin paediatric hospitals to explore the potential for resolving this issue.  This is a welcome initiative, as we must make every effort to maximise all available resources for the benefit of the children concerned.The specific circumstance of this case have been brought to the attention of the HSE by the Department, as a result of Deputy O'Rourke raising the matter with us today.
#NiallBlaneyIND	unknown-#NiallBlaneyIND-party	unknown-#NiallBlaneyIND-dob	unknown-#NiallBlaneyIND-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-03-11 00:00:00	Prelude	445	In light of recent killings in Northern Ireland and the spate of robberies along the Border, especially in my constituency of Donegal North-East, I call on the Minister to request the Garda Commissioner to review Garda numbers along the Border.  It is especially pertinent at this time because in my constituency and in a number of regions along the Border there has been an increase in the number of robberies in recent months.  Even in recent weeks in my own constituency and in the other constituency in Donegal, namely Donegal South-West, there has been a very significant increase in the spate of robberies.  While I recognise that there have been breakthroughs by the Garda Síochána, I fear dissident activities are taking place which may have fuelled the incidents or funded some of the dissident organisations, which we have seen carry out scurrilous work in Northern Ireland.  I refer to the three killings of the past number of days.In some weeks time as co-chair of the British-Irish Parliamentary Assembly I will host a plenary conference in Donegal.  There are immediate concerns related to security matters.  Only this evening I spoke with the other co-chair, Mr. Peter Hain, MP, who will attend along with a number of other Members of Parliament.  There is concern about recent events and it is something we must review to ensure security is stepped up.  Of late there have been several post office robberies along the Border, affecting such areas as Carrigans, Muff, Bridgend and Newtowncunningham.  Shops, bookmakers and small businesses are under pressure.  Many people are living in fear whether their business is a post office, a shop or a bookmaker's.  The situation is causing undue hardship.  Some people are wondering if they are safe in continuing their business or if they would be better off wrapping it up.  Such people are somewhat insecure at present.Since the Good Friday Agreement there has been a step down in the number of gardaí directly along the Border, although not throughout Donegal.  The Minister should contact the Garda Commissioner with a view to having security along the Border reviewed, especially in my constituency of Donegal North-East.  I seek such a review and a situation whereby the Garda Commissioner is comfortable with the presence of gardaí directly along the Border.  If there was a proper presence in this area, there would be less illegal activity.There is a possibility of dissident involvement in fuel laundering along the Border.  I am especially concerned about such activity in my constituency.  I believe that some public houses are possibly owned by dissidents.  We must take a hard look at all those in business, their background and from where they have come.  We must be smarter about dealing with security along the Border.I recognise the good work of the Garda in Donegal.  I am aware of the extent of the co-operation between the Garda and the PSNI, the Police Service of Northern Ireland.  I am also aware that one member of the PSNI is currently transferred to a station in Letterkenny.  Such activity and work of the Garda are to be welcomed.  However, the presence of gardaí directly along the Border must be stepped up.  I urge the Minister to meet the Garda Commissioner and request him to review the situation and provide the House with an update.
#MaryWallace	unknown-#MaryWallace-party	unknown-#MaryWallace-dob	unknown-#MaryWallace-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-03-11 00:00:00	Prelude	446	I thank Deputy Blaney for raising the matter of the tragic events of the past few days in Northern Ireland.  I add my voice to that of the Taoiseach and the other Members of the House who spoke in support of today's all-party motion condemning these killings and expressing deep sympathy for the families of the victims.The Garda Síochána is in very close contact with the Police Service of Northern Ireland and co-operation, both in terms of pursuing those responsible and seeking to prevent any further incidents, remains at the highest level.  The Chief Constable has publicly recognised the excellent co-operation between the two forces.  The Garda Commissioner and Chief Constable will meet on Thursday to discuss the latest developments in these cases and our continuing response to them.  The Minister and Garda Commissioner have been very conscious of the threat posed by dissidents and that is why, despite the political progress in the North, the Garda has continued to deploy extensive resources targeting dissident activities.  It should be noted by the House that despite the political progress in recent years we have retained the full legislative armoury for dealing with terrorist groups.The harsh reality is that it does not take a large group of people, or significant resources, to engage in this type of activity.  Nor, in the short term at any rate, do they require any significant level of support in the community.  The House can be assured that the Government remains determined that the peace process will not be jeopardised by the actions of a small minority.  The Minister has been informed by the Garda Commissioner that on 31 January 2009, the latest date for which figures are readily available, the personnel strength of the Garda divisions in the border areas to which Deputy Blaney referred was as follows: Donegal, 485; Cavan-Monaghan, 416; Sligo-Leitrim, 323; and Louth, 295.  These divisional strengths are augmented by the resources available to regional and national units, for example, the National Bureau of Criminal Investigation, the Garda National Drugs Unit, the Criminal Assets Bureau, etc., as and when required.The Minister is also informed that local Garda management, through ongoing monitoring and analysis of crime trends, is aware of the other issues being raised by Deputy Blaney and the Garda Síochána has put the following measures in place to prevent, reduce and detect such incidents: additional patrols by uniformed and plain-clothes personnel; redeployment of resources, to assist in the identification of suspected offenders for these offences; the dissemination of crime prevention advice to the local community using local media, including radio and newspapers; and local senior Garda management meetings with representatives of the local communities to apprise them of ongoing efforts and initiatives targeting this type of criminality, including appealing to the community to report any information on suspicious activity occurring in the area to the Garda Síochána.  Liaison has been established and is being maintained with the Police Service of Northern Ireland to establish similar crime trends in that jurisdiction, which may assist in identifying suspects for these incidents.A divisional crime manager has also been appointed in each Garda division to assist in the monitoring and analysing of crime trends in conjunction with the divisional officer and divisional detective inspector to prepare specific initiatives and operations to target specific crime types.  Given the geographical location, there are significant levels of ongoing cross-Border co-operation with the Police Service of Northern Ireland in identifying crime trends and possible suspected offenders for crimes in both jurisdictions.  Border superintendents attend bi-monthly crime meetings at various locations, including Garda headquarters.  At local level, cross-Border crime meetings are held on a monthly basis with regular, sometimes daily, interactions regarding individual incidents and other criminal activity.In addition, the Garda Síochána Acts of 2005 and 2007 provided for police co-operation between the two police forces.  The protocols signed between the Commissioner of the Garda Síochána and the Chief Constable of the PSNl, allowed members of the Garda Síochána and members of the PSNl to take part in exchange programmes in each other's jurisdiction.  The areas where exchanges take place have been expanded into the operational field, where the development of understanding and networks between the North and here could be most beneficial.  To this end exchanges have been expanded to district community policing units, divisional drug units, divisional traffic units, divisional crime units and district detective units.  This expansion commenced in the Border divisions, namely, Louth-Meath, Cavan-Monaghan, Sligo-Leitrim and Donegal.The Minister wishes to assure Deputy Blaney that both he and the Garda authorities are committed to providing the resources necessary to tackle crime.  The allocation of personnel by the Commissioner is determined by a number of factors including population, crime trends and as the policing needs of each division dictates.  It is the responsibility of each Garda divisional officer to allocate personnel within his or her division.  Notwithstanding this, the level of Garda personnel assigned throughout the country, and overall policing arrangements and operational strategy, are continually monitored and reviewed.  Such monitoring ensures optimum use is made of Garda resources and the best possible Garda service is provided to the general public.  I thank Deputy Blaney for raising the issue of Garda numbers.
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	20450	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-03-11 00:00:00	Prelude	447	I regret the Minister of State in the Department of Education and Science, Deputy Haughey, is not present as he has a unique insight into Mount Temple Comprehensive School which is located in the constituency he and I represent.  Without wishing to denigrate the presence of the Minister of State, Deputy Wallace, I hope she will convey to the Minister my concerns about the school in question.Mount Temple Comprehensive School is a unique school on the north side of Dublin.  While it emerged from the Protestant tradition, it has always been much more than this, having fostered a broad pupil mix from the outset.  Members will be aware of the famous book by Christopher Nolan entitled, Under the Eye of the Clock.  Mr. Nolan, who was severely disabled, achieved tremendous things and the eye of the clock of the title refers to the clock tower in Mount Temple school where he was educated.  The school has always reached out to children with special needs and children who need a different type of education.  It is unashamedly different in its approach to providing education, for which it should be cherished and valued.Places in Mount Temple Comprehensive School are in huge demand, with three children waiting for every place.  Built originally to accommodate 450 pupils, the school currently has 850 students.  This expansion has only been possible by pressing into service preserved old buildings such as the manor house and using prefabricated buildings.  The school consists of a patchwork of seven buildings, none of which even remotely reaches acceptable standards in energy efficiency or in terms of the type of building one expects in a modern school.The tragedy in this case is that the school has been trapped for eight years in the labyrinth of the Department's building pipeline.  I defy anyone to explain to me how this pipeline works.  The Acting Chairman, Deputy Wall, may have experienced this process but it is the most mystifying system I have come across.  It appears to be designed to hand-trip schools which are making honest endeavours to provide for pupils rather than to facilitate the progression of building projects which have been recognised as needed.Several years ago, the Department acknowledged that the school needed to be completely rebuilt.  The school is located on an exceptional, wonderful and large site in the heart of the city.  With its preserved buildings and additional features, it is a unique asset which should be developed.  It is particularly galling for the school to see the charmed approach the Department has taken to a squash facility with a small membership which happened to be built on the same land as the school and has, over the past 15 years, probably received €1 million in support to keep it going.  Meanwhile, a school with 850 pupils is struggling to survive.What are the next steps in the building project?  What timeframe can one reasonably expect for completion of each phase?  Is it a question of waiting for cash approval to enable projects to be released like a flood and inform us where we stand?  The process is frustrating for schools.  In this case, the school has committed to fund the statutory process and provide €1.5 million towards the cost of the new building.  There is major commitment behind the school, which is a unique educational facility.  As well as the traditional Protestant schools, all the Educate Together schools in the local area feed into Mount Temple.  Its special worth should be recognised by the Department.
#MaryWallace	unknown-#MaryWallace-party	unknown-#MaryWallace-dob	unknown-#MaryWallace-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-03-11 00:00:00	Prelude	448	I thank Deputy Bruton for raising this important matter and I will endeavour to demystify the system and explain the steps taken as part of the building process.  This debate provides me with the opportunity to outline to the House the Department's strategy for capital investment in education projects and the current position with regard to the building project for Mount Temple Comprehensive School on the Malahide Road in Dublin 3.All applications for capital funding are assessed in the planning and building unit of the Department.  The assessment process determines the extent and type of need presenting based on the demographics of an area, proposed housing developments, condition of buildings, site capacity, etc.  This leads ultimately to an appropriate accommodation solution.  As part of this process, a project is assigned a band rating under published prioritisation criteria for large-scale building projects.  These criteria were devised following consultation with the education partners.To demystify the process, as requested by the Deputy, one must explain the band rating process as this helps establish the current position of a project.  Projects are selected for inclusion in the school building and modernisation programme on the basis of priority of need.  This is reflected in the band rating assigned to a project.  In other words, a proposed building project moves through the system commensurate with the band rating assigned to it.  There are four band ratings overall, of which band 1 is the highest and band 4 the lowest.  Band 1 projects, for example, include the provision of buildings where none currently exists but there is a high demand for pupil places, while a band 4 project provides for desirable but not necessarily urgent or essential facilities such as a library or new sports hall.  The building project for Mount Temple Comprehensive School has been assigned a band rating of 2.4 under these criteria.All major projects on the Department's capital programme progress through the same structured process of architectural planning, which is divided into clearly defined stages.  The stages of architectural planning are set out in the Department's design team procedures and are necessary to comply with Department of Finance guidelines which require that capital projects be fully designed prior to going to tender.  They also ensure proper cost management of capital projects and facilitate compliance with statutory and public procurement requirements.Deputy Bruton asked what are the next steps in the project for Mount Temple Comprehensive School.  There are five stages involved in the progression of major school projects through architectural planning.  The project for Mount Temple Comprehensive School is currently at the first stage of this process.A submission for the early stage of architectural planning was submitted to the Department in September 2008 and is under consideration.  The Department expects to respond to the school shortly with its comments on that submission.  Once the preliminary stage is approved, there are four remaining stages in architectural planning.  The next stage of the process is divided into stage 2a, which involves a developed sketch scheme for the project, and stage 2b, which brings the project to detailed design.  It is at this stage that a project has reached the point at which it can apply for planning permission.  Stage 3 of the process involves tendering the project and stage 4 sees construction start on site.  There are no timescales set for the completion of each of these stages.The Deputy also asked about the availability of cash.  The Government has dramatically increased investment in the schools building programme to €656 million this year.  This is an unprecedented level of capital investment which reflects the commitment of the Government to continue its programme of sustained investment in primary and post-primary schools.  It will underpin a particular emphasis on the delivery of additional school places in rapidly developing areas, while continuing to develop on the Government's commitment to delivering improvements in the quality of existing primary and post-primary accommodation throughout the country.More than 140 major projects are in architectural planning, including the project for Mount Temple Comprehensive School.  In addition, more than 100 projects are in construction or have been approved to proceed to tender and construction.  The progression of all large-scale building projects, including the project for Mount Temple Comprehensive School, from initial design stage through to construction is dependent on the prioritisation of competing demands on the funding available under the Department's capital budget.  The project in question will continue to be considered for progression in the context of the Department's multi-annual school building and modernisation programme.The allocation for school buildings in 2009 is €656 million.  This represents a significant investment in the school building and modernisation programme.  This level of funding for the building programme, at a time of great pressure on public finances, is a sign of the commitment of Government to investing in school infrastructure and will permit the continuation of progress in the overall improvement of school accommodation.I thank the Deputy again for giving me the opportunity to outline to the House how the Department intends to address the needs of Mount Temple Comprehensive School.  In light of current economic circumstances and with competing demands on the capital budget of the Department, it is not possible to give an indicative timeframe for the further progression of the project at this time.
#JohnGormley	unknown-#JohnGormley-party	unknown-#JohnGormley-dob	unknown-#JohnGormley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-03-11 00:00:00	Prelude	449	Since the publication of the National Climate Change Strategy 2007 — 2012, work has continued across Government Departments on the development of measures to reduce national greenhouse gas emissions.  Progress in implementing such measures, and the coordination of work across Government with respect to the climate change agenda is overseen by the Cabinet Committee on Climate Change and Energy Security.  That Committee has established two inter-departmental groups to support its work.   The Senior Officials Group is tasked with addressing the challenges posed to Ireland in achieving its greenhouse gas emission targets and informing and implementing policy in this regard, while the Technical Analysis Steering Group, which includes representatives from relevant agencies, provides the modelling expertise which underpins the analysis.  Subgroups of these Groups have been established on an ad-hoc basis to consider specific issues and to report to the two main Groups.  An informal Expert Advisory Panel has also been established by the Cabinet Committee to assist in the analysis of possible policy measures.In addition, the Joint Committee on Climate Change and Energy Security is also important in developing cross-party consensus both on targets and on the measures required to achieve them.Given that these structures are now in place, the potential for further added value from the establishment, at this stage, of a Commission on Climate Change remains under consideration.

In Budget 2009 the published expenditure provision for 2009 was €3,114m representing a reduction of 3% in overall expenditure by my Department. The reduction in overall expenditure has been brought about by a combination of efficiency savings and limited reductions applied to some spending provisions for 2009 in light of the present budgetary position.In regard to the operation of my Department, we are achieving savings and efficiencies in relation to payroll, energy efficiency in Departmental offices and in travel and subsistence costs.With regard to the programmes implemented by my Department, we are at all times seeking to maximize the outputs achieved from all financial resources. Measures include better prioritisation, streamlining procedures and a firm objective of achieving value for money.As announced recently, the Government has indicated in light of the further deterioration in the public finances that public expenditure provisions and revenue increasing measures will be reviewed in the coming weeks with a view to the introduction of a Supplementary Budget early next month. This is necessary to adhere to the planned Budgetary strategy for the current year.  Revised estimates will then be published which will show the full extent of the savings to be achieved by my Department.As Minister, I have at all times maintained a critical focus on the need for efficiency and effectiveness in the disbursement of all funding under my control. This focus on value for money extends to the local government sector where local councils must also seek and implement optimum efficiencies in the implementation of local programmes.
#JohnGormley	unknown-#JohnGormley-party	unknown-#JohnGormley-dob	unknown-#JohnGormley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-03-11 00:00:00	Prelude	451	Section 4 of the Local Government Act 1998 required that the Exchequer contribution to the Fund was to be increased annually in line with inflation as measured by the Consumer Price Index.  Section 17 of the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest Act 2009 amends this provision and provides that the annual exchequer contribution to be paid into the Local Government Fund is to be agreed between the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government and the Minister for Finance as part of the Estimates and Budgetary process.The Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest Act 2009 provides that the new pension-related deduction applies to local authority staff along with other public servants.  Local authorities will retain the full proceeds of the new pension-related deduction and the Exchequer contribution to the Fund is being reduced to take account of the deduction.  This will have a neutral impact on local authority finances.The Government also decided to broaden the revenue base of local authorities by introducing a charge on all non-principal private residences.  The new charge will be set at €200 per dwelling, and will come into effect in 2009.  It will be payable by the owners of private rented accommodation, holiday homes and other non-principal residences but will not be applied to new dwellings as yet unsold.  The charge will be levied and collected by local authorities, and will be used to support the provision of local services.  Legislation will be brought forward to give effect to the charge shortly.The Commission on Taxation will be reporting on Local Government funding later this year and this will inform the Government's long term approach to Local Government financing.

It is their duty to ensure, as far as possible and with the co-operation of the public, the accuracy and comprehensiveness of the Register.In working to compile the Register for 2007/08, local authorities undertook and completed, with assistance from my Department, the most extensive registration campaign in decades.  On the basis of the work undertaken, I am satisfied that local authorities achieved a significant improvement in the accuracy and comprehensiveness of the Register compared to previous years.  The task for local authorities, in relation to the Register for 2009/10, was to maintain and build on the progress made to date.Local authorities were required to publish the Draft Register for 2009/10 on 1 November 2008 and people had until 25 November to check it to ensure that their details are accurately entered on the Register.  My Department ran an advertising campaign to encourage people to check that they are on the Draft Register and to notify their city or county council of any errors or omissions no later than 25 November.Authorities were required to publish the Final Register for 2009/10 by 1 February 2009 and this is now available for checking.  Individuals not on the Register can avail of the supplement to the Register up until 15 days before the next polling day (i.e. applications must be with the authority not later than Monday 18 May in the case of the Local and European elections being held on 5 June 2009).Looking to the future, the Programme for Government contains a commitment to establish an independent Electoral Commission.  The Commission's responsibilities will include taking charge of the compilation of a new national rolling electoral register.  My Department appointed consultants to carry out preliminary research on issues arising in relation to establishment of the Electoral Commission.  I published the relevant report for consultation on 10 February 2009.
#MichaelFinneranFF	unknown-#MichaelFinneranFF-party	unknown-#MichaelFinneranFF-dob	unknown-#MichaelFinneranFF-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2009-03-11 00:00:00	Prelude	453	I propose to take Questions Nos. 48 and 52 together.The Housing Adaptation Grant Schemes for Older People and People with a Disability are funded by 80% recoupment available from my Department together with a 20% contribution from the resources of the local authority.  In the case of the old Disabled Persons and Essential Repairs Grant Schemes, these were funded by 67% recoupment available from my Department together with a 33% contribution from the resources of the local authority.In May 2008, my Department made an initial combined (Exchequer and local authority) allocation of €71.4 million for the operation of the grant schemes.  In addition, to take account of significantly increased levels of activity under the grant schemes experienced by local authorities, supplementary Exchequer allocations totalling €15 million were made in September, October and December 2008.  Therefore, taking account also of the local authority contribution associated with the €15m in supplementary Exchequer allocations, total expenditure in respect of the Housing Adaptation Grant Schemes for Older People and People with a Disability and the Disabled Persons and Essential Repairs Grant Schemes, in 2008, amounted to €94.9 million, representing an increase of almost €24 million over the corresponding expenditure in 2007.This level of funding supported the carrying out of adaptation and improvement works to over 12,000 vulnerable households in 2008, an increase of some 2,500 over those assisted in 2007.  I am including in the Official Report the following tabular statement setting out the total amounts recouped by my Department to each local authority in respect of each grant scheme in 2008.As regards funding for 2009, my Department has been in regular contact with all local authorities on a range of relevant issues including the levels of activity experienced under the schemes in 2008, the levels of claims on hand, the degree to which prioritisation of applications has taken place and the anticipated levels of activity in 2009.In view of the anticipated high levels of demand under the schemes once again this year, I am conscious of the need for local authorities to be able to deploy available resources as early as possible in order to maximise their impact for households availing of the schemes.  Therefore, local authorities will be notified of their capital allocations in respect of the Housing Adaptation Grant Schemes for Older People and People with a Disability, immediately following the publication of the Revised Estimates for Public Services 2009.As in previous years, it will be a matter for each local authority to decide on the specific level of funding to be directed towards each of the schemes, from within the combined allocation notified to them by my Department, and to manage the operation of the schemes in their areas from within this allocation.Local AuthorityTotal Recoupment by D/EHLG 2008Disabled Persons Grant 2008 RecoupmentEssential Repairs Grant 2008 RecoupmentHousing Grant Disability 2008 RecoupmentMobility Aids Grant 2008 RecoupmentHousing Aid Older People 2008 Recoupment€€€€€€Carlow County Council1,534,923709,232457,12439,18324,778304,606Cavan County Council1,568,060652,764560,652273,0963,14878,400Clare County Council2,100,7901,272,775200,838273,46737,181316,529Cork County Council5,784,9572,266,6861,569,199734,769169,9031,044,400Donegal County Council3,112,4981,328,5731,103,520144,48258,967476,956Dún Laoghaire/R.down Co.

Of these 1,028 were provided by local authorities.  According to the census, just over 250 of these local authority units were occupied by persons aged 65 years or over, representing less than a quarter of a percentage (0.22%) of the total local authority stock in 2006 (115,386).  Of the units in question, 203 were provided by Dublin City Council, and account for 0.75% of the total city council stock in 2006.In the Partnership Agreement Towards 2016, the Government committed to updating and more effectively enforcing the minimum standards regulations for the rental sector and recently delivered on this commitment by approving a package of measures including the phasing out of the traditional bed-sit by 31 January 2013.  Those elements of the package not requiring primary legislation, including those relating to bed-sit accommodation, have been introduced through new regulations to replace those made in 1993 and came into effect on 1 February 2009.Accordingly, any rental properties being let for the first time after 1 February 2009 will have to comply with all the requirements of the new regulations and no new bed-sits can be rented.  However, in so far as existing accommodation is concerned, i.e. properties which have been rented at any time between 1 September 2004 and 31 January 2009, a period of four years (to 31 January 2013) has been allowed for landlords, including local authorities, to undertake the necessary remedial works to ensure compliance with the new regulations.Each year local authorities expend some €150 million on the maintenance and improvement of their stock, an d these improvement works programmes include remedial action necessary to convert bed-sits.

The Green Paper presents a set of options which share a common theme of strengthening local democratic leadership. For example, Stronger Local Democracy proposes a Regional Mayor for Dublin to meet the strategic challenges the city faces. The Paper also suggests that local leadership, accountability and connection with the citizen would be achieved through the provision of directly elected mayors with key powers of initiative in other areas. A suite of further proposals in relation to issues such as town government, participative democracy, regional governance, and service delivery are also included in the Green Paper.Stronger Local Democracy represents the initial phase of a transparent, inclusive policy formulation process. Its purpose was not to arrive at a single solution, but to present options for further consideration. Following the publication of the Green Paper, my Department conducted a public consultation process to inform the preparation of the White Paper. The consultation process included a series of 6 regional seminars held over the summer, to gather as full a range of perspectives as possible.I am currently finalising the content of the White Paper on local government, for Government consideration and subsequent publication; It is my intention to see a stronger, more vibrant and more accountable form of local government at the end of this process.

An agreement under Part V may provide for, inter alia, the developer building and transferring completed houses to the planning authority at a price determined on the basis of the site cost of the units, calculated at existing use value, together with the building and development costs, including profits on those costs, as agreed between both parties.Where housing authorities consider it appropriate, in the context of reduced open market prices and the continuing need to ensure value for money outcomes, they have the option to further reduce the sale price of an affordable unit by providing subsidy, including through the use of any Part V funds on hands. Local authorities are best positioned to make judgments in this regard based on local circumstances.The majority of affordable units on hands were acquired on foot of Part V agreements between developers and local authorities.  It would be a matter for individual local authorities to consider the scope to re-negotiate prices, having regard to the nature of contracts entered into by them with developers.  In the case of units provided under the 1999 Affordable Housing Scheme and the Affordable Housing Initiative, prices were largely determined by the cost of constructing the dwellings on local authority or State land and, in most instances, were significantly below prevailing market price.The Affordable Homes Partnership, working closely with my Department, has examined the position regarding unsold affordable housing with a view to identifying actions that might assist in the sale of such units.  The Partnership recently held a seminar providing advice and guidance to local authorities on the marketing and sale of affordable homes in the current market.  The Partnership has also issued a sales guide, available on their website, to complement their meetings with individual authorities.My Department is currently drawing up further guidance on this matter in light of the examination carried out by the Affordable Homes Partnership and a circular will be issued to local authorities very shortly.

The review will be carried out by an expert group to include members with relevant international experience.  I am currently considering the appropriate structure for the review and the membership of the review group.The EPA has also taken steps to build capacity in support of the prosecution of cases on indictment in the higher courts.  It has developed a panel of retired members of An Garda Síochána with the skills to facilitate better file preparation for the Director of Public Prosecutions.  It has also developed a special training course for local authority staff on waste enforcement and the preparation of files for the DPP.

In accordance with the requirements of the EU Water Framework Directive, all projects funded under this Programme require that the marginal capital cost of servicing non-domestic consumers should be met by the non-domestic sector.  The charging of the marginal cost to the non-domestic sector represents a reasonable charge for the provision of a costly service by the State to that sector.Final decisions in relation to the contribution that my Department will make towards the cost of the Carrickmacross Sewerage Scheme have yet to be taken.
#JohnGormley	unknown-#JohnGormley-party	unknown-#JohnGormley-dob	unknown-#JohnGormley-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2009-03-11 00:00:00	Prelude	461	I propose to take Questions Nos. 58 and 80 together.Septic tanks are the long established means of sewage treatment for houses in rural areas not served by a public sewerage scheme.  The results of the last Census of Population indicated that about 418,000 houses, or 32% of the total stock of just over 1.3 million houses, were served by septic tanks in 2006.In its Water Quality 2004-2006 Report published in 2008, the EPA identified discharges from municipal waste water treatment works and from agricultural activities as the principal suspected causes of water pollution.  The report also noted that microbial pathogens are now more prevalent in groundwater sources, largely from organic waste sources, and that these can pose a threat to human health.  The Agency, therefore, concluded that greater attention needs to be given to groundwater protection, and in particular to prevention of pollution at source including from septic tanks.  My Department is currently examining options for a system of monitoring and inspection of septic tanks in order to protect water quality from potential pollution from septic tanks.Site conditions play an important role in how effectively septic tanks can operate.  The existing standards for septic tanks are set out in Recommendations for Domestic Effluent Treatment and Disposal from a Single Dwelling House (S.R.6 of 1991), published by the NSAI in 1991 and incorporated in Part H of the Building Regulations dealing with Drainage and Waste Water Disposal.  The aim of these standards is to achieve satisfactory practice in the design, construction and maintenance of septic tank drainage systems.  The EPA is currently developing an updated code of practice for waste water treatment systems for single houses which will incorporate the requirements of new European Standards due to come into force on 1 July 2009.  As soon as the EPA completes its work, I will incorporate the new Code of Practice under Part H of the Building Regulations.Section 70 of the Water Services Act 2007 places a duty of care on the occupier of a premises or, if unoccupied, the owner, to ensure that waste water from the premises does not cause nuisance or risk to human health or the environment.  Section 22 of 2007 Act confers extensive powers of inspection, investigation and enforcement to water services authorities to protect water quality, including powers to serve notice on a person requiring that person to take specified measures to prevent or control water pollution.  The National Standards Authority of Ireland (NSAI) recommends that septic tanks should be inspected and emptied twice a year.The Programme for Government includes a commitment in regard to a scheme of support for the replacement and upgrade of septic tanks older than 15 years with newer systems.  While my Department has been examining the conditions which might attach to such a scheme, the timeframe for pursuing this commitment will remain under ongoing review, having regard to current budgetary constraints.
#MichaelFinneranFF	unknown-#MichaelFinneranFF-party	unknown-#MichaelFinneranFF-dob	unknown-#MichaelFinneranFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-03-11 00:00:00	Prelude	462	The Residential Tenancies Act 2004 introduced a new regulatory framework governing private rented residential tenancies, providing, inter alia, for:A measure of security for tenants of certain dwellings;Amendment of landlord and tenant law in relation to basic rights and obligations of each of the parties;The cheap and speedy resolution of disputes between such parties;The establishment of the Private Residential Tenancies Board (PRTB) to discharge a range of functions related to these matters.The PRTB was established as an independent statutory body in September 2004 and its principal functions are in the areas of:The registration of private rental tenancies;The resolution of disputes between tenants and landlords;The provision of information, assistance and advice to the Minister on the private rental sector.Since its establishment in September, 2004, a notable success has been the registration to date of over 310,000 tenancies, compared with less than 23,000 registered with local authorities in 2004.  Almost 211,000 "current" tenancies are now registered with the Board.  During 2007, the PRTB received almost 1,500 dispute applications for determination, and slightly in excess of that in 2008.  These disputes are in areas such as deposit retention, illegal eviction, rent arrears, anti-social behaviour and various other breaches of landlord or tenant obligations.Partly as a consequence of the Board's success in ensuring registration compliance, and the resulting large workloads arising, it is acknowledged that the processing times for dispute resolution are not yet optimal.  This situation has arisen due to a combination of the major increase in demands in line with the expansion of the sector and the quasi-judicial process involved which can be time consuming, particularly in relation to issues such as court actions.  It is, however, important to note that while the PRTB provides dispute resolution services, less than 1% of all registered tenancies seek to avail of the PRTB's dispute resolution mechanisms.  This indicates that a healthy and stable landlord-tenant relationship prevails in the vast majority of tenancies.  I am satisfied that the dispute resolution procedure offered by the PRTB is affordable, and much cheaper than the courts procedure that it has replaced, given that the application fee for the first stage of the dispute resolution process is €25 and the fee for the second or appeal stage is €40.In response to the large and ongoing volume of work it had to deal with, the Board of the PRTB requested an additional 14 permanent staff to bring their permanent staffing complement from 26 to 40.  This was approved by my Department in early 2008 and the additional personnel were recruited over the course of last Summer.  This increased staffing level will help significantly with the administrative work related to the processing of dispute cases.  On 16 December 2008, I launched the Board's new corporate plan which maps out how the PRTB intends to deal with new challenges during the 2009 to 2011 period.  In this plan, the PRTB outlines specific targets and performance indicators in aspects of its work in the areas of Dispute Resolution, Tenancy Registration, Research and Information, Innovation and Customer Service, Leadership and Governance and Human Resources and Finance.  No effort will be spared by the Board in vigorously delivering on this Corporate Plan.Due to the nature and complexity of the Residential Tenancies Act, one element of the Board's remit under the Act is to assess the functioning of the PRTB and of the Act itself and to put forward suggestions for improvements to the original legislation.  This has already resulted in a number of notable legislative changes to the Act being proposed to my Department by the Board.  Some relevant amendments were introduced at Seanad Committee Stage of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill in 2008 and I hope to bring a number of other related amendments forward at Committee stage in this House.In addition, I have requested my Department to undertake a review of the provisions of the Residential Tenancies Act 2004 under which the PRTB operates.  The purpose of this review, which will get underway shortly, is to consider whether, in light of more than four years' operational experience, the PRTB's underpinning legislative framework can be improved to further support the effective regulation of a healthy and well-functioning private rental sector.

The application of Part V, including determination of market value for clawback purposes, is a matter for individual local authorities.Notwithstanding this, it is normal practice for participating private lending institutions, which provide mortgage finance for affordable dwellings, to limit such advances to 80% of the market value of the dwelling as determined by them.  Affordable housing is sold at a discount to market value and there is no maximum threshold set on this discount.  Local authorities determine the level of discount having regard to available resources to ensure the housing units are affordable.

A public consultation process has been completed, and account is being taken of submissions received from the public and key stakeholders.While there is already a wide range of measures in place to deal with noise from a variety of sources, I intend that the new legislation will take a more integrated approach to noise pollution.  There will be a greater emphasis on codes of practice for construction, commercial and domestic situations.  Local authorities will have stronger enforcement powers to deal with nuisances from particular noise sources such as continuously sounding alarms, and I also see the need to extend the powers of the Garda Síochána in certain circumstances.  There will, in addition, be measures to increase awareness of noise nuisance and of how it can be remedied.

Sustainable Energy Ireland (SEI) has been designated as the Issuing Authority with responsibility for the ongoing administration of the BER Scheme.BER Assessor training is not provided by SEI itself, but by 22 training providers who must be registered with a National Awards Body recognised under the National Framework of Qualifications and listed on SEI's website.  All training providers must comply with the Specification for Assessor Training Programmes for Building Energy Rating (BER) of Dwellings, as published by SEI.  In particular, this document prescribes strict technical attainments for trainers and minimum entry qualifications for trainees as necessary prerequisites to the training process.  All BER assessment activity is closely monitored by SEI and a robust system of audit and quality assurance checks is in place.I understand from SEI that, following a competitive tender process initiated in October 2008, a preferred tenderer for the introduction of a National BER Examination for all trained assessors has now been selected.  Contract arrangements are currently being finalised which will see the National BER Examination being provided at 41 exam centres, including 25 mobile units, around the country from June 2009.

A person who is not on the register may apply for inclusion on the supplement to the register up to 15 days before polling day.  Applications must be received by the relevant city or county council not later than Monday 18 May in order to vote at the local and European elections on 5 June 2009.  Application forms for inclusion on the supplement to the register, Form RFA 2, are widely available from local authorities, post offices, Garda stations, public libraries, and local authority websites, and can be downloaded from www.checktheregister.ie.In making voter registration as accessible as possible, it is important to have appropriate measures in place to guard against potential personation or abuse of the electoral system.  It is, therefore, a legal requirement that completed application forms for inclusion on the supplement to the register are witnessed by a member of the Garda Síochána before being returned to the appropriate local authority.  If a person cannot for stated reasons attend their local Garda station, their application may be witnessed by an official of the local authority.  If because of a physical illness or physical disability, a person cannot attend either their local Garda station or their local authority, their application form can be accompanied by a medical certificate.I am concerned to ensure that the legislative and administrative arrangements in place in relation to registration are as flexible and user friendly as possible consistent with maintaining the security and integrity of the electoral process.  While I will continue to keep current practice under review, I am satisfied that the present arrangements strike a reasonable balance.

Part B of the Building Regulations 1997 sets out the fire safety requirements to be observed in the design and construction of certain buildings including apartment complexes.Section 18 of the Fire Services Act 1981, as amended, places a duty on persons having control over premises, such as apartment complexes, to take all reasonable measures to guard against the outbreak of fire and to ensure the safety of persons on the premises in the event of an outbreak of fire.  The Section also places a duty on people on such premises to conduct themselves in such as way as to ensure that, as far as reasonably practicable, other people on the premises are not exposed to danger from fire as a consequence of any act or omission of theirs.  Section 22 of the Fire Services Act 1981, as amended, empowers fire authorities to inspect any land or building, including apartment complexes, for the purpose of the Act, including enforcement of fire safety matters.The preparation of legislation on management companies for apartment complexes is a matter for the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform.

The quality of individual supplies is monitored by the EPA and its most recent report "The Quality of Drinking Water in Ireland  — A Report for the Years 2006 and 2007" is available in the Oireachtas Library.I have put in place a rigorous supervisory framework to ensure good quality drinking water is provided and that effective mechanisms are available to deal quickly and effectively with problems where they arise.  Under the European Communities (Drinking Water) (No. 2) Regulations 2007, local authority drinking water supplies are subject to supervision by the EPA and I have given the Agency the necessary resources to back up its new enforcement powers.Under the drinking water regulations, local authorities are obliged to ensure that any failure to meet quality standards in a water supply is investigated immediately to determine the cause.  The authority is required to consult with the Health Service Executive to determine whether there is a potential danger to human health, and, if there is, to agree the appropriate action, including the prompt notification of consumers. In the case of public supplies, a local authority is also obliged to inform the EPA promptly and the EPA can issue such directions to a local authority as necessary to prevent or remove any health risk.  Failure to comply with such a direction is an indictable offence and subject to heavy penalties.In addition, my Department coordinates and finances a major programme of investment in improved water supply infrastructure, active leakage control, telemetry and rehabilitation of watermains, on which some €1.6 billion has been invested by the Government in the period since 2000. This level of investment reflects the priority assigned by Government to meeting EU standards for drinking water and providing critical water supply infrastructure.The schemes included in the current Water Services Investment Programme are derived mainly from the assessments of needs undertaken by all local authorities, at my Department's request, as an input to the overall strategy for meeting water services infrastructural requirements.  Among the criteria local authorities are required to take into account in preparing assessments of needs are compliance with national and EU drinking water standards, including reports produced by the EPA annually in relation to drinking water quality.The Water Services Act, 2007, provides for preparation of a strategic water services plan by each water services authority for its area at least every 6 years.  Such plans will set out current and projected water services needs and identify the required responses. This process will ensure that water services planning is appropriately integrated with planning for investment in social and economic development.  The relevant provisions will be brought into force as soon as related guidelines and training are available.I am satisfied that the policies and resources in place will ensure that our water supplies are capable of meeting the required quality standards and current and anticipated demands.

Meeting this obligation will entail doubling the existing level of diversion from landfill by 2010 and further increases in diversion in subsequent years.Following extensive consultation, the National Strategy on Biodegradable Waste was published in April 2006 and is aimed at diverting 80% of biodegradable municipal waste from landfill through segregated collection and the generation of compost.  The Programme for Government contains a commitment to implementation of the National Strategy.I have indicated my intention to introduce primary legislation to allow significant increases in the landfill levy.  My Department, in addition, has initiated a stakeholder consultation on a Statutory Instrument for the segregation of commercial biodegradable waste.Last year, I issued a circular to all local authorities to drive forward the roll out of brown bins and promote the use of home composting and the National Waste Report 2007 indicates increased quantities are being dealt with by home composting.  I am confident that all of the above measures will contribute significantly to the achievement of the targets for the diversion of biodegradable waste from landfill and a reduction in our overall use of landfill.

Rent payable under the scheme to an approved housing body, by a tenant, is based on household and subsidiary income in the previous tax year.  Where this would result in hardship arising from a fall in income due to loss of employment, disability etc, the rent may be adjusted accordingly.In the case of the Capital Assistance Scheme (CAS), which is aimed at persons with special housing needs such as elderly, the homeless or persons with a physical or intellectual disability, rents are charged at a reasonable rate having regard to tenants' income. In cases where an approved housing body contributes a minimum of 5% of the capital cost of a CAS funded project, the approved body may retain nomination rights, outside of the local authority waiting list, for up to 25% of the units. In these circumstances, the normal landlord/tenant arrangements apply.In line with the commitments set out in the Government's housing policy statement, Delivering Homes, Sustaining Communities my Department is currently undertaking, with the assistance of outside consultants, a strategic review of the role of the voluntary and co-operative housing sector in the provision, maintenance, operation and management of social rented accommodation in Ireland.  The outcome of the review, which I expect to finalise by mid-2009, will inform policy with regard to, inter alia, future funding arrangements and the operation, maintenance and management of schemes.

Detailed advice in relation to the application of the reduction is being developed and the Department of Finance and other Departments are being consulted to ensure consistency of application. This advice will be utilised by my Department and circulated to local authorities and bodies under the aegis of my Department as soon as possible. Given the wide variety of contracts under which professional fees can arise, ranging from contracts solely for professional services to construction contracts which can include an element of professional fees, and the different procedures under which contracts were negotiated, it is not possible at this early stage to quantify the actual savings that will accrue.  It will be a matter for the local authorities and the bodies under the aegis of the Department to examine all contracts for professional fees to establish whether or not such contracts come within the Government decision and apply the reduction in all applicable cases. My Department is not in a position to respond in relation to specific operational matters of bodies under its aegis.

The present legal framework, as determined by the Oireachtas, reflects this. In accordance with section 52 of the Protection of the Environment Act 2003 the determination of waste management charges is a matter for the relevant local authority where it acts as the service provider. Similarly, where a private operator provides the collection service, it is a matter for that operator to determine charges.Significant regulatory issues, including issues associated with waste charges and the methods for charging for service provision, have emerged as waste management services have rapidly evolved in recent years.  I recognise that the existing regulatory framework requires modernisation which will be taken forward in the context of the overall review of national waste management policy, provided for in the Programme for Government.  Identification of the changes necessary will also be greatly assisted by the recently published OECD review of the public service, which includes a specific case study on waste management.The revised approach to the collection of household waste being taken by the Dublin local authorities will further inform what measures may be necessary to underpin sustainable and affordable waste collection services and infrastructure provision, whether delivered by the private or public sectors. In these contexts the appropriate policy responses, including in respect of charging systems, are being developed and elaborated.

As part of this process, I am also taking into account the work of the Commission on Electronic Voting, which has examined the system, the need to maintain public confidence in the electoral process, as well as the provisions in the Programme for Government relating to electoral reform generally.Given the scale of investment in the system to date, and the importance of the issues involved for our electoral system, it is essential that the future of the project be examined objectively and in a thorough and comprehensive manner. It is important that we come to the best possible decision.  It is not possible to make more specific comment at this point on the project itself, or on future plans for the machines, pending completion of the necessary work and a decision by Government in the matter.Information on the costs associated with the storage of electronic voting machines is compiled annually by my Department.  Based on figures received from Returning Officers, the total annual costs for storage of the electronic voting equipment (including the cost of insurance, service charges, rates and heating) in 2008 were some €204,000.

In its Report for the year 2006, the Agency noted that the term mechanical biological treatment (MBT) is used to describe not one specific process, but rather a combination of different technologies, and that it was not possible to estimate from the available data how much waste was treated mechanically.The Programme for Government includes a commitment to the implementation of the National Strategy on Biodegradable Waste and the achievement of Ireland's obligations under the EU Landfill Directive. In achieving this, I believe there should be less reliance on landfill and incineration and greater use of alternative technologies, including those for the mechanical and biological treatment of waste.It is my intention to bring forward legislation significantly to increase the landfill levy to drive the diversion of biodegradable material from landfill and encourage the development of alternative technologies including mechanical and biological treatment of waste.Consultants are engaged in carrying out a study which will underpin the overall review of waste policy also provided for in the Programme and which will be concluded this year. In this context policy proposals will be developed to facilitate the deployment of the full range of non-landfill technologies.

In addition, local authorities may enter into service level agreements with approved housing bodies with regard to the management and maintenance of social housing units acquired by these authorities under Part V.Part V units are more generally suited to family type accommodation and those which are being assigned to approved housing bodies are, for the most part, funded under the Capital Loan and Subsidy Scheme. Under the terms of the scheme, management and maintenance costs are met from the rental income generated by the project as well as an annual management and maintenance subsidy allowance from my Department of up to €724 which is paid to approved housing bodies in respect of each dwelling funded under the scheme.The Working Group on Voluntary and Co-operative Housing, which is comprised of representatives of the voluntary housing sector, the Irish Council for Social Housing (ICSH), the National Association of Building Co-operatives, the local authorities and my own Department, provides a stakeholder forum for the voluntary and co-operative housing sector. To date, the issue of high numbers of tenants refusing offers of accommodation in Part V properties due to high the levels of management fees and parking fees has not been identified as an area of concern. In the case of apartments provided under Part V and where car parking is provided, the capital cost of the units generally covers both the accommodation and car parking space. In these instances, car parking fees should not arise.Local authorities and approved housing bodies do everything possible to minimise the impact of management charges on the rents charged to tenants of voluntary units acquired under Part V.  Dublin City Council, for example, recently set up a Working Group under its Housing Strategic Policy Committee, which includes representatives of the ICSH, to look at issues in relation to the impact of management charges on social housing tenants.Details of the accommodation provided under my Department's funding schemes for voluntary and co-operative housing, including details of the housing units acquired under Part V, are published in my Department's Annual Housing Statistics, copies of which are available in the Oireachtas Library.

As such, the development plan must offer clear guidance on sustainable development policies and objectives, both national and local, which addresses the full range of sustainability issues such as climate change, waste management, transport, urban development, sustainable communities and the use of natural resources.In June 2007, my Department published Guidelines for Planning Authorities on Development Plans.  The Guidelines state that it is imperative that the objectives and strategies set out in development plans are compatible with the Government's commitment to reducing energy consumption and modifying the impacts of climate change.  Development plans should be consistent with the objectives of national initiatives that will address energy and climate change issues such as the National Climate Change Strategy 2007-2012, which builds on the commitment to sustainable development set out in Towards 2016 and the National Development Plan 2007-2013.  Moreover, the conclusions in the EPA State of the Environment Reports, and other evidence in relation to environmental quality and trends, should inform the drafting of development plans and be reflected, as appropriate, in their objectives and implementation.Building on existing guidance and highlighting best practice examples of plans at different scales, my Department has also begun the preparation of new planning guidelines on local area plans.  A key element of these guidelines, which will be published later this year for public consultation, is the development of a sustainability toolkit which will focus on practical ways in which local planning policies can bring about better energy efficiency in new developments and how best to protect and enhance habitats and biodiversity, to integrate waste management into planning new development and support more use of sustainable transport modes, including public transport, walking and cycling.

It will make use of some of the vacant housing stock throughout the country, thereby avoiding any time lag in providing homes for households in need, and achieving value for money at a time of constraint in the public finances.I have set aside €20 million to support this new initiative in 2009. It is expected that through this a minimum of 2,000 additional homes will be procured this year.  It will be a matter for each local authority to determine what properties and locations are suitable for leasing; however, in putting forward proposals authorities will be expected to have regard to the Department's guidelines on social housing and all proposals for funding must be consistent with the policy of creating sustainable communities.Further details of the scheme can be found in a circular recently issued by my Department, which will be forwarded to the Deputy.

Progress towards ratification of the Convention is closely aligned with work at EU level and, in that context, the European Union has adopted two Directives as part of the ratification process. These deal with public access to environmental information (2003/4/EC) and public participation in certain environmental decision-making procedures (2003/35/EC).The European Communities (Access to Information on the Environment) Regulations 2007 came into effect on 1 May 2007.

It is up to individual housing authorities to plan the composition, management and delivery of their social housing investment programmes having regard to the specific social housing priorities in their areas and to the Exchequer funding allocations available to them, which are based on their identified 2008 statutory assessment of housing need. To ensure that these programmes are delivered in a coherent and coordinated manner City and County Councils have put in place multi-annual Housing Action Plans which encompass delivery of social and affordable housing in their areas, including Town Councils.  These programmes will be considered by my Department as part of the annual Housing Action Plan Review process which is currently underway.It is expected that through the social housing investment programme and the voluntary and co-operative housing programmes in 2009, and, having regard to the availability of suitable housing in the current housing market, including through the recently announced long-term leasing initiative, good progress will be made this year in meeting social housing needs.
#JohnGormley	unknown-#JohnGormley-party	unknown-#JohnGormley-dob	unknown-#JohnGormley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-03-11 00:00:00	Prelude	486	Ireland has long been concerned about the risk to this country posed by the large and complex nuclear reprocessing site at Sellafield.  The policies and actions of this Government continue to reflect the firm position that Sellafield's continued operation poses risks of real and legitimate concern to Ireland and that it should be decommissioned and closed in a safe and orderly manner.  Since coming into office I have expressed this position at all appropriate opportunities and our concerns in relation to the site have been consistently articulated to the UK Government at political, diplomatic and official levels.For some years now, the UK and Ireland have developed a process for regular high level exchanges on the matter of Sellafield and its related facilities. These exchanges have embedded the ‘package' of measures for enhanced co-operation and information exchanges announced by my predecessor in December 2004.The background to that announcement was that, in 2001, in response to the then imminent commissioning of the MOX fuel manufacturing plant at the Sellafield site, Ireland instituted legal proceedings against the UK under the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS).   Pending the hearing of the case, Ireland applied for and received a Provisional Measures Order from the Arbitral Tribunal, which ordered a review by Ireland and the UK of the mechanisms for inter-governmental notification and co-operation.  Arising from this, a series of co-operative measures was developed, agreed and put in place.These measures are valuable from Ireland's viewpoint and are working well.  They represent real and considerable added value to the necessarily co-operative relationship between Ireland and the UK.  The measures include the Bi-Lateral Agreement on Early Notification of a Nuclear Incident; direct access to the UK Radiation Monitoring System (RIMNET); access for the Garda Síochána to Sellafield, significantly improved information exchanges; co-operation on emergency planning with the UK; improved and ongoing contacts at regulator and official level on nuclear issues; and access for the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland (RPII) to Sellafield and other facilities.This latter measure has resulted in two visits by the RPII to sites in the UK, one to Sellafield and one to the Wylfa Nuclear Power Plant in North Wales. The Reports of the Institute on these visits are available on the RPII website, www.rpii.ie.  These visits are extremely useful to Ireland. They enhance the co-operation between technical experts in both countries and provide us with a high level of knowledge of the operation of these UK nuclear facilities which would not otherwise be readily available.I consider that the co-operation measures are being utilised fully by Ireland and, with the co-operation of the UK, the level of exchange is deepening with each meeting.  These all provide objective evidence of real improvements in the quality of the information available to Ireland and enhancement of our understanding of the site.  In this way, we are better able to assess the full nature of the risk posed, and ensure that we are well placed to deal with such risk, however remote.I emphasize, however, that the Government is continuing and will continue to pursue all political, diplomatic and, where necessary and appropriate, legal options to secure the safe and orderly decommissioning of the Sellafield facility.  It is my view that the ongoing discussions between the two administrations in relation to Sellafield have resulted in increased recognition by the UK Government of the depth and seriousness of Ireland's concerns about Sellafield and of the priority that is rightly accorded to the issue by the Irish Government.Ireland has supported and will continue to support efforts by the European Commission to develop an increased role for itself in the area of safety within the European Nuclear Industry.  In this regard, I welcomed the proposal for a Nuclear Safety Directive from the European Commission in November 2008.  In Ireland's view, the transboundary risks and impacts arising from nuclear installations should be fully reflected in the instruments, structures and institutions of the EU.

He had written to the main Opposition party leaders in 1999 but it was evident that cross-party support for the introduction of such a scheme did not exist at the time.  He wrote to Opposition party leaders again in October 2007 to inquire if their parties would be prepared to enter into discussions on the matter.  A formal response to the letter of October 2007 has not been received in one case.  I share my predecessor's view that a national honours system would require all-party support.

Our enterprise support measures are geared towards helping companies to grow and sell on world markets.  Enterprise Ireland is the State agency charged with helping indigenous enterprises to increase their exports in existing and new markets.  The agency is active nationally, at the developmental level, and internationally, in assisting Irish indigenous companies to find new markets for their products and increase their existing level of market share.  Through its network of international offices, Enterprise Ireland creates and implements successful strategies for market entry, development and growth in overseas markets.  IDA Ireland client companies account for a significant proportion of overall exports.  The IDA has designed a range of measures to help client companies to embed their employment, output and exports.  Within the last two weeks, the Taoiseach has announced the establishment of an enterprise stabilisation fund to support viable but vulnerable exporting companies.  This fund is an important first step in the process of concerted support for our trading enterprises.Against the backdrop of the current global economic downturn, a range of additional measures is being assessed with a view to further helping exporting companies.  Various proposals have been suggested.  A thorough assessment of possible supports will be finalised soon.  In addition, several major instruments have been introduced to support enterprises generally.  The bank recapitalisation scheme, which includes provision to increase lending capacity to small and medium-sized enterprises by 10%, was one such carefully designed measure.  This major development, coupled with a new code of practice on business lending, will be a crucial source of support for our exporting companies.  Having regard to the continued concerns of the business community about credit insurance, an independent study on credit availability has been commissioned by the Department of Finance as part of the bank recapitalisation programme.  I understand this study is due to be completed within five or six weeks.  A separate review of the export credit insurance market was also carried out at my request.  This report is now finalised.  I will bring it to the Government for discussion soon.To help cash flow to businesses, I will shortly introduce on an administrative basis a commitment to reduce the payment period by central Departments to businesses from 30 to 15 days.  An assessment of the impact of extending this to the local authority, health and education sectors will be completed by the end of April.  Clearly, we need a sustained focus on growing exports to ensure a return to economic growth.  I assure the Deputy that I and my colleagues in government are determined to take the necessary measures that will position Ireland, not least its enterprises, its entrepreneurs and its exporters, to weather the current global crisis and emerge optimally positioned to take advantage of the global upturn, when it comes.  As the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, I am convinced that the rigorous and carefully targeted stimulus measures I have set out will not only support but serve to regenerate the strength and capacity of Irish business in every sector.

The OPW has also commenced a programme of Flood Risk Assessment and Management studies that will map the areas of the country potentially at risk and will produce for each area of significant risk identified, a plan outlining measures to address the risk, including, if appropriate, maintenance of river channels.  The flood maps and proposed risk mitigation measures set out in the plans will take account of climate change scenarios.  The studies, which are carried out in conjunction with the relevant local authorities, will meet the requirements of the EU Flood Directive.  It is expected that the Flood Risk Assessment and Management programme will be completed within the 2015 deadline set out in that directive.  A Flood Risk Assessment and Management study for the Lee catchment in Cork and the Dodder in Dublin will be completed in 2009, while similar studies for the Suir and Fingal-East Meath areas are ongoing.  Pending the carrying out of Flood Risk Assessment and Management studies, the OPW has been involved in or funded a number of localised studies aimed at addressing pressing flood problems.

#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-03-11 00:00:00	Prelude	503	At the outset the Deputy may wish to note that the choice of mortgage product ultimately rests with consumers in light of their assessment of the terms and conditions that their lending institution offers. The decision of borrowers is influenced by a range of factors such as their personal preferences and their own assessment of the relative merits of fixed and variable rate mortgages.Generally mortgages are for long periods. To some consumers a fixed interest rate on a mortgage offers peace of mind in that the borrower benefits from certainty regarding the cost of their mortgage, does not need to be concerned with changes in mortgage interest rates and accordingly he or she can budget more confidently.Where a bank offers a fixed rate over a certain period it incurs additional costs in obtaining fixed or other funding in respect of the loan over the period. The additional costs will reflect both the market view in relation to future trends in interest rates for the period and the fact that longer term deposits generally attract higher interest rates than short term. In addition, if a borrower wishes to break a fixed interest rate contract prior to the end of the agreed term in order to change to a variable interest rate contract, it will generally result in funding costs for the lender concerned.  If covered institutions were prohibited from charging customers for the funding costs, the price and availability of fixed rate mortgages is likely to be adversely affected.
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-03-11 00:00:00	Prelude	504	I am assuming that by "Irish citizens who qualify for non-payment of tax here," the Deputy means Irish-domiciled individuals claiming to be non-resident for tax purposes.I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that Irish citizens who are non-resident for tax purposes are in general chargeable on: income arising in Ireland, for example, income from directorships, a trade or profession, rented properties etc; and gains from the disposals of land, buildings or shares deriving their value from these assets and certain other assets such as minerals in the State or other assets related to exploitation of such minerals.In general, non-resident individuals are liable to Irish capital gains tax on disposals of land, buildings or shares deriving their value from these assets and certain other assets such as minerals in the State or other assets related to exploitation of such minerals. They are not liable to Irish capital gains tax on assets outside this category, for example, shares or equities in companies not deriving their value primarily from land, buildings, etc.  There are variations on this position if the non-resident individual is ordinarily resident and/or domiciled in Ireland.I am also informed that an individual who is not domiciled but is ordinarily resident in the State is, in general, taxable on all Irish income and on UK and foreign sourced income remitted to the State whether the individual is resident or not resident in the State.I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that the number of chargeable persons who claimed on their 2007 tax return that they or their spouse were not resident in the State is 5,867.  This figure is based on the 2007 tax returns processed up to the end of February 2009.There is no statutory obligation on citizens to show their worth on their tax return.  Therefore, it is not possible to estimate the net worth of chargeable persons who are not resident in the State.  Likewise, there is no statutory obligation on citizens to show if they have paid tax in any other country on their tax return.  It is, therefore, not possible to state if chargeable persons who are not resident in the State pay tax in any other country.There is no statutory obligation on citizens who are only taxable in the State on Irish sourced income or on income remitted to the State to return details of income or gains arising anywhere else in the world.  Therefore, it is not possible to establish the amount of these incomes or gains or of any associated tax. These arrangements are fairly standard across OECD countries.A person is regarded as resident in the State for tax purposes in a tax year if he or she spends: 183 days in the State in that year, or 280 days in aggregate in that tax year and the preceding tax year.  An individual who is present in the State for 30 days or less in a tax year will not be treated as resident for that year unless he or she elects to be resident. Also, for years up to and including 2008, a day will only count as a day of presence in the State for tax residence purposes if the individual is present in the State at the end of the day.However, section 15 Finance (No. 2) Act 2008 amended the legislation so that as respects 2009 and subsequent years an individual is regarded as present in the State for a day if he or she is present in the State at any time during that day.  These rules are similar to the rules that apply in many other developed countries.  As with other areas of taxation, the rules are constantly kept under review.

In doing so they avoid the risk of rate increases, but of course they forgo the chance to benefit from rate reductions.In general banks will try to match fixed rate  loans with fixed rate funding, so that there is a real cost to them if a customer wishes to end the fixed rate agreement before the due time.I have not discussed this issue with any representatives of the credit institutions either in the context of the bank guarantee scheme or the recapitalisation programme and I have no plans to seek to impose this requirement on any credit institution.
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-03-11 00:00:00	Prelude	506	The variable mortgage interest rates have fallen sharply in recent times. This is a major benefit to many families.The Deputy will be aware that many lenders are conducting extensive advertising campaigns, showing that competition is a real factor on the mortgage scene. The existence of that level of competition in the mortgage lending market is sufficient, I believe, to ensure that credit institutions will reduce their rates where possible in order to remain competitive and retain their share of the market.The Deputy will appreciate that a balance must be achieved by Government between influencing private banks through the bank guarantee scheme and other financial support incentives while at the same time being seen to have a hands-off approach to the day to day running of these institutions which must operate on a strictly commercial basis.I have not discussed this issue with any representatives of the credit institutions either in the context of the bank guarantee scheme or the recapitalisation programme and I have no plans to seek to impose this requirement on any credit institution.

#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-03-11 00:00:00	Prelude	509	As the Deputy is aware, I announced in Budget 2009 that an air travel tax will come into force in respect of passengers departing from Irish airports on and from 30 March 2009. A general rate of €10 per passenger will apply, with a lower rate of €2 for shorter journeys.The Finance (No.2) Act 2008 confirms the introduction of an air travel tax from 30 March 2009. However, I took account of concerns raised by the regional airports particularly those on the western seaboard.  The lower rate of €2 will apply to departures from any Irish airport where the destination is 300kms or less from Dublin airport. This means that all Irish departures, subject to the tax, to locations such as Manchester, Liverpool and Glasgow will be subject to the €2 rate.In addition, to assist the smaller airports I have increased the exemption threshold for airports included in the air travel tax, from 10,000 to 50,000 departing passengers in the previous calendar year.  We currently face significant financial challenges and the air travel tax is an important revenue raising measure.Ireland is not unique in regard to applying a tax on air travel. A number of countries within the EU apply similar taxes including, the UK, France and the Netherlands, as do Australia and New Zealand. The proposed rates for the Irish air travel tax are not unreasonable both for shorter and longer journeys, when compared to rates in other countries.It should be recognised that tourists will only be subject to the tax on their return journey.  The additional €10 or €2 in the context of a much larger purchasing decision involving travel, hotel expenditures etc. should not have much of an effect on tourist numbers.  I appreciate the airline industry continues to go through a difficult period.  However, this difficult trading period has, in addition to weak world economic activity, been largely driven by a massive spike in oil prices. Oil prices have now halved from the all-time high prices experienced earlier in the year.I tried to be as fair as possible in looking at areas for additional tax revenues.  It is also worth noting that fuel used by commercial airlines is completely exempt from tax, so it's a sector that already has considerable preferential treatment. I have no plans to further revise the air travel tax.
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-03-11 00:00:00	Prelude	510	I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that as a general rule all vehicles imported permanently into the State must register for Vehicle Registration Tax (VRT) purposes within one working day of arrival.  This rule applies equally to vehicles imported by EU and non EU persons.  In practice, Revenue allows latitude of a maximum of seven days for registration.However, Section 135 (a) of the Finance Act 1992 permitted a European or other foreign-registered vehicle which was temporarily brought into the State by a person established outside the State, to be exempted from the requirement to register for VRT purposes for a period normally not exceeding 12 months from the date upon which the vehicle concerned was brought into the State.Section 64 of the Finance (No.2) Act 2008 amends this section to provide for the registration (without the payment of VRT) of vehicles temporarily brought into the State for a period greater than 42 days.When the new temporary registration system comes into effect, the vehicle owner will be required to register with Revenue and receive a temporary number plate, which will have to be displayed on the vehicle. This will provide a mechanism whereby Revenue can maintain a record of vehicles benefiting from this exemption, quickly identify applicants who are not eligible for a temporary exemption and must immediately pay any VRT due; and identify vehicles coming to the end of a period of temporary exemption (i.e. one year), so that VRT can be collected when it becomes due. In addition the amendment provides that vehicles seeking temporary registration will be required to undergo a pre-registration test as a pre-condition for registration.The Deputy may wish to note that Revenue mobile units and An Garda Síochána continue to monitor both Irish and foreign-registered vehicles on our roads as part of their regular and ongoing enforcement activity. For their part, Revenue mobile units challenged 20,669 vehicles last year. Of these, some 15,231 satisfied Revenue officials that the registration status was in order at that particular time and no further action was taken. 5,438 vehicles required further investigation and action including registration and payment of VRT, seizure of vehicle, export of vehicle, grant of transfer of residence relief or temporary exemption, and reports for prosecution. In addition to the VRT collected, penalties totalling €1,109,315 were imposed in respect of these vehicles. In 2008, some 55,000 second hand vehicles were registered and the total VRT paid amounted to €190m.

With effect from 1st January, 2009, the income thresholds for entitlement to a medical card for those aged 70 and over are €700 (gross) per week (€36,500 per year) for a single person and €1,400 (gross) per week (€73,000 per year) for a couple.In early January 2009, the HSE wrote to persons aged 70 and over who were medical card holders on 31st December 2008, informing them that either they will continue to hold their card or, if they consider that they are over the income thresholds, they should advise the HSE by 2nd March 2009, after which date their medical card is no longer valid.Under the new arrangements, a much simplified system of assessment for eligibility was introduced in respect of persons aged 70 and over, based on gross income rather than net income, as applies otherwise for means-testing of eligibility for medical cards.The simplified approach taken for persons aged 70 and over who held a medical card prior to 31st December 2008 is close to a self-assessment system. In introducing the measures, I emphasised my belief in the honesty and integrity of the vast majority of older persons in our society.There are measures in the legislation that allow for the sharing of data between State agencies and the Health Service Executive (HSE) to allow the HSE to verify in any particular case if the person has income, as declared, under the gross income limit.Long-standing provisions of the Health Act 1970, as amended, continue to apply.  For instance, under Section 49 (1) there is a requirement for a person to notify the HSE of any change in his/her circumstances which would render him/her ineligible for services.  In addition, under Section 50, when a person has obtained a service and it is later ascertained that he/she was not entitled to the service, the HSE may charge the individual for any services provided to him/her for the period for which he/she had no entitlement.  Failure to notify the HSE or the use of a service one is not entitled to is an offence on summary conviction.The Health Act 2008 provides that the HSE shall provide any necessary supports to any person aged 70 or over in the making of an application for a medical card where, by reason of any incapacity, such person requests such assistance.

The Government has, over recent years, provided significant additional investment either to put in place, or expand, a range of community based services such as Home Helps, Home Care Packages, Day/Respite Care, and Meals-on-Wheels.  All of these are designed to support recipients and their families, so that those requiring care can remain in their own homes and communities for as long as possible.The Government fully appreciates the valuable role carers make to society, which complements the significant Exchequer funding provided annually in this area.

Following consideration by a Visa Officer, it was refused on 2 February 2009, for a number of reasons:1. The evidence of finances submitted was deemed insufficient in that the reference did not provide bank statements or a P60 for 2008;2. The applicant was previously refused an Irish visa. Furthermore, in additional information supplied, the applicant indicated that he was refused entry to the United Kingdom;3. The Visa Officer, in considering the application including additional information supplied by both the reference in the State and the applicant, noted inconsistencies concerning the date of the birth of the applicant.

For that reason the matter had not been reported to An Garda Síochána.  Crime prevention and personal security advice was provided to the person.I am further informed that local Garda management is not aware of other incidents of public disorder or anti-social behaviour occurring in the area referred to.  Any complaints received by the Garda authorities are the subject of investigation and dealt with appropriately, including by juvenile or adult caution, fixed charge notices or initiating criminal proceedings.Current policing policy in the area is predicated on the prevention of crime, including crimes of violence against persons and property, the prevention of public order offences and the maintenance of an environment conducive to the improvement of the quality of life of the residents.  This strategy is, and will continue to be, central to the delivery of the policing service in this area.

One such condition is that the applicant must be of good character.There are no guidelines relating to the judgement of good character. My officials make enquiries with a number of external agencies as part of the normal processing of applications. Enquiries are made with An Garda Síochána to check if the person has come to the adverse attention of the Garda since arriving in the State. Enquiries are also made to assess an applicant's financial status in respect of their ability to support themselves in the State. Enquiries with the Revenue Commissioners and the Department of Social and Family Affairs may be necessary in this regard. A submission is prepared by my officials in each case, I evaluate this submission including any recommendations expressed by my officials, and from time to time it may be necessary to seek additional information if the particular circumstances of a case require it.Once I am satisfied I have sufficient information to make my decision, I then decide in my absolute discretion whether to grant or refuse an application based upon all of the information presented to me.

As a result, any decision taken in relation to the adult brother of the person concerned applied equally to the person concerned.The brother of the person concerned was granted permission to remain in the State on the basis of his marriage to an Irish national, until 26 May 2000. This permission was subsequently renewed until 26 May 2001. This permission also applied to the person concerned. The person concerned formally withdrew his asylum application on 24 June 1999.The adult brother of the person concerned and his Irish spouse separated in 2000 and, as a consequence, his application for renewal of his permission to remain in the State was refused. This decision applied equally to the person concerned.In 2003, the person concerned applied for a certificate of naturalisation but this application was refused as the person concerned was deemed to have insufficient periods of legal/reckonable residence in the State.The marriage of the adult brother of the person concerned was annulled by Court Order dated 22 June 2004. As a result,  a notice of intention to deport letter, as provided for under Section 3 of the Immigration Act, 1999 (as amended), issued to the person concerned on 3 August 2004.The case of the person concerned was examined under Section 3 (6) of the Immigration Act, 1999, as amended, and Section 5 of the Refugee Act, 1996, as amended, on the prohibition of refoulement following which, on 1 December 2005, the then Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform signed a Deportation Order in respect of him. Notice of this Order was served on 7 December 2005. The person concerned was deported the following day.In early 2009, the person concerned applied for a visa at the Visa Office in the Irish Embassy in London. This application was refused. The decision to refuse the visa application, and the reasons for refusal, was conveyed in writing to the person concerned by letter dated 3 February 2009. The visa application was refused because the person concerned remains the subject of a Deportation Order.It is open to the person concerned to submit an appeal addressing the stated refusal reason within two months of the date of this notification, in this case before 3 April 2009.  Outside of this time frame a fresh visa application must be made.The communication included as part of this Parliamentary Question has requested the revocation of the Deportation Order. This request will shortly be considered by Officials in my Department. When a decision has been made on this request, this will be conveyed in writing to the person concerned.

The objective of the Regulations is to ensure that members of the Garda Síochána act with due respect for the dignity and personal rights of persons in custody.  The Regulations include provision for the assignment of a member of the Garda Síochána in each Garda station to be responsible for ensuring that the treatment of persons in custody is in accordance with the Regulations.The responsibilities conferred by the Regulations on members include provisions which are designed to ensure the welfare of persons in custody and to ensure that persons receive medical treatment from a doctor where necessary (regulation 21).  Failure to comply with the Regulations on the part of a member of the Garda Síochána constitutes a breach of discipline.

#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-03-11 00:00:00	Prelude	539	A passport application was received by the Passport Office in respect of the person in question on 25 November 2006. The applicant's mother stated that the applicant's father was born in Ireland and that the applicant was, therefore, an Irish citizen and thus entitled to an Irish passport. The person identified as the child's father died prior to the child's birth.  Section 7 of the Passports Act 2008 requires that the Minister for Foreign Affairs shall be satisfied that a person is an Irish citizen before issuing a passport.  Proofs of identity and entitlement to citizenship are required in respect of all passport applications.In the case in question, the applicant's mother provided certain documentation as evidence of entitlement to citizenship which purported to establish the identity of the applicant's father. These documents were insufficient to confirm that the individual named by the applicant's mother is the father of the applicant.  The Department wrote to the applicant's mother on 10 January 2007 to inform her that, pending the receipt of satisfactory evidence of Irish citizenship, it was unable to issue a passport to the applicant. The Department outlined the proofs required to establish citizenship.In March 2007, in response to further queries from the applicant's mother, the Department explained further how the relevant proofs might be obtained and took the additional step of contacting the Legal Aid Board on her behalf. However, my Department received no further correspondence on behalf of the applicant.Two years passed before the appearance on 1 March of the newspaper articles referred to by the Deputy. In these articles, it is reported that a brother of the person through whom Irish citizenship is claimed has prepared an affidavit acknowledging the applicant as his brother's daughter and that he has offered to undergo DNA tests to support the child's right to citizenship. No such affidavit has been received by the Department, nor, prior to the appearance of the newspaper articles, had there been any contact from the family of the person through whom citizenship is claimed.Last week, a member of the family made contact with the Department on this matter.  The Department will liaise with this family member and the applicant's mother to assist them in establishing whether the applicant is entitled to Irish citizenship.  My Department has at all times sought to be of assistance to the applicant and her mother, within the constraints of its legal obligations, and will gladly issue a passport to the applicant if citizenship can be established.

#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-03-11 00:00:00	Prelude	549	The back to education allowance (BTEA) scheme is designed to help those in receipt of a social welfare payment who have not worked for a period of time to improve their employability and job-readiness by acquiring educational qualifications. It is in recognition of the special difficulties which such persons can face when attempting to gain a foothold in the labour market. The scheme enables qualified people who have been getting a social welfare payment to continue to receive a payment while pursuing an approved full-time education course.To qualify for participation, an applicant must be in receipt of a relevant social welfare payment and be at least 21 years of age prior to commencing an approved course of study. However, lone parents and persons in receipt of unemployment payments can qualify before 21 years of age provided they are out of formal education for at least 2 years. In general, an applicant must be in receipt of a relevant Social Welfare payment for 6 months if pursuing a second level course or 12 months if pursuing a third level course. In order to support activation of the unemployed, the qualifying period for the third level option is reduced to 9 months for persons who are participating in the National Employment Action Plan process.People who are awarded statutory redundancy may access the scheme immediately, provided an entitlement to a relevant social welfare payment is established prior to commencing an approved course of study.  Recipients of Jobseeker's Allowance or Jobseeker's Benefit who qualify for participation in the back to education scheme must provide written confirmation from the relevant institute of education that they are registered as full-time students. They are not required to sign-on the Live Register while attending an approved course of study.The requirement to be in receipt of a social welfare payment for a minimum period has always been a feature of the scheme. A waiting period is considered essential to confer entitlement to income support for an indefinite period and is considered necessary in the context of targeting scarce resources at those who need it most. The scheme will continue to be monitored in the light of the changed economic circumstances to ensure that it continues to meet its objectives.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-03-11 00:00:00	Prelude	550	There are two strands of the back to work scheme; back to work enterprise allowance (BTWEA) for self employed and back to work allowance (BTWA) for employees. The allowance is payable at a tapered rate of the qualifying payment. The self employed strand is payable at 100% of the qualifying payment in year one, 75% in year two, 50% in year three, and 25% in year four. Participants on the employee strand receive 75% of the qualifying payment in year one, 50% in year two, and 25% in year three.In 2008, the total expenditure on the scheme was €73.14m and at the end of December 2008 there were 8,162 participants of whom 4,604 were availing of the self-employment option. A total of €80.34m has been provided for the scheme in 2009.  Based on figures available, the average weekly cost per person on the back to work scheme is €165.49. It is estimated that the annual cost of an additional 100 people on the back to work allowance is in the region of €877,000.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-03-11 00:00:00	Prelude	551	During 2008 an interdepartmental group, chaired by the Department of the Taoiseach, with secretariat support provided by my Department, undertook work, including a public consultation process to develop a National Carers' Strategy. While a number of drafts were produced covering the areas outlined in the terms of reference, a final text was not completed by the working group.Faced with the current economic situation, it was not possible to set targets or time lines which could be achieved. In that context, rather than publishing a document which did not include any significant plans for the future, the Government decided not to publish a strategy at this time.  I appreciate that it is disappointing for carers and the people for whom they care. I met with some of their representatives last week to inform them of this difficult decision taken by Government.  The Government is acutely aware of the sacrifices made by carers and has sought to make many improvements in services and supports for carers.Over the past decade weekly payment rates to carers have greatly increased, qualifying conditions for carer's allowance have significantly eased, coverage of the scheme has been extended and new schemes such as carer's benefit, half-rate carer's allowance and the respite care grant have been introduced and extended.In relation to income supports, in Budget 2009, I increased the rate of carer's allowance for those aged 66 or over by €7 to €239 per week and for those aged under 66 by €6.50 to €220.50 per week. These increases took effect from January 2009.  Recipients of carer's allowance are also eligible for household benefits and free travel and the respite care grant.  It is estimated that the combined expenditure on carer's allowance, carer's benefit, the respite care grant and half-rate carer's allowance will be €650 million in 2009.  The Department of Social and Family Affairs is committed to continuing to work with the carer representative groups to deliver services in the most effective way and to support the carer groups in the valuable work they do in helping carers.

All ten helicopters are based at Casement Aerodrome, Baldonnel. There are no Air Corps helicopters based overseas.The eight military helicopters are operated by the Air Corps in a general purpose military operational and training role. Primary taskings include security, aid to the civil power, military exercises, infantry interoperability training and limited troop transport. They are also used to perform air ambulance, inland Search and Rescue, aid to the civil authorities, community support, ministerial and VIP transport tasks.Air Corps helicopters are used from time to time for ministerial air transport in situations where, for operational reasons, fixed wing aircraft may not be available, the point of destination may not be close to an airport and in circumstances where there is a requirement for greater flexibility than can be delivered by fixed wing aircraft. In 2008, ministerial transport represented approximately 5% of total helicopter flying hours. Requests for Ministerial use of helicopters are subject to the prior approval of An Taoiseach. Once approved, all operational matters are settled directly between the office of the Minister in question and the Department of Defence or Air Corps.Details of Ministerial use of Air Corps helicopters since 1 January 2008 is set out in the following table.  The Department of Defence follows the normal practice in the aviation business of costing aircraft by reference to the cost per flying hour under either of two headings:(a) The direct cost, i.e. the costs which are additional to those associated with having the aircraft and which only arise when the aircraft is flown including maintenance, fuel and support services; and(b) The total cost, i.e. the direct cost plus the costs associated with having the aircraft, i.e. depreciation and personnel costsThe current rates per hour used to establish these costs in relation to helicopters are also set out in the tabular statements. The costs are an approximation to actual costs.DateAircraftMinisterial  Time On BoardRouteRequesting Minister31/01/2008EC 13580Phoenix Park – Templemore – Phoenix ParkJustice, Equality and Law Reform01/02/2008AW 13990Baldonnel – Mullingar Barracks –   Galgorm Manor Ballymena – St Patricks Drumcondra –  BaldonnelAn Taoiseach08/02/2008AW 13940St Patricks Drumcondra  – WaterfordAn Taoiseach23/03/2008EC 135100Sarsfield Barracks – Phoenix Park – Sarsfield BarracksDefence25/03/2008EC 13560Kilkenny Barracks – Farranfore, KillarneyEducation & Science26/03/2008EC 135120Killarney, Farranfore – Wexford – BaldonnelEducation & Science04/04/2008EC 13530St Patricks, Drumcondra – Ritz Carlton Powerscourt  – Phoenix ParkAn Taoiseach11/04/2008EC 135100St Patricks, Drumcondra – Ashford Castle – St Patricks, DrumcondraAn Taoiseach11/04/2008EC 13545Galway – Phoenix ParkHealth14/04/2008EC 13550Sarsfield Barracks – Phoenix ParkDefence09/04/2008EC 13555Baldonnel – GalwayHealth17/04/2008EC 13530Phoenix Park – Ballyraggart KilkennyAgriculture Fisheries & Food18/04/2008EC 13570Mount Juliet – Finner CampAgriculture Fisheries & Food29/04/2008EC 13520Phoenix Park – Mount Wolsely Hotel CarlowJustice, Equality and Law Reform01/05/2008AW 139115Baldonnel – Sarsfield Barracks – Sligo Airport – Finner – Sarsfield Barracks – BaldonnelDefence01/05/2008AW 13960Baldonnel – Kilkenny Barracks – BaldonnelJustice Equality & Law Reform30/05/2008AW 139100Sarsfield Barracks – Phoenix Park – Sarsfield BarracksDefence29/05/2008EC135120Dundalk Barracks – Waterford Airport – Dundalk BarracksJustice Equality & Law Reform30/05/2008AW 13990UCD – CastleislandHealth10/06/2008EC 13570Sarsfield Barracks – Curragh – Sarsfield BarracksDefence19/06/2008EC 135100Sarsfield Barracks – Baldonnel – Sarsfield BarracksDefence15/08/2008AW 13980Baldonnel – Omagh (Lisanelly) – Tullamore (Harriers) – BaldonnelTaoiseach26/08/2008AW 139100Sarsfield Barracks (Limerick) – Curragh Camp – Sarsfield BarracksDefence05/09/2008EC13555Knock Airport – Waterford AirportArts,Sports &Tourism10/09/2008EC13540Phoenix Park – Kilkenny CastleDefence12/09/2008EC13580Sarsfield Barracks (Limerick) – Phoenix Park –  Sarsfield Barracks (Limerick)Defence13/09/2008AW 13960Frosses Football Pitch (Donegal) – City West Hotel (Dublin)Tanaiste (Enterprise Trade & Employment)23/09/2008AW 13945Farmleigh House – Cuffesgrange (Kilkenny) – Tullamore (Harriers) – CurraghTaoiseach23/09/2008AW 13945Baldonnel – Cuffesgrange (Kilkenny) – BaldonnelTanaiste (Enterprise Trade & Employment)03/10/2008AW 13985St Pats (Drumcondra) – Cork (UCC) – Tullamore (Harriers) – BaldonnelTaoiseach31/10/2008EC 135100Trim (New GAA Pitch) – Foynes GAA Pitch (Limerick) – Trim (New GAA Pitch)Transport04/11/2008AW 13970Phoenix Park – Lough Erne Hotel (Enniskillen) – Dundalk Barracks – BaldonnelJustice08/11/2008AW 139100Sarsfield Barracks (Limerick) – Tullamore(Harriers) – Phoenix Park – Tullamore (Harriers) – Sarsfield Barracks (Limerick)Taoiseach/Defence30/11/2008EC13565Baldonnel – Tullamore (Harriers) – Race Course Wexford – Kilkenny BarracksTaoiseach05/12/2008AW 139120Baldonnel – Dundalk Barracks – Sarsfield Barracks – Dundalk Barracks – BaldonnelJustice, Equality & Law Reform04/12/2008AW 13960Phoenix Park – Cork AirportTanaiste09/12/2008AW 139100Baldonnel – Galway – BaldonnelEducation & ScienceDateAircraftMinisterial  Time On BoardRouteRequesting Minister30/01/2009AW139120Baldonnel – Dundalk Barracks – Clanree Hotel (Letterkenny) – Dundalk Barracks – BaldonnelJustice, Equality & Law Reform29/01/2009AW13945Belfast City – BaldonnelForeign Affairs06/02/2009AW13990Knightsbrook Hotel, Trim – Shannon – Knightsbrook Hotel, TrimTransport23/02/2009AW13945Shannon Airport – Trim GAA PitchTransport02/03/2009AW139110Baldonnel – Waterford Airport – Killarney/ Farranfore Airport – BaldonnelArts Sport & TourismThe costs associated with Air Corps helicopters used in provision of Ministerial Air Transport Service are as follows:AircraftAverage Direct Cost Per HourAverage Total Cost Per Hour€€EC 1354301,590AW 1391,4703,130

The facility whereby a member of the Permanent Defence Force could apply for a driving licence on foot of a military driving permit was introduced by virtue of the Road Traffic (Licensing of Drivers) (Amendment) (No. 2) Regulations, 1980 (S.I. No. 334 of 1980) and applied only to those permit holders who were members of the Permanent Defence Forces within the  five years preceding the application .  As the individual concerned was discharged from the Permanent Defence Force in 1972 he was not eligible to apply for a driving licence under this provision.The facility whereby a member of the Reserve Defence Force could also apply for a driving licence on foot of a military driving permit was introduced by virtue of the Road Traffic (Licensing of Drivers) Regulations, 1999 (S.I. No. 352 of 1999) and similarly applied only to those permit holders who were members of the Defence Forces in the five years preceding the application.  As the individual concerned was discharged from the reserve in 1981 he was not eligible to apply for a driving licence under this provision.Having regard to the above, I do not consider that any change to the individual's service record is warranted.

#JohnGormley	unknown-#JohnGormley-party	unknown-#JohnGormley-dob	unknown-#JohnGormley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-03-11 00:00:00	Prelude	557	Part E (Sound) of the Building Regulations sets out the requirements in relation to sound insulation in buildings, including dwellings. Technical Guidance Document E (TGD-E) provides guidance on how to comply with Part E.Responsibility for compliance with the Regulations is a matter for the owner or builder of a building. Responsibility for enforcement of the Regulations rests with the 37 local Building Control Authorities.A tenant in private rented residential accommodation is entitled to refer a dispute to the Private Residential Tenancies Board (PRTB), provided that the matter is within the obligations of the landlord in the first place. In this regard, Section 16(h) of the Residential Tenancies Act 2004 provides that a tenant shall not behave in an anti-social way which, under Section 17(1) (c) can mean "persistent behaviour that prevents or interferes with the peaceful occupation of a dwelling". A complaint can, therefore, be brought to the PRTB on noise grounds.In relation to local authority tenants, the management and maintenance of Local Authority housing stock is a matter for each individual Authority under Section 58 (1) of the Housing Act, 1966.  If a Local Authority tenant is a cause of noise, this should be covered by the tenancy agreement. Under Article 83 (1) (i) of the Housing Regulations 1980, amongst the conditions of tenancy are that the tenant shall not cause any nuisance or be guilty of or permit any conduct likely to cause annoyance or disturbance to neighbours.While there is already a wide range of measures in place to deal with noise from a variety of sources, I am currently preparing proposals to strengthen the existing legislation on noise pollution in accordance with the commitment in the Programme for Government. I intend that the new legislation will take a more integrated approach to the subject.  There will be a greater emphasis on Codes of Practice for construction, commercial and domestic situations.  Local Authorities will have stronger enforcement powers to deal with nuisances from particular noise sources, such as continuously sounding alarms, and I also see the need to extend the powers of An Garda Síochána in certain circumstances.  There will, in addition, be measures to increase awareness of noise nuisance and of how it can be remedied.

This represents 103,000 active landlords and some 362,000 active tenants. It is not possible to estimate the number of landlords who have yet to comply with the registration requirements of the Residential Tenancies Act 2004. It is nonetheless noteworthy to compare the number of tenancies now registered with the previous system of registration with local authorities when registrations did not exceed 30,000.The PRTB enforces registration requirements in accordance with the provisions of the Residential Tenancies Act 2004, specifically sections 144 and 145 which provide for the issuing of notices to landlords and/or occupiers of the dwellings in question, and the prosecution of offenders for non-compliance with the registration requirement. Since 2004, the Board has examined almost 8,000 cases of non-registration and has subsequently issued over 11,000 enforcement notices to landlords and/or occupiers of dwellings.

In carrying out these assessments, authorities take a range of factors into account, including:relevant national and EU environmental and public health water quality statutory requirements and standards, including the requirements of the Urban Wastewater Treatment Regulations, 2001,relevant reports and studies such as the National Urban Waste Water Study and any similar studies/reports commissioned locally,relevant reports produced by the Environmental Protection Agency on water quality and urban wastewater discharges,the adequacy of existing collection networks and, in the case of anticipated development, the adequacy of the capacity of existing treatment plants, andcontinued support for economic activity and the National Spatial Strategy.The last needs assessments produced by Water Services Authorities were taken into account in the selection and scheduling of the schemes approved for funding under my Department's Water Services Investment Programme 2007-2009, which is available in the Oireachtas Library.  I envisage that further needs assessments will be undertaken this year as an input to an updated Water Services Investment Programme.In addition, my Department allocates annual block grants to Water Services Authorities under the devolved Rural Water Programme on the basis of prioritised work programmes. Additional information in relation to progress on individual projects under the Water Services Investment and Rural Water Programmes may be obtained from the relevant Water Services Authority.The continued high level of capital investment in the water services sector in recent years, involving Exchequer expenditure of €4.15 billion in the period 2000 — 2008, is a clear statement of the priority assigned by Government to the preservation and protection of our water resources, to meeting EU standards for drinking water and wastewater treatment and to providing critical new water and wastewater infrastructure.

#SeanPower	unknown-#SeanPower-party	unknown-#SeanPower-dob	unknown-#SeanPower-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2009-03-11 00:00:00	Prelude	569	I propose to take Questions Nos. 192 and 193 together.Following scientific research conducted by the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea (ICES), indicating that the European eel stocks are in a critical state, the EU introduced Council Regulation 1100/2007, the objective of which is to achieve recovery of the stocks to previous high levels.  The Regulation requires the Irish authorities to prepare a national Eel Management Plan for implementation from 1 July 2009 or from the earliest possible time before that date.The Regulation does not require transposition into Irish law and the Minister already has powers under the Fisheries Acts to conserve and protect inland fisheries stocks. In the circumstances, a Regulatory Impact Assessment (RIA) was not required. Given that the Eel Regulation did not constitute a significant regulation under the RIA Guidelines a screening RIA was not appropriate either. The Department did, however, carry out a public consultation on the draft eel management plan in 2008. Some 16 submissions were received largely from eel fishermen representatives and, while acknowledging the decline in stocks, these sought to continue fishing.The impact assessment published in November 2005, when the Council Regulation was first introduced by the EU Commission, recognised the conservation measures that might be employed including reduction in fishing, increases in restocking, improvements in water quality, modification to dams and turbines and assisted migration as measures that could form part of eel management plans, all of which have different social and economic consequences.  It also identified that "the key element to retain is that a failure to act will result in a disappearance of all eel fishing and aquaculture sectors if the stock decline continues".The EU target is clearly defined in the Regulation where it states that the objective of each Member State's Eel Management Plan shall be to reduce anthropogenic mortalities so as to permit with high probability the escapement to sea of at least 40% of the silver eel biomass relative to the best estimate of escapement that would have existed if no anthropogenic influences had impacted the stock. In other words, the Regulation requires that 4kg of eels escape to sea for every 10kg that would have escaped if people didn't kill any or stop any migrating, and the number of elvers coming into the water was as high as it ever was.Ireland's level of escapement is currently estimated at only 24%.  Given the critical status of the eel stock, as demonstrated in the assessment contained in the draft National Eel Management Plan, a number of management measures have been identified as necessary to reach the target set in the EC Regulation, including closure of the commercial and recreational fishery from 2009.  It is also necessary to mitigate the impact of hydropower on escapement, to ensure upstream migration of juvenile eel at barriers and to improve water quality.The decision to cease the eel fishery was taken, based on the best scientific advice available (the nature of which I have elaborated on in replies to recent Parliamentary Questions), as a conservation measure to support a recovery of the stock in the shortest time possible.  I am advised that if all measures proposed are adopted and if other EU Member States take a similar conservative approach, the recovery period  could be as long as 90 years (i.e. an average of 4 eel generations).  A partial closure of the fishery or a more relaxed approach to the other management measures would have extended this recovery period to a very significant extent.Over the coming months, Ireland's draft eel management plan, along with those of other Member States, has to be evaluated by the European Commission as to their adequacy in delivering the objectives of the Eel Regulation. Neither I nor the Department has received any indications as to the Commission's attitude to the plan to date.Under the Regulation, all aspects of the plan must be reviewed in 2012.  This review will consider, inter alia, whether the eel fishery and market could be reopened in any river basin district in light of the data gathered in the interim and the performance of the stocks.  When the last 20 years of poor recruitment is taken into account, I am advised that it is likely that the adult eel stock in Irish waters will continue to decline for at least the next decade.I am aware that the closure of the fishery will have an impact on licensed eel fishermen who have been actively fishing and I have requested that the Central Fisheries Board and BIM explore diversification options with eel fishermen representatives. The Trap and Transport operations to be undertaken by the ESB, as mitigation of the impact of hydropower schemes as part of the draft plan, may also offer opportunities for a limited number of eel fishermen.

The three-pronged Programme underpins the Government's commitment to improve the energy efficiency of our housing stock whilst reducing our carbon emissions and creating employment in the energy services sector.The Home Energy Saving (HES) Scheme is the largest element of the Programme with a budget of €50 million in 2009.  This scheme has the potential to support the upgrade of in excess of 27,500 homes in 2009.  Sustainable Energy Ireland (SEI) estimates that demand for this scheme could ultimately exceed 100,000 homes.Homeowners can expect to save up to €700 per year on their energy bills if they install the full suite of measures available under the scheme.  The scheme offers grants of up to 40% of the typical cost of energy efficiency upgrade measures, varying depending on the measure concerned.  A list of eligible measures and fixed grant rates is set out in the following table.MeasureFixed grant rate€Roof Insulation250Cavity Wall Insulation400Internal Wall Insulation2,500External Wall Insulation4,000High Efficiency Boiler with Heating Controls Upgrade700Heating Controls Upgrade Only500Building Energy Rating Assessment200The scheme is open to anybody owning a house that was built prior to 2006.  Homeowners and landlords will be able to apply under the scheme later this month.  In the meantime, homeowners can register their interest with SEI or at hes@sei.ie.  Homeowners may arrange to have a building energy rating carried out immediately, if they wish, but this is not a requirement for participation in the scheme.  However, homeowners should not undertake work until they have received grant approval from SEI.The National Insulation Programme for Economic Recovery will also greatly assist those on low incomes or in social housing.  The second element of the Programme, the Warmer Homes Scheme (WHS), is designed to assist private households on low incomes, such as those in receipt of Fuel Allowance, Invalidity or Disability Benefit.  The scheme provides for the installation of a range of energy efficiency measures, including cavity wall insulation, attic insulation, boiler lagging jackets, draught proofing measures and Compact Fluorescent Lamps (CFLs).  Advice is also provided to householders on minimising energy use.  The WHS provides these measures free or at a nominal cost to the householder.Some €20 million has been made available to the WHS in 2009.  This greatly increased level of funding is expected to support energy efficiency interventions in up to 15,000 low income homes in this year alone.  There are 21 community based organisations (CBOs) currently delivering the WHS which represents just over two-thirds of the country.  Under our initiative to extend the scheme nationwide in 2009, SEI plans to commence the introduction of new CBOs to the scheme from the end of March 2009.A number of improvements to the WHS have been introduced over the past few months, including a new free-phone service designed to assist eligible homeowners in identifying their nearest provider.  If outside of current coverage, their details are be recorded and notified as soon as the service becomes available in their area.  In addition, a new website — www.wellandwarm.ie — has been launched, which allows homeowners, neighbours and relatives to find out more information about the WHS and a range of other measures that are available to those most in need.  A complementary information booklet — Keep Well and Warm — has also been published this month and will be widely disseminated.Further information on the WHS is available by calling 1800-250204, by emailing warmerhomes@sei.ie or at www.sei.ie/Grants/Warmer_Homes_Scheme.The third element of the National Insulation Programme for Economic Recovery will involve providing similar energy efficiency upgrade measures in social housing.  Improving the energy efficiency of local authority housing is a key objective for the Government, and to that end, a fund of some €50m has been set aside in 2009 to support the development and implementation of a comprehensive energy efficiency programme.  This programme will include a number of elements including support for the first round of Towards Carbon Neutral and insulation retrofitting projects.  In addition, the funding will be used to assist local authorities in improving the energy rating of dwellings due to be re-let during the year and to advance the overall energy efficiency in apartment complexes.  The Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government will be making further announcements on this element of the programme in due course.

A licence for an initial period of six months was issued in 2005 and a further licence for a three year period to 31 December 2008 was issued in 2006. The award of the licence was not subjected to the tender process. When the licence expired the licensee was legally entitled to the option to renew the licence and chose to exercise that option. As a result the licence was renewed for a further term of one year and the issue of the licence being put to tender did not arise. The position with regard to 2010 is under review and no decision has yet been made with regard to the issue of a licence.

#BattOKeeffe	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-party	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2009-03-11 00:00:00	Prelude	589	I propose to take Questions Nos. 215, 220 and 221 together.I have consistently said that the 2009 Budget required difficult choices to be made across all areas of public expenditure. These decisions were made to control public expenditure and to ensure sustainability in the long run. In this respect Education while protected to a much greater extent than most other areas of public expenditure could not be totally spared. The various impacts at school level were included in the Budget day announcements. Even with the Budget measures in place there will still be a significantly increased borrowing requirement in 2009.The budget measures will impact on individual schools in different ways depending on whether enrolment is rising or declining and the degree to which any one school has more teachers than it is entitled to under the allocation processes. In terms of the position at individual school level the key factor for determining the level of resources provided by my Department is the pupil enrolment at 30 September 2008. The annual process of seeking this enrolment data from schools took place in the autumn and the data have since been received and processed in my Department enabling the commencement of the processes by which teaching resources are allocated to schools for the school year that begins next September.My Department has written to the primary schools that are projected to have a net loss or gain in classroom teaching posts in September, 2009 including the schools referred to by the Deputies. As part of my efforts to ensure that relevant information is openly available to the public detailed information on the opening position for primary schools is now published on my Department's website. This provisional list sets out the details on individual schools that, taken collectively, are projected to gain 128 posts and to lose 382 posts — a net reduction of 254 posts. It is my intention to have this information updated and ultimately to set out the final position when the allocation processes are completed.The above allocations are provisional at this stage and reflect the initial allocation position. The final position for any one school will depend on a number of other factors such as additional posts for schools that are developing rapidly and posts allocated as a result of the appeals processes. The operation of redeployment arrangements also impacts on the final position as a teacher can remain in his or her existing school where a suitable redeployment position does not exist. The final staffing position for all schools will therefore not be known until the autumn. At that stage the allocation process will be fully completed for mainstream classroom teachers and appeals to the Staffing Appeals Board including any appeals submitted by the schools referred to by the Deputies will have been considered. It is open to any primary school Board of Management to submit an appeal under certain criteria to the independent Appeal Board which was established to adjudicate on appeals on mainstream staffing allocations in primary schools. Details of the criteria and application dates for appeal are contained in the staffing schedule, Circular 0002/2009, available on my Department's website.The Appeal Board meets in May, July and October each year to consider cases submitted. Appeals must be submitted to Primary Allocations Section, Department of Education and Science, Athlone, on the standard application form, clearly stating the criterion under which the appeal is being made. The standard application form is available on my Department's website. Closing dates for receipt of staffing appeals in the current year are 29 April, 29 May and 9 October 2009. The Appeal Board operates independently of the Department and its decision is final.

The review of catchment boundaries in County Limerick, will be considered in  the context of this Plan and in the light of the outcome of the Value for Money Review of the School Transport Scheme, including catchment boundaries, being carried out as part of the 2009-2011 round of Value for Money Reviews approved by Government. The Steering Committee, which I established in mid-January, will look at the original objectives of the scheme, whether these objectives remain valid today, the extent to which the objectives are being achieved and whether there are possibilities for economies or efficiencies that would improve the value for money of the scheme. In this context, the review will also look at fundamental issues such as catchment boundaries. The review, when completed, will be published and submitted to the Oireachtas Select Committee on Education and Science.

#BattOKeeffe	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-party	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-03-11 00:00:00	Prelude	592	There will be no pupil with a special educational need who will be without access to a special needs teacher as a result of the decision to apply the normal rules which govern the appointment and retention of teachers of special classes for pupils with a mild general learning disability. These special classes which are to close predate the 2005 General Allocation Model of allocating additional teacher support to schools to enable them to meet the needs of pupils with mild general learning disabilities as well as a number of other high incidence disabilities. All primary schools now have additional teaching support in place for this purpose. All primary schools were allocated additional teaching resources under the General Allocation Model to enable them support pupils with high incidence special educational needs including mild general learning disability (MGLD). Schools can decide how best to use this allocation based on the needs of the pupils. Most pupils with a MGLD are included in ordinary classes with their peers and are supported by their class teacher. The curriculum is flexible so that teachers can cater for the needs of children of different abilities.Teacher allocations to schools typically increase or decrease depending on pupil enrolment. In the case of classes for MGLD the normal pupil teacher ratio that applies is 11:1. My Department however permits schools to retain a teaching post where it has a minimum of 9 pupils in the class. This minimum was not fulfilled in the school referred to by the Deputy. Therefore, the school no longer qualifies to retain the class. When the General Allocation Model was introduced, schools with additional teachers in classes for MGLD were allowed to retain the teachers for these classes. Effectively, these schools received a double allocation. The number of these special classes has decreased since 2005 in line with falling numbers as pupils are supported through the additional teaching allocation provided and schools have integrated the children into age-appropriate mainstream classes. All of the other primary schools in the country who do not have classes for children with MGLD cater for these pupils from within the General Allocation Model. Pupils with a mild general learning disability have, and will continue to have access to additional teaching resources to support their education.

Circular 0064/2008 invited applications from schools for the 2008/2009 school year. The management authority of each school carries responsibility for making decisions regarding the Transition Year Programme in that school. Guidelines have been issued by my Department to support schools in this process. In some schools, the programme is compulsory for all students. In those that offer it as an option, circumstances may arise where it is necessary to limit the number of students who can avail of it. It is the board of management of each individual school that decides the number of places available to students on programmes such as Transition Year. In cases where restrictions apply, schools should have clear procedures regarding how places are allocated to students.

These bodies do not refer individual applications to my Department except, in exceptional cases, where, for example, advice or instruction regarding a particular clause in the relevant scheme is required. If an individual applicant considers that she/he has been unjustly refused a maintenance grant, or that the rate of grant awarded is not the correct one, she/he may appeal, in the first instance, to the local authority or VEC. Where an individual applicant has had an appeal turned down, in writing, by the assessing authority and remains of the view that the body has not interpreted the schemes correctly in his/her case, an appeal form outlining the position may be submitted by the applicant to my Department.The Back to Education Allowance (BTEA) is a second chance education opportunities scheme designed to encourage and facilitate people on certain social welfare payments to improve their skills and qualifications and, therefore, their prospects of returning to the work force. Eligibility for the Back to Education Allowance and associated payments is determined and administered by the Department of Social and Family Affairs.
