#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-06-25 00:00:00	Prelude	0	One thing we can be sure of is that the stamp of Fianna Fáil's failure in Government over the past ten years has been an obscene waste of public money.  Yesterday's ESRI report confirms in its own words that the Government has blown the boom.  The Minister for Finance, Deputy Brian Lenihan, responded to this by saying we must take prudent, transparent and immediate action, as distinct from what the Taoiseach said.  Many will ask where all this money has gone and what has accounted for this wastage.  In many cases, it is made up of relatively small amounts over a broad range.  One of the areas that accounts for this wastage is the plethora of agencies and unaccountable bodies established by the Government, for example, FÁS.  When unemployment was falling, the FÁS budget increased and is now €1 billion.  The recent special report of the Comptroller and Auditor General highlighted serious concerns and questions about how FÁS spends its €9 million on advertising and PR.Following up on that report, Deputy Varadkar of Fine Gael sought, under the Freedom of Information Act, the details of some of those concerns.  It shows that a senior executive in FÁS responsible for its €9 million PR and advertising budget placed most of the campaign advertisements himself, despite the fact that FÁS employs an advertising agency which secures a remit from every advertisement placed.  It is like keeping a dog and barking oneself.  The documents Deputy Varadkar received in recent days show one instance where €100,000 of taxpayers' money was spent on advertising in one local newspaper, which is completely contrary to the normal policy of FÁS in dealing with national advertising.  When asked about this unusual arrangement, there was a straightforward conflict of evidence between the official involved and his director general.  Their evidence was directly contradictory.  The official said the director general told him to place this advertisement.  This is an example of sloppy management of the public's money.  In the context of the Minister for Finance saying we must take prudent action, is this the kind of area in which the Taoiseach will see to it that a stop is put to the mismanagement of the spending of taxpayers' money, given the challenges we face?

#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-06-25 00:00:00	Prelude	2	Obviously I do not know the specifics set out by Deputy Kenny.  If FÁS has a budget of €900 million and its advertising budget is 1% of that, €9 million, obviously one wants to get value for money from it.  FÁS is involved in the important work of reskilling and bringing opportunities to the public's attention, particularly to those who are not in the workforce and who are socially excluded and require assistance in reskilling and finding job opportunities.  FÁS has played a very good role in that effort and has been addressing itself to the new agenda that arises.  Now that we have seen unemployment rise again, relatively speaking, in recent times, Deputy Kenny can be assured that FÁS and its skills will be required on a continuous basis.I cannot comment on the specific issue that is being raised except to say that the concentration of Government activity has to be on the current side to get value for money and to bring to public attention, however one can and as economically as possible, the job FÁS does to ensure those who can avail of those services do so.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-06-25 00:00:00	Prelude	3	I accept the Taoiseach could not possibly know the individual incidences of every agency or quango around the country.  My point is that following Deputy Varadkar's investigation the freedom of information material given to him clearly shows that the opinion of the FÁS executive, who is responsible for a €9 million advertising and PR budget, is that having control of that spend could influence how FÁS is portrayed in the newspapers.  If one turns that around, it is using public money to buy influence in newspapers.  That is not what the FÁS training agency should be about and it does down the very good work and good people who work in FÁS throughout the country.

#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-06-25 00:00:00	Prelude	5	This is not how public money should be spent.  The Comptroller and Auditor General's report, accessed under freedom of information legislation, clearly indicates directly contradictory evidence.  These papers are being made available to the Committee of Public Accounts and I will send them on to the Taoiseach.I ask the Taoiseach to act on this information and consult, through the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, the Garda, which is investigating this matter, to see that in this instance nothing is happening in FÁS that should not happen and that the public can expect to get value for its taxes in this area.  A budget of €9 million for advertising and PR might be small money to Fianna Fáil, but it is an important budget.  It is in the control of one executive who placed most of the advertisements himself.  There is a Garda investigation going on.  I would like to think that, beginning with the Minister, Deputy Brian Lenihan's, prudent and direct action, this kind of area, for one, would be dealt with by the Taoiseach.  From that chair, he recently said sotto voce to call them in.  Somebody might see to it that this activity is strictly in line with the criteria for getting best value for taxpayers’ money.  I would like the Taoiseach to comment.

#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-06-25 00:00:00	Prelude	13	I want to return to the serious state of the economy and to focus in particular on the role of the banks in the economy at present.  When the Irish economy was booming, the banks were in the driving seat.  One could get a loan for anything and they were pushing money at people.  However, now that the economic circumstances have changed somewhat, the tune of the banks has also changed and it appears they are now behaving in a way that may add to our economic difficulties.I am hearing from businesses, big and small, that when loan review dates come up, the banks are in to reduce the facility, change the terms, add on extra charges and increase interest rates without waiting for the changes made by the European Central Bank.  Businesses starting up anew or which are expanding find that, in effect, the banks are now closed to new businesses.  In the new economic circumstances in which we find ourselves, it appears the banks are squeezing the life out of many businesses in this country and putting jobs at risk.I do not expect the banks to act in a way that is not commercial or not responsible to their shareholders.  However, they could apply their credit policies in a more measured and sensitive way in the new circumstances in which we find ourselves.  I would have thought it must be in the banks' own long-term interest to ensure the Irish economy gets through the more difficult times it is now in.  The banks need to look at the wider picture rather than just their own quarterly returns.Has the Taoiseach had discussions with the major banking organisations in this country with a view to getting them to look at the bigger economic picture and behave in a more measured, responsible and sensitive way at this time?  The Taoiseach has been good to the banks.  I recall that in the 2005 budget, for example, he abolished the bank levy, which at the time was worth approximately €103 million per year of a benefit to the banks.  The banks did very well when the Irish economy was doing well.  They made huge profits, and the four larger banking groups made most of their profits here in the Irish economy.Will the Taoiseach exercise leadership with regard to the banks?  Will he call in the major banking organisations, have a discussion with them and persuade them to act in a more measured, reasonable and sensitive way with Irish business at this very difficult time?  In this way, the banks and their lending and credit policies could be made to become part of the solution to our economic difficulties rather than adding to the problem, as, frankly, they are doing at present.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-06-25 00:00:00	Prelude	14	In my previous capacity as Minister for Finance, I was obviously in constant contact with the sector through the Central Bank mechanism and other mechanisms.  This was to ensure that, in dealing with the situation that has arisen with regard to international financial market turbulence, our banking system was able to operate appropriately and properly despite the fact that an international credit squeeze was taking place, for which I was to take some responsibility, according to the Deputy yesterday.  With regard to the question of the banks providing finance, while there is this international situation of which we are all aware, I agree it is important that banks continue to provide prudent risk to business and that the performance of Irish business during the good times should stand as a strong criterion for continued support for those businesses which continue to invest and to require access to finance.It is true there has been difficulty with regard to inter-bank lending.  The provision of money supply has been an issue in international banking circles for over nine months and the provision of money beyond 30, 60 and 90 days has not been as plentiful as would have been the case in the past.  This is as a result of the lack of trust that has emerged due to the outcome in the United States of the developments in the sub-prime market there and the ripple effect this has had on wider banking circles.It is important to point out, however, that, as the Central Bank has confirmed, the Irish banking system is well capitalised and is in a healthy state in terms of its own financial situation.  I would agree it is important that while we recognise there has been a change in the international environment, and indeed the domestic environment, the banking system remains an important access point for capital for the development of markets and companies, and their ability to continue to trade.  This is a point that will be continually made both by me and my successor in the Department of Finance.
#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-06-25 00:00:00	Prelude	15	I do not accept the banks operating in this country can hide behind the international credit squeeze any more than the Taoiseach can hide behind the global economic environment with respect to the domestic policies that are applied here.  We know there is an international backdrop both to what the banks do and what the Taoiseach does in regard to the economy.  However, the banks, particularly the four major banking groups, made most of their profits in this country in good times.  I believe they have a responsibility now to help to get the economy through the more difficult times it is in.They will clearly not do this voluntarily.  Looking at what they are doing and how they dealing with individual businesses and customers, it does not appear as though they are willing to do it.  This is why I put my suggestion the Taoiseach, and as he did not respond to it, I must put it again.  Will he invite the banks to have a discussion with him, as Head of Government, so that he can talk with them and encourage them to take a wider, longer-term view of the Irish economy and encourage them to assist in whatever strategy he has, although he has not yet told us about it, to move the economy forward from where it is at present and on to better times?My specific question is this.  Will the Taoiseach ask the banks in to have a wider discussion with him about where the economy is going, their lending practices and to encourage them not to squeeze the life out of businesses at this time?  At present, what is happening is that the banks in their engagement with individual businesses are throttling them, and in their engagement with new businesses in particular are telling them to clear off and that they will not make money available to them.  Unless people who want to start new businesses can access start-up capital, they will not start up these businesses and therefore will not be able to contribute to moving the economy forward.  Unless existing businesses get some kind of relief and understanding from the banking organisations, they will find themselves in continuing trouble.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-06-25 00:00:00	Prelude	16	This is something I have already done as Minister for Finance.  It continues to be done by the Minister and the Department of Finance.  That is an option which is available to us at any time.  In fact, last night I was discussing with advisers the issue of how we can ensure that we do not have a reaction to the downturn as if we were not capable of getting through it robustly, on the basis of a much better economy now than would have been the case when these sorts of challenges faced the economy a quarter of a century ago.  This has already been discussed among ourselves.  We will continue to encourage and ask that the application of finance to prudent risk and to the availability of risk capital continues to be available to business.  That is important but at the end of the day, we all know the duty they have to their own shareholders, as private companies.  However, of course, we will continue to encourage in that direction.Regarding the idea that there is no strategy, our strategy has already been outlined.  We do not deal with strategies based on the publication of any finance house, however reputable.  We base them on our own official data, which will be becoming available to the Department of Finance in terms of its mid-year——

We will take whatever measures are necessary to have a sustainable budgetary strategy going forward.  We will seek more value for money on the current side.  We were already talking about moderating the rate of increase in current expenditure anyway because we want to continue to apply priority investment on the capital programme.  That is the basic strategy that we have devised and will continue to work on, based on the data as it emerges.  We are only half way through this year.  We will take whatever assessments can be taken on the basis of up-to-date data next week and proceed from there.  There will be continuing forecasts from various finance houses about how they ultimately see the performance of the economy this year which we will only find out about when the outturn emerges in December.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-06-25 00:00:00	Prelude	25	I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 to 12, inclusive, together.On 7 April, my predecessor, Deputy Bertie Ahern met the President of the European Parliament, Mr. Hans-Gert Pöttering.  Discussions focused on the ratification and importance of the reform treaty and the European Commission's proposals on climate change.  Deputy Ahern welcomed the European Parliament's engagement on the issue of climate change and the broad support MEPs gave to the Commission's proposals.On 14 April, my predecessor met with Chancellor Angela Merkel on her first visit to Ireland.  I joined my predecessor and Chancellor Merkel briefly before their working dinner.  During their meeting, they discussed the reform treaty, arrangements for the referendum on 12 June, current EU issues and bilateral relations between our two countries.I had a brief but useful meeting with the French Minister for Agriculture, Mr. Michel Barnier, when he paid a courtesy call to Government Buildings on 9 May.  Mr. Barnier was in Ireland for a series of engagements with the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, Deputy Brendan Smith.Our discussions were dominated by the World Trade Organisation negotiations as Ireland and France share a position on a large portion of the negotiations, particularly concerning agriculture.  Indeed, on 3 June, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Micheál Martin, and the French Foreign Minister, Dr. Bernard Kouchner, issued a joint statement expressing serious concerns about the balance in the current state of the WTO negotiations.I attended the European Council in Brussels on 19 and 20 June and was accompanied by the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Micheál Martin, and the Minister of State with responsibility for European Affairs, Deputy Dick Roche.  As I will make a statement to the House on the European Council shortly, I will at this stage merely give a summary account of its proceedings.Discussions at the Council covered the implications of high global food and oil prices, other economic, social and environmental issues, freedom, security and justice matters, the western Balkans, external relations including the Barcelona Process and the Union for the Mediterranean, which will be launched at a summit in Paris in July involving EU and Mediterranean Heads of State or Government.  The Council adopted conclusions in the areas of justice and home affairs including immigration, asylum and visa issues.  We noted progress on the EU's climate and energy targets by 2020 and welcomed progress on the internal energy market.  The Council also adopted conclusions on external relations.  A copy of the European Council conclusions has been placed in the Oireachtas Library.A discussion on the outcome of the Irish referendum on the Lisbon treaty was held over dinner for Heads of State or Government on Thursday evening.  I gave my initial assessment of the result and listened to the reactions of other Heads of State or Government.  I outlined that the Government fully accepted and respected the result of the Irish referendum.  We now need time to engage in serious and careful analysis of its outcome and implications.  In response, our European partners showed solidarity with Ireland and undoubtedly saw that the outcome of the referendum posed a challenge for Europe as well as for Ireland.  We agreed that we would come back to this issue at the next meeting of the European Council in October.In advance of the European Council, I had separate scheduled meetings with the current President of the European Council, Prime Minister Janez Janša of Slovenia, the President of the European Commission, Mr. José Manuel Barroso, the President of the European Parliament, Mr. Hans-Gert Pöttering, and Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany.In addition to the scheduled meetings, I also took the opportunity to speak with many of my colleagues at Head of State or Government level.  In each case, I gave a brief account of the outcome of the referendum and listened to the reaction.  I am pleased to say that in discussions with the French President, who takes over the Presidency of the European Council on 1 July, we agreed that he will travel to Dublin on 11 July to hold discussions on the French Presidency programme as well as further discussions on the referendum outcome.

Has the Taoiseach had the opportunity to speak directly to the German Chancellor since the referendum result of 12 June?  Has he availed of an opportunity to impress upon her and other European member state leaders, as he should do, that the process of ratification of the reform treaty cannot now proceed as clearly the required unanimity is not in place?  Has he done that much, in the time since the Irish people spoke on 12 June?The German Chancellor, the President of the European Commission and other EU leaders have, quite frankly, insulted the Irish electorate and true democrats across all of the member states of the European Union by, on the one hand, claiming to respect the Irish electorate's decision while, on the other, almost speaking at the same time out of both sides of their mouths, urging the continuation of the process of ratification by other member states.  Does the Taoiseach agree that this is hardly showing respect?Does he also accept that by his failure to make it abundantly clear that the process of ratification cannot now proceed, his claims of showing respect and acceptance do not translate into the required action that he should have taken at this point in time and should yet take, in order to give a true translation of so-called respect and acceptance of the Irish people's decision on the Lisbon treaty proposals?  This is seen as deplorable not only by all of those who voted "No" on 12 June, but by many who voted "Yes".  It is seen by a significant swathe of opinion in Ireland and beyond as deplorable that the Taoiseach has not taken a firm stand in making it abundantly clear that the Lisbon treaty cannot now be repackaged and put back before the people in order to force them into acceptance on a later date.  Will the Taoiseach truly recognise, which is the language we want, the will of the people and take this opportunity to firmly rule out a second referendum on the Lisbon treaty?How can the Taoiseach and other EU member state leaders claim that the EU is a partnership of equals and that treaties require unanimity when a member state electorate — the Irish electorate — has so clearly spoken?  A significant majority of in excess of half of the electorate turned out, which was a considerable turnout on the day, as referenda go in this jurisdiction.There is what I can only describe as an ongoing effort to force the Irish electorate to accept a second presentation of the Lisbon treaty at a future date.  Does the Taoiseach not recognise that this is the clear and unquestionable intent of many of the EU leaders who have spoken on the Irish electorate's decision on 12 June and that his failure to act affirmatively and resolutely in line with the decision of the Irish voters on 12 June is giving oxygen to that particular purpose?  I speak on behalf of all those who voted "No", and I do so with respect to all of the wide opinion that reflected, and many people who voted "Yes" who believe this effort to unravel the democratically expressed will of the Irish people is an absolute travesty of democracy, justice and fair play within the EU today.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-06-25 00:00:00	Prelude	27	I reject all the contentions the Deputy makes in respect of this matter as he ascribes them to me.  There is full respect for and acceptance of the "No" vote.  The Lisbon treaty cannot come into effect unless all member states agree to its ratification.  That is accepted by everybody with whom I have met.  No disrespect is being shown and there is no question of people being forced to do anything.The only people I ever heard talk about coercion under the guise of democracy were those who subscribed to a theory that one could have the ballot box in one hand and an Armalite in the other.  That is the only coercion I have ever heard of in Irish democratic circles, which the Deputy willingly supported.

#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-06-25 00:00:00	Prelude	29	The Deputy now comes in here and lectures me.  As Taoiseach, I will not accept that.The third point I would make to the Deputy is that in the same way as our decision not to ratify the treaty last Thursday week was an exercise in national sovereignty, other countries also have a right to exercise national sovereignty as they see it and make their position clear on the ratification process of the Lisbon treaty.  They gave the collective commitment at the time of the signing and agreeing of the treaty that all countries would proceed with the ratification process not later than the end of this year.In the same way as the Deputy expects and is entitled to respect for our national decisions, as would I as an Irishman, he must respect other people's national decisions.  The basic position has not changed.  Unless all member states ratify the treaty, it cannot come into effect.  Therefore, the question of this country's decision not being respected does not arise.  It is freely accepted and respected.What we must recognise is that in the same way that it has implications for our position, it also has implications for other people's positions.  I said at the Council meeting that we would need time to reflect on and analyse the various reasons, some of them contradictory, we find ourselves in this situation and that I would come back and report to them at the next Council meeting in October based on that reflection, analysis and work.  I said that in the meantime, I would work with colleagues to see in what way we can progress matters one way or another.  That is the position.The only coercion I have ever heard to rapturous applause is the one to which the Deputy subscribed some years ago.

I ask him again with respect because I have never shown disrespect to his position——

I ask him again whether he will translate that respect and acceptance that he claims to hold for the Irish people's decision of 12 June and affirm that the ratification process cannot conclude because, quite simply, unanimity does not exist.  That is the very least that the Irish electors, not only those who voted "No" but many who voted "Yes", would expect of a Taoiseach in affirming his people's right to make a democratic decision.What does the Taoiseach say to attempts to promote the idea of a two-speed EU with this State in the second rank?  We have heard remarks that are clearly purposeful in their intent gearing towards such.  This is in all the context of scaremongering and trying to force the Irish electorate to accept that if a referendum re-presents——

Does he not accept that the Irish electors did not vote in respect of Ireland's position within the EU and that it was not an issue on the agenda on 12 June?  Quite clearly, the overwhelming body of Irish opinion, including elected opinion, is absolutely committed to working within the EU as first-class citizens who deserve first-class respect from every other constituent member state.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-06-25 00:00:00	Prelude	44	The Irish people got that.  They need have no worries in respect of the fact that I formally brought to the attention of the Council the fact that the Irish people had voted "No" in the referendum and that, therefore, we were not in a position to ratify the treaty as matters stand, which it already knew.  I made that point, which is accepted, and the Deputy does not need to hammer it to death.  There is no issue about it.  These are intelligent people who know what the rule is in respect of international treaties.  If all member states do not ratify it, it does not come into effect.  It is a statement of the obvious.The question for us, as politicians, is where do we go from here?  That is the issue.  The Deputy should not be surprised if people have an opinion on that.

The situation is simple.  As matters stand, we are not in a position to ratify the treaty, but the ratification process is proceeding in all the other countries.  They wish to discuss the situation with me.  I can only discuss it with them on the basis of analysing the outcome on the conclusion of the vote and considering if and how we can proceed from here.  That is what emerged from last week's meeting.  If the Deputy looks, he will see those are the agreed conclusions and that is the position.If someone wants to project beyond that, it is a free world, a free country and a free media.  They can say and do what they like and print what they wish.  They can have an opinion, and need not take umbrage if someone disagrees with them.  That is the way it is and there is no more to it.

Surprise was expressed there that the Irish Commissioner and the Taoiseach had, during the course of the campaign, stated they had not read the treaty.  Was that issue raised with the Taoiseach at the summit meeting he attended?The Taoiseach said the Lisbon treaty cannot come into effect as a result of the decision of the Irish referendum.  That is a fact.  There cannot be ambiguity about that.  The treaty requires unanimity and, therefore, cannot be ratified and come into effect without our agreement.  Arising from the discussions he had, what is the Taoiseach's assessment of the prospects of ratification in the remaining member states that have yet to make a decision?  Is it the case that it is not a foregone conclusion that all of the remaining member states will ratify the treaty?Was there any discussion about what would happen in the event that all the remaining member states ratify the treaty and we finish with 26 states having ratified the treaty and one not having ratified it?  Was there any proposal, suggestion or indication given of the thinking of the other 26 members states in that scenario?There was much press speculation around the meeting the Taoiseach attended that there would be a second referendum.  That cannot be.  We had a referendum and got a decision.  We cannot go back again and ask people to vote a second time on the same proposition on which they have just voted.  Apart from whether that should be done, it would not succeed.  One of the suggestions floating around was that the Commissioner problem would be resolved and that all 27 member states would end up with a Commissioner.  Was that proposal discussed at the meeting or suggested to the Taoiseach?  Is there a proposal that there will be a Commissioner for all 27 member states?
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-06-25 00:00:00	Prelude	57	I am sure when the Deputy heard that facetious comment, he was able to dispel the surprise by confirming that would be a very inaccurate reflection of what I said.
#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-06-25 00:00:00	Prelude	58	I did not let the Taoiseach down.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-06-25 00:00:00	Prelude	59	I am glad to hear that and to hear that some traditions and conventions are respected here.  On that issue, I made the comment to colleagues in answer to a question on the first day of the campaign that I had not read the treaty from cover to cover.  The point I was making was that I did not need to read it from cover to cover because I had negotiated 95% of it as Minister for Foreign Affairs during our Presidency of the EU and had seen more drafts of it than, perhaps, some of the people asking about it.  Of course, that was used as part of the honest campaign we had to contend with on the other side.  That said, I do not regard my comment as a determining factor.The issue of concern is the question of the position in other states.  The treaty has been passed in 19 parliaments and others are proceeding with ratification.  There is an issue with regard to the Czech Republic, where the matter has been referred to the constitutional court, which is not expected to hand down its decision until October.  The Czech Prime Minister set out that position at the meeting and it was accommodated in the printed conclusions which the Deputy will have seen.On the question of what happens if 26 states ratify the treaty, the concerns being raised relate to the current position under the Nice provisions, where there is a commitment to proceed with a new Commission, which would have fewer than 27 Commissioners.  That commitment requires unanimity.  There is also an issue with regard to the Lisbon treaty and the question of the Parliament and the numbers to be elected to it and the division of seats under the Lisbon arrangement as against the current situation under the Nice arrangement.  That is a cause of concern for member states.On the question of a Commissioner, there is no formal proposal in play.  What was agreed in Nice was misrepresented by the "No" campaign.  Apart from conscription and everything else, we had to contend with the idea that if people voted "No" to Lisbon they would be sure to keep their Commissioner.  There was no legal basis for that.  If one voted for Lisbon, the current arrangement would have stood until 2014, with the possibility of maintaining that arrangement, subject to unanimous decision, thereafter or one would apply the principle of equal rotation, which would be as good as any member state could negotiate, namely, equality with everyone else.  This was portrayed in a certain way also, to suit the "No" argument.  There is no formal proposal other than what we know the two positions to be.During the course of the Lisbon negotiations, we and other member states sought to maintain the position of one Commissioner per member state implicit there, which would have retrieved the situation to a pre-Nice treaty provision.  Others regard the question of the size of the Commission and its efficacy and everyone having a substantial role to play being determined by the need to reduce the number while at the same time having a compromise agreement to the principle of equal rotation thereafter so that the question of equality of treatment and respect for all states, regardless of size, is maintained in that compromise.  As we know, this was also misrepresented during the course of the referendum campaign.  That is the current position and there is no proposal on the table for amendment.
#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-06-25 00:00:00	Prelude	60	Much of the post-referendum and post-summit speculation focused on the idea that there will be a second referendum.  Let us put that aside for the moment because I cannot see how we can have a second referendum on the same proposition.  Let us say that the other 26 states proceed with ratification.  I heard what the Taoiseach had to say about the situation in the Czech Republic but let us assume that the 26 states proceed to ratify when we have not.  The Lisbon treaty cannot come into effect.  A range of issues relating to the Charter of Fundamental Rights and the change from unanimity to qualified majority voting, the common energy policy and other matters provided for in Lisbon will not go ahead.  The immediate issue that arises is the membership of the European Parliament and the Commission.  Was consideration given to the European Parliament elections, which are less than a year away?  On what basis will European Parliament elections take place — on the basis of the Nice or Lisbon formula?  It is a pressing issue.The Nice formula provides that membership of the Commission is to be reduced from 27 to an unspecified number from next year.  The Lisbon formula was that the Commission would be reduced to 18 from 2014.  We are operating with the Nice formula on the basis that the Lisbon treaty cannot be ratified.  In 2009 the Commission membership will be reduced.  Is consideration being given to the way in which that will be done?  If it is not done, by having a reduction of zero, where do we stand on the appointment of a Commissioner next year?  Has there been discussion on how portfolios would be allocated?
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-06-25 00:00:00	Prelude	61	No, there has not been because we are in an uncertain situation.  The agreed conclusion that emerged from the discussion was that we would analyse the situation because it was only a week since the referendum result and that the October Council meeting would see the matter discussed further to see if there was a way forward at that stage.  The point is that there is uncertainty as to how to proceed.  We operate under the Nice treaty provisions at present.  These are ratified and form the basis of our work.  Until there is a change to that, the Nice treaty provisions operate.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-06-25 00:00:00	Prelude	62	What is the view of the Taoiseach on enlargement?  There seem to be different views from some leaders.  Croatia has complied with all requirements for formally joining the EU.  There appear to be different views on this matter.  Is there an Irish view?  What are the arrangements for President Sarkozy's visit?  France is taking office of the EU Presidency on 1 July.  What is the purpose of that visit?  Is it to discuss how the Taoiseach and the Government see the way forward beyond October?There is a real problem in identifying the underlying reasons why people voted "No".  To me, as a public representative, they cover myriad things from bogs to ivy, local hospital closures and everything else one could think of.  There must be a real assessment of the reasons.  Has the Government considered the arrangement it will make to determine that accurately over the next few months?  Will there be consultation with other parties in the House?There were a number of cases regarding the eminent personalities serving on the Referendum Commission, where people wondered how they could know whether the commission could not answer a question.  The Referendum Commission was constrained to the extent that it was not in operation until the Bill was published, which was late in the day.  Does the Taoiseach have views on the position of the Referendum Commission for future referendums on some form of a Lisbon treaty or others?  The Referendum Commission was given €6 million to explain the facts of the treaty.  Some European leaders told me that if they had read the Referendum Commission booklet they would not have been inclined to vote "Yes" because they thought it did not deal with the concerns and anxieties citizens would have when they vote.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-06-25 00:00:00	Prelude	63	Ireland has always supported various phases of enlargement of the EU, once the Copenhagen criteria are met and the negotiations and accession treaties are agreed.  That requires unanimity.  The issue for many member states is how they see the effectiveness of the EU in the future and, in the absence of arrangements contemplated in the Lisbon treaty, the impact enlargement will have on the efficacy of the activities of the EU.  I can only speak for Ireland and we support enlargement.Regarding President Sarkozy's visit, the offer was made to come as the incoming Presidency and to give concrete expression that colleagues wish to assist in whatever way they can to help us see how matters can be moved forward.  I welcome the fact that the incoming president wants to come to Ireland.  He is more than welcome.  He wishes to discuss his Presidency's programme and to have preliminary discussion on the background and circumstances of the "No" vote, which I welcome.Deputy Kenny's comments on the Referendum Commission have been somewhat critical since the outcome of the referendum.  I am not critical of it, it did a good job.
#JamesBannon	unknown-#JamesBannon-party	unknown-#JamesBannon-dob	unknown-#JamesBannon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-06-25 00:00:00	Prelude	64	That is not the message coming across.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-06-25 00:00:00	Prelude	65	I do not know what message Deputy Bannon got but the only time I saw him, he was going into Kilbeggan races.  The Referendum Commission did a good job.  Issues arose when some questions were asked at a press conference and it took some time to get the reference in the treaty and this was regarded as a major indication of a problem.  It was a marginal question and I am not sure the answer was immediately available to anyone.  In the interests of correctness and accuracy, the Referendum Commission took time to obtain the information and take advice.  That was played up.  There was a bit of a game going on in terms of how that was portrayed, that because a member of the Referendum Commission did not know the answer, he did know what he was talking about.  The man is a capable judge who was conscientious about his task.  The members of the Referendum Commission worked well and did a good job.  Their job was not to advocate on one side or the other, they put the case properly and appropriately and I have no problem with the Referendum Commission.  There is always this indication that if one can find a chink in an issue which arose in an interview or press conference one can draw 25 conclusions from it, which is unfair.  It should be stated that this is unfair, particularly when those who use the answers afterwards misrepresent the matter anyway.  It is hard to listen to this type of argumentation.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-06-25 00:00:00	Prelude	66	I do not want to cast aspersions on the eminent judge who chaired the commission.  My point is that it was only established after the Bill was published and it was very late in the day.  If the Bill were published earlier, the commission could have been established earlier.  Be that as it may, I hope when President Sarkozy comes here he will be welcome.  However, the proposition of Madame Lagarde on tax harmonisation halfway through the campaign did not help matters and nor did the French Foreign Minister's comments that Ireland would be the first to suffer if the people voted "No".  At an early stage, the French Minister for Agriculture, Michel Barnier, made his position clear on the right to use the veto in the WTO talks which might have been helpful had we had the same response from Government earlier.We amend our Constitution on individual issues and have done so over the years on a variety of matters.  We have an individual issue with an information campaign informing people on it and then the question is asked.  The Attorney General as legal officer advised the Government of a requirement to hold a referendum on the Lisbon treaty.  Is it possible for the Taoiseach or the Attorney General as legal officer to provide us with the areas within the treaty which require a constitutional referendum?  If the Taoiseach does not have the information to hand perhaps he will supply it to us formally.  A number of these areas exist and it might be helpful to separate the issues.  The people were asked to approve the treaty which, within it, contained the transfer of a number of competencies which would require a popular vote to amend the Constitution.  It was like a bus passing by to which every person having a dissident view could attach themselves.  This is what happened.What is the Taoiseach's view on the future of the Forum on Europe?  It has been running for a number of years and is chaired by former Senator, Maurice Hayes.  It introduced a number of pillars to allow people have their views for and against and carried out a remit by travelling throughout the country.  Admittedly, many of the meetings were filled with people who had a particular point of view and were not as vigorous as the political meetings which were organised.  Does the Taoiseach see the forum continuing in its current or another form?
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-06-25 00:00:00	Prelude	67	The common consolidated tax base is a dossier which has been in European circles for many years.  The current Commissioner for Taxation and Customs Union is László Kovács.  I have attended a number of ECOFIN councils where the issue was discussed and I put the Irish case clearly and succinctly.  It requires unanimity.  We should not ascribe the fact that the dossier was mentioned in dispatches as being a determining factor as to why people should be frightened of it.The bottom line is that the Commission has right of initiative since the Treaty of Rome.  However, decisions are made at the Council of Ministers.  In this regard, taxation matters require unanimous decision.  We are not alone in having a view on this matter.  Sometimes because an issue is raised we are supposed to run away from the horses.  There is nothing to be defensive about in terms of what Ireland's position is with regard to this matter.  Because it was raised it was suggested that matters could be coerced upon us and we had the demonising of the Union.  Nothing can be coerced upon us in respect of these matters.If a politician from Europe makes a comment in the course of a campaign here it is turned into a situation where Ireland will be penalised.  The person is expressing his or her opinion.  If it is a mark of frustration or a view on how things are, the person is entitled to his or her view, the same as we are entitled to ours.  As we robustly express our views why should we be worried about what anyone else has to say?I do not buy the argument that people should step back and say nothing about anything for fear they might offend us.  I do not believe the people should listen to those who try to portray this as in some way inimicable to our interests.  We live in a union of 27 member states with varying views on various matters all of the time.  I do not agree with the contention that everyone should say nothing and I never suggested it to anybody.  People can express their robust views any time they like and once it is done in a mutually respectful atmosphere I have no problem with it.  I do not see it as something about which we should be concerned.Regarding the WTO issue, we saw until the final day of the campaign a contention by Libertas that it would be decided by qualified majority vote.  It claimed it could quote from text when everyone else, including the Commission, was able to confirm it requires unanimity.  It never stopped Libertas continuing to assert the contrary.  At no stage did anyone seem to be able to state Libertas was wrong.  The argument was allowed continue as though it had validity.Regarding our position on setting out the situation, I do not agree with Deputy Kenny.  I reaffirmed existing policy.  The fact it did not come any sooner was because I did not change the policy.  As I pointed out in the statement it was a reaffirmation of policy.  I understand the point was raised that it did not come any sooner.  It did not come any sooner because I would not change the policy.  I can provide clarification to anyone at any time about the policy.

#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-06-25 00:00:00	Prelude	86	The Deputy wishes.The Forum on Europe has done good work in trying to bring to public attention the role Europe plays in our domestic affairs and politics.  It has been scrupulous in its efforts to take into account all bodies of opinion regardless of what democratic mandate they have.  This is fair enough to take account of the voluntary sector and advocacy groups.  There is an issue about the need for this Parliament to reappraise how it brings the relevance of European issues to the floor of the House more regularly and how they impact on every aspect of policy.  There is an idea that our interests are defended solely on the basis of whether we have a Commissioner, which in itself is important in terms of the institutional architecture of the Union. However, when one considers the workload and the 90 diplomats and public servants employed in our permanent representation office in Brussels who, on an ongoing basis, defend and monitor our interests, put our points of views and persuade in policy areas and myriad other areas throughout the Union apparatus, this is a far greater example of the resources and the efforts Ireland makes on a daily basis to influence what happens in Europe for the benefit of its people.Too often we have not properly thought about how we reflect that in our national debate in every policy area and whether we should have more regular debates on the Union in the House on specific issues to bring to people's attention in real time the benefits that accrue by reason of our participation in Europe.  That would bring into our domestic debate in a more real way for the electorate the importance the Union plays in their daily lives.We have allowed a system to develop where we have been recognised as punching above our weight and as a flexible, constructive and persuasive partner in the Union over many years in a parallel universe within the negotiating fora of the Union and its institutions while not reflecting it in the body politic at home sufficiently.  I consider this the more I reflect on the comprehension of how much a role Europe plays in the modernisation of this society, the economy we are building, the rationale behind our investment and industrial policies and the development of our social policies.  The Union has been an integral part of the development of national policy and, in some cases, the genesis of policy has emanated from Brussels, much of it to our benefit and progression, yet the idea that, in some way, the Union demonises us and is there to overwhelm us and do us down continues to resonate.  Suggestions were made during the campaign that the Union was trying to do us down and it was critical of us.  We need to have a more mature debate in the House on a more regular basis on all aspects of policy and how Europe has helped shape our political thinking and the policies we implement in ways that are of real meaning to the lives of our people.

Will the Taoiseach comment on this?
#BernardAllen	unknown-#BernardAllen-party	unknown-#BernardAllen-dob	unknown-#BernardAllen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-06-25 00:00:00	Prelude	94	The Taoiseach uttered words we could support but we only had five hours last week to debate the referendum, during which I had a minute and a half.  The Forum on Europe needs to be revamped and reformed, as it is a glorified talking shop comprising the in crowd meeting in the confines of the grandiose setting of Dublin Castle.  It should be more relevant to the people.  The Taoiseach should seriously examine the forum and revamp it.  The Seanad, in the context of its reform, should be given a greater role in dealing with European affairs by inviting Commissioners to the House and giving it real work to do along with support for legislative work.  There is huge potential in the context of Seanad and Dáil reform.  Rather than talk about it, the Taoiseach should do it.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-06-25 00:00:00	Prelude	95	I do not have any comment to make on other people's views on the referendum.  They are entitled to their opinion.  Let everyone give their opinion on it if they wish.I take Deputy Allen's point.  In response to Deputy Kenny, we need to try to improve the way we project the work we do in the House as having a greater connection with what goes on in Europe than we portray currently because of the way our political culture has developed.  We have not brought that into our narrative for whatever reason and we should try to consider how we can do that, including examining all these issues.  We need to develop our thinking in the coming weeks and months.

Only a change of Minister and a change of direction can stop this wanton waste, which is the start of a national roll-out under the current management.

Is the proposal for dealing with No. 20, statements on European Council, Brussels, agreed?  Agreed.  Is the proposal regarding the suspension of sitting under Standing Order 23(1) agreed?  Agreed.  Is the proposal for dealing with No. a11, motion re proposed approval by Dáil Eireann of an agreement between the European Union and Australia regarding passenger name records, agreed?
#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-06-25 00:00:00	Prelude	106	No.  This is a proposal on an agreement between the EU and Australia on the storage of passenger information.  Opposition Whips were informed at 6.30 p.m. yesterday that important business would need to be taken today immediately after statements on the EU summit.  A briefing document outlining the background was later circulated.While we are not opposed in principle to the proposed agreement, we have not been able to research and examine its terms in the time available.  I strongly oppose the way in which the Dáil is being asked to handle this business.  It is not acceptable that Whips and spokespersons should be given little more than 12 hours notification.  Unfortunately, it is not the first instance of such an occurrence.  The Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform is one of the worst offenders in this regard.  The Labour Party will no longer accept a situation in which a parliamentary gun is put to its head and we are told we must agree to something like this without proper notice.I listened to the Taoiseach's comments on making EU matters more relevant and further involving the House in EU relations, but this approach suggests that nothing has been learned from the referendum of two weeks ago.  This type of approach has caused concern among the public as to whether the Dáil's role in these matters is being reduced to that of a rubber stamp.  Labour Party Deputies are not prepared to agree to something of which we were notified at 6.30 p.m. yesterday and in respect of which we have not had time to consider and seek opinions and advice, but that is expected to be passed by the House in less than one hour.This is a sensitive issue for the public.  There is an understanding among the public of what must be done to ensure safety against terrorism while travelling and so on, but people are sensitive when it comes to their personal data being handed from one state to another and subsequently being stored.  It is not acceptable that such a sensitive issue should be rushed through the House shortly after its notification.  The Labour Party will not agree the proposal before the House.

The motion was added to the schedule late yesterday evening.  It has implications not only for data retention, but data protection and must, therefore, be of considerable concern to citizens and Deputies.This is not the way to do business.  We have not had an opportunity to discuss, examine and inform ourselves of the ramifications of the motion's adoption.  The more correct approach would have been to refer this matter to a committee for substantive address and debate, following which the committee would inform the House accordingly.  There is no explanation for rushing the motion.  When the Taoiseach responds to Deputy Gilmore and me, will he advise us of the reason for the irresponsible rush?  We would be irresponsible were we to glibly nod our heads and allow the motion to proceed unchallenged.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-06-25 00:00:00	Prelude	108	Let me be candid.  I take the point that the approach is not ideal, but this matter appeared before and was approved by the Cabinet yesterday.  In our briefing document, we indicated that the Slovenian Presidency of the Union is keen to finalise the agreement before its presidency concludes.  That is not a determining factor for this Parliament, but it is the context in which we ask the matter to be taken.The approach is not meant to set a precedent, but relates to the manner in which the matter came through our system and was approved yesterday.  We are the only outstanding country from which approval is required if the agreement is to be signed under the Slovenian Presidency, which has given the matter some prominence and effort during its six-month term.  It has been understanding of our recent situation.  We should proceed on this basis.  I take the Deputies' points, but the approach taken was unavoidable in this case.

Some time ago, before the Taoiseach was confirmed in his new office, he said he had given south Offaly a declaration.  Is it true, as reported in the newspapers, that he has accepted the commission's recommendations as they are?

The Electoral (Amendment) Bill came before the Cabinet yesterday and was accepted.  I stated earlier that one would love to have seen a unanimous decision to amend.

If the Taoiseach expects us to debate the Exchequer returns as well, we must have a guarantee that the Minister for Finance or the Taoiseach himself, or both, will participate in the debate.  It is a two-handed partnership, with one having just moved from the post of Minister for Finance and the other having reluctantly taken it up.

I welcome this report in so far as it goes.  It includes draft legislation for the regulation, organisation and operation of management companies where they are required.  In addition, we have been told that a high level committee comprising three Departments and including the relevant Ministers and their officials has examined the other aspects of this issue, including the situation of housing estates where management companies are incorrectly or unnecessarily put in place.  Will the legislation that is being prepared by the Law Reform Commission be taken quickly?  When can we expect to see the other legislation that was promised to deal with this overhang of housing estates with unnecessary and expensive management companies?

The Deputy pointed out that a legislative response has been published in respect of one aspect of the issue.  We will now proceed to consider how the Law Reform Commission recommendations can be addressed by legislation or otherwise.

#CharlesFlanagan	unknown-#CharlesFlanagan-party	unknown-#CharlesFlanagan-dob	unknown-#CharlesFlanagan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-06-25 00:00:00	Prelude	183	I raised a matter yesterday and also last week and do not wish to detain the House but it is an important issue in regard to the manner in which we engage in the process of business here.  I speak about the Intoxicating Liquor Bill which is before the House.  We raised the matter last night at the outset of the debate.  The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform has not indicated a favourable response to requests from this side of the House that sufficient time be made available to discuss Committee Stage of this legislation.  I express my disappointment with the office of the Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach because I have had to raise this matter again.  What are the arrangements?  Yesterday, the only response I received from the office of the Government Whip when I asked the arrangements for Committee Stage, given the guillotine has been sharpened for this and, indeed, other legislation, was that Report Stage would be taken next week.  How could Report Stage be listed for this Chamber for next week when the First Stage had not been moved when I got the message?  This is a serious question.  I regret the fact the Ceann Comhairle is being dismissive of what I say.

#CharlesFlanagan	unknown-#CharlesFlanagan-party	unknown-#CharlesFlanagan-dob	unknown-#CharlesFlanagan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-06-25 00:00:00	Prelude	185	It appears that the written Whips' message we receive daily is being changed every day.  We had it earlier this morning in connection with another issue of importance Deputy Gilmore brought before the House.  Each change to the Whips' message on a daily basis is for the convenience of Government not for the convenience of the House.  If Ministers want co-operation, particularly in the last few weeks when there may well be a need for legislation to be processed, it will only be forthcoming if it is a two-way street and we know what is going on.  There will be no co-operation in facilitating Committee Stage or the completion of the Intoxication Liquor Bill unless and until sufficient time is made available on Committee Stage to allow the detailed aspects of the legislation to be dealt with fully.  We owe it to the people.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-06-25 00:00:00	Prelude	186	I wish to raise two matters, one of which relates to the point raised by Deputy Flanagan.  My distributed schedule of business states: "Report Stage business planned for schedule next Dáil week, beginning 30 June — Intoxicating Liquor Bill."  The Bill only originated in the House after Private Members' business last night.  The Bill started life last night and it is suggested in the schedule of business that we take Report Stage next week.  The normal unwritten protocol is that we would have a couple of weeks to prepare amendments.  I hope the Taoiseach will be able to reassure the House that will apply here.The second matter relates to the Offences Against the State (Amendment) Act 1998: Motion, that the House took in some tempestuous circumstances last week when the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform felt that he had other business to do outside of the House and sent in a Minister of State who has no delegated order to take this issue.  It has, apparently, transpired that section 5 of that legislation was repealed by section 3 of the Criminal Justice Act 2007, yet we went ahead and reaffirmed it in a 50 minute debate last week.  I ask the Taoiseach, I do not expect him to know off the top of his head, whether there is a question about the legal validity of the motion that was passed, since we could not reaffirm a section that is no longer in the legislation.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-06-25 00:00:00	Prelude	187	I will check it — I do not know if there is substance to that point.  The fact is that it has been repealed by legislation.  If it is included in the reaffirmation of the Offences Against the State Act, if I understand the point, that would suggest, which the original legislation continues to include that section, it has been repealed by other legislation.  There are many issues of law where we still have on the Statute Book, prior to consolidation or prior to modernisation or codification of law, provisions which are repealed by other legislation, which do not come into effect simply by their existence, since the repealing provision supersedes the original.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-06-25 00:00:00	Prelude	188	We expressly included it in the motion.  The motion reaffirmed sections 2 to 12 and section 5 of the Offences Against the State Act which related to certain inferences that might be drawn.  Section 5 of the legislation relates to inferences from failure of accused to mention particular facts.  In the 2007 legislation that was repealed by section 3 of the Criminal Justice Act.  We went ahead and reaffirmed it in the motion.  I ask the Taoiseach to take advice as to whether there is any question about the legal validity of the motion we passed.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-06-25 00:00:00	Prelude	189	I will take advice obviously and come back to the Deputy and clarify the matter.In regard to the Intoxicating Liquor Bill, my understanding is that there is an intention to try to enact this legislation before the House rises for the recess on the basis that there are some very important public order offences being provided for in that legislation which would win the widespread support of everyone in the House in terms of the benefit that might derive from the early enactment of the Bill.  The Whips will meet this evening to settle on next week's business in whatever way that can the accommodated.  The Government would appreciate it because all Members would regard those public offences provisions, particularly, but not exclusively, as timely.
#SeymourCrawford	unknown-#SeymourCrawford-party	unknown-#SeymourCrawford-dob	unknown-#SeymourCrawford-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-06-25 00:00:00	Prelude	190	I wish to raise three issues.  In light of the extraordinary legal charges solicitors are imposing on people who have debt problems, especially in regard to mortgages, when will the legal costs Bill come before the House?  Given the failure of the HSE to provide true facts in regard to frontline staff, when will the health information Bill come before the House?  Given that the Taoiseach has clearly stated in the House that the fair deal Bill will not come before the House this session, how will he put in place a structure that will allow families——

It is unfortunate that he has just left the Chamber because he could have advised the Taoiseach on his reply.The first question relates to the social housing (miscellaneous provisions) Bill.  I believe the Minister, Deputy Gormley, is meeting tenants in Cork tomorrow who wish to purchase their homes.  When will the legislation come before the House?  It was included in the programme for Government and it was indicated that it would come to the House before the summer.

The second matter relates to the planning and development regulations, which is secondary legislation that will come before the House tomorrow without debate.  I wish to raise a number of matters in connection with the issue.  The Labour Party is fully supportive of increasing renewable energy capacities but this——

A number of issues are involved.  Given that we are identifying a specific type of industry that would be exempt from planning permission, has the Minister sought legal advice on the matter?

However, there is a two-year period of time within which this should be done.  As there are clearly very serious implications for agency workers who are employed within this jurisdiction and the spin-off adverse effects on those who are directly employed that we have heard about in this House many times, will the Taoiseach bring forward the introduction of the legislation in line with the decision made at the Council of Ministers?

I wish to ask the Taoiseach about plans at EU level for the small business Act for the European Union that will be implemented in directive form.  Does the Government have a particular position on it and will any such position be published in advance of negotiations on the directive?  This is a particularly important directive in terms of targeting red tape and reducing bureaucracy for small and medium sized businesses across the EU and also in the light of the vote on the Lisbon treaty.Second, is the Taoiseach aware that the Minister, Deputy Gormley, and his advisers have been making commitments to residents and the media on the amendment of the planning legislation regarding CPO procedures?  It is particularly relevant because it has been in the newspapers in recent days.  It is especially relevant to my constituency given that we have had a maverick——

#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-06-25 00:00:00	Prelude	329	I attended the meeting of the European Council in Brussels on Thursday and Friday, 19 and 20 June.  I was accompanied at the meeting by the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Micheál Martin, and the Minister of State with responsibility for European Union affairs, Deputy Dick Roche.  The Council's proceedings were dominated by two issues, namely the Lisbon treaty following the rejection of the proposed constitutional amendment in the referendum here the previous week and the issue of rising food and oil prices.As one would expect, while much of the discussion and media focus was on the consequences of our referendum result, a number of substantive steps forward were taken in a variety of areas of work.  These included measures on Slovakia's accession to the euro zone, the establishment of the European institute of technology in Budapest, progress in the justice and home affairs area, notably on migration and visa issues, and on the issue of food and oil prices which is now top of the EU agenda.  On the external relations side, the Council adopted important conclusions following discussion among foreign Ministers, including on the Western Balkans, Zimbabwe, Burma and Sudan.The Council noted progress on the EU's climate and energy targets by 2020.  We face an intense period of work on these important issues over the rest of this year in order for the European Union to continue to lead the international efforts to secure an ambitious, global and comprehensive post-2012 agreement on climate change.  The Council also welcomed the progress on the internal energy market.The Lisbon treaty aside, the other main focus of the Council was the issue of food and oil prices where there were lengthy discussions on both Thursday and Friday.  There was a clear sense around the table of the impact this is having on the public and the very wide-ranging effect such price rises are having on the economy as a whole.  I spoke about the difficulties people are facing from issues like high food and fuel prices coming on top of higher mortgage payments.  I also encouraged the Commission to introduce short-term emergency measures to help the fisheries sector through current difficulties.  The whole European economy is affected by the increases in food and oil prices, but they have a particularly large impact on low-income households.  This is true of Ireland and our European partners.  It is even more true in developing countries where the proportion of total income spent on food and fuel is larger again.By agreeing to return to this matter in October, the Council ensured that this issue is set to remain on the EU agenda.  The Council noted that work would be advanced on various fronts in the next months, including further assessment of the social and environmental consequences of bio-fuels policies, analysis of regulation in the retail sector, closer monitoring of the commodity related financial markets and further work on innovation and development in the areas of agricultural production.The main focus of the meeting from an Irish perspective was the issue of the Lisbon treaty following the rejection the previous week by the people of a proposal to amend our Constitution to allow the Government ratify the treaty.  I am pleased that the Council conclusions reflect the views and concerns I brought to the meeting, including the need to respect fully the Irish "No" vote in the referendum.  I made clear in the run up to and during the Council that our ratification procedure and vote would need to be respected, just as we would respect the procedures and decisions of others.  The central focus of our efforts over the two days was to try to manage the situation which arises as a result of the referendum outcome.  The referendum was an Irish vote, but it has serious implications for all of our European partners.Over dinner, I gave my European colleagues my initial assessment of what had happened in Ireland and explained that we now need time to analyse the result and its full implications.  Only then could we turn to what possible ways forward there might be for Ireland and the Union.  What I said to my colleagues at the Council reflected closely the comments I made to this House last Wednesday during our debate on the referendum.  At the outset, I laid considerable emphasis on my view that the vote was not in any way a rejection of Europe and the good that it delivers.  In addition to the more tangible economic developments which were widely accepted, I stressed the broad recognition in Ireland of the Union's achievements in securing peace, providing economic stability, reinforcing cultural, social and environmental development and promoting European values of democracy, tolerance and equality.  I explained that, against that positive background, it is clear that the debate reflected anxieties about potential future developments and the potential future direction of the Union.I spoke of the different types of issues which arose.  I explained that some were sectoral, for example, those giving rise to unease to the farmers or trade unions.  I said that some were very much national, for example, the fears held by some people on the issues of common defence.  I explained that the sense of loss of influence had been a theme through the campaign and I drew attention to broader issues such as the very significant changes our country has undergone in recent years and the current tougher economic circumstances, including the issue of food and fuel prices which the Council had been discussing at great length.I said that issues extraneous to the treaty had also played a considerable role.  I spoke of the disconnect between the people and the European institutions and how this could mean that to some of our citizens Europe may appear to be a place of treaties and protocols, directives and regulations, instead of something that makes a meaningful and beneficial impact on people's lives.  I stressed the importance of us now taking the time to analyse and consult so that we can properly understand the underlying factors that shaped the outcome of the referendum.  I made clear our view that it was premature and could be unhelpful to suggest any next steps or timetables at this early juncture.The Council members listened carefully to my comments.  They accepted the outcome of the referendum.  They were aware that this is not the first time the EU has found itself in this type of situation.  I am sure they were conscious of the fact that such a vote reflects broader concerns over how the Union manages its business and its relationship with the citizens of the member states.  They were certainly very concerned at what the outcome means.  They highlighted the dilemma of trying to respond to the concerns of the Irish people while still trying to advance a process which they consider to be vital and which has been in preparation for many years.Many of them were perplexed.  Some found it hard to understand how Ireland could reject a treaty which they see as improving the functioning of the Union and redressing perceived difficulties of democratic accountability.  On several occasions over the two days, colleagues commented on what they considered to be the prominence of issues in the campaign which are either unaffected by, or well catered for, in the treaty.  Many had received briefings, including through their embassies in Dublin throughout the course of the campaign.  They were well informed about the views and issues aired during the campaign and the impact they might have had.Until the referendum vote, the governments of these states were hopeful that the treaty would enter into force next January.  They consider this treaty to be vital to the ability of the EU to function in the interests of all their citizens.  That view is reflected in the conclusions which recall the purpose of the treaty.  Many made it clear that they have no wish to revisit the text of the treaty, which is itself a compromise text which took many years to negotiate.  Several sought guidance on the type of timeframe that Ireland would require to analyse and reflect on what had happened.  A number raised questions related to next year's European Parliament elections.  Questions were also raised regarding arrangements for the Council Presidency and appointment of the next European Commission, where continuation of the current treaty means a reduction in the number of Commissioners next year.I made it clear that, however frustrating for them, it is simply too early to know how to move forward at this point.  I was straightforward and honest and said that I did not have answers at this time.  I stressed that the views and concerns expressed in the campaign were varied and complex.  There is no quick fix or easy solution at this stage.  I underlined that we must not prejudge how this dilemma might be resolved.  I stressed that we intended to proceed in very close consultation with our EU partners.  Any potential way forward must be acceptable not just to Ireland, but also to every other EU member state.  I underlined the need for time to allow us to analyse and consult in order to understand why the people had rejected the proposal.  Only then could we even begin to turn our minds to possible ways forward.Working closely with the incoming Presidency will be central to the consultation with partners.  During the meeting, President Sarkozy and I agreed that he would come to Dublin at the start of the French Presidency on 11 July for intensive discussions.  I am pleased that, following discussion, the Council accepted that deeper analysis and consultation is needed before any conclusions can be drawn.As is normal, a copy of the conclusions has been laid in the Library of the Houses of the Oireachtas.  It is important that there be no doubt at home or abroad that these conclusions reflect accurately the position as of today.  I will paraphrase the key points as follows.  The Council noted preparatory work undertaken in line with last December's Council conclusions, noted the outcome of the referendum on the basis of an initial assessment provided by me, agreed more time is necessary to analyse the situation and noted that the Government will actively consult, internally and with the other member states, to suggest a way forward.  The Council noted that parliaments in 19 member states have ratified the treaty and that the ratification process continues in other countries, while also noting that the Czech Republic cannot complete its ratification until its constitutional court delivers an opinion.  The Council also agreed to my suggestion to revisit the issue in October and underlined the need not to become distracted from the core business of continuing to deliver concrete results in the various policy areas of concern to the citizen.Following the "No" vote less than two weeks ago, the Government's main task is to manage the situation that arises as a consequence, both domestically and with our partners.  There are various elements within that task of which the European Council last week represented one.  We will press on with the necessary analysis and reflection so that we can understand in some depth what has happened.  The Government agreed yesterday that the Minister for Foreign Affairs would commission survey research to help us with that.  Alongside this work, there will be detailed consultation both at home and with our fellow member states.In the circumstances which it faced, last week's Council demonstrated the strength of Europe's working methods, namely a determination to resolve issues through discussion and debate and, where necessary, to allow time to explore how ways forward acceptable to all might be found.  The Council avoided any moves which might have made the situation that Ireland and Europe faces more difficult.  I said to the House last Wednesday during our debate that I will devote my energies to this issue.  I assure the House today that the Government is fully focused on finding an acceptable and viable way forward for our country.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-06-25 00:00:00	Prelude	330	I would like to share time with Deputies Timmins and Creighton.  Before the Heads of Government meeting I briefed the European People's Party.  Some 14 Prime Ministers were present at that and many will have received a somewhat similar briefing from the Taoiseach at the meeting and over their working lunch.  There is a need for the European Union to reaffirm what the European project and process is about and where we see the Union and its citizens ten, 15 or 20 years down the line.  Equally, there is clearly a divide in this country.  Those in better off areas gave a stronger "Yes" vote than those in other areas.  I hope the Taoiseach sets out the structure as to how he will analyse and assimilate the underlying reasons people took the decision they took in all its forms.  The Taoiseach has only 12 weeks in which to do this — July, August and September.  The meeting will be in mid-October.  That structure needs to be clear, comprehensive and thorough so that there is a clear understanding of the issues.During the campaign this party always supported the European process and concept.  The only contact I had with members of Fianna Fáil were on a couple of occasions at the Forum on Europe or Dublin Castle with Deputy Roche and some brief contact with Deputy Martin, except for the appearance at the National College of Ireland with the three party leaders to show our coherence.  This is not the way a campaign such as this should have been planned.  I mentioned it to the Taoiseach's predecessor.  If there is to be a re-run of this in some format the Taoiseach should not expect a blank cheque of support from this party.  We will always support the European process but I would like us to be at least kept informed of the analysis, data and what is happening.The Government has a problem and a number of options are open.  Europe can do nothing about this and leave it be, but that is not an option.  The Government can put the same question to the people, and that is not an option.  The Government can examine alternatives of which there are a number.  I mentioned one earlier during Taoiseach's Questions and the Taoiseach might respond by having the Attorney General send me his considered opinion as legal officer to the State as to which elements of the Lisbon treaty require a constitutional referendum in their own right in this country.  A number of complications need to be clarified.  It might be helpful in that the Government could not just isolate them but deal with them individually so people in Ireland who have had a range of difficulties, instead of having them all lumped together, would understand exactly where they come from.The Taoiseach mentioned that he would talk to the EU partners on a very close basis.  That is important but he should also take into account the support the Lisbon treaty was given by both the Labour Party and Fine Gael.  The "No" vote would have been much higher had that not been the case.  The feeling from the European People's Party representatives was that they do not want the momentum of European development to be restricted or stopped.  There is clearly a danger that if this runs to the European elections, very aggressive people on the right and left of the political spectrum in other European countries wanting to interfere with this may turn the elections into a referendum on Lisbon.  That is a dilemma for the Government.  We will wait and see what comes from its analysis in October and what alternatives the Government sees ahead and when.  Timelines are very important for all our parties here who will contest local and European elections this time next year.
#BillyGodfreyTimminsFG	unknown-#BillyGodfreyTimminsFG-party	unknown-#BillyGodfreyTimminsFG-dob	unknown-#BillyGodfreyTimminsFG-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-06-25 00:00:00	Prelude	331	I welcome the fact that the Taoiseach and Government have decided to commission research on the results.  Some of the research I have seen has been contradictory.  The Eurobarometer states immigration was an issue of concern to 1% of the people.  We need qualitative research as well as quantitative.  There is contradictory evidence. The Sunday Business Post said neutrality and tax were of concern to 50% and 60% of the people.  They were minor issues.  Those issues have always been there.  I disagree with the Minister for Foreign Affairs in that those battles have been fought in the past.  Individuals who fight those battles now do not really believe in the European project and they use those issues as a front.  They may have influenced a certain number of people but they were not the overriding issues.Earlier the Taoiseach spoke about trying to get out the information on the accuracy or otherwise with which people speak.  The national broadcaster has a role to play.  It produced a few very effective programmes late in the day.  The commentators and people in the national broadcaster must have the information on what is in the treaty.  They let some of the issues go unchallenged.  Some issues also went unchallenged by politicians on the "Yes" side.  The one that really gets to me is the suggestion that we would lose half our voting strength on the European Council.  One could equally make the claim that our vote would double.  However that went unchallenged by politicians and commentators.The National Forum on Europe and the Referendum Commission can be two easy targets, particularly from the "Yes" side.  We need to examine how this House tied the hands of the Referendum Commission due to the shortage of time.  I hope the environment committee invites it in to see where it saw the shortfalls in the legislation under which it operates.  The timeframe for the Referendum Commission to try to get established, familiarise itself with the information and disseminate it was very restrictive.  The Forum on Europe is another easy target.  The Forum on Europe produced the best information on the Lisbon treaty in an excellent, impartial booklet.  It did tremendous work.A number of years ago the Forum on Europe identified two sectors of the electorate, namely women and young people.  Both groups played a key part in this referendum.  The research will show that many young people voted who had never voted in elections before, despite having the opportunity, and most of them voted "No".  They were very motivated in voting.  We on the "Yes" side cannot assume people will vote "Yes" if the issue is rerun.  We must be very careful how this is approached and what the way forward is.  While it is a European problem, the response must come internally.  The solution cannot be imposed on Ireland from outside and I caution the Taoiseach to be wary of that.  Many of the measures due to come in under the Lisbon treaty do not come in until 2014, so there is no rush in finding a solution and that message should be brought back to the Taoiseach's European colleagues.Others issues arose, including food and oil.  Some member states introduced short-term measures to deal with the difficulties for low income households with regard to food prices.  I do not know if this is applicable in Ireland or if the Government has plans to bring in measures to deal with it.  I ask the Minister to consider the emphasis on the production of biofuels and the impact this is having on the price of food, which is an issue for the EU at large.  While it is only one of the factors that has increased the price of food, we need to examine the implications of this policy across Europe.We provide in the region of €200 million to the World Food Programme.  The increased price of oil this year alone will bring an extra $400 billion to Saudi Arabia.  I note it has given $500 million to the World Food Programme but perhaps we should consider how we might reallocate money within our own aid budget because the food programme is very beneficial.On Kosovo and EULEX, there seems to be some uncertainty as to the status of the force and how it will move forward, an issue I will raise with the Minister on Question Time.  The only way we can guarantee or assist stability in the Balkans is by having all those countries within the EU.The Minister made brief reference to Zimbabwe.  Is there anything we can do here or in Europe in this regard?  It strikes me that when the real crunch comes, the only ones who can do anything are the Americans.  When we in Europe try to get a common defence policy to develop our resources so we could do the many things that would assist, and which the international community cries out for, the very people who cry out for intervention are the ones who complain about measures that are taken to ensure we have the facilities and wherewithal to do it.  I find it an unusual contradiction.
#LucindaCreighton	unknown-#LucindaCreighton-party	unknown-#LucindaCreighton-dob	unknown-#LucindaCreighton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-06-25 00:00:00	Prelude	332	I was interested to hear the Taoiseach's comments on his after-dinner speech at the European Council, where he pointed to the institutional disconnect from the citizens of Europe.  I note he made no reference whatsoever to any of the domestic issues that were at play in regard to the Lisbon treaty referendum, primarily the lack of trust in politicians in this country as a direct result of the tribunals which have dominated the political scene for the past 11 years.  We need to acknowledge this and face up to it.  The second issue is immigration, which is becoming an increasingly bigger issue and clearly led to a socioeconomic divide in how people voted in the referendum.  Those two issues need to be dealt with.There is no doubt we have now reached institutional deadlock.  While Ireland may be satisfied with that, it is clear the other EU member states are not.  That is not in any way disrespectful of the Irish "No" vote but it is an expression of a desire to proceed with further integration at EU level.  In conscience, as a country, a society and an EU member state, we cannot afford to try to block that.  We need to come up with a solution very quickly.I appeal to the Taoiseach to make it eminently clear to Sinn Féin and their cheerleaders that there is no prospect of a full renegotiation of a new treaty in the context of solving this issue.  They are posturing in Ireland and around Europe.  I note Sinn Féin's one MEP, being so critical of a lack of democracy at EU level, ironically was not in Strasbourg for the plenary session last week but was following cameras and radio microphones around the European Council in Brussels, which is telling enough in itself.  I ask the Taoiseach to make it abundantly clear that while Sinn Féin might, in whatever cloud cuckoo land they live, believe a full renegotiation is available to this country, that is not a reality and simply not possible.What can we do?  I have been slightly disappointed with the Taoiseach's response.  I have not seen a huge amount of decisiveness or enthusiasm to reach some form of solution to this problem.  In fact, in some ways the Taoiseach has been kicking to touch.  To be fair, the Taoiseach is going back to the European Council in October but I hope he will have concrete proposals on the table.Significant changes are necessary to entice the people to support whatever proposal will go before them.  There will have to be significant and real changes that will appeal to the people and deal with some of the concerns that have been raised.  Obviously, the ones that have been floated and on which there is certainly room to manoeuvre are the issues of the Commissioner and some form of declaration or protocol on neutrality and particularly on the social and moral issues.The social and moral issues are significant.  A significant proportion of the population have fears about the Charter of Fundamental Rights and the potential powers of the European Court of Justice in the future.  In a very short period, the Taoiseach could bring legal expertise together to put forward a Government position or a response to those fears in regard not just to abortion but to euthanasia, stem cell research and all the moral issues about which Irish people feel strongly in terms of having our autonomy in decision-making.  Those fears were not allayed throughout the course of the last referendum campaign.  If they are not addressed in the immediate future, the same factors will come into play in terms of how people vote on any future proposal.I will make two points in conclusion.  First, if the Government goes back to the people with a very similar proposal without significant deals or concessions from other EU member states, I have no doubt that people who voted "Yes" in the last referendum will vote "No" the next time.  Quite conceivably, the "No" vote could be an even larger proportion on the next occasion unless the Government is careful and sends out a very clear message.  That is what needs to be done over the course of the next four to six weeks.Second, there is a momentum in regard to the European debate surrounding integration and institutional reform.  If the ball is dropped in the autumn and the Taoiseach starts talking about a referendum some time next year, it will be divisive.  The momentum is there now and the Taoiseach should build on it.  He should be decisive, show leadership, bring concrete proposals to the table, both domestically and at the next European Council, and proceed very quickly at that point.
#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-06-25 00:00:00	Prelude	333	No one in this House would envy the position the Taoiseach found himself in last week at his first European Council meeting in Brussels.  The result of the referendum on the Lisbon treaty presents enormous difficulties for the Government and for the country.As I have said consistently since the first results of the referendum became known, the people have spoken, and the result of the referendum must be fully respected.  At the same time, as a result of that vote Ireland is confronted by our greatest diplomatic challenge since the Second World War.  Since that time, Ireland has faced challenges on the international stage but none which had the potential to so profoundly affect our vital national interests.  The gains of 50 years of patient diplomacy, which has sought to put Ireland at the heart of the European project, are now at stake.It was as far back as 1958 that Ireland began to base its economic policy on free trade with our European partners and it was in 1961 that our first application for membership of the European Community was made.  That policy is now in question.  How we now resolve the problems thrown up by the result of the referendum will determine what it means to be Irish in Europe, perhaps for a generation.Let us be clear, however, about one thing.  This is not just an Irish problem.  It is also a European problem.  Ireland is the only country to hold a popular vote on the Lisbon treaty.  The people have spoken and their voice must be respected.  It would be entirely wrong, inappropriate and counterproductive for the European Union to proceed on the basis of any settlement that does not fully respect the voice of the Irish people.The European Union is, after all, a community of member states founded on the principles of democracy, and it would cause itself untold damage if it were to attempt in some way to sidestep the verdict of the Irish people.  That is particularly true since Ireland is one of the smaller member states of the Union.  Again, the institutional settlement reached in Lisbon would be deeply undermined if the wishes of a small member state were not to be treated in the same way as those of a large member state.Solidarity is, of course, a two-way street.  There is also an onus on us to find a way forward.  The European Union has important work to do.  The issues addressed in the Lisbon treaty, such as dealing with climate change, are pressing.  There is an urgent need for the Union to end years of institutional navel-gazing and get on with delivery.I believe the heads of State understand that this is not just an Irish problem.  At our meeting in advance of the summit I pointed out to my colleagues in the party of European Socialists that while Ireland is the only country to have a vote on Lisbon, there are many other member states where the majority in parliament for ratification would not be reflected in a popular vote.  The irony is that the Lisbon treaty contains significant steps forward in addressing this democratic deficit.In this context, the Taoiseach was correct in his statement to the Council meeting last week to emphasise the importance of respecting the outcome of the referendum and to look for time to assess the result and its implications.  This matter will not be resolved by any rush to judgment and the imposition of arbitrary deadlines is certainly not helpful at this stage.  We need to establish a process whereby we can begin to find a way forward, both to strengthen our negotiating position and to limit the damage to Irish diplomacy in other areas.  For as long as we are saying to our colleagues in Europe that we do not know and we do not know when we will know, we are not strengthening our position.  It is time to shake off the shellshock and get back into the game.  We do not need all the answers now, but we need an open and transparent process for finding them.I emphasise again that this is not just an Irish problem. The work must progress at home and abroad.  We must seek to ascertain fully why it was that the Irish people rejected the treaty and we must also engage with our European partners on what options are available.  There seems to be an assumption that has grown that Ireland will automatically move to a second referendum.  I have made no such assumption.  The people have spoken and there can be no question of putting the same package in front of them as before, with a request that they might think better of it a second time.  That simply will not fly, nor should it.We must assess where we are at.  As the Taoiseach said earlier, the Lisbon treaty cannot now be ratified.  Its ratification cannot be completed and it cannot come into effect as a result of the decision in the Irish referendum.  That is a fact.  We clearly do not want a situation where a two-speed Europe develops.  That is clearly not in our national interest.  At the same time, it is pretty clear from the summit meeting which the Taoiseach attended — this view was reflected in the meeting I attended — that there is no mood for a renegotiation of the Lisbon treaty.  Indeed, even if there were to be a renegotiation, what would be renegotiated?I listened to Deputy Creighton and the point she made about, for example, concerns regarding the Charter of Fundamental Rights.  I heard such concerns being reflected in some of the commentary made after the Lisbon agreement.  I assure the House that if there were to be a renegotiation of the treaty and a watering down of the charter, there would be a problem with us.  We believe in the Charter of Fundamental Rights and also believe it is an enormous loss to people in this country that the charter will not now be enshrined in the European treaties and given protection in European law.  If people have it in their minds that there will be a renegotiation or a request for opt outs, I assure them that if anybody tries to opt out of the Charter of Fundamental Rights, they will be dealing with us.  There were provisions in the charter which were good for workers and citizens that will not now be enshrined in the European treaties.  If anybody tries to wriggle away from them, as a convenient means of arriving at a second referendum, my party will resist that tooth and nail.The reality which we must face up to is that the governance of the European Union for the foreseeable future will not be based on the Lisbon treaty but on the Nice treaty.  We must address the issue of how that will be squared with the immediate requirements that are coming down the track.  Some of the more immediate issues are, for example, the European Parliament elections next year and how they will be conducted and the composition of the European Commission.  The Lisbon treaty would have deferred a decision on the latter until 2014 but ironically, the retention of the Nice treaty brings that date forward to 2009.  There is a requirement under the Nice treaty that the Commission be reduced and we must determine how that is to be squared.  No matter which way one looks at this — even those who are hoping for a renegotiation must admit — continuing on the basis of Nice is inevitable.  We are talking about renegotiating not with one entity but with 26 other member states, which will take time, even if it were to happen.  Therefore, in the short term, we must constructively address the issue of how the European Union continues on the basis of the Nice arrangements.  Otherwise, we are de facto accepting either that there will be a two-speed Europe or another referendum and frankly, if we did have a second referendum, I do not believe the outcome would be any different.  In that context, I share Deputy Creighton’s view as to where we might end up in terms of overall vote.I understand the Taoiseach intends to report back to the summit in October.  I hope that in the meantime Irish diplomacy will be reaching out on a bilateral basis to our partners across the community to explore options and look for possible solutions.  Apart from anything else, the prospect of non-ratification by one or two other countries has to be factored in.  I do not say that in the hope that with a single bound, Ireland might be free.  The underlying requirements that gave rise to the treaty would not disappear but the political and diplomatic scenario would certainly change.As well as engaging with our partners, there must be an engagement with the Irish people.  In his speech to the Council, the Taoiseach outlined a number of issues that arose during the campaign and which may have influenced people to vote "No".  As he pointed out, some of these were contradictory and many were not borne out by the content of the treaty.  However, it is a mistake to equate what may or may not have been in the minds of voters with the arguments that were advanced by the "No" campaign.  I do not accept the "No" vote was simply a reflection back of the arguments advanced by the "No" campaign.A number of opinion polls have been taken which will merit careful scrutiny over the coming weeks and there is a requirement for further analysis of public attitudes.  There are a number of points that can be made now.  The treaty itself was not easy to communicate.  It was not based on a single big idea but on a series of reforms.  In that context, it certainly was not helpful that senior politicians claimed not to have read the treaty and that some were dismissive of the notion that they might do so.One of the reasons being advanced for the "No" vote was that many people did not understand the treaty.  That was not the biggest problem.  The biggest problem was that many of those arguing for a "Yes" vote did not understand the treaty and it showed.  This was further confirmed by those who said they had not read it.The polls point out that the vast majority of Irish people, whether they voted "Yes" or "No", are supportive of the European Union and Ireland's ongoing membership of it.  That is heartening and reflective of a deep-rooted sentiment among the Irish people.  Respecting the outcome of the referendum means we in this House must listen to the people but we must also offer leadership.  We cannot afford to — and must not — accept the facile interpretation offered by some, including some in the international media, that the Irish are the spoiled children of Europe; that having gained so much from EU membership, we took fright and ran when the European gravy train ran dry.  I do not accept that interpretation.  I firmly believe the Irish people see themselves as pro-European and that they want Ireland to be at the centre of the European project, shaping Europe's future.  Irish people are willing participants in a European Union that is founded on democracy, equality and solidarity among nations and that has a strong social and environmental, as well as economic dimension.The challenge for us as political leaders is to give a voice to that ambition at home and abroad.  It is to articulate for our European partners that there are genuinely-held concerns about some aspects of the European project and that those concerns are not the exclusive preserve of the Irish but are widely shared in other member states.  The EU needs to address those concerns, not just to solve the immediate crisis, but in the longer-terms interests of its legitimacy among the peoples of EuropeThis problem goes well beyond what one or other campaigner has said about the treaty.  This problem arises because a proud and confident people, who are committed to being full participants in the European Union, judged it right to reject the Treaty of Lisbon.  That is not an Irish problem, it is a European problem, but it falls to the Irish to lead the way in resolving it.The referendum was two weeks ago.  It is over and we have a decision.  It is time to stop re-running the argument.  Let us stop talking about the "Yes" side and the "No" side.  There can now be only one side and that is Ireland's side.  In that context, it is not sufficient for anybody to simply say this is a problem for the Government.  Everybody, especially those who argued for the "No" vote, has a responsibility to find a solution, not just in terms of setting down demands but also of delivering support for whatever the perceived solution is and support for that which is beyond these shores.  All of us through our respective linkages with other parties and our political groupings in Europe have a responsibility to help resolve this difficulty.  Certainly, the Labour Party will play its part in doing that.I listened to what the Taoiseach had to say during Question Time about the disconnect between the European institutions and the people.  This is the chickens coming home to roost because if one looks back over the period of time during which we have been a member of the EU, one can see that the way in which Government has engaged with the EU and has then communicated the result of that engagement to the public has been very possessory.  There has not been a great deal of access for the wider public or body politic to Europe.  It has always been mediated.  The Government negotiates with Europe, delivers a deal and then claims the credit for it.  One sees this in all the key negotiations — agriculture, fisheries and trade.  We negotiate with Europe and the Government delivers the bacon.I recall that the systems that were put in place here for the monitoring and management of the delivery of Structural Funds were all centred around central Government and were all based on the premise that the announcements would be made by Ministers and that it would be centralised.  There was no sense out there that this was assistance coming from the EU.  It was always presented as a great achievement by the Government and Ministers.

Chuaigh an Taoiseach go dtí an cruinniú sin chun toradh vótála na hÉireann, i gcoinne chonradh Liospóin, a phlé.  Nuair a labhair sé ag an gcruinniú sin, dúirt sé:For all of us, the will of the people is sovereign. They have spoken at the ballot box, the ultimate democratic forum, and the Government accepts their verdict.The Taoiseach has talked the talk of democracy but has failed to walk the walk because he has not accepted the Irish people's verdict on Lisbon and has not ensured that his Council counterparts have accepted it.  If he had heard the people, his message to the Council would have been very clear.  The Lisbon treaty is finished and ratification of it must end.  This was the Taoiseach's job last week.It is a falsity to suggest that to continue this process is to uphold consensus.  It is, as the Taoiseach well knows, the very opposite.  Despite having been given a very clear mandate from the Irish electorate, he attended his first Council meeting as Taoiseach of this country not as a leader of a democratic people but as an apologist to the European elites.  His speech was peppered with reassurances that the Irish people remain committed to their European identity and the Union, which they do.  However, uttering these reasonable words, the Taoiseach sought to distract and deceive the Irish people and European commentators from his actual intent, which is to ignore the unambiguous mandate given to him by the people of this State.  His meeting with the Council was as dishonest as the Lisbon treaty itself.

It is worth remembering that a lengthy national debate on the constitution took place in both countries.

The fact that he negotiated a document which he did not even read is scandalous and an even bigger indictment of him.  It is all coming out clearly now.  Massive public meetings were held in France with thousands of people in attendance.  Following the French and Dutch rejection of the constitution, recriminations were rife.  A two-speed Europe was threatened and voters from both states were castigated.  Despite this, the French called a halt to the ratification process and a much touted period of reflection was supposed to begin.The fact is that a period of reflection did not take place.  Cosmetic engagements between the EU institutions and civic society took place while EU leaders and faceless bureaucrats began a deeply dishonest process of stripping out all constitutional reference within the text and then produced the Lisbon treaty.  Understanding the massive opposition throughout Europe to what this treaty sought to achieve, EU leaders concocted a way of avoiding putting this maligned document to the public in plebiscites.By the time the Lisbon treaty was signed off on by European leaders and at the end of last year, the substance of the EU constitution remained intact, something which the previous Taoiseach admitted in this House, while democracy and consent did not.  Thankfully, in Ireland, we have a voice thanks to one brave individual, Raymond Crotty, who took on the political establishment that would prefer us to be quiet and do as we are told regardless of the cost to Europe, Ireland and the wider world.  He forced successive Governments to put treaty changes to the people in referenda for which I congratulate him.  It is a pity he is not with us today to stand over and see his achievement.It is 2005 all over again with EU leaders reacting with angry surprise because the people have spoken and dared to have a different vision for Europe than that of the Union's political leadership.  Last Thursday's Council meeting hailed the loudest contradiction to date.  The best example came from Angela Merkel who was clad in her solitary green jacket but was firm in her resolve that the treaty must go on.  Reassurances that the Irish vote would be respected were qualified with threats of Irish isolation, a two-speed Europe and legal manoeuvres to allow the treaty to be implemented without Ireland's consent.  This and the words last week are a reflection of the respect some EU leaders have for the rules of the EU as a whole.The Taoiseach made his whimpering excuses on behalf of the Irish people, got shoved out to the edge of the class for the group photograph and slunk back home to continue his barrage of insults against over 53% of the electorate who voted against the treaty whom his party has now likened to the reprehensible Jean-Marie Le Pen.What the Taoiseach should have done last Thursday——

What the Taoiseach should have done last Thursday was acknowledge that the people he was put here to serve have given him a clear mandate with regard to the fate of the Lisbon treaty.  We have also given him a comprehensive list of achievable deliverables that can be put in place in the treaty.  These deliverables clearly reflected our commitment to and support for the Union despite the Taoiseach's attempt to brand us otherwise.This debate, as the Taoiseach well knows, was never about whether Ireland is in or out of Europe.  All sections of the debate agreed that Ireland's place in Europe but we in the "No" campaign believed that a better deal was possible.  I still believe a better deal is possible.  We articulated clearly the type of Europe we wish to shape.  We are ambitious for the Union and believe its social model should be based on peace, democracy, equality and prosperity.  We take those values seriously.Sinn Féin's campaign against the treaty focused on four central areas of concern, namely, democracy, neutrality, workers' rights and public services.  Workers and voters shared our concerns, as evidenced at public meetings and in national and regional letters' sections of the newspapers and radio debates for months prior to the referendum.  We also outlined our concerns with respect to other issues such as trade, the developing world and the European atomic energy treaty.  The people listened and voted accordingly.Last Wednesday, my party presented the Taoiseach's office with a detailed submission on what a new treaty should contain if the concerns of the Irish, French, Dutch and many millions of people throughout Europe are to be addressed.  It is time he stopped putting up obstacles to this discussion and took the solution-based approach.  The people have spoken and the Lisbon treaty is over.  The Taoiseach can still demand of EU leaders that the ratification process end and a new deal be negotiated.  It is false to argue that the Lisbon treaty was plan B.  It was not and was never intended to be.  It was plan A with a new cover.Sinn Féin's submission contains the detail of a better deal.  It represents short-term strategic reforms which we believe are reasonable, practical and deliverable in the context of any upcoming new deal negotiations, but they are the minimum required in any treaty.  We must have a new deal.  The electorate will not accept a rerun of Lisbon.  The Taoiseach knows that, I know it and every dog in the street knows it.  Europe will not, and cannot, forge ahead at different speeds.  It was not built that way and will collapse if it attempts to do so.  To introduce a two-speed Europe would begin the process of unravelling the thread of the Union itself.  Rather than deepen the democratic deficit, the Taoiseach should be seeking to close the gap between the citizens of member states and the EU institutions.I agree there is a need for future treaties, but they must be written in clear and accessible language.  There is also a need to provide all members of the public with treaty documents that clearly mark proposed changes under consideration.  These must be accompanied by explanatory notes outlining in plain language the implications of such changes.  These notes must also be independent and descriptive, not interpretative.  Such information should be provided by either the Government or the relevant EU institution, at least six months before any future referendum so we as a society can have a full debate on the implications of all of the proposed changes to our current position within the European Union.These measures would go a significant way towards addressing the information deficit on Europe highlighted by the electorate during the campaign.  It is not good enough for elected representatives to assume the public are not interested.  The huge turnout for the recent referendum showed they are interested.  They have a voice and want to be heard.  The continuing debate throughout Ireland and all member states suggests they are interested and have the future of Europe at heart.  The dissemination of information throughout society on issues of such national importance must be taken seriously by the Government.  The Taoiseach and his Government must make a real commitment to addressing this gaping hole in his relationship with the people.The electorate and campaigners also raised further specific concerns that could easily be addressed in a new treaty.  A permanent Commissioner for all member states must be retained.  Arguments made in this Chamber against such a proposition have not stood up to scrutiny.  We can keep the Nice treaty composition of the Commission, with a number of changes to improve its democratic accountability.  Sinn Féin has proposed maintaining the Nice treaty QMV formula.We do not see the need or do not want to see the re-emergence of the self-amending or Passerelle articles in any future treaty.  These articles would allow the Council, acting by unanimity, to shift decisions from unanimity to QMV and to expand the existing competences of the European Union and alter the internal procedural working of the EU institutions without reference to the people.Article 46A, which gives the European Union a single legal personality, must also be dropped.  We want to see member state parliaments given greater scope for intervention in the EU legislative programme, the lowering of thresholds for the application of the yellow and orange card system proposed in the Lisbon treaty, the removal of the requirement for support from the European Council or Parliament to block a proposal, to legally oblige the Commission to respond to any yellow or orange card, and to give groups of member states opportunities to propose amendments to proposals on the basis of non-compliance with the aims and values of the European Union.  Such changes would account for more than mere window dressing.  They would deliver truly democratic EU decision making structures between member states and the EU Parliament.Ireland, with its unique military neutral status, should seek significant amendments to the section of the Lisbon treaty dealing with common defence and security policy.  Sinn Féin has proposed introducing unanimity into all aspects of common defence and security policy to explicitly recognise neutral and non-aligned states and give them the same status that was being accorded to NATO members in the Lisbon treaty.  Sinn Féin has proposed the removal of the NATO compatibility requirement from the framing of common defence and security policy.  We also propose including a detailed protocol explicitly protecting Irish neutrality, while maintaining the ability of the State to participate in UN-authorised peace keeping and civil and military responses to humanitarian and natural disasters.The wording and application of any future social clause must be strengthened, specifically compelling the Commission to produce a social and equality impact assessment of all legislative proposals.  The protection of public services must also be addressed.  The existing protocol on services of general interest must be substantially reworded, making it a protocol on vital public services.  This would allow member states to define which services should be defined as vital public services and protect such services from the application of EU rules on competition and State aid.These are some examples of what Sinn Féin recommends.  The Taoiseach and Minister have been given our document and, hopefully, will use it to address the concerns of the Irish electorate when a new treaty is being negotiated over the next number of years.

For example, how does the Minister propose to combat the existence of posters of a threatening nature, such those that suggested "Vote No or you will pay" or "People have given their lives for your freedom, don't throw it away"?  Other posters had pictures of three monkeys and suggested people were being kept silent, would not be listened to and were, effectively, monkeys.  How does the Minister propose to deal with this issue?How too does he propose to deal with a situation whereby anybody purporting to speak in favour of a "Yes" vote through the media generally, is automatically required to have a person supporting a "No" vote given an equal proportion of time and space?  How is it envisaged one can ever win an argument while that remains the case?

The debate was marked and characterised by posters with excessive hype, exaggeration and hyperbole.  They were clearly wrong and appealed to people's emotions.  The degree of their impact is open to question.  I am also conscious of leaflets funded from overseas.  The United Kingdom Independence Party financed a leaflet that had everything but the words "Vote No" on it.  Perhaps because of this, it may have passed some rule which facilitated funding.  These issues should be examined because the leaflet threatened the confiscation of people's salary if they voted "Yes".

It is a matter on which we could all reflect.  Those on the "Yes" side cannot complain about the rules of the game afterwards.  The rules are there for everyone to play by and, during the campaign, when the "No" side did not like adjudications by the Referendum Commission, it sought to shoot the messenger.

As soon as it did so, people questioned its right to do so.  I do not want to be in that position now.One of the best programmes on the treaty was the "Prime Time" programme of two weeks ago.  It analysed the treaty and the arguments for and against and made an objective appraisal of the treaty's relevance to each issue.  It covered taxation and abortion.  Then it had a debate between two people for and two people against.  For the person listening or watching, the other programmes gave five minutes to the "Yes" side and five minutes to the "No" side, with one side saying it was black, the other saying it was white.  In that case one can argue that it depends on the prowess and communication ability of the proponents and antagonists but the person listening was more puzzled afterwards.  That is why we are engaging in a research project on the campaign and on why people were uncomfortable with the treaty and voted "No" and "Yes".  It will also consider the underlying attitudes to the EU.I was taken by Deputy Ó Snodaigh's remarks.  He almost criticised the Taoiseach for saying that the overwhelming majority of Irish people are for the Union, describing this as "weasel words".  I heard Mary Lou McDonald on television, at pains to point out that Sinn Féin was pro-Union, in line with the majority of the Irish people.  The gurus behind the Sinn Féin operation presented Mary Lou McDonald as the MEP with a particular message targeted and designed to be attractive to the middle ground watching the "Six One News".  When the veneer is taken away, Deputy Ó Snodaigh shows a deep-seated hostility to the European project, as evidenced by the tone and tenor of his remarks this morning.  There are lessons to be learned and we are open to learning them.

We must examine what we are for.  People say we are for remaining in the EU and for the European project but what does that mean in practice?It is fine if people say what should happen in the post-referendum situation.  There must be a focus on delivery.  Those who campaigned on the referendum have a responsibility not just to produce a list for the Government to negotiate.  They should say that they can deliver parties across the EU, or ideally governments across the EU, in support of the new position.The treaty cannot be ratified, which is clear.  We should not go down the road of a second referendum, for the reasons I mentioned earlier.  The renegotiation will take time.  The reality is that we are stuck with Nice.  We must turn our minds to how the continuing operation of the EU can be squared with Nice.  The working assumption must be developing our proposals based on Nice rather than developing on the assumption that Lisbon will happen.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-06-25 00:00:00	Prelude	351	The point about research is covered.  We want the research to embrace the attitudes to the EU, not just the general attitude but how people see Ireland's role in the Union into the future.  We took at face value the protestations of those who advocated "No" to Lisbon that they were for the EU and for Ireland being at the heart of the EU.  Those who advocated "No" said this repeatedly and with great intensity.

If that is the case, there is a responsibility on such groups not just to present a document, to wish us the best of luck negotiating it and to retain a reserve position to oppose it if 80% of the document is not achieved but rather to use their influence to keep Ireland at the heart of the Union.  That is the objective of the Government.At the beginning of the week I said that it was far too premature to talk about options for referendums.  We must undertake proper analysis and engage with our European colleagues to see what we can do to keep Ireland at the heart of the EU.  If everyone in the House is agreed on this, we must put our thinking caps on and engage with those over whom they have influence.  We can provide people with analysis of the parliamentary debates in European states.  In France the communists said "Bravo Irlande".  In Britain there was the United Kingdom Independence Party, in France there was Jean-Marie Le Pen and all over Europe, those on the far right and far left were overjoyed at the Irish rejection of the Lisbon treaty.  I accept there were people in between but it is revealing to see the political background of those who are exulting the most because Ireland voted "No".  There is a responsibility on everyone to ensure Ireland can stay at the heart of the Union.Deputy Gilmore raises an interesting point that the bottom line is that the Nice treaty is pressing.  This was clarified at the GAERC meeting.  People talk about the urgent need to retain a Commissioner.  If the Lisbon treaty had been ratified we would have a full Commissioner up to 2014.  The Nice treaty which is in operation at present, provides for a reduction in the Commission once the Union has 27 member states, which it now has.  It stipulates that the reduced number will be introduced on the basis of strict equal rotation between member states to come into effect on 1 November 2009.  This is exercising our minds and those of our European colleagues.  It is a real and immediate issue.  We face the immediate prospect of losing a Commissioner in November 2009 as opposed to from 2014 onwards under the Lisbon treaty.We are not affected in terms of the European Parliament because we were to be allocated 12 seats under the Lisbon treaty and the Nice treaty provided for Ireland to have 12 seats from 2009.  We have 13 at present because a temporary increase was permitted when Bulgaria and Romania joined the European Union.  In many respects, although many European states and parliamentarians would prefer the European Parliament elections to be held under the terms of the Lisbon treaty, the Commission proposal is a real one.  I know it must have unanimity but it is legal.  It is what people voted for.  I am sure people will not state that ultimately we should defy the wishes of the people who voted on the Nice treaty.  One cannot have it both ways.

Does he agree that the level of EU legislation, proposals and directives coming before the Oireachtas is at an all-time high and shows the opposite to paralysis?Does the Minister accept that rather than apologising to EU leaders for the "No" vote, which was the extent of the Taoiseach's speech, and continuously reassuring them that the Irish people remain committed to a European identity, he should acknowledge our support for the EU identity and the Union but be more forceful in putting forward the Irish mandate, which was to state the Lisbon treaty was at an end?I welcome the Minister's acceptance that it will be the Taoiseach who will have the final say with regard to the reduction of the number of Commissioners.  If we have one less Commissioner from 1 November, it will be in the Taoiseach's lap and he will have to vote on it.  The vote from Ireland on the Lisbon treaty superseded that on the Nice treaty in stating we did not want a reduction in the number of Commissioners and that people wish to retain it.  This is the interpretation of the Lisbon vote.

In a nutshell this is what I believe the inability to get the Lisbon treaty through means.In terms of energy and our engagement with oil producing countries such as Russia, the capacity of Europe is diminished in terms of being a significant player.  It is far better for Ireland that we have an entity such as Europe to represent us on such key energy issues in an effective and efficient way, which is what the reform of the institutions is all about.Europe has been a great leader on climate change.  However, the rest of the world has not come on board with the same momentum or leadership as Europe.  We need an administratively stronger Europe with consistency and continuity at its helm to push these issues with the US.  This is also true with regard to globalisation and the emerging economies of China and India.The Taoiseach did not apologise on behalf of the voters.  This is a deliberately dishonest proposition to put before the House.

#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-06-25 00:00:00	Prelude	370	The Taoiseach was strong and robust at the European Union.  He articulated what the Irish people decided.  He stated to his European colleagues and Heads of State that they had to respect it.  They did respect it and did not seek to isolate Ireland.  He also stated that we do not have answers.  Europe is in difficulty.  We do not have any quick fixes or solutions.  The Taoiseach made this clear to such an extent that the conclusions agreed reflect the position of the Taoiseach and the country, which is not to be told we must do X, Y or Z because we are not in a position to state we can do so.  We will analyse it ourselves and see how we can map a way forward.  This is as far as we went.  The conclusions of the summit reflect this position.With regard to suggesting that the Taoiseach should have told other member states not to do this or that with regard to ratification, in our view it would be unacceptable for us to deny the sovereign right of democratically elected parliaments across the European Union to decide for themselves whether they wish to ratify the Lisbon treaty.  Just as we wish them to respect our right to say "No", we must respect their democratic processes and their right to say either "Yes" or "No" through their parliamentary democracies.

It is strange to me that the unelected elite in this country all advocated a "No" vote.

These issues are of real concern to the Irish people and I appeal to the Minister that if, as he reflects on the outcome of the referendum, he draws up new proposals to put to the people that we opt in fully to the justice and home affairs aspect.

It is far too early and we are in a period of analysis.  I intend to engage with the Oireachtas on this issue over the coming months.  It is important that the supremacy of the Dáil as the elected forum of the people is reflected and has an input.With regard to the bio-fuels issue, conflicting views exist on the impact of bio-fuels on the food issue.  It is not all related to bio-fuels and deeply contested views are held.  Having had access to significant research on bio-fuels in a previous position, the sooner we get to second generation bio-fuel production the better in order that we do not have to divert food production opportunities to the bio-fuels sector.  That is the key.Deputy Creighton referred to the Charter of Fundamental Rights and social issues pertaining to abortion and so on.  The charter relates to how the European institutions apply their mandates but Ireland's Maastricht protocol protects our constitutional provisions regarding the right to life of the unborn and this was confirmed by the Archbishop of Dublin.  I take on board the Deputy's comments on the home affairs issue but it is arguable others would have used that just as they used the defence and neutrality issue, notwithstanding the protections we have in place, to drive a wedge between the "Yes" and "No" sides.  However, in the context of reflection, I appreciate the Deputy's views on those issues and I will take them on board.Deputy Durkan made a fair point.  If one conducted a little research across Europe about who is absolutely delighted with the "No" vote, it is revealing in itself.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-06-25 00:00:00	Prelude	381	In the previous Question Time, I indicated that persons over the age of 75 years would not be required to use the social services card.  However, I should have stated that they would not be obliged to use it in the first tranche this year.  An information campaign will be launched to support them in this regard.  Given the discussion on the economic downturn, I wish to reassure people that the Government is committed to ensuring support for everyone in a vulnerable position.The first question relates to a relevant and important matter, namely, fuel poverty and the rising cost of fuel.  Fuel poverty is an issue that involves the Departments of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Communications, Energy and Natural Resources and Social and Family Affairs.My Department's role is to assist social welfare recipients with heating costs, both through their basic payments and the household benefits package with fuel, electricity and gas allowances.  These schemes have been improved significantly in recent years.  For example, the fuel allowance is now payable for 30 weeks and benefits 290,000 people at an aggregate cost of €170 million this year.  The payment rate has also increased to €18 per week or €21.90 for recipients living in designated smokeless areas.  Electricity and gas allowances under the household benefits package are payable throughout the year to more than 355,000 pensioners, people with disabilities and carer households towards their heating, light and cooking costs at an estimated overall scheme cost of €159 million in 2008.  The supplementary welfare allowance scheme can also be used to assist people in certain circumstances with specific heating needs due to infirmity or a particular medical condition.The income maintenance needs of those on social welfare payments have also been met in recent years through significantly increased primary social welfare rates.  Government policy is focused on increasing these rates to ensure that people can meet their basic living costs, including heating costs, throughout the year and also achieve an improvement in quality of life.  Since December 2001, overall inflation has increased by 27% while energy product prices have increased by 65%.  However, increases in social welfare payments have been between 71% and 88% in the same period.A number of organisations, including Sustainable Energy Ireland, the Combat Poverty Agency and the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, are engaged in action research projects on energy efficiency.  My Department is co-operating with these projects, including providing funding for one project.  Reports on these fuel research projects, which are expected by the third quarter of this year, will help to inform Government policy on fuel poverty.Any changes to social welfare programmes to assist with heating costs will be considered in a budgetary context.  However, the main focus of the Government will be on increasing social welfare payments in real terms to enable social welfare recipients to better meet heating and other needs.
#OlwynEnrightFG	unknown-#OlwynEnrightFG-party	unknown-#OlwynEnrightFG-dob	unknown-#OlwynEnrightFG-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-06-25 00:00:00	Prelude	382	While the Minister may have the results of the surveys by the third quarter, winter will have started by that time and people will be suffering.  The Minister will be aware that the Institute of Public Health in Ireland believes fuel poverty levels are unacceptably high in the Republic.  While the relevant statistics are old, she will also be aware that we have the highest incidence of winter mortality in Europe.  While more people are bound to die during winter, the reasons include fuel poverty, according to the institute.While the Minister mentioned that the Government cares about this issue, actions speak louder than words.  A risk obtains in this situation.  I assume the Minister is aware that the price of domestic heating oil increased by 47%, in excess of €1,200 or €1,300 per tank per year, between May 2007 and May 2008.  How does she intend to address this matter?  While I welcome Government focus on increasing social welfare rates, the fuel issue must be addressed specifically.  Given the Minister's comments, I am concerned about whether she will really enter the rounds of negotiations to bat on this issue.  Will she confirm to the House whether she intends to seek an increase?  I am not asking for a token increase of an extra week to try to keep everyone happy or to prevent them from stating that they received nothing.  I am asking for a real increase to reflect inflation in fuel prices.Yesterday, Age Action Ireland put it to me that elderly people will need to make a choice between food and fuel this winter.  This would be unacceptable in the Ireland of 2008.  I want the Minister's commitment that she will ensure elderly people and lone parents need not make such a life or death decision.

The Deputy is wrong in stating that the issue is not being addressed.

For this reason, the work being carried out by the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government on housing standards and energy issues is important.  It should not just be a case of giving pensioners money to heat houses if that heat is going straight out the window.  For this reason, it is important that Departments work together.Deputy Enright referred to the Institute of Public Health in Ireland's figures on winter mortality rates, namely, excess deaths during winter over other months.  Some 70% of those deaths are due to cardiovascular disease, 69% are due to respiratory illness and 40%——

Given that houses must be of a certain standard, it is important that the Government continue to support initiatives in this regard.  Last year, we increased the fuel allowance by one week.  Its amount has been increased over a number of years.  An income disregard of €100 over the contributory pension was introduced for those who could avail of it.

#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-06-25 00:00:00	Prelude	393	I welcome the recent research by the Vincentian Partnership for Social Justice, which clearly demonstrates the considerable progress made by the Government since the publication of its original research entitled, Minimum Essential Budgets for Six Households, in late 2006.  This is one of a number of research models and presents some useful information.  The updated findings will be studied with interest by the Department.  The recent update shows significant improvements in the position for most household types.  In particular, pensioner couple households and lone parents or couples with younger children have seen their positions improve dramatically.The decisive steps taken by the Government in the past two years on a wide range of fronts have addressed some of the problems and challenges identified in the 2006 report and in similar studies.  Such actions include the introduction of the early child care supplement and increases in social welfare rates and the national minimum wage.  Social welfare pensions have increased by €30 per week and basic welfare rates by €32 per week since 2006.  These increases have been well in excess of both inflation and wage growth.  Child benefit rates have increased by more than 10% in the same period while the qualified child allowance has been significantly restructured and enhanced.  Other measures have included improvements in the means testing arrangements for a range of schemes, such as jobseekers allowance and disability allowance, which are designed to encourage recipients and their spouses or partners to work, thereby increasing total household income, changes in the upper earnings limit for one-parent family payment and improvements in the family income supplement focused on larger families.The Government remains committed to improving the standard of living of welfare dependent and low-income households significantly and to implementing the national action plan on social inclusion, a key objective of which is the elimination of consistent poverty.  We will continue to pursue these policies having regard to available resources.
#RoisinShortall	unknown-#RoisinShortall-party	unknown-#RoisinShortall-dob	unknown-#RoisinShortall-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-06-25 00:00:00	Prelude	394	I asked for the Minister's opinion on the research conducted by the partnership.  We would all acknowledge the work of its constituent members in respect of poverty.  What are the Minister's opinions on the partnership's findings?  While the research established that there have been improvements in many sectors, the partnership's approach to measuring what is required to survive and make ends meet among various family types is a different approach from that taken by the Minister's Department.  After the partnership examined 27 family types, it found that 15 types were making ends meet.  The remain 12, however, were not.What is the Minister's opinion on the research and its approach to measuring the adequacy of income?  Has the Minister considered adopting that type of approach in her Department?  Rates have been set in the Department for different categories of social welfare recipients.  Annual increases in benefits tend to be made in line with inflation.  The approach proposed in this respect is different; it takes account of the different types of family compositions and the costs involved.  One of the key areas to which recognition is not given is the difference in the child care costs associated with children of different ages.  For example, whether it be child dependant allowance or the child benefit payment, will the Minister accept there is a world of difference in the costs involved in rearing a two year old and a 16 or 18 year old?  Does she consider that the approach taken by the Vincentian Partnership has some merit and might be adopted by her Department?
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-06-25 00:00:00	Prelude	395	As I said initially, this is only one of a number of research models.  Many models and figures were presented by the various groups I met in recent weeks.  They each come up with different measures.  One of them is the Vincentian minimum essential budget, which is only one such method.  It proposes an income level of €265 per week for an unemployed single male.  An alternative, which is frequently put forward, is that of 60% of the median income, which proposes an income level of €223.  Another is the benchmark model which proposes an income level of 30% gross average industrial earnings.  Different people use different models.  Therefore, it is not correct to say that any one model is better than another.

#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-06-25 00:00:00	Prelude	397	No, therefore, there is no question of us simply adopting one model over the others.The Government has already accepted that there are different cost implications for different groups.  The early child care allowance was introduced in the first instance because of the particularly high child care costs involved in rearing very young children.  That is why children under the age of six were particularly targeted in that respect.  The child benefit payment targets families with children.  The success of targeting pensioners has been indicated by the reduction to 2.2% of the number of people, particularly pensioners, living in consistent poverty.  Therefore, the Government recognises that different people and groups need to be targeted in different ways, but our overall aim is to ensure the general rate of social welfare payments will continue to increase.

#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-06-25 00:00:00	Prelude	403	The Civil Public and Services Union, CPSU, the union which represents clerical and supervisory grades in the Civil Service, is currently engaged in industrial action in pursuit of a claim for the extension of flexi time bands in the Department.  Initially, the industrial action commenced with the withdrawal of co-operation with the implementation of a new time and attendance system by the Department.  The implementation of the new system had been agreed in November 2006 as part of the Department's Towards 2016 modernisation action plan, progress on which has been the basis for pay awards under the agreement.Industrial action was escalated with effect from 28 April 2008 to include the withdrawal of lunch-time service to the public at the Department's local offices and not answering telephones during the lunch-time period across the Department.  Discussions at a departmental level were unable to resolve the issue.  Following the intervention of the National Implementation Body, the parties were referred to facilitation discussions at the Labour Relations Commission.  At the end of two sessions, on 29 May and 12 June, agreement was not reached.The CPSU escalated industrial action, with effect from 16 June, to include not answering telephones in all of the Department's offices and a ban on overtime.  However, on foot of a statement issued by the National Implementation Body on 19 June 2008 and the agreement of both the Department and the CPSU to engage in further discussions at the LRC, the CPSU stood down the escalated action that had been in effect from Monday 16 June.  In accordance with the recommendation of the National Implementation Body the discussions at the LRC are to be completed by 1 July 2008.Pending resolution of the dispute the Department's local offices will be closed and telephones will not be answered during lunch-hour.  However, apart from this, services are being provided as normal.Clients who may be unable to attend at a local office during current opening hours may continue to make application for various payments by post.  Application forms are widely available at post offices, citizens information bureaus and on the Department's website www.welfare.ie.It is not envisaged that the current dispute will lead to delays in payments, but the matter will be kept under review.  I was reassured to hear the assistant general secretary of the CPSU state in an interview on national radio that "nobody's payment will be affected" and that it will continue to be a priority that "nobody suffers in terms of payments".

As I was not allowed raise and get a response to this matter on the Order of Business, I raised it by way of tabling this question.Has a backlog of work been created as a result of the industrial action to date?  I appreciate the Minister said the industrial action has not caused the stoppage or prevention of payments to people, but is there concern that such industrial action has created or will create in the period up to 1 July a backlog of work in the Department's offices?  I received correspondence, which I am aware the Minister also received, as it was copied to me, from people who experienced difficulty contacting the Department's offices and who have complained to us on that basis.  This is the key issue, namely, whether as a result of the inconvenience caused by the industrial action a backlog of work has been created and, if it has, how the Minister intends to address it.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-06-25 00:00:00	Prelude	405	I am not aware of any backlog and it is unlikely one would develop at this stage, particularly now that the escalation of the strike has been stood down.  It is important that people realise that given that applications must be made in writing, that they will be dealt with.  People should download the relevant forms or obtain them from the Department's offices and submit their applications.Our intention always is to serve the public.  We want to ensure the best possible service continues to be delivered, as is the case in all the local offices throughout the country, and to ensure people can get the information they need and have their applications processed.At present, local offices will be closed during lunch-hour and telephones will not be answered during that period.  Hopefully people will be able to contact the offices during office hours outside lunch-hour.  Given that the people concerned will engage in further discussions at the Labour Relations Commission tomorrow, I sincerely hope both sides can reach a resolution of the dispute in the interests of the public.

Some concern was expressed that if the dispute escalated, which hopefully will not happen now, it could affect the agencies under the remit of the Minister's Department.  Does she have an concern about that or has that issue been brought to her attention?
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-06-25 00:00:00	Prelude	407	No it has not been brought to my intention that there is any danger or likelihood of that happening.  It is probably a bit early to be discussing these issues, given that discussions on this matter will take place at the Labour Relations Commission tomorrow and that the advice is to have it resolved before 1 July, which will be next week.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-06-25 00:00:00	Prelude	408	The question of introducing a paternity benefit payment would depend on establishing an underlying entitlement to statutory paternity leave in the first instance.  Responsibility for issues relating to paternity leave rests with the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform.Following commitments made in the social partnership agreement Towards 2016, a working group led by the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform has been convened to review the level of provision of both maternity and paternity leave.  The group is currently examining various options and is due to conclude its deliberations before the end of 2008.  The work of the group will be informed by the commitment in An Agreed Programme for Government to increase, over the next five years, paid maternity leave by five weeks, to make all leave after the first 26 weeks available to either parent, and to examine the possibility of introducing a statutory entitlement to paternity leave and shared parental leave.  The Department participates in this group.While male employees are not entitled under Irish law to either paid or unpaid paternity leave, they may be entitled to parental leave.  Parental leave entitles both parents who qualify to take a period of up to 14 weeks' unpaid leave from employment in respect of children aged up to eight years.  There is no provision for a social insurance based payment for periods of parental leave, but employees may be entitled to credited contributions to maintain their social insurance record for the period.The introduction of paid paternity leave would have significant cost implications.  For example, the estimated full year cost of introducing a paternity benefit, on a similar basis to maternity benefit, would be €273 million.  The question of how such a payment would be financed would have to be examined.
#RoisinShortall	unknown-#RoisinShortall-party	unknown-#RoisinShortall-dob	unknown-#RoisinShortall-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-06-25 00:00:00	Prelude	409	There is a recognition in the programme for Government of the need to support parents in spending more time with their children.  The Government also made a commitment in it to examine the possibility of introducing paternity benefit.  It seems little progress has been made on that.  That area comes under the remit of the Minister's Department.  I do not understand why consideration of such provision must be deferred until the working group in the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform has completed its business.  Does the Minister believe it is right that the State should support fathers in spending time with their infants within the first few months of their lives?  There are major pressures on a couple when a baby is born.  There is a recognition of this in the provision of maternity leave and parental leave.  The problem, however, is that parental leave is unpaid.  Therefore, a father will suffer financially if he takes leave from work to spend time with his partner and new baby.  This is a regressive situation.  We should be facilitating parents in spending more time with their children.  Is the Minister prepared to move ahead in this regard in respect of the responsibilities which fall within her Department?
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-06-25 00:00:00	Prelude	410	It is not possible for the Department of Social and Family Affairs to move ahead without an entitlement being established.  However, the establishment of an entitlement to statutory paternity leave comes under the remit of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform.  That is why we are working together in the working group.  The Government has always shown itself to be committed to parents.  The provision in the programme for Government for an additional five weeks paternal leave to be available to either parent after the first 26 weeks indicates the importance we place on facilitating both parents in being actively involved in the rearing of their children.However, entitlement to statutory paternity leave would first have to be established, after which a scheme would have to be devised to facilitate it.  After that, questions arise as to how much it might cost and where the money would come from.  All these issues are being considered by the working group, which is due to report by the end of the year.  This process is being led by the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform but my Department has a key role as the prospective administrator of any potential provision.  I look forward to the working group's report.
#RoisinShortall	unknown-#RoisinShortall-party	unknown-#RoisinShortall-dob	unknown-#RoisinShortall-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-06-25 00:00:00	Prelude	411	We are talking about paternity benefit.  Entitlement would be based on the person's insurance record, which comes within the remit of the Minister's Department.  I do not see the difficulty in establishing that entitlement, just as entitlement may be established in respect of any other social welfare payment.  That is what the commitment in the programme for Government is about.  Parents are seeking a provision for paid parental leave, however small to begin with, which they can take within a few months of a baby being born.  That is the time when couples experience most pressure.  I see no difficulty in establishing that entitlement.  Given the commitment in the programme for Government, the Minister should lead the way on this.  It is not necessarily a question of providing the same type of entitlement as already exists in respect of maternity benefit but of at least providing a small amount of paternity benefit for those early weeks of a child's life.

The group will consider all the implications of the introduction of such a statutory entitlement, including cost and issues relating to competitiveness.  These are significant implications which must be considered by each of the relevant Departments.  The report is due at the end of the year, after which there will be three and a half years of the Government's term remaining to implement its recommendations.

#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-06-25 00:00:00	Prelude	416	The development of a national carers' strategy is a key Government commitment in both the national partnership agreement, Towards 2016, and the programme for Government.  The focus of the strategy is on supporting informal and family carers in the community.  While social welfare supports for carers are a key issue in the strategy, other issues such as access to respite and other health services, education, training and employment are also important.Co-operation between relevant Departments and agencies is essential if the provision of services, supports and entitlements for carers is to be fully addressed.  For that reason, an interdepartmental working group, chaired by the Department of the Taoiseach, was established to develop the strategy.  Developing the strategy involves consultation with Departments and bodies not represented on the working group.  The Department of Social and Family Affairs, on behalf of the working group, has met with a wide range of organisations including the Equality Authority, Combat Poverty Agency and the Citizens Information Board.A request for submissions from the public was published in regional newspapers in early March.  The closing date for submissions was 18 April 2008.  There was a good response from individuals and organisations and the submissions received are currently being examined.Towards 2016 commits the Department to hosting an annual consultation meeting of carer representative groups and relevant Departments and agencies.  Such a meeting was held on 23 January 2008.  The theme was the national carers' strategy and groups were given an opportunity to comment on the draft terms of reference and to raise other issues considered relevant in the context of the strategy.  It is intended to hold a second meeting with carer groups.The commitment to the development of a national carers' strategy also includes a commitment to appropriate consultation with the social partners.  The first of two consultation meetings with the social partners was held on 8 May 2008.  Key issues raised were recognition for carers and their work, access to suitable health services, income support, training, gender issues and balancing employment and care.It is intended to publish the strategy later this year.  In the meantime, substantial improvements have been made to supports for carers as weekly payment rates have greatly increased to €214 per week for carers aged under 66 and €232 for carers aged over 66.  The level of the respite care grant has been in creased to €1,700 per year.  Qualifying conditions for carer's allowance have been eased, notably with the increased earnings disregards which now stand at €332.50 for a single person and €665 for a couple, thus exceeding the Towards 2016 commitments in this regard.
#OlwynEnrightFG	unknown-#OlwynEnrightFG-party	unknown-#OlwynEnrightFG-dob	unknown-#OlwynEnrightFG-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-06-25 00:00:00	Prelude	417	At the meeting of 23 January to which the Minister referred, the impression was given to those present that work would commence as soon as possible on the strategy and that it would be completed by mid-2008.  Next Tuesday, 1 July, is mid-2008.  The initial deadline was the end of 2007.  What is the Department's policy on deadlines?  Does it follow the Government's lead on issues such as decentralisation in respect of which the Taoiseach told us yesterday that while a three-year commitment has not been delivered six years later, it does not matter and we must move on.  The commitment to finalise a national carers' strategy is six months overdue and it remains a work in progress.Will the Minister offer a firm deadline as to when the strategy will be completed?  Will she provide more detail on the depth of the consultation that is taking place?  There is concern among carers that they will be presented with something which does not meet their needs.  There was some discussion at the meeting of 23 January and a position paper was presented at the last meeting with the social partners.  The three agencies to which the Minister referred are State agencies or at least related to her Department.  Carers and their representative bodies are concerned that the issues of most concern to them may not be addressed  in the strategy.  They do not even know whether it will include short-term, medium-term or long-term aims and what they will entail.I appreciate that various Departments and agencies are involved in the process but, as the Minister acknowledged, her Department is providing the secretariat.  While the Department of the Taoiseach may be the lead Department, much of the work falls to the Department of Social and Family Affairs.  Will the Minister provide a clear timeframe for the publication of the strategy and for its delivery?
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-06-25 00:00:00	Prelude	418	It was not possible to meet the deadline of the end of 2007 because the section of the Department dealing with this issue was also working on the Green Paper on pensions, which involved a broad range of consultation, as well as the development of new arrangements for payments to nursing home.  However, since this process began, there has been a significant level of positive consultation.  The request for submissions has produced submission from 50 organisations, 100 from individuals and some 360 which came through questionnaires.The Carers Association of Ireland held a series of regional seminars at the end of last year which allowed individuals to put forward their views on the strategy.  The association has compiled those contributions into a report which I will launch next week.  In the last fortnight I have met representatives of the Carers Association of Ireland and Care Alliance Ireland, the former representing individuals and the latter voluntary organisations.  Both groups had an opportunity to put forward their views.  All these consultations are feeding into the development of the strategy.Many of the issues being raised by carers are more relevant to the Department of Health and Children than to my Department.  At the same time, because they have such wide-reaching terms of reference, they would impact directly on my Department.  The work is ongoing under the Department of the Taoiseach and the target is to complete it by the end of the year.

In addition, it is always available to consult with the Government with a view to achieving progress.  The Minister has told me what I already know.  What I seek is a firm deadline.  I appreciate that the pensions issue had to be dealt with, but I am not sure what role the Department had in the nursing homes issue.  These matters have been on the agenda for some years and to point to them as reasons for the delay in the national carers' strategy is a lame excuse.  Will the Minister provide a definitive timeframe for final publication of the strategy?

#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-06-25 00:00:00	Prelude	423	The supplementary welfare allowance scheme, which includes rent supplement, is administered on behalf of the Department by the community welfare service of the Health Service Executive.  The purpose of rent supplement is to provide short-term income support to eligible tenants living in private rented accommodation whose means are insufficient to meet their accommodation costs and who do not have accommodation available to them from any other source.  There are currently over 63,000 tenants benefiting from assistance under the rent supplement scheme.Responsibility for setting and enforcing housing standards rests with the local authorities.  The community welfare service of the HSE is not qualified to undertake this work.  However, accommodation occupied by rent supplement tenants should at least meet minimum housing standards.  Under legislative provisions introduced by the Department in 2006 and 2007, the HSE can decide that a rent supplement may not be payable where it has been notified by a housing authority regarding non-compliance with housing standards.Where a notification of non-compliance with standards is received from a housing authority in respect of an existing tenant, guidelines recommend that a community welfare officer should discuss the situation with the tenant and take whatever action is necessary in the best interests of the tenant.  The objective is to ensure that substandard accommodation does not come within rent supplementation.  The HSE must be satisfied that accommodation funded under the rent supplement scheme is reasonably suited to the residential and other needs of the claimant.  Where the HSE becomes aware of accommodation or blocks of accommodation which appears to it to be sub-standard, it notifies the local authority and it may advise prospective tenants at that premises that rent supplement will not be paid in respect of those tenancies.A review of the Housing (Standards for Rented Houses) Regulations 1993 is being undertaken by the Minister for State at the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government.  The guidelines will be reviewed in consultation with the community welfare service when the new regulations are published, with a view to supporting the implementation of any provisions that impact on the rent supplement scheme.The Department is committed to working with and supporting the Department of the Environment Heritage and Local Government in meeting its responsibilities in relation to housing standards.
#RoisinShortall	unknown-#RoisinShortall-party	unknown-#RoisinShortall-dob	unknown-#RoisinShortall-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-06-25 00:00:00	Prelude	424	Will the Minister accept that as the scheme operates, community welfare officers are put in an invidious position, given that sometimes they have to decide between making a person homeless or allowing that person to continue living in substandard accommodation?  Often these are the two choices available to a community welfare officer.  The inspection of accommodation is very important and needs to be continued and supplemented as very few inspections take place at present.  There is a need to drive standards up.  As the system operates, that is the choice open to community welfare officers and it is a difficult position in which to put them.  Will the Minister consider whether a different approach can be taken where community welfare officers would be empowered to suspend the payment pending the landlord getting his affairs in order and raising the standard of the accommodation?  Alternatively, the Minister may wish to allow community welfare officers to take a case conference type approach to dealing with cases such as this so that there can be co-ordination between the community welfare officer and the other agencies involved.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-06-25 00:00:00	Prelude	425	One of the key issues for community welfare officers is that they have discretion.  Discretion is paramount in this case as they are able to decide on the most appropriate action.  However, they are asked to do so in consultation with the tenant and to ensure that whatever action is taken is in the best interest of the tenant.

#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-06-25 00:00:00	Prelude	427	No.  The community welfare officers have the discretion to determine what is in the best interest of the tenant.  The regulations which are in existence since 1993 are being reviewed.  Once that happens, my Department will review the guidelines for the community welfare officers which will guide them in regard to decisions they may want to take.  Given that there are 63,000 recipients of the rent supplement scheme, very few notifications have come forward in regard to substandard accommodation.

Threshold has said there are 4,500 bedsits in the State which are poor quality, damp and vermin-infested fire traps.  That is not an improvement.  Will the Minister empower community welfare officers, when a tenant gets local authority housing or moves on to RAS or whatever, to issue a notice to the landlord, through the other agencies, that he or she cannot rent that property to anyone else?  I understand the predicament of community welfare officers that they do not want to make somebody homeless, but if they could prevent somebody else moving into the accommodation it would ensure the landlord could not continue to profit from substandard accommodation in which nobody should be asked to live.

The level of inspections needs to be increased if standards in private rented accommodation are to be improved.  Will the Minister accept that in many situations where a community welfare officer points out that the standard of the accommodation is inadequate, the alternative is that the person becomes homeless?  It may be okay in certain parts of Dublin where a good deal of accommodation is available but in other areas that is not necessarily the case.  Will the Minister accept that what is required is a far greater level of co-ordination between her Department, RAS, local authorities and the local authority housing officers?  With proper expansion of RAS many of these difficulties could be overcome.

Given that €392 million is being spent on a scheme I accept it needs to be fully co-ordinated between the different Departments.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-06-25 00:00:00	Prelude	436	The appropriateness of benchmarking social welfare rates has been actively considered from time to time.In 2001, the social welfare benchmarking and indexation group was established to examine the issues involved in developing a benchmark for adequacy of adult and child social welfare payments.  The group published its final report in September 2001 but did not achieve a consensus position on the desirability of establishing a formal benchmark.  The illustrative benchmark options examined in the report included 30% of gross average industrial earnings and 50% of average weekly household income.  The group could not agree about which of these would be the better option as there were advantages and disadvantages associated with each.The report provides a valuable resource for the assessment of the implications of adopting particular approaches to the up rating of social welfare payments and was considered by Government as part of the review of the national anti-poverty strategy in 2002.  Recognising that the exact rate was a matter for Government, the strategy set a target of €150 per week, in 2002 terms, for the lowest social welfare payments to be met by 2007.  This target was achieved in 2007.  The National Action Plan for Social Inclusion 2007-2016 includes a commitment to maintain the relative value of the lowest social welfare rate at least at €185.80, in 2007 terms, over the course of the plan, subject to available resources.  This commitment is reiterated in the agreed programme for Government.The value of the lowest rate of welfare payment was fully maintained in budget 2008 and stands at €197.80 per week following an increase of €12 per week or over 6%.  In the last six budgets, the value of the lowest rate of payment has increased by a cumulative €79 per week or 67%.  By any standards, the levels of increases in welfare payments generally over the period since 2002 have been exceptional and are a demonstration of our continuing commitment to all those who are less well off.

Will the Minister engage on this one issue?  Does she accept that one cannot operate a one-size-fits-all approach in regard to social welfare payments?  This is the fundamental point being made in the Vincentian Partnership research.  For example, in regard to  child rearing costs one cannot say it costs the same amount to rear a three year old as a 17 year old.  What the Vincentian Partnership research has asked is that the Minister should consider introducing a new system of measuring the adequacy of social welfare payments which actually recognises the real costs involved for different types of families.  Obviously there are significant costs when rearing teenagers in terms of clothing and food — similar to an adult in those respects — but also school costs.  From her previous job, the Minister should be aware of the huge financial pressures on low income families with teenagers.The other area is in respect of lone pensioners where the living alone allowance has not been increased for 12 years and is set at €7.70.  One cannot possibly say that the overheads and expenses associated with day to day living are the same for one person as for two people.  The Minister is not taking into consideration these particular costs in regard to those categories of families.  Will the Minister consider taking the approach suggested in the Vincentian Partnership documents?

The Government introduced the early child care allowance to target that particular group.  We also recognise that there are increased costs for people going back to school, which is why parents with children going to second level get more in the back-to-school allowance than parents with primary school children.  There are different ways of supporting the various groups referred to by the Deputy.

Does the Minister agree that the living costs for a pensioner living alone are approximately 73% of a couple's costs?  A pensioner whose husband recently died informed me that her household costs are the same except for the fact that she buys a bit less food and only clothes for one person.  She still has to pay car insurance, car tax, car repayments and her household running costs are all the exact same but now she has only one income.  The lack of an increase in the living alone allowance is pushing that elderly lady into poverty.  Similar examples can be found elsewhere in the country.  Regardless of which figures one chooses, the reality on the ground is the same.The Minister spoke about increasing the overall social welfare rates.  The social welfare system has to target those who need help most.  I urge her to give some consideration to the living alone allowance.

#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-06-25 00:00:00	Prelude	450	I propose to take Questions Nos. 75 and 128 together.The national fuel allowance scheme assists householders on long-term social welfare or health service executive, HSE, payments to meet the cost of their heating needs during the winter season.  Fuel allowance is paid for 30 weeks from end-September to end-April.  The allowance represents a contribution towards a person's normal heating expenses.  It is not intended to meet those costs in full.  A total of 290,000 people, 170,000 with basic fuel allowance and 120,000 with smokeless fuel supplement, will benefit under the scheme at a cost of more than €170 million in 2008.Fuel allowance is incorporated into a person's weekly social welfare payment.  That reflects the objective that total weekly income, including the fuel allowance, is sufficient to meet all of a person's income needs, including heating costs.  The main role of the social welfare system is to provide income supports.  Government policy in recent years has focused on significantly increasing primary social welfare rates to ensure that people on social welfare can meet their basic living costs, including heating, throughout the year and to achieve an improvement in quality of life.  That is a more costly approach than increasing fuel allowance, as the increase is paid for the full year and not just for the 30 weeks of the winter heating season.  Social welfare rates have increased at a significantly greater rate than price inflation in recent years.  Since December 2001, overall inflation has increased by over 27% while energy product prices have increased by 65%.  However, increases in social welfare payments, including fuel allowance, have been between 71% and 88% in the same period.In addition to primary payments and fuel allowance, electricity and gas allowances under the household benefits package, are payable throughout the year to more than 355,000 pensioners, people with disabilities, and carer households towards their heating, light and cooking costs at an estimated overall scheme cost of €159 million in 2008.  A special heating needs facility is also available through the supplementary welfare allowance scheme to assist people in certain circumstances with specific heating needs due to infirmity or a particular medical condition.Fuel poverty is the inability to afford adequate warmth in a home, or the inability to achieve adequate warmth because of the energy inefficiency of the home.  The Department is working with all other Departments both in doing research and on various projects to see how the less well-off in society can be supported.
#JohnODonoghue	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-party	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-dob	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-06-25 00:00:00	Prelude	451	As Questions Nos. 75 and 128 are being taken together the time is doubled.  Twelve minutes will be allowed for the question.
#ArthurMorganSF	unknown-#ArthurMorganSF-party	unknown-#ArthurMorganSF-dob	unknown-#ArthurMorganSF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-06-25 00:00:00	Prelude	452	That is a pleasant change.  There has been much talk in the media recently about the significant increase in fuel costs and its impact on business, rightly so.  However, there has not been the same focus on the impact of rising fuel costs, especially on older people and families with lower incomes.  Does the Minister accept that the impact of the increased fuel costs on those categories of people has been significant?  If one looks at the weather today and for the past week, it is evident that the Irish summer has changed.  Does the Minister accept that the poor summer weather strengthens the case for the extension of the scheme?  There was no increase in the scheme in last year's budget.  Does the Minister accept there is a need to increase the fuel allowance due to the significant impact on the health of older people?  If additional fuel allowance is not provided then the Minister for Health and Children will have to expend more money to treat such people in hospital.  Does the Minister accept in the first instance that there is a difficulty with people meeting their fuel bills?  Perhaps I will ask a supplementary question following the Minister's reply.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-06-25 00:00:00	Prelude	453	It is obvious that the fuel prices are impacting on everybody; individuals at home, industry, community facilities and schools, and on the Irish economy, as it is on the world economy.  The cost of fuel is to the forefront of the Government's discussions.  I have had initial discussions with the Minister for Finance, the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, and the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources on the impact of the increase in fuel costs, especially on social welfare recipients.  The best way to ensure adequate heat for people is not just through a funding mechanism, we want to ensure also that houses are efficient at conserving energy.  Much work is going on between the various Departments and perhaps that should be better promoted so that people are aware of what is available to them.The Government's approach in recent years has been to increase social welfare payments generally to ensure that people have enough money to meet their basic needs every week, including heating.  Increases have featured in all of today's questions.  I accept that the draw on that money for heating this year is probably greater than in any other year.  We increased the fuel allowance payment by one week this year and that issue can continue to be examined, as can the amount.  It is a costly scheme.  It would cost approximately €9 million to increase it by €1.  To increase it by a week would cost €5.6 million and to give the fuel allowance all year round would cost €123 million extra.  As Deputy Morgan indicated, given the weather we currently have, people might need heat even during mid-summer.

#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-06-25 00:00:00	Prelude	455	We must consider what is the best use for the money or whether we would be better off putting it into the general payments.
#ArthurMorganSF	unknown-#ArthurMorganSF-party	unknown-#ArthurMorganSF-dob	unknown-#ArthurMorganSF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-06-25 00:00:00	Prelude	456	A couple of points arise from the Minister's reply.  Is her Department engaging with other Departments on house building, especially local authority housing, to ensure that the best insulation systems are in place to capture the maximum heat in the home?  Does the Department have a role in that regard?Regarding the €123 million extra it would cost to provide the fuel allowance all year round, does the Minister accept that if she does not do so that a significant amount of that sum will be expended by the Department of Health and Children to treat colds, pneumonia and other ailments that will result from a lack of heat, especially among older people?  I agree with the Minister that the purpose of the allowance is to ensure people can meet their heating costs.  However, they are clearly not meeting their costs.  Given the significant increase in fuel prices, does the Minister accept that something needs to happen urgently?
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-06-25 00:00:00	Prelude	457	The Department is co-operating with a number of organisations, including Sustainable Energy Ireland, the Combat Poverty Agency and the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, on making homes warmer.  We are funding one of the projects in that regard.  It is an action research project which obviously will help to feed into future policy.  I have already mentioned the fuel allowance which is available to people under general social welfare payments.  The free units people get are not affected by the price of fuel because they get those units irrespective of the price.  Some 350,000 pensioners get the household benefit and need not worry about the cost of that scheme.
#ArthurMorganSF	unknown-#ArthurMorganSF-party	unknown-#ArthurMorganSF-dob	unknown-#ArthurMorganSF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-06-25 00:00:00	Prelude	458	The €123 million will end up being spent anyway through expenditure on health services.  Why not cut out the middle person and have it dealt with through the Department of Social and Family Affairs?
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-06-25 00:00:00	Prelude	459	The question always arises as to whether it is better to put the money into one scheme, like giving an extra week's fuel allowance payments, or to apply it to general rates across the board.  All these issues need to be considered in the context of the budget, bearing in mind that there are particular pressures because of the price of fuel, which we recognise.
#RoisinShortall	unknown-#RoisinShortall-party	unknown-#RoisinShortall-dob	unknown-#RoisinShortall-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-06-25 00:00:00	Prelude	460	The 11% increase in the price of fuel in the past year impacts on everybody.  However, it impacts disproportionately on people on low fixed incomes, who are the responsibility of the Department of Social and Family Affairs.  It is not good enough for the Minister to say she is talking to various Departments and agencies.  Something much more concrete needs to happen.  As we speak, representatives of the Institute of Public Health in Ireland are appearing before the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Social and Family Affairs making the case for an interdepartmental fuel poverty group as exists in Northern Ireland.There is a need to formalise the relationship between the Departments of Social and Family Affairs, Communications, Energy and Natural Resources and the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, as well as the other agencies involved.  Would the Minister consider taking the initiative to establish such a group?  At the moment there is no strategy to deal with fuel poverty and we know that problem is likely to increase incrementally over the coming years.  Given that the Department of Social and Family Affairs has responsibility for people on low incomes in ensuring that their income is adequate to meet their expenses — quite patently, it is not adequate with the kinds of fuel increases we have seen recently — will the Minister consider taking that initiative in setting up such an interdepartmental group?
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-06-25 00:00:00	Prelude	461	I already indicated to the Deputy that I have had discussions with the various Ministers about drawing together all the different initiatives taking place.

#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-06-25 00:00:00	Prelude	463	I do not know what "formalised" means.  If it means setting up a body with a full secretariat and involves costs just to bring people together, I would not favour that.

#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-06-25 00:00:00	Prelude	465	The correct approach is to co-ordinate the various ongoing activities between our different Departments — the payments from my Department, energy efficiency in homes through the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources and housing standards through the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government — along with Sustainable Energy Ireland and other bodies.
#RoisinShortall	unknown-#RoisinShortall-party	unknown-#RoisinShortall-dob	unknown-#RoisinShortall-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-06-25 00:00:00	Prelude	466	The problem is that there is no strategy.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-06-25 00:00:00	Prelude	467	The strategy is to ensure that people do not suffer as a result of fuel poverty.
#RoisinShortall	unknown-#RoisinShortall-party	unknown-#RoisinShortall-dob	unknown-#RoisinShortall-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-06-25 00:00:00	Prelude	468	That is not a strategy.

There are 20 Ministers of State and half of us do not know what they do or even if they know themselves.  Could one of them not take the lead in this regard?  The Minister does not seem to accept that everyone is only taking responsibility for the small bit that relates to his or her Department.  In answer to my earlier priority question, the Minister spoke about the inefficiency of heating and the need to deal with the amount of heat escaping from houses as a result of bad insulation etc., which is true.  However, because it is not in her Department, the Minister might not be aware that in the past five years only 9,000 houses were able to benefit from improvements in that regard, whereas tens of thousands of houses have such problems.Again, because it is not in her Department, the Minister might not be aware that the vast proportion of grants paid by the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government are to people building new houses or those who can afford to install green energy systems such as solar panels.  The people most affected by fuel poverty, the single-income households and the elderly, have not been able to avail of these grants.  Will the Minister co-ordinate with the other Departments — I do not mind whether it has a secretariat — to establish a strategy before the budget to ensure the issue is addressed rather than just discussed?
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-06-25 00:00:00	Prelude	470	I assure the Deputy it is being addressed rather than just being discussed.
#RoisinShortall	unknown-#RoisinShortall-party	unknown-#RoisinShortall-dob	unknown-#RoisinShortall-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-06-25 00:00:00	Prelude	471	There is no evidence of that at all.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-06-25 00:00:00	Prelude	472	I propose to take Questions Nos. 76 and 89 together.The consultation period on the pensions Green Paper was completed and the time for making submissions closed on 31 May 2008.  Overall, the response to the request for submissions on the Green Paper and attendance at the regional seminars held by the Department earlier in the year has been extremely positive.  The consultation period closed with a very successful conference in Dublin Castle on international pension reforms.  The conference featured presentations from countries such as Australia, New Zealand and the UK which have, or are planning, major reforms as well as speakers from the OECD and the World Bank who dealt with the wider international reform agenda.The extent to which the public engaged in the process has been particularly satisfying and will give us a clear picture of the issues and concerns people have regarding pensions now and into the future.  I understand that upwards of 360 submissions have been received, many in the final days of the consultation process, with approximately 300 coming from members of the public.  All the submissions received are available on the website.  The submissions are being assessed and a report summarising the issues raised and suggestions for reform will be finalised by approximately the end of June.  This report will be published as soon as possible thereafter.While I understand that there is a general acceptance in the submissions that action is required on our pensions system, it appears there is no clear consensus on the extent of the reform required, or the manner in which any reforms should be delivered.  Our objective must be to ensure that we have in place a pensions system which will deliver an adequate retirement income to all our people and which can, at the same time, withstand the cost pressures which will arise in the future as the composition of our population changes and the balance between those at work and those who are retired shifts dramatically.In deciding on reforms we must be aware that good pension provision entails significant costs for society as a whole, whether it is delivered through the State system or by personal contributions to private arrangements.  While the Government is faced with difficult decisions, we are determined to bring this process to a conclusion by the end of the year by announcing a framework to address the pensions agenda for the longer term.  The nature of the reform decided on will dictate the period over which it will be implemented.
#RoisinShortall	unknown-#RoisinShortall-party	unknown-#RoisinShortall-dob	unknown-#RoisinShortall-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-06-25 00:00:00	Prelude	473	I have a concern over the timeframe involved.  The Minister's predecessor gave a commitment that proposals would be ready to be brought to Government before the budget at the end of this year.  The Minister seems to be moving away from that commitment and I ask her to clarify the position.  Does the Minister accept we cannot continue with the very unfair tax-based reliefs system that very much favours the better off?  We need to move away from that quickly and ensure a comprehensive pension policy to cover all people irrespective of incomes.  When talking about establishing a framework for the future, would the Minister envisage proposals being brought to Government in time to be included in this year's budget?
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-06-25 00:00:00	Prelude	474	As I said in my initial reply, it is intended to have the framework by the end of this year.  Other countries, including the UK, gave a three or four-year lead-in period for the implementation of their strategy.  Obviously that needs to be considered now because of the various elements involved.  It will not be easy to come up with a framework because there are very divergent views in that regard.  There is no consensus, particularly between the employers and the employees, as to how it should be addressed.  It is accepted that there is a need to deal with the issue because of the demographic change.  We are lucky in having the luxury of not being faced with this issue today because we have six workers for every person on a pension.  In some years' time we will have only two workers for every person on a pension.  The time is right for us to establish this framework.  I cannot say what the outcome of the strategy or the implementation period will be because we have had so many submissions.  However, it is the intention to bring the framework to Government by the end of this year.
#RoisinShortall	unknown-#RoisinShortall-party	unknown-#RoisinShortall-dob	unknown-#RoisinShortall-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-06-25 00:00:00	Prelude	475	While I accept this is an extremely complex area, given that the Minister will have the report this week or next week she will have several months to consider it and make proposals.  Is she saying we cannot expect any proposals to go before Government in time for the budget this year?
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-06-25 00:00:00	Prelude	476	The strategy will have to be agreed between my Department and the Department of Finance and will then have to go before Government so all I can commit to is a framework going before the Government at the end of this year.  As to whether any changes will be brought about in the budget, it is unlikely because that would have to be prepared by November.  We are talking about a long-term view, so it does not need to be rushed for December of this year.
#RoisinShortall	unknown-#RoisinShortall-party	unknown-#RoisinShortall-dob	unknown-#RoisinShortall-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-06-25 00:00:00	Prelude	477	The Minister's predecessor gave a commitment that the proposals would be contained in the budget this year.

#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-06-25 00:00:00	Prelude	480	We are not necessarily talking about the pensions of today but the Pensions Board is advising people through its awareness campaigns to ensure they make provision for their pensions, and this is working successfully.  We have seen an increase in the last number of years in the number of people making some extra private provision.  It is not as high as we would like it to be.  Obviously we wanted to hit approximately 70%, but it is increasing.  All that work is going on at the same time.  We must take on board the range of views that has come across in the submissions and some of the international experience, which is very different.  We have the benefit of being able to see what has happened in places such as Australia and New Zealand.  Given all that and the level of interest there has been, it will take a few months to tie it all together.  All I can commit to is that it is still the intention to bring it to Government by the end of the year.
#ArthurMorganSF	unknown-#ArthurMorganSF-party	unknown-#ArthurMorganSF-dob	unknown-#ArthurMorganSF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-06-25 00:00:00	Prelude	481	I agree with the Minister on the diversity of views on this matter.  Virtually everybody I talk to has a different view.  That is evidenced by the 360 submissions the Minister has received.  The submissions are being assessed and the Minister hopes to have that report by the end of June.  Will the Minister publish that report immediately or make it available to Members of this House?  The Minister is not giving a clear indication on when she will have an assessment done on it and when she will make a recommendation.  Can she give us any estimate on the timeframe?
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-06-25 00:00:00	Prelude	482	All the submissions are on the web and are available to all members of the public.  I intend to publish the report I am expecting over the next couple of weeks so that people can see the diverse range of views out there.  Listening to other countries and reading the submissions, there are those who would like an SSIA approach, a mandatory approach or a soft mandatory approach.  We have the diverging views I have already mentioned between employers and employees.  What is the role of the State?  What are people's expectations of their pensions?  How much do people feel a private pension should be as against a State pension?  What standard of living do people expect from their pensions as distinct from their working lives?  All these issues must be considered seriously over the next couple of months and that is my intention.

The Minister spoke about the work going on, the advertising campaign and the work of the Pensions Board.  However, all that work is being stunted because of the uncertainty.  People who have not taken out pensions would consider themselves to be badly advised if they took one out immediately because they do not know what changes will be made when the Government makes decisions on this issue.  From that perspective, time is of the essence.  If the Minister does not envisage this happening in this year's budget, does she have any idea whether there would be a Supplementary Estimate or a mini budget in the following year to do this rather than waiting a year and a half from now, which will happen if we take no action in the coming budget?

People know this is a long-term view and are being advised on their personal circumstances.  It is interesting to examine the pensions coverage when one sees that of people between the ages of 20 and 24 years of age, only 27% have made provisions.  Our campaigns have particularly targeted them to ensure they take out pensions.  They are not sitting by waiting to see what the Government does at the end of the year, next year or the year after.  Any framework would have to be given time to get embedded.

#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-06-25 00:00:00	Prelude	492	The supplementary welfare allowance scheme, SWA, provides for a weekly or monthly supplement to be paid in respect of rent or mortgage interest to any person in the State whose means are insufficient to meet their needs.  The purpose of the rent supplement scheme is to provide short-term income support, in the form of a weekly or monthly payment, to eligible people living in private rented accommodation whose means are insufficient to meet their accommodation costs and who do not have accommodation available to them from any other source.  Similarly, mortgage interest supplement provides short-term income support to eligible people who are unable to meet their mortgage interest repayments in respect of a house which is their sole place of residence.  The supplement assists with the interest portion of the mortgage repayments only.In recent years, a significant number of people have come to rely on rent supplement for extended periods, including people on local authority housing waiting lists.  On 13 June 2008 over 63,000 people were in receipt of a supplement of which almost 32,000 recipients are getting a supplement for 18 months or more.  The scheme was not designed to meet long-term ongoing housing needs.One of the measures introduced to address the issue of long-term rent supplementation is the rental accommodation scheme, RAS, which gives local authorities specific responsibility for meeting the long-term housing needs of people receiving rent supplement for 18 months or more.  Almost 13,000 tenants have been transferred from the rent supplement scheme to RAS since 2005.Significant changes to the means test for rent and mortgage interest supplement were implemented in 2007.  Additional provision was made specifically to facilitate people on rent supplement returning to work and those accepted as eligible for accommodation under RAS.  These measures are positive steps in assisting tenants in achieving a long-term housing solution for their needs while also increasing the financial return from employment for those returning to work or moving to full-time employment.Overall, I am satisfied that the current rent supplement and mortgage interest schemes provide an adequate short-term safety net within the overall social welfare system to ensure that people do not suffer hardship due to loss of employment.  Nonetheless, I intend to keep the schemes under review to ensure that they meet the objective of catering for those who require assistance on a short-term basis while long-term housing needs are dealt with in a more appropriate manner.

#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-06-25 00:00:00	Prelude	494	I would be interested to hear exactly what changes Deputy Durkan anticipates.  I know that more people are under pressure for their rent and mortgages than in the past, but it is important that the 5,000 people gaining the mortgage interest supplement receive it only to supplement the interest rather than the capital because these people will be left with a good capital asset.  I am not sure whether Deputy Durkan is suggesting the supplement should go to paying off the capital as well as the interest but, as the Deputy knows, 63,000 people benefit from the rent supplement at a cost of €392 million while just over 5,000 people benefit from the mortgage interest supplement at a cost of €14.3 million this year.

In the last two or three years it has increased by 35%.  That is a fair measure of the increasing problems people are facing and the need, as Deputy Durkan said, to change the scheme to facilitate the reality of what is happening.  The rule is that where one member of a couple is in employment, no assistance can be given.  With the increase in low income couples in recent times due to low wage jobs, very many families are in a situation where one member of the couple is working but they are still not managing to make ends meet.  The Society of St. Vincent de Paul and other groups have identified the working poor as an important phenomenon.  In that regard, I ask the Minister if she would consider the rules in respect of people who are working being debarred from receiving any kind of assistance because that is unrealistic in this day and age.

There is clearly a change in circumstances.  What the Minister says relates to previous circumstances when interest rates were high.  Interest rates are now low but the repayments are causing problems due to the high mortgages which were awarded by financial institutions in the past few years.  Many of the people involved now find they must reach a settlement with their financial institution.The response we get with regard to rent supplement and mortgage support is exactly what the Minister has just told us.  Deputy Shortall and I are asking whether the Minister would consider the new circumstances in an effort to ascertain how best a means could be devised whereby hardship could be alleviated for the people concerned, whether it be through mortgage or rent supplement.

It is proposed to establish the personal advocacy service on a phased basis.  An organisational structure has been developed by the Citizens Information Board to meet the needs of the personal advocacy service, PAS.  The post of director of PAS was sanctioned by the Department of Finance in 2007 and the Citizens Information Board has completed the recruitment process.  It is expected that the appointment will be made shortly.The service will be launched when the director has taken up the position, recruited the staff and is satisfied that the structures, resources and facilities are in place to allow the service to commence operation.  In view of the recruitment process which will need to be undertaken for the additional posts, it is not possible at this time to give a definitive date on which the service will be launched and fully operational.  The service will be subject to continuing review and additional posts, if required, will be sought as necessary depending on the level of demand for the service.Additional information not given on the floor of the House.In the meantime the Citizens Information Board is continuing preparatory work in regard to the establishment of the new service and has identified accommodation to facilitate its immediate needs.  On my recent visit to the Citizen Information Board, I was briefed on the steps which it has taken to get the service under way and I am confident that once the staff are in place, the service will be available to those who require it.

The Justice and Home Affairs Council approved the negotiating mandate for an agreement on 28 February last and intensive negotiations then commenced between the EU side, which was led by the Slovenian EU Presidency assisted by the European Commission, and the relevant Australian authorities.The negotiations only concluded last month and the Justice and Home Affairs Council agreed a general approach in regard to the agreement at its meeting on 5-6 June while awaiting the lifting of parliamentary reservations by member states.  I regret that Members have not had as much time to consider this agreement as we all would have wished.  When it arose on the Order of Business this morning, the Taoiseach spoke in similar vein.  Both the Slovenian Presidency and the Australian Government are keen to conclude the agreement before the summer recess.The Australian Government, in particular, is very keen to have this agreement signed and put into operation as a matter of urgency.  Given the excellent relations which have always existed between Ireland and Australia, the Government, subject to the approval of both the Dáil and Seanad, wishes to be as helpful as possible in this regard.  The Slovenian Presidency has shown great interest in the issue.  Its six month terms ends on Monday, so approval from us is needed by tomorrow.
#TommyBroughan	unknown-#TommyBroughan-party	unknown-#TommyBroughan-dob	unknown-#TommyBroughan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-06-25 00:00:00	Prelude	529	Is this a public relations exercise on the part of the Slovenians?
#NoelAhern	unknown-#NoelAhern-party	unknown-#NoelAhern-dob	unknown-#NoelAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-06-25 00:00:00	Prelude	530	No, it is not, but both Australia and Slovenia have shown great interest in the matter.Irish-Australian relations go back for many generations and a sizeable number of Australians claim Irish ancestry.  The descendants of the many Irish men and women who settled in Australia have played a significant role in that country's economic, social and political developments.  While these links of kinship are the bedrock of the relationship between our two countries, there are also strong contemporary links which ensure that the relationship continues to prosper.While Ireland has a bilateral air services agreement with Australia, no Irish or Australian carrier has yet sought to provide direct air links between Australia and Ireland under that agreement.  However, I am hopeful that this will change at some stage in the future.  In the meantime, Irish people continue to travel to Australia to pursue opportunities there through a variety of different routes and with a number of different carriers, including European carriers.  In addition to those Irish people who have chosen to make their home in Australia and who have found work there in a wide variety of sectors, the Irish are enthusiastic participants in the working holiday visa scheme.  Since its introduction in 1985, at any given time some 13,000 young Irish people are availing of the scheme to spend 12 months working and travelling in Australia.  They return to Ireland richer for the experience.  In recent years, approximately 3,000 Australians have visited Ireland each year on the working holiday scheme.The agreement that is before the House today follows a similar agreement with the United States that was approved by both Houses last year.  The events of 11 September 2001 and terrorist attacks in other parts of the world have made us more aware than ever that terrorism is a global problem.  The events of September 11 highlighted particular vulnerabilities relating to air travel and aviation generally.  Enhanced security at airports worldwide is now part and parcel of the experience of air travel.  The US authorities and now the Australian authorities have identified the potential of passenger name records, PNR, data to play an important role in the fight against terrorism and other transnational crimes leading to the negotiation of agreements with the EU on the processing and transfer of PNR data.The agreement will provide legal certainty for air carriers and EU-based reservation systems to transfer EU PNR data to the Australian customs service in full compliance with EU data protection law.  It will be valid for a period of seven years, thus ensuring legal certainty for EU air carriers and reservation systems for a considerable period.  The agreement only applies to EU-sourced PNR data for those passengers travelling to, from or via Australia.  It contains important commitments by Australian customs service on the handling of EU PNR data in full respect of EU data protection law.  Under the agreement, Australia undertakes to ensure that the Australian customs service complies with its commitments regarding the processing of EU PNR data.The purposes for which EU PNR data may be processed by the Australian customs service is strictly limited under the agreement to preventing and combating terrorism and related crimes; serious crimes, including organised crime, that are transnational in nature; and flight from warrants or custody for these crimes.  Except during an initial two year transition period, the Australian customs service will be able to access EU PNR data only on the basis of the transmission to it of that data.  This is commonly referred to as a push system.  In the transition period the existing Australian PNR system will be used which operates on the basis of a pull system, whereby the Australian customs service accesses data directly from reservation systems.  However, this method will be used only for this strictly limited period.The protection of personal data under the agreement and the rights of individuals seeking access to and correction of their personal data applies, irrespective of the nationality or place of residence of the data subject.  The agreement ensures that commitments both in the main body of the agreement and its annex are binding upon Australia by explicitly referring to those assurances, compliance with which is necessary to ensure an adequate level of protection of EU PNR data.  This precludes national data protection authorities from taking a different view on the level of data protection, thus ensuring a harmonised approach at EU level and providing legal certainty.The agreement provides for a joint periodic review of its implementation by the European Union and Australia and may be terminated by either party at any time.  In the event that a European Union PNR system is implemented, the agreement shall be reviewed.  It is noteworthy that the agreement provides that the EU member state data protection authorities may suspend the flow of EU PNR data to the Australian customs service in particular circumstances where there is a substantial likelihood that the standards of protection set out in the agreement are being infringed.The annex to the agreement forms part of the agreement and, like the agreement, is legally binding.  The annex contains several key elements, including the provision that the Australian customs service will only disclose EU-sourced PNR data on a case by case basis and in response to a written request from one of the five Australian authorities listed in the schedule to the agreement.  Disclosure, whether to these Australian authorities or to specified authorities of third countries, is subject to the strict purpose limitation of the agreement.  The annex also provides that bulk data may be disclosed to the five Australian authorities listed in the schedule to the agreement, provided these are first rendered anonymous so that they contain no personal data.  The types of data that can be collected, which comprise 19 different data elements, are set out.  Any personal data included within EU PNR data which may indicate racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious beliefs, trade union membership and data concerning health or other sensitive data, shall be filtered out and deleted by Australian customs.  The Australian customs service will ensure that its EU PNR transfer requirements are judicious and proportionate so as not to be an excessive burden on air carriers and reservation systems.The agreement provides for a data retention period of three and a half years for active data, followed by a further two year period during which the data will be archived and may only be accessed on a case by case basis for investigative purposes.  Active data would be PNR data which could be used for identifying high-risk passengers and establishing travel patterns.  Archived data will no longer be used unless needed to reply to an identifiable case, threat or risk.  Data relating to ongoing prosecutions or investigations may be retained until these are concluded.  The agreement provides for a separate data retention period of five and a half years for data rendered anonymous, enabling Australian customs to use the data for the purposes of establishing statistics, profile building, and so forth.  The annex confirms that under Australian law administrative, civil and criminal enforcement measures are available to all data subjects irrespective of nationality or place of residence, for violations of Australian privacy laws and rules and for unauthorised disclosure of information.I am very conscious that there is a balance to be struck between public security considerations and privacy rights of the individual citizens in this type of agreement.  The European Commission, in line with the mandate it received from the member states, sought to strike the balance in the negotiations with the Australian authorities.  I believe it succeeded in achieving that objective and that the agreement contains significant checks and balances.As I said earlier in reference to Deputy Broughan's comments, it is regretted that the recent conclusion of the negotiations on the agreement combined with the scheduling of the European institutions and the Houses of the Oireachtas has not afforded Members more time to consider this issue.  As I said, that was raised this morning and it has been explained that Australia is keen to get it through.  It was one of the items the Slovenian Presidency was anxious to try to push through as well.  With those points in mind, we are seeking the co-operation of Members.  I commend the motion to the House.

#BernardJDurkan	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-party	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-dob	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-06-25 00:00:00	Prelude	533	That is a long time if one had a heavy weight on one's toe.I am glad to have the opportunity to comment on the motion.  Like Deputy Broughan, I reiterate the concerns in respect of the way this has been presented to the Opposition.  My colleague, Deputy Fergus O'Dowd, who is the spokesman on this area, found it impossible to rearrange his schedule to be here today. He received the same notice referred to by Deputy Broughan.It is extremely dangerous to pursue that line of activity in matters of this nature because they could become sensitive or fundamental issues at some later stage.  Given the nature of this proposal, a situation could arise in the future where, under data protection or something else, somebody may raise an issue.  Alternatively, it may fail to do the job it was supposed to do and somebody may get through the net despite the fact that this measure is in place.This type of proposal needs much more consideration by Parliament.  I reiterate that it has come to pass in recent times that Parliament means less and less.  This is grand for Government.  Incidentally, some Departments think the committee system is an extension of Government but it is not.  We should recognise once and for all that if Parliament is going to work properly and if we are to have public confidence in the institutions of the State, we must be absolutely clear about the way we treat Parliament, and that means the way Government treats Parliament.  I reiterate the reservations made about the Order of Business this morning and more recently by Deputy Broughan.In respect of the motion itself, I can understand what it proposes to do, notwithstanding the rushed way it is to be put in place.  Much depends on the integrity of this system and whether it is effective at all.  Much also depends on the degree of information that is retained — I know the Minister of State referred to this in his speech — and how that information is used.  I happen to be one of the people who knows from my experience in this House that even though specific restrictions can be laid down as to how something might or might not be disclosed, notwithstanding the existence of the Data Protection Commissioner, it does not necessarily always reflect best practice in the way such information is treated.  I would like an assurance from the Minister of State in respect of this country and the EU which also has an interest.  We should remember that we are still members of the EU, notwithstanding the recent "No" vote, and, as a result, we have responsibilities to our EU colleagues.  Any breach that may take place may find itself in difficulty regarding overall EU law, rules, regulations and directives.I am very conscious of the security risk and the need for the EU and Ireland as a member of the EU to take protective measures to combat terrorism, money laundering or traffic associated with any of these activities.  It is essential from all our points of view that this be done, but it is also essential that we know the information collected and retained for the period set out in the proposal is retained for that purpose only.  We must remember that this information is of a sensitive nature and can be extremely beneficial to people who are money launderers, potential or working criminals, for want of a better description, or people who are involved or indulging in illegal or illicit activity.Unfortunately, modern information technology has made it possible for people to infiltrate the system and gain information they are not supposed to get their hands on.  That could have very serious consequences in a matter of this nature.  I ask the Minister of State to reassure himself and the House that adequate protection exists and that our Data Protection Commissioner is satisfied with everything contained in the proposal.We should remember that only a short time ago the Data Protection Commissioner mused aloud that information of a personal nature might not be made available to Members of the House despite the fact that they are elected by the public to represent them and their views.  Fortunately, it has not been pursued but if it is pursued, I reiterate that the running of the House and the information available to Members in pursuit of their duties as public representatives shall not be interfered with under any circumstances.  Any attempt to intervene in that area undermines the entire democratic system, notwithstanding all recent events.I have already referred to the EU.  The Justice and Home Affairs Council approved the negotiating mandate for the agreement on 28 February last.  Again, it is a bit rushed.  Given our experience in the Oireachtas Committee on European Affairs and other places, things do not happen that quickly here.  We do not adopt these proposals as quickly as we should in most circumstances.  Let us presume there is an urgent reason for this proposal.  I note that our Slovenian colleagues are anxious to have this provision in place before they leave the Presidency.The information retained is not supposed to be of a personal nature.  Perhaps we need to spell out more precisely what kind of information can be retained and how it is likely to be used.  We know it can be retained for five years.  To whom will it be released?  Will it be released to the Australian and Irish authorities?  Will it be released simultaneously or another way?  Will it be released to any other authority or institution?  Will it be released to anybody else who may not be an authority in the true sense of the word?This agreement is supposed to prevent and combat terrorism and serious crimes, including organised crime, that are transnational in nature.  We have raised that issue in the House until we are blue in the face but we have not received much response, despite the fact that there is a massive amount of international or transnational crime which seems to be taking place outside but not beyond our reach.  However, it seems to be taking place outside our reach in so far as legislation is concerned.The raft of legislation that exists, particularly in the justice area, in respect of this matter can only be marvelled at because it has been threatened for a long time and has not been brought before the House to the greatest extent possible.  The fact that this proposal is coming before us now suggests that there is a recognition of a need that has not been filled or addressed in a particular way and this is the attempt to do it.  It is an emergency fire brigade action to get ahead of the posse before it goes over the cliff.It also refers to flight from warrants or custody for various crimes.  We are well aware of that issue.  From the knowledge I possess and have gleaned from parliamentary questions, there is large-scale international freedom of movement for people who have illicit intentions.  It appears their businesses are thriving, be they money laundering or extortion.  If this provision addresses that in full, I am in favour of it provided it does not reflect heavily on some poor unfortunate who travels to Australia or from Australia to Ireland to visit their sick relative, for example.  Incidentally, some years ago I dealt with the case of a constituent who happened to have the same name and date of birth as a well-known and successful criminal who was alive and well and working at his underworld activities at the time.  This reflected badly on my unfortunate constituent, who happened to have the same data.  I hope that with regard to this agreement we will not have a similar case, as it would bring the whole scheme into disrepute.The Minister of State referred to a pull and push system.  What he said put in my mind the image of a fellow trying to push a kangaroo up a ladder.  It is difficult to envisage how it will work, although I can envisage circumstances in which the system could be used.  The pull system will allow the Australian customs service to access data directly from the reservation systems, although only for a limited period.  I presume the reverse will apply also, or will it just be one-way traffic?  Could we have further clarification on this?The Minister of State referred to the protection of personal data under the agreement and the rights of individuals to seek access to and correction of their personal data, irrespective of their nationality or the place of residence of the subject.  The Data Protection Commissioner here comes into play in this regard.  Incidentally, he will have to be more vigilant when dealing with issues under this heading than with issues that might arise with regard to whether Members of the Oireachtas have access to information on behalf of their constituents by way of parliamentary question, freedom of information or any other method.  I make no apologies for reiterating this.  When Members are elected to public office, they have a mission on behalf of their constituents.  Anything that interferes with that, in this particular provision or anywhere else, is out of order.  The sooner we recognise that in this House, the better.  If we do not, we will shortly be relegated to the status of a regional assembly, which we are not.The Minister of State said that the Australian customs service would only disclose the EU-sourced PNR data on a case by case basis, in response to a written request from one of the five Australian authorities listed in the Schedule of the agreement.  Disclosure, whether to these Australian authorities or to specified authorities of third countries, is subject to the strict purpose limitation of the agreement.  How can this be guaranteed?On the various types of data that may be gathered, the agreement refers to racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious beliefs and trade union membership.  Data concerning health or other sensitive data shall be filtered out and deleted by the Australian customs.  It is essential that both parties to the agreement honour this element in full in order to protect the integrity of the proposal.  As we know from past performance in this House and elsewhere, the integrity of a particular proposal is determined by the degree to which its conditions are respected and implemented and by the degree to which those conditions respect the individual entitlements and rights of the citizenry of the respective countries that are party to the agreement.I deplore the short advance warning provided to the Opposition of the tabling of this issue.  I know the Minister did not intend this to happen, but somebody is responsible for it.  Somebody cynically imposed this on the Order Paper at the last minute.

Somebody realised this would discommode the Opposition which would have already made its plans for this part of the week.  As the Minister of State knows well, the Opposition must plan its work for the week a week ahead and do its job on that basis.  It is different for the Government.  When one is in government and bringing a Bill into the House — this information may assist those who could not understand the recent Lisbon treaty — all a Minister has to do is reach behind him for the aide-mémoire that comes from the dutiful civil servant who is on hand at all times to illuminate, update, reassure and encourage Ministers.  That facility is not available to unfortunate Members of the Opposition.  I am not crying for its introduction.  We are well able to look after ourselves and our own interests, but this means we must work harder, read more and be forever vigilant.
#TommyBroughan	unknown-#TommyBroughan-party	unknown-#TommyBroughan-dob	unknown-#TommyBroughan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-06-25 00:00:00	Prelude	536	I propose to share time with Deputy Aengus Ó Snodaigh.  In the increasingly global security conscious environment we are in currently and given the particularly vulnerable nature of air travel, measures to enhance the safety and security of air travel for airline passengers are welcome.However, I agree with my colleagues that the manner of presentation of this proposal is unacceptable, undemocratic and completely disgraceful.  Thanks to our diligent librarian, I got a copy of the agreement at approximately 2.30 p.m.  It is a 40-page document and is quite an intricate piece of legislation which refers to Australian legislation.  I and Deputy Durkan, therefore, had approximately one hour to prepare for this debate.  This is shameful treatment of the Opposition.  I admit the Minister of State informed me last night at approximately 6.30 p.m. that the matter was arising today.  However, the late announcement of the agenda seems a churlish way to treat the Opposition.What is even more astonishing is that last year when the original EU-US agreement on PNR was also being rushed through the House, with no proper time allocated for its thorough invigilation, our colleagues, including Deputy Shortall from the Labour Party, protested at the short notice given for that debate.  The Minister at the time, Deputy Noel Dempsey, apologised and said he regretted that people did not have enough time to examine the agreement, but that it would not happen again.  However, here we are a few months later and it has happened again.The main document in question is dated Brussels, 10 June.  Therefore, it has been available for the past couple of weeks and there was no need for this breakneck last minute performance by the Minister.  The briefing note we got appears to say that the Slovenians, who currently hold the EU Presidency, are responsible for getting us to rush this forward before 30 June.  I hope no simple public relations mechanism was the reason for us having to go ahead with this rushed debate.It is amazing, as my colleague mentioned, that given the concerns we had last week about EU legislation and making this House responsible for invigilating it and given what the people decided in the referendum, that the Government comes forward in a cavalier way and again treats the people's representatives on this side of the House with disdain on this issue and refuses to allow us proper study and debate on it.The agreement states in Article 5 that the purpose of the EU-Australian agreement is to prevent and combat terrorism and related crimes, transnational organised crime and flight from warrants or custody with regard to these crimes.  The increased transnational and global nature of organised crime and terrorism has, understandably, given rise to the need for much greater co-operation.  I notice, for example, that in recent months the Australian Government has been diligently seeking the return of an alleged drug lord, Mr. Tony Mokbel who fled to Greece and was fighting extradition back to Australia.  Close co-operation between Greece and Australia has resulted in this alleged criminal being returned to Australia.  Terrorist crimes, particularly since 11 September 2001 and attempted terrorist attacks on European airports, also highlight the need for legislation in this area.  A key concern of mine and of all Members of this House is the provision of the highest level of protection for all of our citizens when travelling by air.  We must be conscious of the sensitive issues of personal privacy and individual freedom that are involved when developing a system such as the passenger name records system.  During the few minutes I had to read the document I noted the reference to the Australian Acts, the Privacy Act 1988 and the Freedom of Information Act 1982, in section 17 of the annexe.  How does that complement our rights under our freedom of information and personal rights legislation?  There is a reference in section 5 of the annexe to transmission of information to third countries.  How can we be referring, given this is an agreement with Australia, to third countries receiving information on European and Irish citizens?Most citizens will support measures that increase their safety and security when travelling by air but it is critical the Minister provides a clear and detailed account of the operation of this system and that citizens are reassured.  What system is in place at present with the Australian authorities for passenger name records?The impetus for this agreement came from Australia.  The impetus for the previous agreement came from the US when the US was threatening to cut air connections between the two continents.  Where are we at in respect of European passenger name records security?  Will there be a European directive on passenger name records across the EU?In the previous debate a colleague mentioned that in a briefing session on the operation of passenger name records systems airline operators had been asked how many times an airplane had been diverted or turned back because a passenger had been flagged through the passenger name records system.  The Minister, Deputy Dempsey, stated this had occurred approximately ten times at that stage, and in each case there was no reason to bring the aircraft back.Article 7 refers to the correction of records.  How could that happen for a European or Irish citizen?  We have long, deep and profound family associations with Australia.  They follow our cultural, economic and political developments as we follow theirs.  How can the record be corrected by Australian authorities?  The document refers to the five authorities of the Australian Crime Commission, the Australian Federal Police, the Australian Security and Intelligence Organisation, the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecution and the Department of Immigration and Citizenship.  There seems to be much overlap.  Will the records of EU citizens be dispersed through a variety of Australian bodies?  Why is there a two-year transition period when the Australian customs service will be able to use the so-called pull system, as referred to by Deputy Durkan and the Minister, to access data from reservation systems?  Why will it take two years to introduce the new system?  Does the Minister of State have any updated information on the use of passenger name records information over the past year and whether it has been successfully used in apprehending any terror or criminal suspects?The briefing document received last night mentions that the protection for personal data under the agreement applies yet we were given no indication in the briefing document as to how this will operate.  Given recent breaches in data security, particularly the spectacular breaches in the UK when the social security records of half the British population were lost, it is critical we have more information on that.  We are also told in the briefing document that 19 different data elements can be collected.  Some seem quite obscure.  What does the reference to split or divided information in section 9 of the annexe refer to?

What is the basis for retaining personal data for up to five and a half years?  The agreement also mentions a joint periodic review, provided for under article 9, and amendments to the agreement under article 11.  What is the timeframe for this review?  Reference is made to four years in the main document.It is clear that the Minister should have insisted on a clear and strong role for the Oireachtas in monitoring and invigilating the operation of this and the previous US-EU passenger name records agreement.  Last year during the debate on the EU-US agreement, my colleague Deputy Róisín Shortall highlighted a very important report that was prepared by a committee in the House of Lords in the UK on passenger name records agreements.  This Westminster report flagged a number of concerns including the need for airlines to inform passengers about what happens to their personal information, the need to maintain public confidence by maintaining individual liberty in the context of the introduction of any new counter-terrorism measures and the inclusion of a full list of data that is permitted to be collected so there should be no vague and open ended statements that will allow for further measures to be undertaken that were not specifically outlined in the original agreement.  Does the Minister of State agree the theme of the report is a useful template for this type of agreement with another country?  Will all passengers be informed of what is happening to their personal data under this agreement?  I referred to the Australian legislation.  How come Irish, EU or Slovenian legislation is not referred to?Deputy Shortall also highlighted the views of the European Data Protection Supervisor on 27 June 2007 when the supervisor warned that European data protection rights were at risk under the EU-US agreement.  I will support the agreement on behalf of the Labour Party and the objectives of enhancing air travel security and co-operation between the EU and our friends and colleagues in Australia in the area of crime and justice, particularly given the deep and historic ties between our two nations.I wish to register the strongest protest possible at the manner in which the business was brought before the House.  It is ridiculous and unacceptable.  Some day the Opposition will walk out.  The Government can have the House to itself if it is not prepared to do business in a democratic manner.

Níl ach trí noiméad agam, agus tá sé deacair morán a rá maidir leis an mbealach a chuireadh é seo os ár gcomhair.  Tá sé scannallach nár tugadh eolas dúinn mar gheall ar seo go dtí oíche aréir.  Cad is fiú domsa nó éinne eile freastal ar chruinnithe gach seachtain chun iarrachta a déanamh ghnó an Teach a eagrú nuair a chuirtear rudaí os ár gcomhair sa Teach cosúil leis na trí píosaí páipéar a fuaireamar ón Rialtas mar gheall ar seo chun plé a dhéanamh an lá dár gcion?  Ní leor sin, agus is scannall é go bhfuil orainn díospóireacht a bheith againn ar rud nach raibh feicthe againn go dtí aréir, in anneoin go raibh fhois ag an Rialtas go raibh sé le teacht ó mí Feabhra nuair a chríochniagh an idir-phlé ar seo.  Bhí fhois acu ó deireadh mí Bealtaine go raibh sé chun teacht níos tapúla, agus bhí fhois ag an Rialtas coicís ó shin go mbeadh sé os comhair an Teach.  Fós, níor dhúirt an Rialtas le héinne ar an dtaobh seo den Teach go raibh sé ar an mbealach chun seans a thabhairt dúinn ár jab a dhéanamh agus cinnte a dhéanamh nach rachaidh an reachtaíocht seo tríd an Teach gan cíoradh cheart a dhéanamh air.It is a disgrace that we have so little time to analyse this.  It is hugely important and, once we have passed it, there is no going back unless the Minister can persuade the other 26 countries to stop it at this stage or include a review clause so we can return to this and examine the protections for the data we are transferring to another jurisdiction.  Under the existing passenger name records regime between the EU and the US, those in the EU can have access to the material provided.  If one asks a United States airline to provide one with the data it will supply to the regime in the United States, it will not supply it for security reasons.  This is the type of regime in existence with regard to data protection and access to our records.We must be careful when agreeing to pass data to other countries which do not have the same standards of data protection as us.  Data can be incorrect and a protection does exist whereby one can correct it, but if one does not know it is wrong there is no point in having this.  One will end up like Mr. McBrearty, who was refused entry into the United States because the information in this country was wrong.  How are we to guarantee the information in the United States, even at this stage, has been corrected in his case?  Many other Irish and European citizens will find out their information is stored wrongly only when they end up being sent back from an airport.This is rushed legislation and it is not accountable.  We cannot stand over the fact that we have not had the opportunity to scrutinise it.  At the very least it should be referred to committee.  The committees of this House have a little expertise because they dealt with the previous PNR data agreements.  Tá mé i gcoinne é seo a rith ag an am seo toisc nach bhfuil go leor ama againn don cheist seo ná go leor eolais againn faoi ach oiread.

It was due to a combination of factors outside our direct control.  Negotiations concluded in May and the justice and home affairs Ministers agreed a general approach at their meeting on 5 and 6 June, pending the lifting of parliamentary reserves by member states.  The final text became available on 10 June.  I am not sure what happened day by day since 10 June but it went to Cabinet for decision yesterday.The Slovenian Presidency and the Australians are keen to have it up and running as soon as possible.  This is the first occasion on which Slovenia has held the Presidency of the EU and it listed this matter as one of the transport items it wanted to achieve during the Presidency.  We are trying to help it as a small nation holding the Presidency for the first time.Deputy Durkan mentioned Parliament having less and less importance and respect.  Many other countries are not running into the same problem because this will not be approved by the parliaments in those other countries.  In a way our system, due to the Constitution, provides us with a role to be involved.  One might thank God it is due to the Constitution and not me or the Government.  This was not deliberate and to my knowledge nobody blackguarded the Deputies, held back or delayed anything.  From 10 June to yesterday is probably reasonably fast in the context of how long these matters can take.In recent years, attacks have brought home to people the dangers of terrorism.  It appears that even if the US was first in line, followed by Australia, the danger of terrorism will mean that over the coming years various countries or blocs of countries will introduce such a form of advance notice of people travelling.  Accepting the dangers and matters which can go wrong, it will be part and parcel of air travel.Deputy Broughan asked about an EU scheme.  The EU draft framework decision on PNR, which is under negotiation, provides for the sharing of PNR data with law enforcement authorities in the EU.  When the EU PNR system is in place, the transfer of PNR data will be reciprocal.This is a complex and sensitive subject.  We all recognise the need to strike a balance between public security considerations and the need to protect the rights of all our respective citizens.  The agreement tries to achieve this objective.  It provides important protections for EU PNR data and avenues of redress for persons seeking information on or correction to PNR data and this is a welcome development.The agreement will be subject to periodic review by both parties and can be terminated by either side.  If data protection authorities in the member states have substantial concerns that the standards of protection set out in the agreement are being infringed, they many suspend the flow of EU PNR data to Australia.

The agreement has strict limitations on the purposes for which the data can be used which are combatting crime, terrorism, including organised crime, and flights from warrants or custody for these particular types of crimes.Deputy Durkan also asked with what other authorities the data might be shared.  It can only be shared with the five Australian authorities which are listed in the schedule.  It may be shared with third country governments but only where the functions of these authorities relate to the purposes of the agreement, which is preventing or combatting crime.  Australian customs must keep a log of all such disclosures and it can be reviewed as part of a joint review by the EU and Australia.All Deputies raised data protection issues.  Australia would be considered a country with a sophisticated data protection system.  Customs will treat EU PNR data as confidential in accordance with Australian law.  At its discretion it will share PNR data with those authorities listed in the schedule with law enforcement, public security or counter-terrorism functions only for the same purpose for which it may use the data itself.It is important to note that although these other Australian authorities will have the right to obtain PNR information under the agreement, they will not have access to the customs database.  Data will be shared only in response to specific written requests on a case by case basis to the authorities listed in the schedule and the Australian customs service will release EU sourced PNR data information only after assessing the relevance of each request.  Such access will be strictly and carefully limited in proportion to the nature of the individual case.  Data disclosed to the authorities in question will be "anonymised" in such a way that a data subject is no longer identifiable.  Such data will be processed only for the purposes of establishing in depth statistics, trend analysis and profile building relating to preventing and combatting the offences set out in article 5.Australian data protection legislation, namely the Privacy Act, governs the collection, use, storage, disclosure and alteration of, and security access to, personal information.  PNR data furnished must be disclosed to the individual in accordance with the Act and the Freedom of Information Act.  Australia will provide a system whereby individuals, regardless of nationality or country of residence, can have access to and correct their own personal information.  Complaints can be made to customs and then to the Australian data protection commissioner and the Commonwealth Ombudsman.  Administrative, civil and criminal enforcement measures are available under Australian law for violation of Australian privacy rule and unauthorised disclosure of Australian records.I thank the Deputies for their contributions.  I apologise again for the way the motion has been brought forward but we are trying to facilitate the wishes of the Australians and the Slovenian Presidency.  I thank Members for their support and understanding of the situation.

As indicated on Committee Stage, I have been advised by the Parliamentary Counsel's office that the Government cannot accept the amendment as the language used in the Bill and the language of the treaty in the Schedule to the Bill is English and there is no need to insert the words "in the English language" in the legislation.

Perhaps he could explain what we are debating.  He said I was talking about nuclear bombs and explosions on Committee Stage.  As I understand it, the Bill is about nuclear devices which are nuclear bombs.  He said other types of nuclear devices might be under consideration in this legislation.  Perhaps he could outline the nuclear devices that may be covered by the Bill, which are not nuclear bombs or nuclear explosions.  I have the notes of the committee meeting.  Are we debating a ban on nuclear testing in the context of explosions and nuclear bombs?  The Bill is clearly entitled the Nuclear Test Ban Bill, which I interpret, having read the memorandum that arrived late, to be nuclear explosions.  The Minister of State said on Committee Stage the Bill covered nuclear devices other than nuclear bombs.  Perhaps he will clarify what he meant.  I signalled on Committee Stage that I would revisit the issue on Report Stage.  What are we debating?

On several occasions, I requested an explanatory memorandum to accompany the Bill, which was never provided.  I was given a one-page sheet on the day the Bill was debated on Committee Stage.
#JohnnyBrady	unknown-#JohnnyBrady-party	unknown-#JohnnyBrady-dob	unknown-#JohnnyBrady-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-06-25 00:00:00	Prelude	561	The House can only discuss the amendments that have been tabled on Fourth Stage.

The facilitation of the Bill has been very shoddy.  An explanatory memorandum was not provided when the Bill was published.  I requested such a memorandum and the Taoiseach said there would be a memorandum before the Bill reached Committee Stage.  It was not provided.  We received a one-page note with an outline of the legislation.  A memorandum appeared following Committee Stage.  However, due to the absence of an explanatory memorandum, I asked on Committee Stage what it was we were discussing other than a nuclear bomb or explosion.  The Minister of State is on record as stating that we were discussing nuclear devices other than nuclear bombs and explosions.  Will he clarify what the other nuclear devices are?  The amendments are drafted in the context of our discussion of nuclear explosions and bombs.  If other mechanisms are incorporated in the Bill, they should be considered in light of the amendments.
#MichaelKitt	unknown-#MichaelKitt-party	unknown-#MichaelKitt-dob	unknown-#MichaelKitt-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-06-25 00:00:00	Prelude	563	I will try to help the Deputy as best I can.  I understood bombs and devices to be the same in the context of our discussion.  We can return to Committee Stage if the Deputy wishes to restart.

Is he conceding that his current position is different from his position on Committee Stage, namely, that the Bill relates to nuclear explosions and bombs?

#CiaranLynch	unknown-#CiaranLynch-party	unknown-#CiaranLynch-dob	unknown-#CiaranLynch-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-06-25 00:00:00	Prelude	569	With respect, we are discussing this matter due to the Department's failure to provide explanatory documentation.  On Committee Stage, the Minister of State referred to another aspect of the Bill.  I gave him grace because it was his first outing in his current position.  However, I told him that, as he was unable to answer my question appropriately, I would raise it again on Report Stage.  It is on the select committee's record.Given that the amendments are based on my interpretation of the Bill, an unexplained and different interpretation of "devices" means that they cannot be discussed.  What are the other devices?
#MichaelKitt	unknown-#MichaelKitt-party	unknown-#MichaelKitt-dob	unknown-#MichaelKitt-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-06-25 00:00:00	Prelude	570	We are going over old ground.
#JohnnyBrady	unknown-#JohnnyBrady-party	unknown-#JohnnyBrady-dob	unknown-#JohnnyBrady-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-06-25 00:00:00	Prelude	571	I know.
#MichaelKitt	unknown-#MichaelKitt-party	unknown-#MichaelKitt-dob	unknown-#MichaelKitt-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-06-25 00:00:00	Prelude	572	We are discussing a nuclear test ban irrespective of whether one is discussing a bomb or a device.
#CiaranLynch	unknown-#CiaranLynch-party	unknown-#CiaranLynch-dob	unknown-#CiaranLynch-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-06-25 00:00:00	Prelude	573	We are discussing nuclear explosions and bombs.  I welcome the Minister of State's late clarification because all of us on Committee Stage were of an understanding not shared by him.The proposition of the amendments is simple.  The Labour Party seeks to amend the Bill in two respects.  The Bill suggests that a year in jail or a fine of €5,000 is a sufficient sentence or penalty for involvement in the setting off of a nuclear explosion.  There has been much discussion of a recession, but even a reduction of fines to €1,000 might be an overstep.  The idea that Ireland is proposing to deal with a serious offence by imposing a sentence of one year in jail or a €5,000 fine is a misreading of the situation.  The Minister of State was wrong to say on Committee Stage that there is no provision to accommodate the amendment, as other legislation on serious crime, such as rape, disorder, murder, manslaughter and attempted murder, would accommodate it.  There are no minor provisions made therein, for example, bringing the matter before the District Court.  Instead, a judge uses his or her discretion in making a determination and handing down a sentence.  It ill behoves us to limit sentences in this respect.The sentence addressed by the second amendment — "a fine not exceeding €5,000 or imprisonment for a term not exceeding 6 months" — is paltry.  While a lesser jail term such as this would be merited in the event of someone who may be a second or third party to the offence, the Labour Party is of the opinion that the penalties and tariffs are at levels far below those merited.  We suggest an increase in the jail period to two years and an increase in the fine to €500,000.I ask that the Minister of State accept the amendments.  While I acknowledge that he did not instigate the Bill, we now have an opportunity to identify an obvious anomaly via acceptance of the first amendment and to correct it via acceptance of the second amendment.
#PadraicMcCormack	unknown-#PadraicMcCormack-party	unknown-#PadraicMcCormack-dob	unknown-#PadraicMcCormack-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-06-25 00:00:00	Prelude	574	Regarding the subject matter of amendment No. 4, will the Minister of State explain why the fine is only €5,000 and the jail sentence is only six months?  These are low.  The Labour Party amendment would increase the former substantially.  Were we to know the reasoning behind the €5,000 figure, we might be clearer on what it is the Government is trying to achieve.
#MichaelKitt	unknown-#MichaelKitt-party	unknown-#MichaelKitt-dob	unknown-#MichaelKitt-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-06-25 00:00:00	Prelude	575	We have been advised by the Parliamentary Counsel's office that the Government cannot accept these amendments because the fines are not commensurate with the prison terms.  There needs to be greater proportionality and harmony between the two aspects.I am considering tabling amendments on Committee Stage in the Seanad to address the circumstances envisaged by the Deputies.  I will ask the Parliamentary Counsel for advice on the best approach.
#PadraicMcCormack	unknown-#PadraicMcCormack-party	unknown-#PadraicMcCormack-dob	unknown-#PadraicMcCormack-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-06-25 00:00:00	Prelude	576	Would it not be better to table those amendments on this Stage rather than in the Seanad?
#MichaelKitt	unknown-#MichaelKitt-party	unknown-#MichaelKitt-dob	unknown-#MichaelKitt-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-06-25 00:00:00	Prelude	577	Deputy McCormack has raised a good point.  I will examine the matters referred to by Deputy Ciarán Lynch, namely, a fine not exceeding €5,000 and a prison sentence not exceeding six months.  In section 2(4)(b), the legislation provides for a maximum prison sentence of life.  While the fines and prison sentences in the proposed amendments are not commensurate, I would like to re-examine the issue on Committee Stage in the Seanad.
#CiaranLynch	unknown-#CiaranLynch-party	unknown-#CiaranLynch-dob	unknown-#CiaranLynch-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-06-25 00:00:00	Prelude	578	I will be succinct.  The Minister of State's response had positive aspects and he identified problems in the legislation.  While I welcome and take on board his comments concerning Seanad amendments, will he provide further information on them this afternoon?Amendments Nos. 3 and 4, while similar, are separate.  The former's removal of a part of the Bill would rectify the issue and allow a judge discretion to deal with a scenario.  I will propose a fair compromise.  Were the Minister of State to accept amendment No. 3, the Labour Party would be prepared to withdraw amendment No. 4 and allow the relevant issue to be examined in the Seanad.  I take on board the point that there must be a correlation between the size of the fine and the period of imprisonment.  This matter could be resolved in the Seanad.
#PadraicMcCormack	unknown-#PadraicMcCormack-party	unknown-#PadraicMcCormack-dob	unknown-#PadraicMcCormack-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-06-25 00:00:00	Prelude	579	I support the Deputy's view and will ask my Seanad colleagues to keep an eye on this.
#MichaelKitt	unknown-#MichaelKitt-party	unknown-#MichaelKitt-dob	unknown-#MichaelKitt-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-06-25 00:00:00	Prelude	580	I am sure the Deputies would accept that liability to a fine not exceeding €500,000 or imprisonment for a term of two years are not commensurate.  Similarly, Deputy Ciarán Lynch would make the point, with which I would agree, that liability to a fine of €5,000 fine or imprisonment for a term of six or 12 months are not commensurate.  I will address the circumstances that were raised by Members on both sides of the House and bring forward an amendment on Committee Stage in the Seanad rather than put forward a very high or very low figure in this respect.  That is my proposal.
#PadraicMcCormack	unknown-#PadraicMcCormack-party	unknown-#PadraicMcCormack-dob	unknown-#PadraicMcCormack-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-06-25 00:00:00	Prelude	581	Will the Minister of State bring forward an amendment to the Bill in the Seanad?  Is that what he has conceded?
#MichaelKitt	unknown-#MichaelKitt-party	unknown-#MichaelKitt-dob	unknown-#MichaelKitt-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-06-25 00:00:00	Prelude	582	Yes, I will bring forward an amendment to the Bill in the Seanad.
#CiaranLynch	unknown-#CiaranLynch-party	unknown-#CiaranLynch-dob	unknown-#CiaranLynch-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-06-25 00:00:00	Prelude	583	I might clarify the position, given it appears from the Minister of State's response that we seem to be in agreement and working towards resolving this matter.  Amendments Nos. 3 and 4 are being considered together.  I accept the Minister of State's point that the level of a fine and jail sentence in the subsection must be commensurate or comparative.  If he is saying that this issue will be dealt with during the debate on the Bill in the Seanad, I will accept that.The substantial issue in the Bill is covered in amendment No. 3.  I propose that we proceed on the basis that the Minister of State accepts amendment No. 3 and we will withdraw amendment No. 4 pending further examination of the matter during the debate on the Bill in the Seanad.  If that proposal is acceptable, we will have accomplished a good day's work in resolving these outstanding matters.
#MichaelKitt	unknown-#MichaelKitt-party	unknown-#MichaelKitt-dob	unknown-#MichaelKitt-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-06-25 00:00:00	Prelude	584	I am repeating myself, but in amendment No. 3 the level of the fine and the prison sentence proposed are not proportionate.
#CiaranLynch	unknown-#CiaranLynch-party	unknown-#CiaranLynch-dob	unknown-#CiaranLynch-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-06-25 00:00:00	Prelude	585	That relates to amendment No. 4.
#MichaelKitt	unknown-#MichaelKitt-party	unknown-#MichaelKitt-dob	unknown-#MichaelKitt-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-06-25 00:00:00	Prelude	586	No.
#CiaranLynch	unknown-#CiaranLynch-party	unknown-#CiaranLynch-dob	unknown-#CiaranLynch-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-06-25 00:00:00	Prelude	587	Amendment No. 3 relates to the first part of the Bill, which deals with the substantive issue of a nuclear explosion, and it proposes a jail sentence of one year or a fine of €5,000.  Amendment No. 4 relates to the associated relationship to the crime, a second or third party relationship to the event.  What is proposed in amendment No. 4 can be further examined in the debate on the Bill in the Seanad.  However, amendment No. 3 addresses the case of a person directly connected with the setting off of a nuclear explosion in the State being liable, as proposed in the section, to a fine of €5,000 or one year's imprisonment.  The Labour Party amendment proposes the deletion of certain lines of the section, which would allow a judge presiding over such a case to determine the sentence to be handed down and that we would not engage in determining the sentences in lesser crimes dealt with by District Courts or anything else.  That is the procedure in the case of any serious offence, whether it be manslaughter, murder, riotous behaviour, rape or sexual assault.  There is no provision in the Bill for a minor offence.  It is incorrect to proceed with the provision of a minor penalty for such a serious offence as the setting of a nuclear explosion in the State.
#KathleenLynch	unknown-#KathleenLynch-party	unknown-#KathleenLynch-dob	unknown-#KathleenLynch-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-06-25 00:00:00	Prelude	588	Does the Minister of State wish to reply?  We must bring consideration of these amendments to a conclusion.
#MichaelKitt	unknown-#MichaelKitt-party	unknown-#MichaelKitt-dob	unknown-#MichaelKitt-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-06-25 00:00:00	Prelude	589	I have a difficulty, as I outlined previously, with amendments Nos. 3 and 4.  I propose to bring forward an amendment on Committee Stage in the Seanad to deal with the points Deputy Ciarán Lynch and I have raised.  I cannot go any further than that.
#JoannaTuffy	unknown-#JoannaTuffy-party	unknown-#JoannaTuffy-dob	unknown-#JoannaTuffy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-06-25 00:00:00	Prelude	590	Will the Minister of State bring forward an amendment to deal with what is proposed in amendments Nos. 3 and 4?
#MichaelKitt	unknown-#MichaelKitt-party	unknown-#MichaelKitt-dob	unknown-#MichaelKitt-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-06-25 00:00:00	Prelude	591	Amendments Nos. 3 and 4 are being taken together and, therefore, that would be the case.
#JoannaTuffy	unknown-#JoannaTuffy-party	unknown-#JoannaTuffy-dob	unknown-#JoannaTuffy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-06-25 00:00:00	Prelude	592	I take it the proposed Government amendment would apply to what is covered in both amendments Nos. 3 and 4 and that, therefore, it would replicate what is covered in amendments Nos. 3 and 4, but it would be the Minister of State's version.
#KathleenLynch	unknown-#KathleenLynch-party	unknown-#KathleenLynch-dob	unknown-#KathleenLynch-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-06-25 00:00:00	Prelude	593	We cannot discuss what such an amendment would contain, but the Minister State has promised to bring forward an amendment.

#KathleenLynch	unknown-#KathleenLynch-party	unknown-#KathleenLynch-dob	unknown-#KathleenLynch-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-06-25 00:00:00	Prelude	595	Are the Deputies prepared to withdraw the amendments in their names on the basis that the Minister of State will bring forward an amendment on Committee Stage in the Seanad?
#CiaranLynch	unknown-#CiaranLynch-party	unknown-#CiaranLynch-dob	unknown-#CiaranLynch-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-06-25 00:00:00	Prelude	596	On the basis that the Minister has given a commitment to amend these two areas on Committee Stage in the Seanad, it only fair to withdraw the amendments.
#MichaelKitt	unknown-#MichaelKitt-party	unknown-#MichaelKitt-dob	unknown-#MichaelKitt-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-06-25 00:00:00	Prelude	597	I indicated on Committee Stage on 21 May 2008 that I proposed to include a minor technical amendment to the Third Schedule of the Freedom of Information Act 1997 in the Nuclear Test Ban Bill when the Bill reached Report Stage.  Following further advice from the Attorney General, I will not now introduce any amendments to the Freedom of Information Act by way of the Nuclear Test Ban Bill.  It is now proposed instead to introduce any amendments to the Third Schedule of the Freedom of Information Act in respect of my Department's legislation in the environmental (miscellaneous provisions) Bill currently being prepared.
#CiaranLynch	unknown-#CiaranLynch-party	unknown-#CiaranLynch-dob	unknown-#CiaranLynch-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-06-25 00:00:00	Prelude	598	I wish to share my time with Deputy Rabbitte.
#KathleenLynch	unknown-#KathleenLynch-party	unknown-#KathleenLynch-dob	unknown-#KathleenLynch-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-06-25 00:00:00	Prelude	599	That is agreed.
#CiaranLynch	unknown-#CiaranLynch-party	unknown-#CiaranLynch-dob	unknown-#CiaranLynch-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-06-25 00:00:00	Prelude	600	This Bill, if colleagues will excuse the pun, has been doing the rounds in recent days.  It appeared in one manifestation but will leave the House in another, not unlike what happens on a Saturday night.We need to ask ourselves what is the intent of the Bill.  Is it to resolve an issue, deal with the problem of alcohol in society or is it a PR exercise by a Minister who has now gone on, to use his own words, to deal with a housing crisis?Three obvious areas could have been addressed in this Bill — traceability,  promotion and advertising of alcohol products and 21 year old people purchasing alcohol in off-licences.  The Minister had an opportunity to introduce traceability whereby youngsters under the age of 18 found in possession of alcohol——
#KathleenLynch	unknown-#KathleenLynch-party	unknown-#KathleenLynch-dob	unknown-#KathleenLynch-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-06-25 00:00:00	Prelude	601	I apologise for interrupting the Deputy.  It might be preferable at this stage that Deputy Rabbitte resume his contribution and use his entire slot.
#CiaranLynch	unknown-#CiaranLynch-party	unknown-#CiaranLynch-dob	unknown-#CiaranLynch-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-06-25 00:00:00	Prelude	602	That is fine.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-06-25 00:00:00	Prelude	603	I thank the Acting Chairman and Deputy Ciarán Lynch.  I did not appreciate that the previous business would be dealt with so quickly.I argued last night for the few meaningful sections of this Bill to be incorporated into the promised sale of alcohol Bill.  That would represent a more considered approach to alcohol abuse in our society and its implications for public health and safety.  This Bill is a rushed effort, already much altered by the Minister.  His presentation last night dealt at length with the harmful effects of alcohol abuse on society.  However, the Bill is a narrow, modest measure which does not respond to most of issues raised by the Minister himself.  I cannot recall the Government producing a single public health measure since 1997 to combat the harmful effects of alcohol abuse.The Bill avoids addressing most of the Minister's own arguments.  Its focus is on teenage drunkenness and public disorder, and there is no doubt that the availability of cheaper alcohol in unregulated retail outlets exacerbates this endemic cultural malaise.  However, after this Bill is enacted, it will still be possible to purchase alcohol at bargain basement prices in supermarkets.  Alcohol sales are blatantly used as loss leaders in supermarkets.  The Government seemed only too content until now to tolerate high prices for food and other essentials and knockdown prices for various alcohol products.  Nothing in the Bill will change this practice of high prices for food and low prices for alcohol.The Minister announced last night that he will not proceed with the proposal to cease the operation of early houses and that there will no longer be a requirement for wine to be separated from other products.  Moreover, in the matter of the separation of alcohol from other products, he announced that his plans may now be met by a voluntary code to be devised by retailers.  We must probe this in considerable detail on Committee Stage.  However, it must be asked how it diminishes public disorder and enhances public safety to require all nightclubs to disgorge their clientele onto the streets at the same time.  I do not much care whether the Minister cuts back the hours of operation of such establishments, but the proposal in this Bill will merely invite agitation and irritation and strain public transport and other services.There are important issues in the report of the alcohol advisory group which are not dealt with in this Bill.  Instead of rushing at half cock to legislate, the Minister should be taking those issues on board and incorporating them into a considered sale of alcohol Bill.  Dr. Gordon Holmes says in the preface to this report: "A more consistent and co-ordinated approach to alcohol-related problems is required across the Government system."  This Bill only adds to the existing half thought-out and inconsistent approach.  The Minister has already dropped some of the ill-considered sections but is pressing ahead with others which will require detailed scrutiny on Committee Stage.While the Minister insists on disgorging the clientele of pubs and nightclubs onto the streets at a uniform time, with the inevitable congregation of patrons at fast food facilities, this Bill will have the opposite effect to that which he desires.  What is needed is a considered sale of alcohol Bill with public health and safety at its core and where proper thought is given to issues such as below cost selling, advertising, education, regulation of retail outlets and other pertinent issues raised by the Dr. Gordon Holmes committee.  This Bill falls a long way short.It is essential that sufficient time be afforded on Committee Stage to debate this legislation.  I drew the Taoiseach's attention this morning to the unprecedented experience of receiving a schedule of business for this week which indicates that Report Stage of the Bill is listed for next week.  I am only the second speaker on Second Stage.  Committee Stage has not even been scheduled.  How then can we jump to Report Stage next week?  That is no way to process legislation in this House.  There is no point in the Government trying to bludgeon us into submission because they have surmised that we will be reluctant to deal with the issue of teenage drunkenness and public disorder.  We are not at all reluctant to deal with it.  On the contrary, we want to deal with it comprehensively and safely.The Minister has promised a sale of alcohol Bill.  It would have been much better for him to have taken a considered approach rather than going off at half cock.  The Minister admitted in a radio interview this morning that he is puzzled as to why proposals on early houses were included in this Bill.  One does not see many youths going on the rampage because they have been served alcohol in early houses.  The Minister has done a deal with retail outlets whereby they will introduce their own code of conduct.  He no longer wants to separate wine so that those of us, unlike the Minister, with a predilection in that area can now fondle the bottle to our heart's content.  We had the revelation from the Minister last night that he may not be entirely averse to that product, which is not in keeping with the Calvinist image he has portrayed in the House for the past 20 years.I am glad to hear he is in touch with the real world.  As such, he will know that forcing people out of nightclubs and onto the street at the same time, when their drinks are half drunk, is only inviting trouble.  There must be a drinking-up time facility.  I am aware of at least one such place where gardaí go in on the hour to round up people onto the streets.  Without allowing for drinking-up time, one invites irritation and difficulty.  Throughout the State, such difficulty as takes place usually occurs adjacent to fast food facilities where people congregate at the same late hour.I do not dispute that the Minister's objective is worthy in seeking to contain public disorder and to address the endemic abuse of alcohol by young people.  However, the measures must be considered.  There is a great deal more in the Dr. Gordon Holmes report than is incorporated into this slight Bill.  It is becoming more slight every day — if the Minister receives any more representations, there will be nothing left in it.  It would be far better to incorporate these provisions into the promised sale of alcohol Bill.  We must give some considered thought to the damage being done to public health by the abuse of alcohol and we must come forward with some considered measures.We will require time on Committee Stage to deal with the various issues we wish to raise in the context of the Bill.  It is simply unacceptable that there should be a departure in the case of this legislation from the protocol that Members should have reasonable time to prepare amendments, after the completion of Second Stage, and to thrash them out on Committee Stage before moving on to Report and Final Stages.  Let us extend the sitting time of the House or find some other means of ensuring the time is available.  I do not mind what means the Minister prefers to accommodate that.  However, I object to being railroaded into agreeing to legislation I consider defective and which the Minister himself has effectively admitted is defective in that he has already excised significant elements of it.  We must have time to tease it out and to examine other aspects of this issue.
#TimDooley	unknown-#TimDooley-party	unknown-#TimDooley-dob	unknown-#TimDooley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-06-25 00:00:00	Prelude	604	I welcome the opportunity to contribute to the debate on this Bill.  It has been clear for some time that legislation of this type is necessary.  We are all aware of the difficulties associated with the abuse of alcohol and of the necessity to introduce some measures to curb the consumption of alcohol.  However, that has to be set against a backdrop of a culture of the consumption of alcohol.  I listened to the debate last evening and I have just listened intently to Deputy Rabbitte.  I suppose he is right in suggesting no Bill will resolve this problem, whether this one or the sale of alcohol Bill, as proposed.The introduction of this Bill and the subsequent debate will help highlight an issue that needs to be addressed.  It will always be difficult to address a cultural issue.  There is little doubt that our current status in terms of the consumption of alcohol has been developed over a considerable period.  For many years, Irish people consumed more alcohol than their European neighbours and continue to do so.  The buoyancy in the economy in recent years has certainly aided and abetted the increased level of alcohol consumption, particularly among young people.  That is an issue that needs to be addressed.This Bill is a first step.  A number of Opposition speakers have indicated it does not go far enough, as did Deputy Rabbitte.  It is about setting a target whereby the Government will be in a position to take this issue seriously and attempt in legislation to curb the consumption of alcohol, so far as it can.  Taken with the promised sale of alcohol Bill, there will be a suite of measures to help.  At the end of the day it is rather like road safety.  Clearly the two are linked and there is personal choice.  We live in a democracy.  To the extent that one can prevent people doing the dastardly acts outlined by many speakers, there is a limit as to how far one can go in legislation.  The issue will require a much greater level of debate in society.In regard to our thinking about alcohol, we have to look at the education system.  Other societies have a much more mature way of dealing with alcohol.  For example, in France wine is almost part of the diet and, as such, there is not the same excitement about young people obtaining access to alcohol where it is treated in the same way as many of us treat water.  For that reason a cultural shift is required and this can only happen through debate.  Our habits and practices have developed over many years and are very different from European and international practices.Some of the benchmarks identified in terms of the level of alcohol consumption here versus others probably do not give fair recognition to what truly goes on.  I read some statistics recently which seem to suggest that an Irish person is more likely to take up to five drinks at one particular event.  That is not to suggest people drink every day, whereas in other countries people will have a couple of glasses of wine, perhaps, every day.  Perhaps we are not as bad as some of the international statistics suggest.It would be wrong not to compliment the Government's alcohol advisory group, chaired by Dr. Gordon Holmes, on the efforts it has made in informing the debate.  In its report the group has identified methodologies of dealing with this problem while clearly recognising there are limitations as to what can be done in a democracy and how one can help prevent the problems society is encountering in this regard.Certainly there was concern about the increase in the level of off-licence trade and its impact on the consumption of alcohol.  We have all seen the development of the larger supermarkets and the aggressive approach adopted in regard to the sale of alcohol, for example, below-cost selling and promotional practices that have encouraged volume sales.  It is not unusual to see a number of young people walk out of some of the larger supermarkets with a slab of cans.  That is becoming a regular sight.  The restriction proposed for opening hours is welcome.  That it will apply to supermarkets and off-licences is helpful.The below-cost unit selling and the special promotions were particularly disingenuous from so-called responsible retailers who set themselves up in communities.  They work with schools through the provision of tokens to buy computers and do much to generate business in their communities but, on the other hand, use alcohol products as a loss leader to attract people to their stores.  It is only right that those practices be prevented.  They do nothing for the children in our society.  Many supermarkets work with communities and have various programmes for providing IT equipment for schools.  That they do the two, side by side, is disingenuous and I would hope the issue can be resolved without legislation.  We are all contributors to the problem and can have an input into its resolution.  We need to appeal to those involved in the sale of alcohol, not necessarily to stick to the letter of the law but to have a conscience about the predatory practices they employ.  If that could be done, it would deal with the issue in a more sensible way than bringing forward legislation that it may not be possible to enforce.The alcohol advisory group, chaired by Dr. Holmes, looked at the special exemption orders and some of the longer opening hours that have developed.  It looked also at the existing sanctions and penalties for those people who broke the law.  It is right and fitting that the sanctions be commensurate with the profits that can be made from the sale of alcohol and the provision of facilities in that regard.  I would hope that sanctions and penalties could be used effectively where people have been found to be in breach of the law.  It is all about combatting excessive under age drinking.If those who are under age begin to consume far too much alcohol it can have a huge impact on their ability to continue in education or find suitable employment and can cause devastation in their lives.  It is not just about the impact on the street at night  — public order offences are a concern at another level — the grip of alcohol, together with drugs, can have a huge impact on lives.  For that reason it is right and fitting that we should find methods to deal with it.Ireland has one of the highest alcohol consumption levels in the EU.   That, combined with the lethal cocktail of drugs, poses a real problem particularly around binge drinking, which has a negative effect on society.  We all know its impact in terms of road deaths.  Some 36% of fatal crashes involve alcohol consumption and 28% of injuries at accident and emergency departments involve alcohol in one way or another.  It plays a huge role in domestic violence.  Almost half of those who have committed homicide offences were intoxicated.  It is important that we continue to highlight the problem and generate publicity as we have done in regard to some of the health promotion measures that have taken place, particularly in the area of smoking.  Some of the measures taken by the Government in the past, while not legislative, to promote a healthier lifestyle have been helpful in terms of changing people's practices in regard to smoking and eating.  We debated some serious issues in terms of a balanced diet and its impact on public health.  Clearly alcohol should also be looked in terms of a public health policy.  Investment, through education and an effective campaign promoting public health will ultimately have a beneficial effect, perhaps greater than any restrictive or legislative practice a Government may introduce.  That is not to suggest I do not support the Bill which I do and I support the Minister's efforts in regard to the development of the sale of alcohol Bill.  We must be practical however and view the issue in the context of the current situation and of our overall culture on the consumption of alcohol.  There is little doubt that the misuse of alcohol has a tremendous impact on the economy, especially in terms of the loss of working days in the commercial and public sectors.  That aspect is probably not highlighted sufficiently.  Absenteeism is a problem, especially on Mondays.  Changes in that regard may be in the pipeline due to the straitened economic circumstances in which we find ourselves.  The level of absenteeism in certain professions and sectors is significant and that needs to be addressed within the workplace.  If people felt their jobs would be in jeopardy if they did not show up on Monday, it might contribute to a change in behaviour on Sunday night much more than would a change to the closing time of bars.  To find a solution, we need to examine the matter in a holistic way.There is a difficulty with public order in certain areas and the impact drunkenness has on the lives of other people, especially late at night.  There is also an impact on tourism.  For many years Ireland was seen as a country where people enjoyed a drink.  We might have consumed a little more alcohol than our European neighbours or our friends in America but, notwithstanding that, we were seen as jovial characters.  The caricatures that emerged were by and large positive.  Unfortunately, alcohol and drug consumption by some younger people causes aggressive behaviour which has tarnished that image.  That mix has changed the way in which people behave and led them to take things too far.  We are at risk of significant losses if we are not prepared to tackle the problem and to deal with it in a measured, effective way.We need to get tough on public order.  I am sure the Minister is in contact with the Garda.  Powers must be available to the Garda that will allow it to do its job effectively so that drunkenness and loutish behaviour is removed from our streets in so far as possible and as quickly as possible in a manner that will ensure people do not continue to serially offend.  I refer for example to anti-social behaviour orders and other legislative measures.The Bill deals with restrictions on the opening of off-licences.  It is especially welcome that these measures are being extended to some large supermarkets.  There is effectively a duopoly within the supermarket sector, as two of the large chain stores that are omnipresent throughout the country have a hold on the retail grocery trade.  They have been branching into below cost selling of alcohol and the practices I outlined earlier in terms of the sale of multiple packs of cans of alcoholic drink known as slabs of cans.  It is regrettable that this is happening and it is correct that the opening hours for their off-trade would be restricted in the same way as off-licences.I am delighted the Minister has decided to change his mind on early houses.  I was one of the people who had lobbied him on the matter — not that I have ever stood in an early house, to the best of my knowledge.  I walk by an early house on my way to the Dáil every Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday morning and I regularly banter with a couple of fellows who stand outside the door smoking cigarettes.  They do not seem to pose a public order threat.  From talking to other people who have encountered the phenomenon of early houses, that appears to be the general consensus.  It is clear that the problem does not lie with early houses.  While it might have provided the Minister with an opportunity to demonstrate a "get tough" attitude, it would not have had any effect.  I am delighted he avoided the opportunity to look tough and has been much more practical in the measures contained in the Bill.It is correct that the off-sales criteria that apply to off-licences would also apply to early houses.  Existing early houses will continue to be treated in the same way they are currently.  That is a workable solution and will help to protect some of the character of society.  Had we chosen the other option, it would have been regrettable because early houses have become a feature of a certain part of city life for some people.  They are a source of wonder and amusement for visitors.  To some extent, early houses are a tourist attraction.  I am not sure if tourists drink in early houses but they certainly visit them and talk about this aspect of Irish life.I remain somewhat concerned about the necessity for a District Court certificate for wine retail outlets or off-licences.  I have been lobbied by people, some from small retail stores, who do not see wine as being a major problem.  There is no evidence of large amounts of wine being consumed to the detriment of society in a way that would constitute a threat to public order.  I am more concerned about below-cost selling and cheap beers in terms of public order.  Cheaper sources of alcohol are available than wine.  I am not certain there is a necessity for the measure, which may only result in the courts being clogged up when we would be better advised to keep them free to deal with more serious offences.  The Minister appears to have made up his mind but perhaps he will reconsider it at a later Stage.I welcome the practical approach adopted by the Minister to the structural separation of alcohol from other products in retail outlets.  I lobbied the Minister on the issue, as did other Members on this side of the House, about the difficulty it would have created for many convenience stores and smaller supermarkets in rural areas.  Clearly, they provide a service where people generally purchase off-licence sales for consumption at home.  That measure would have created an almost impossible burden on most of the shops I know where space is not available.  The range of products stocked by many convenience stores is such that one is not required to travel to a large multinational store, which is helpful.  If the Minister were to opt to separate alcohol products, that would drive consumers further into the grip of the duopoly that exists within the supermarket business.  In the long run, that would be to the detriment of competition and rural communities.I welcome the Minister's helpful approach to engage with the industry.  He has invited the industry to come forward with a voluntary code of practice.  The Minister has indicated that if the measures are independently verifiable he will consider not commencing section 8.  That is a genuine effort on the part of the Minister to try to resolve the matter, and one where I hope the interaction between the two sides will be such that a solution can be found that does not damage the viability of smaller stores.I welcome the fact that wine is to be exempt from any separation or code that might emerge.  Deputy Rabbitte used flowery language about the fondling of wine bottles.  That has become the practice for people, who, whether they are wine connoisseurs or not, like to give the impression that they are.  In these times of straitened economic circumstances one would not want to take that from people if they feel it necessary to touch their purchase.  The tightening of the special exemption order is welcome.  The insistence on the use of CCTV is also helpful.  To the best of my knowledge all good public houses that seek a late exemption or have night club businesses believe CCTV is an integral part of the security of the business.It is helpful that theatre licences have been removed.  I hope the Minister will review the nightclub sector.  The Irish Nightclub Industry Association has sought a definition of nightclubs in law, which would be welcome.  They should also be granted an annual nightclub permit.Further to what Deputy Rabbitte said about sequential closing, the Minister should consider ending the prohibition of entertainment during the drinking-up time.  At the moment during the half-hour drinking-up time nightclubs and bars are prevented from playing music, which adds to the speed at which people exit the building.  If they were allowed play music for that half-hour, albeit with the bars closed, it would delay the exit from the building and allow a degree of sequential movement on to the streets.

#JoeCarey	unknown-#JoeCarey-party	unknown-#JoeCarey-dob	unknown-#JoeCarey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-06-25 00:00:00	Prelude	607	Historically we as Irish people have had a somewhat ambiguous relationship with alcohol and its impact on our society.  There is a sneaking regard for a man that can hold his drink.  We associate some of our great literary figures and their work with alcohol.  Every Irish social occasion involves alcohol.  In recent years we have developed as an economy.  We develop and export software and pharmaceuticals.  We service and contribute to an international financial services industry.  However, if we go anywhere in the world, what it is that makes us distinctively Irish?  What is it that makes us stand out?  The answer to those questions is the Irish pub.  Practically every European, American, Asian, African and Australian city boasts its own authentic Irish Pub.  One of the first introductions the people from the former communist bloc eastern European countries had to Western culture was the Irish pub.  This in itself is not necessarily a bad thing.  We have long been associated with hospitality and the clichéd céad míle fáilte.  The pub has long been one of the cornerstones of Irish culture, where babies' heads are wetted, political careers established and funeral wakes conducted.  It has been stated that prior to our independence the British authorities were quite happy to have the people of Ireland as inebriated as possible in order that rebellion would not take place.  It is difficult to rise against the oppressor with a bellyful of ale on board.I welcome the proposal in the Bill to introduce test purchasing of alcohol for both on-licence and off-licence premises.  It would appear that gardaí will be allowed to test pubs and other outlets by sending in under-age people to try to buy drink, in order to expose breaches of the law.  The principle of this is fine and should tighten up sale to those who are under age.  The previous Minister spoke of using this method "subject to the necessary safeguards".  I ask the Minister elaborate on this.  Has this type of action using people under the age of 18 been used in any other sphere of Garda activity previously?  Are there any constitutional issues in using children to implement legislation in this manner?  Surely a national identity card should form a cornerstone of such a proposal.I welcome any initiative regarding the manner in which alcohol is promoted and discounts applied.  There is sophistication in all alcohol advertising.  Drinks companies are obviously making vast sums of money when we see the film-type quality of their television advertising.A friend of mine had occasion to visit Canada in the mid 1990s to attend an event sponsored by a well-known international drinks company.  At the time the company referred to the vast untapped market for a new product, alcopops.  He did not know what they were and felt the whole thing was daft.  Here we are a number of years later with the whole alcohol consumption issue turned on its head.  There has been a revolution in what and how people drink.  It would be very naïve of us to think that this happened by accident.We have seen another recent development in the sale of alcohol in that we are now in the era of "buy one get one free".  This is a most unwelcome development and reflects on the marketing departments of drinks companies.  Allowing the industry to self-regulate and follow a code of practice developed in conjunction with the Department of Health and Children has been the modus operandi heretofore.  Perhaps it is time we a had a more vigorous approach as to how alcohol is promoted in society.Statistics show that approximately 40% of proceedings taken each year for public order offences are for intoxication in a public place.  I welcome that fixed-penalty charges for drunk and disorderly offences are planned in this legislation, which should free up the District Court.  The Bill also allows a member of the Garda Síochána to seize any bottle or container which is in the possession of a person who appears to be under the age of 18 and which the member suspects, with reasonable cause, contains alcohol which is being consumed, or intended to be consumed, by a person under 18 years in a place other than a private residence.Surely the substantive issue must be that a person under 18 years should not be consuming alcohol.  While I understand that again there are constitutional issues regarding the private residences, is the Minister saying that in the case of a person under 18 found in public by a garda with alcohol the defence of claiming to be on the way home with alcohol will suffice?  The Minister stated that alcohol would be seized in public if trouble was brewing and from people under 18 if gardaí think it will not be consumed indoors.  Surely if those under 18 are found with alcohol it should be automatic that it be confiscated.I understand the Minister has rowed back on the part of the Bill relating to early houses, which I welcome.  There would not appear to be any element of public disorder associated with these premises.  While they may not be to everyone's liking, we need to stay close to the principles of the Bill and temper all proposals with their impact on the relationship between alcohol and public order.  I note the Minister has stated there is evidence showing these early houses are now used by people with drink problems.  By all means he should show us this evidence and allow us make an informed decision.We have seen a proliferation of off-licences in recent years.  The culture of drinking has changed from the pub to the purchase of alcohol for consumption elsewhere.  I have some reservations about the structural changes required under the Bill for mixed-trading retailers in that a structurally separated area will need to be constructed for the display and sale of alcohol.  In essence for many businesses they will need to place the alcohol behind the counter and this measure is simply not practical in terms of space and because nearly all beers are now stored in refrigeration units.  There are other means to achieve what the Minister wants to achieve on this issue.  For instance all alcohol could be sold from a dedicated till covered by CCTV.  Secure units could be used for the display of alcohol in a defined area of the shop or quite simply a trader's licence to trade alcohol could be removed immediately on conviction of a breach of the Intoxicating Liquor Acts.  With respect to the physical separation of alcohol from the main store it would be more practical to adopt the Northern Ireland model whereby the authorities there have separated the area in which alcohol is sold by providing a physical barrier with access through a gate, turnstile or similar device.It would be worth considering the introduction of an officially recognised training scheme for those involved in the sale of alcohol.  While some responsible traders operate such a scheme, the Bill should compel anyone who sells alcohol to have participated in a scheme.  I acknowledge the Minister has stepped back from the structural changes proposed for off-licenses within stores, which I felt were impractical.  The Minister must clearly define what he means by a code of standards which he mentioned in his speech to this House last night.The State has a key role to play in ensuring licensing laws and public order legislation are adequate and effective.  Parents, too, have a role to play.  We should continue to always underscore the importance of personal responsibility regarding the consumption of alcohol.  Our drink culture has changed and become more aggressive.  The philosophy of drinking to simply get drunk has become more common over the years.  We have public health issues associated with alcohol that we did not have previously.  This legislation goes some way towards finally acknowledging that we, as a people, have problems in this area.
#MichaelWDArcy	unknown-#MichaelWDArcy-party	unknown-#MichaelWDArcy-dob	unknown-#MichaelWDArcy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-06-25 00:00:00	Prelude	608	We have been talking for a long time about the need for Government action to tackle the very many problems caused to Irish society by alcohol abuse.  That day has finally come for what looks like being a partial Bill to do something about it.  As has been said, Fine Gael supports it, though with some serious reservations, which I will touch on later.  For the most part this Bill is a good start, although I agree with Deputy Rabbitte that much more needs to be done.  I assume we will deal with much more substantial aspects of alcohol abuse and intoxicating liquor after the recess.Alcohol abuse affects every strata of society, age group and socioeconomic class, male and female.  Along with the considerable human misery it causes — ruining relationships, marriages and families, leading to underage sex and resultant pregnancies, social problems, mental health issues and public order offences — it places a considerable financial burden on society.  That is why, while it may be much more politically advantageous to concentrate spending on public capital projects such as the extension of the Luas or a metro system, shiny, bright new infrastructure and services that will gain kudos from the public, there should be much more investment in social capital.  That is a moral obligation which we, as legislators, cannot and should not ignore.  Ignoring it, unfortunately, will not make it go away.  On the contrary, our head in the sand approach to the problem up to now has allowed it to get worse.There must be a much more cohesive strategy in time to deal with the problems we face.  This strategy must come from the public health sections of the Department of Health and Children and the HSE, and the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government via the Planning and Development Act, which allows the opening of certain facilities including fast food outlets and the opening hours attached to businesses selling alcohol.  The Departments of Arts, Sport and Tourism and Education and Science must also join together to try to deal with the problem once and for all.  Drunkenness in the streets is what we see at one end of the scale.  If that strategic, cohesive campaign was put together well once, we would be able to deal with many of those problems.  It is a complex and deep-rooted problem and because of that there is no easy, quick fix solution.  That is why we need to take action which deals with the issue in a comprehensive way that is practical and workable.There is much talk about drug abuse, however the most available drug for teenagers is alcohol.  There have been 96 prosecutions in five years for illegally supplying alcohol to those who are underage.  Irish society does not report on others.  We do not report on the local publican who gives these children drink, even though we have seen them drunk in our pubs time and again.  How often has one gone out for Sunday lunch with one's family and seen people settling down for the entire afternoon to watch a match on television?  How often do we later see the parents of children very drunk, the children becoming agitated and bored in the pub because they have nothing to do and no interest, and then a row breaking out?  How often do we report these matters to the publicans or the Garda?  We do not.  There is as much onus on society and those of us who are responsible to take the matter in hand and deal with it.The issue of underage sex, which is linked to alcohol use in pre-teens and teenagers, is a little discussed problem in this country.  The prevalence of "field drinking", that is gangs of teenagers gathering in places like fields and parks to drink excessively, is known to lead to under-age sex.  Some of this could be categorised as abusive, for example it has been reported to me that drunk minors engage in sexual activity with more than one person or in the company of others.  Surely no right-thinking person, young or old, would ever consider this if they were not seriously drunk.  We have not even begun to examine the psychological effects of such activity on those engaging in it, quite apart from unwanted pregnancies.  This legislation allows the Garda to confiscate the alcohol.  It is a bit late at that stage for gardaí to come and take alcohol after actions of that nature have happened.The number of off-licences in the State has trebled in seven years.  Alcohol is available in far more outlets now, such as smaller shops, service stations and the like, as well as the big supermarkets.  I take issue with the many adults who buy drink for underage people.  They feel they are doing them a service, but if anything they are doing them a major disservice.  Many of these outlets are open too late, drink is too easily available and the Bill will try to deal with some of that.It is not overstating the case to say advertising often glorifies the use of alcohol.  We are shown images of groups of friends gathering in pubs, getting the pints in, all good cheer and friendly chat.  Those featured are often depicted as being heroes.  The link with sports needs to be seriously questioned.  The inclusion of professional sports people, whom young people look up to and see as role models, is a matter of concern.  The subliminal message being sent out all the time is that alcohol is cool.  Little or no message is sent out about the associated problems of alcohol abuse.  There is very little reporting that many professional sports people do not drink alcohol.  One cannot play, train and perform at the necessary level for professional sports and participate in drink.  Some do, but they do not achieve the top level and few of them drink any longer.  That message is never put out there.  The only message that gets out is of the famous sports person supporting drink or one of the outlets for the provision of drink, and nobody knows whether he or she drinks.  I know of some sports people who receive significant funds to promote these products although they do not drink at all, and certainly would not drink some of the products they promote.Tougher measures must be demonstrated to publicans who offend and it must be shown that they will not be allowed to get away with it.  There must be zero tolerance and after a period of time or a number of convictions the message will get through that the harsher penalties will cause a significant problem for anybody who is prepared to ignore the legislation.Nightclub opening hours are of concern to this side of the House.  Gardaí have expressed serious concern over the years about the level of public order offences committed in the time immediately following the closure of nightclubs.  Deputy Joe Carey and I still frequent nightclubs on occasion, although not as often as we used to, and it is very obvious to us that when the nightclubs all close at one particular time everybody ends up on the streets looking for a taxi and a burger at more or less the same time.  It is a problem that needs to be dealt with and sequential closing is a method of doing this.The Planning and Development Act needs to be revisited with regard to the closing of fast food outlets.  It is crazy that some fast food outlets which have revamped their premises have a condition of planning that they must close at a particular time while older ones which have not revamped or remodelled do not have conditions of planning.  Some are obliged to close and others are not, which is unfair and must be dealt with.In the next session, I would like to see a cohesive strategy coming from Government.  This Bill is a step in the right direction and I will not be critical of it.  However, we must consider all positive matters so that young adults can go out, have a good time and have a few drinks without getting drunk out of their minds.
#CyprianBrady	unknown-#CyprianBrady-party	unknown-#CyprianBrady-dob	unknown-#CyprianBrady-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-06-25 00:00:00	Prelude	609	I welcome the opportunity to speak on the Bill.  The vast majority of people in this country are affected by this issue, some more directly than others.  My constituency of Dublin Central, which includes the central north side of the city, probably has the highest concentration of off-licences and licensed premises in the country.  I welcome the introduction of new legislation to contribute to reducing and eliminating the misuse of alcohol and the anti-social behaviour which results from this misuse.  Communities throughout the country, not just in cities, have at some stage experienced the results of the misuse of alcohol.Having worked for many years with local communities in my constituency, I am extremely aware of the problems associated with the misuse of alcohol, particularly where it involves the young.  I am also aware of how this can impact on the lives, careers, families and communities of those affected.  As the Minister stated yesterday at the launch of the Bill, this is a response to a deepening problem of alcohol misuse and it will also reduce public disorder and crime associated with alcohol misuse.  It is not a killjoy measure or one conjured up by a nanny state.  This is to assist in tackling problems which are consistently being raised by communities and groups throughout the country.  It is a very balanced approach to what is an issue for many.The Alcohol Related Harm in Ireland report, published by the HSE in April, shows how alcohol misuse is exacerbating our crime problem.  Some 46% of those who committed murder or manslaughter were intoxicated at the time of their crimes, drunkenness was a factor in more than one third of all fatal crashes and public order offences committed by adults increased by 247% between 1996 and 2002.  These are stark realities which emerged in this report and they require immediate intervention.  To be fair to the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform and the present and the previous Minister, that immediate response is included in this Bill.I am concerned following recent reports that our young people are now among the biggest binge drinkers in Europe.  The statistics are horrific.  Not all young people abuse alcohol or are adversely affected by the use of alcohol but for those that are, the initial binge drinking can be a first step to a life of crime.  I have seen this at first hand in communities in my own area where young children, for whatever reason but mostly from boredom, become involved in the taking of alcohol with the result that they enter a spiral from which they cannot escape.  Despite the many supports and programmes that are in place throughout the city, these young children find themselves in a position where they are helpless to help themselves.  In the small minority of cases where they actually become addicted, it can have a devastating affect on a community or a family.  Anybody working in this field will tell us that the age of young people who are becoming addicted, not just to alcohol but also to drugs, is falling.The Bill attempts to tackle alcohol abuse and address the public order and licensing aspects of what is a national problem.  When we hear reports of vulnerable communities, particularly elderly people who have their lives disrupted, often on a daily basis, by adults and children who abuse alcohol, we must take action.  Studies have been undertaken on the effect of these issues.  The Bill will go a long way towards addressing many of the problems these people and communities are experiencing.I was concerned with two particular aspects of the Bill which the Minister addressed yesterday.  In particular, the measures could have impacted on the livelihood of people who are trying to run respectable businesses to the highest possible standards.  Primarily due to the concerns raised by Dr. Holmes in regard to the increased availability and visibility of alcohol, particularly off sales, the Bill in general makes provision for the following.  Off-sales of alcohol will be permitted only between the hours of 10.30 a.m. and 10.00 p.m., or 12.30 p.m. to 10.00 p.m. on Sundays.  A point which surprised many is that shops, supermarkets and garages can currently sell alcohol from 7.30 a.m.  Another section deals with wine off-licences, which are currently available directly from the Revenue Commissioners but which will in future require a District Court certificate.  Also, the grounds on which an objection may be made to the granting of a District Court certificate for an off-licence will be extended to include consideration of the needs of the neighbourhood.  I will address this point later as it is crucial.The Bill also states that alcohol products must in future be displayed and sold in supermarkets, convenience stores and so on in a specified area which is structurally separated from the rest of the premises.  As I said, my area has a high concentration of small convenience stores which service large apartment complexes or estates further out in the suburbs.  The majority of retail outlets agree that the concept of having a separate area for merchandising alcohol is a good way to go, including the use of turnstiles, as used in the North of Ireland.  However, in many cases, this is not practical or possible due to the size of the store and also due to the requirement to employ a separate staff member and have a separate till to process the sale of alcohol.We had detailed discussions with the Minister, Deputy Dermot Ahern in recent days.  I was delighted to hear it has been decided, in consultation with the retail organisations and individual business people, that there will a code of practice which they will voluntarily implement — in many cases the codes and requirements are being enforced voluntarily.  As a result, the Minister is willing to consider deferring the implementation of any structural changes that may be required in retail premises, specifically with regard to the sale of alcohol.Having spoken to many business people in my own area, many of whom are very responsible, I know that if we had gone down the road of enforcing the segregation and separation of alcohol, because of the nature of retail sales and the competition which exists in that market, some of these retail outlets could have turned into off-licence premises solely, which would defeat the whole purpose of the Bill in reducing access to alcohol. Due to the size of the outlets, the nature of the business and the areas in which the convenience stores are located, it would not have been practical for them to take on refurbishments and additional staff.   I was very much heartened by the Minister's decision to re-examine the issue and to defer any implementation pending consultation with the business people and their representative associations.Members might not be aware that some retailers may need up to a dozen different licences before they can open their doors.  Obviously one needs a licence to sell alcohol but one also requires a licence to sell lottery tickets, fresh food, fruit, stamps, fish and hot food, to name but a few.The offer of a voluntary code of practice governing issues such as signage, access, availability and staff training is welcome.  Staff in shops must be properly trained in customer service and in handling alcohol and cash.  Outlets must invest in voluntary training programmes to ensure that only persons over the age of 18 are sold alcohol.  We have heard anecdotal evidence of some retail outlets employing people under the age of 18 and allowing them to sell alcohol.  We have heard other reports of persons selling alcohol who have very limited English, which can cause difficulties.  It is important that high standards are enforced by the retailers themselves.  Many of the retailers to whom I refer are small family businesses whose name is over the door and who have a certain standing and credibility to maintain in their communities.  The onus is on them to ensure that proper training and information is provided to staff in upholding the law.There has been much discussion about the early morning houses, a large number of which are located in my constituency.  I have met many proprietors of such premises in recent days.  Most early houses are run by families who have been in the business for generations.  They were originally provided with a six-day licence to sell alcohol from 7 a.m. to facilitate those who worked on the docks and in the markets which are situated in central Dublin.  Years ago, Dublin only came to life at 8 a.m. and most people went into work in the centre of the city.  The city then effectively closed down at night, with most pubs, restaurants and shops shut by midnight.  Today, we have a changed city which is cosmopolitan, busy and which caters for more than 1 million people.  It is effectively a city that never sleeps and the number of people working at night or doing shift work has increased enormously in the past decade.  I saw a petition from one particular early house which was signed by taxi drivers, nurses, doctors, gardaí, retail and service staff, postal staff and other community workers.  All of those people are doing shifts or working throughout the night and are as entitled to go to a pub for some relaxation at the end of their working day as those who work from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m.Many proprietors of early houses have pointed out that the problem of the negative consequences of the misuse of alcohol and the anti-social behaviour resulting from that does not occur between the hours of 7 a.m. and 10 a.m.  The vast majority of the problems occur between 11 p.m. and 3 a.m.   While a small number of the early houses open at 7 a.m., many do not open until 10.30 a.m. because that is the nature of the business.  Very few of them engage in off-sales.  The Minister has tackled that issue in this legislation, by precluding early houses from selling off-sale alcohol before 10.30 a.m.   A lot of the early houses have a very regular clientele which has been built up over many years.These are my two main issues of concern and I am glad to see that the Minister is aware of them and has pledged to deal with them.  On the wider issue, alcohol abuse by some young people can be tackled by parental control, educational programmes and a restriction in the availability of low-cost alcohol, particularly in multinational supermarkets.  We must ensure that the existing laws are implemented.  In that context, alcohol promotions are a significant issue.  I remember a discussion some years ago regarding alcohol promotions in colleges and universities.  Alcohol companies were providing so much alcohol to clubs and societies that, in effect, the students were drinking for nothing.  The companies were sponsoring their drinking and it was worth their while to do so.  Promotions permit access to large volumes of alcohol and must be tackled.  I welcome the fact that the issue is dealt with in this Bill.The sale of large quantities of alcohol through "two for the price of one" promotions, whereby one can buy a dozen cans of a particular brand of alcohol and get another dozen free, is widespread among large multinational retailers.  They use such promotions as loss leaders to attract customers into their stores, who then buy other goods.  It has led to an enormous increase in the availability of alcohol, in terms of portability and accessibility.  These issues are being tackled in the legislation, which will lead to a reduction in the negative consequences of the misuse of alcohol.I welcome the introduction of increased powers for the Garda Síochána, which will contribute significantly to combating public disorder.  The Bill provides for gardaí to seize alcohol from individuals if they suspect them of breaching public order.  The power to seize was always a problematic issue.  The gardaí currently have the power to seize, but only under certain conditions.  This Bill strengthens the ability of the gardaí to seize alcohol from individuals they suspect of causing a problem.The Bill also includes reforms to existing licensing laws that will allow the District Court to grant special exemption orders to nightclubs, late bars and other venues, with the aim of improving safety.  The use of CCTV cameras is crucial in this area and it will be a statutory requirement for late-opening bars and nightclubs to install such equipment.  CCTV systems have proven very useful in situations where people have been hurt and indeed, were used in the course of the investigation of a murder outside a nightclub.  The use of CCTV in off-licences and retail outlets is crucial.  It can help to tackle the issue of under age drinking.  I know that some young people can appear to be older than they actually are, but retailers must ask for identification and CCTV cameras can police this.The Stardust nightclub fire is still a source of comment for many people.  Adequate fire safety in late night venues is crucial.  We have seen incidents around the world where inadequate fire safety measures in late night venues has led to many deaths.The sale of alcohol under a theatre licence will only be permitted during normal licensing hours in future.  This is part of the licensing system that was being abused by a small number of proprietors but it is being nailed down in this legislation.   An anomaly existed whereby some premises could remain open beyond normal hours without having to obtain special exemption orders.  There were approximately 91,000 applications in one year for such orders.  Again, this is all about addressing the misuse of alcohol and the consequences of misuse.  The Bill is very strong on that.  However, the Government can only go so far.  This Bill is a start in terms of combating the problems associated with alcohol misuse.There is a considerable amount of legislation in place.  While we must ensure that the legislation is adequate and effective, personal responsibility must be part of the solution.  Parents have a pivotal role in keeping younger children away from the dangers of alcohol and society has a collective role in addressing this problem.  The Minister recognised that in his few words last night.  This legislation uses a commonsense approach.  This approach, matched by individual and collective responsibility by society, will address some of the problems and make a difference to the quality of life of our citizens in our communities.
#DenisNaughten	unknown-#DenisNaughten-party	unknown-#DenisNaughten-dob	unknown-#DenisNaughten-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-06-25 00:00:00	Prelude	610	With the agreement of the House, I wish to share my time with Deputy Deenihan.I welcome the opportunity to speak on this Bill.  In principle, I welcome it.  The thrust and background to it are extremely positive.  The major issue is the direct link between the availability of alcohol and public order issues.  This Government has allowed the number of alcohol outlets to literally mushroom in recent years.  As a result, we saw a 57% rise in public order offences between 2003 and 2007.I welcome the proposals to limit the opening times of off-licences and the new powers given to the Garda Síochána to seize alcohol in public places.  One key point that consistently comes up in the report of the alcohol advisory group, which is the basis for this legislation, is the fact that the current legislation is consistently ignored by the relevant authorities.  We cannot allow the latest set of proposals enacted by this House to be forgotten by the Government in respect of resourcing the authorities to ensure that what we enact is enforced.  I have yet to see any commitment in respect of providing the resources to local authorities and the Garda Síochána to ensure that the legislation we bring forward here in this House is enacted and then enforced.I welcome the fact that the previous Minister, Deputy Brian Lenihan, addressed a loophole I had flagged in the legislation in respect of supermarket loyalty cards.  This is a positive development.  I am disappointed that this issue ignores the fundamental problem we have at the moment in respect of the availability of alcohol, namely, below-cost selling.  Nothing is being done in respect of this.What is hugely frustrating is that I was criticised by the current Government Chief Whip in respect of the concerns I raised regarding the abolition of the ban on below-cost selling.  I made the point that we should not throw the baby out with the bath water.  I was ignored at the time and it was suggested that I would stop the introduction of cheap groceries.  The exact opposite has happened.  We now have cheap alcohol and grocery prices are going through the roof.  Alcohol has been used as a loss leader in respect of getting people into supermarkets.  This legislation does not address the issue of below-cost selling.  It deals with marketing and promotion but ignores below-cost selling.  That problem is the sole responsibility of this Government and the previous Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment who introduced the legislation to remove the ban on below-cost selling without looking at the huge implications it has.Going through the legislation, it is very interesting to see some of the issues in it.  I know we will get the opportunity to deal with them in more detail on Committee Stage but I will flag a logistical problem.  A wine retailer must now get their off-licence directly from the District Court.  We all know about the backlog in the courts at the moment.  I understand that there are between 5,000 and 6,000 of these licences so it will take a significant amount of court time to deal with them.  I accept the principle of what the Minister is trying to do but surely an alternative mechanism can be found rather than tying up the courts dealing with this issue.  There are far more important things for the courts to do than deal with a wine retailer's off-licence.  Wine and its availability is not the problem with which we must deal.  It is not what is causing anti-social behaviour and under age drinking.  Surely we can have a sensible approach to that.I welcome the provision relating to CCTV systems at venues like nightclubs and late bars, which is a positive development.  Many clubs and late bars already have CCTV in place but that additional protection will not only protect the public, it will protect the individual operator who is running a good business.All Members received a considerable level of representations relating not so much to theatre licences as proposed in section 10, but to closing times and the need to have that differential between the closing times of public houses and nightclubs in place.  All of us are aware of people who, because of their profession, cannot go out on Thursday, Friday or Saturday night.  For many of them, their only social outlet is on Sunday night.  They include people who work in the pub or nightclub trade, nurses, doctors, members of the Garda Síochána and so forth.  We need to look at ensuring that the flexibility is maintained within the licensing laws in respect of this issue and that the differential remains.  I have concerns about the abolition of that and believe people who want to go out and socialise on Sunday night should be allowed to do so.  I do not see where there is any major difficulty with that in principle and I hope the Minister will look again at that issue before Committee Stage.  International practice has shown that sequential closing is important in respect of public order.  The objective behind this legislation is to improve public order.I also welcome the provision relating to test purchasing.  This is a positive development welcomed by most retailers and people.  There are implications for the young people involved which I want to see addressed on Committee Stage.  In respect of under age drinking and purchasing, I wish to focus on the issue of a national ID card.  We can talk all we like here about under age drinking but unless we are prepared to address the issue of a national ID card, we are only talking in circles.  Driver's licences have been used as national ID cards by many young people.  They can easily be forged.  When Deputy Séamus Brennan was Minister for Transport, we were promised a secure driver's licence system with credit card-type driver's licences in this jurisdiction within two years but that is still on the long finger.  The Garda ID system is also prone to being forged.  A number of nightclub owners have told me that they have come across forged copies of Garda ID cards.We have seen the situation relating to passports.  A significant number of passports go missing annually.  Many of those stolen passports are ones that are being used by young people to prove their age.  We should introduce a national ID card system.  It is somewhat hypocritical for the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to introduce a national ID card for non-Irish citizens, but for him not to be prepared to put one in place for Irish citizens.  This proposal is in the proposed new legislation on immigration.Why do we not have a system whereby anybody using false identification will be prosecuted and fined?  Currently, publicans or licence holders are prosecuted for providing alcohol to those under the legal age, but those who purport to be over the legal age are not.  The responsibility is on the licensee to prove the person has a forged ID, but the presenter of the forged ID gets away with it.  We should have a system of fines in place so that those using false ID face some penalty.  This should not just apply to under age drinking, because there is significant abuse of identification here, for example with regard to PPS numbers.  ID abuse seems to be brushed under the carpet, but I hope that on Committee Stage the Minister will bring forward some provision in this regard that will provide once and for all for a watertight national ID card system here.
#JimmyDeenihan	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-party	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-dob	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-06-25 00:00:00	Prelude	611	In the context of this Bill, I refer briefly to a report published in April that received very little attention or space in the national media.  The report in question, Alcohol Related Harm in Ireland, was produced by Dr. Ann Hope of the HSE and is a report that should be sent to every school, publican and GP.  It confirms what I said on numerous occasions here when addressing the issue of alcohol abuse.Alcohol is the third highest factor in the case of premature death and ill health in the European Union.  Alcohol consumption is linked to more than 60 diseases and conditions, affecting nearly every organ in the human body.  Some diseases are wholly caused by alcohol, such as alcoholic liver disease, alcohol dependency or alcohol poisoning.  A dose response relationship is evident between alcohol consumption and risk of harm.  In other words, the risk of harm increases with the amount of alcohol consumed.  For many conditions and diseases, the relative risk increases with the increase in the volume of alcohol consumed.  For example, there is a 13-fold increased risk of liver cirrhosis for women who drink 40 mg or more or for men who drink 60 mg or more per day.  In the case of ischaemic stroke, something the Minister of State would be aware of, low level alcohol consumption offers some protection for men and women, but high level consumption increases the risk.  There is also an increased risk of haemorrhage stroke in men, even at a low consumption level.  I recommend that this excellent report by Dr. Ann Hope be circulated widely.  It should also be discussed in Committee or in the House and it certainly can contribute much to our debate.This legislation is based on the report of the Government alcohol advisory group which was set up in January.  When the group was set up, the Minister at the time said he would implement its recommendations as soon as possible.  I recognise the action of the Minister in this regard and that this action is now being continued by the current Minister.  This is how legislation should be brought forward.  This is how it is done in America and legislation does not need to go through years of consideration before a Bill is produced.  As an aside, the heads for the Curragh of Kildare Bill were ready in 2004.  I asked a parliamentary question about that Bill today, but the response was that it will not be ready for several years yet.  There is action on the legislation before us now, which is untypical of the slow and cumbersome way we normally produce legislation here.I know Dr. Gordon Holmes well and compliment him on his approach to the Bill.  He has been involved in previous reports and has a depth of experience in the areas of legislation and alcohol abuse.  Unfortunately, however, a number of the recommendations made in his report will not be included in the Bill.  Some will and others will be changed and, perhaps, improved.  Dr. Holmes's report highlights several important statistics for people interested in this area and for decision makers.  It shows that Ireland has one of the highest levels of alcohol consumption in the European Union.  In 2006, alcohol consumption levels here were approximately 30% higher than the EU average.  This demonstrates the scale of the problem.In addition to high consumption levels, Ireland also has a particular problem with binge drinking.  It may be useful to consider binge drinking as a cultural attitude to alcohol consumption.  Going out to get drunk is considered one of the hallmarks of binge drinking, as is preloading — a term used to refer to the consumption of alcohol before going out.  Going out to get drunk is very much part of the philosophy of many of our young people, and even some older people.  Preloading has become prevalent.  Proprietors of bars and clubs would say that people come from their homes and parties already intoxicated.  Therefore, we cannot blame it all on bar owners or proprietors of other centres where people go to drink.  This Bill is designed to combat the easy availability of alcohol and I welcome that.I noticed a comment made by the chairman of the advisory group, Dr. Gordon Holmes, on the publication of the legislation.  He said he was pleased his recommendations were accepted, but was disappointed there was still no overall Government policy across all Departments.  I have called for a cross-departmental approach to this problem on several occasions.  In 1991 I produced a Private Members' Bill, the Youth Services Bill, which suggested an integrated approach to issues such as alcohol abuse.  Unfortunately, few Private Members' Bills are accepted by this House.  That was a good Bill and the approach recommended in it is now being proposed.  Then, because it was an Opposition Bill, it was not accepted.With regard to the provisions in the Bill, I welcome the additional powers given to the Garda.  I was in New York recently where I visited a policeman friend who took me into the NYPD headquarters.  He showed me around and I went out on a few working trips with him and saw for myself how the police handle situations in New York.  One cannot be seen with a bottle of alcohol on the street in New York, even if it is in a bag.  It is confiscated.  It is not tolerated.  As a result, one does not see these things anymore on the streets of Manhattan or New York.  I hope this provision will have the desired effect.  It is fine to take alcohol from somebody once but can we continue to do so?  If we do, is there an extra penalty for repeat offenders?I refer to issues not addressed by the Bill, such as alcohol retail price promotions.  We see offers for a full slab of beer free when one buys a slab.  For young people it is a badge of honour to have a slab over their shoulders.  That must stop and I hope it can be addressed by another Department.I see no reason the Garda national identification card, into which the Garda Síochána put much time and money devising, cannot be universal.  The Minister should make it mandatory.There should be mandatory training for alcohol retailers.  This has been successful in the food industry.  The standard of food hygiene was raised considerably because of that initiative and there is no reason there should not be mandatory training for alcohol retailers.I am pleased the Minister dropped the measures on early opening, for which there was no justification.  I am pleased he has introduced a voluntary code for separation.  Separation could be counterproductive for some people and put them out of business, especially those in rural areas, but those who could afford it would put larger units in their shops, and would make sure it would pay.    As a member of the committee, I will have the opportunity to address these issues again on Committee Stage.  I welcome the important debate and hope it will address the mayhem on our streets and the damage done to young people.  This is not the ultimate solution but is a step in the right direction.
#DaraCalleary	unknown-#DaraCalleary-party	unknown-#DaraCalleary-dob	unknown-#DaraCalleary-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-06-25 00:00:00	Prelude	612	I propose to share time with Deputies Lowry and Finian McGrath.  I welcome the proposals before the House from the Ministers, Deputies Brian Lenihan and Dermot Ahern.  I particularly welcome the willingness of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy Ahern, to engage with the various interest groups on whose shoulders it will fall to implement this legislation.The changes announced last night regarding retail provisions are especially welcome.  The segregation of alcohol sounds great in theory and for some retailers it would not be a problem.  However, for the majority, particularly the smaller, owner-managed retailers it presents a major problem and major expense that could not be recouped in the market conditions in which they operate.  The issue of staffing and the practical matter of not having space are also concerns.The decision to introduce the voluntary code is welcome but places the onus on the shoulders of the retailers.  I hope they will respect it, engage with it and that this House does not have take further action on it.  Having met many in recent weeks, I do not doubt that owner-managed operators would have no difficulty operating this voluntary code.  The pride in the name over the door still stands for many of them.  However, I have concerns about how the large supermarkets and multiples will engage with this voluntary code.  They have shown little regard to date for many of the issues this Bill seeks to address.  Particular vigilance is needed for that sector.I do not know if the nightclub issue is being addressed in these reforms.  Sequential opening times must be examined.  It has already been mentioned in the House as assisting public order.  It makes no sense to have every night establishment closing at the same time and everyone spilling on to the streets, often with nowhere to go, with transport not available and takeaways closed.  This will lead to public order issues.  If we can bring people out on a phased basis, particularly in large towns and cities, the prospect of public disorder is lessened.The matter of drinking-up time and the ability to play music during that time seems a small issue but is one that causes much hassle for nightclub owners.  It is a small concession to make in this context.I have been watching the debate on the monitor as well as in the House and agree with all speakers on the loyalty cards and the below cost selling of alcohol in retail outlets.  That must stop.  Whether this is an issue for the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment or the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, heads must be knocked together without delay.  Supermarkets have been using alcohol as a loss leader to get people in the door.  It is normal to see the weekly shop include crates of beer and spirits, with food following behind as a minor purchase.  That is the single greatest issue in terms of the sale of alcohol.On a walk through any park in any town where under age and illegal drinking takes place, one will come across packaging with the brand names of various supermarkets thrown there.  It is evident that the alcohol was easy to purchase and, in this day of technology, we should be able to track where these bottles and cans were purchased through a bar code system.  Tracing them to the point of purchase could provide for a further sanction against this behaviour.  We cannot stop talking about it and we must address it.Below-cost selling has become a greater issue in recent years.  We will not blame anyone for this but it must be tackled.  It is strange that we are reluctant to have national identification cards in this State, particularly for under age people.  We do not have difficulty with identification cards in the US or Australia.  As younger people on J1 visas in the US, we did not have difficulty with an under age limit of 21 years but when we talk about it in Ireland the issues of civil liberties and everything else comes into play.  We have not been able to progress the matter of national identification cards.  On this issue, the sale of alcohol particularly to under age people a national ID card is the only solution.  It could be managed by some agency and should be a card that cannot be copied or used or sold on the black market.  It is only fair to the proprietors of retail outlets, pubs and nightclubs or any undertaking involved in the sale of alcohol that we give them this protection in the battle against under age consumption of alcohol.I listened to Deputy Deenihan's comments.  The difficulty with binge drinking in Ireland is that none of us knows we are doing it.  It is considered something somebody else does.  The scientific interpretation of binge drinking shows that we all do it every weekend but we do not know we are doing it.  There must be an aggressive discussion on the fact that the normal weekend out qualifies as binge drinking.  Then, people might examine their own behaviour.I commend the Bill and welcome the engagement between the Minister and the interest groups.  There will be further discussion on Committee Stage on other matters.  This should be seen as the first step on a full scale assault on the sale of alcohol, the misuse of alcohol and the others issues concerning alcohol that are doing so much damage to our country.
#MichaelLowry	unknown-#MichaelLowry-party	unknown-#MichaelLowry-dob	unknown-#MichaelLowry-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-06-25 00:00:00	Prelude	613	I welcome the strong political support for this Bill to curb intoxicating liquor consumption.  I note strong support from civil society, including the alcohol industry itself, which recognises that such legislation is long overdue.  I hope the time spent debating the Bill will be used wisely to iron out any deficiencies and to ensure that the Bill results in maximum effectiveness in combating alcohol abuse in Ireland.It is now generally accepted that there is a compelling case in the context of public health and public safety to limit the widespread availability of alcohol.  The onus is on Government to protect the common good of the citizens by legislating in a responsible way.  This Bill is a step in the right direction.  It is vital that we as legislators ensure this Bill is successful in addressing the problems and does not create unnecessary and inconvenient burdens on business and society without having real results.The Government established the alcohol advisory group in January.  The group was able to draw on a considerable level of knowledge and expertise in the course of its work.  The group speedily came up with a thorough and useful report but I must note the distinct lack of inclusion of stakeholders in society, from industry and ordinary people, who might have also had something to contribute to the report.As a nation, we have an unhealthy relationship with alcohol and the statistics stemming from this relationship are stark and undeniable.  Of those involved in murder or manslaughter, 46% were intoxicated at the time of their crimes.  Drunkenness was a factor in more than one third of all fatal crashes.  The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy Dermot Ahern, recently outlined CSO figures for the past four years showing a 57% rise in public order offences; a 26% rise in assaults; and a 30% rise in four categories of assault.  We must question the role of alcohol in this shocking increase in public order adult offences in recent years.A survey by IBEC reported that alcohol and alcohol-related illnesses were cited by 12% of companies as a cause of short-term absences from work for males and by 4% for women.  Excessive alcohol consumption was present in a quarter of severe domestic abuse cases.From my perspective of serving the people of North Tipperary, it is clear that alcohol use and abuse among young people needs to be strongly challenged and confronted.  In this context I welcome the initiatives in the Bill whereby a garda may seek an explanation from young persons under 18 years of age in possession of alcohol and if not satisfied with the reply the garda may seize the alcohol.Only 96 prosecutions were taken in five years against off-licences, shops, pubs and restaurants for illegally supplying alcohol to those under 18 years of age.  It is hoped the introduction of frequent test purchasing of alcohol products applying to both on-licences and off-licences will weed out and severely punish offenders.I am happy with reasonable restrictions on the advertising and marketing of alcohol to young people.  The alcohol industry has been very good at associating its brands with successful and sought after lifestyles that have proven to be attractive to young people.  It is also frightening to read that the 2006 national study of health behaviour in school-aged children found that half of those aged between 15 and 17 years reported being drinkers and more than one third reported having been "really drunk" in the previous 30 days.  It begs that question, "What about parental responsibility?".  This is one area not addressed in the Bill.Aspects of the Bill designed to deal with persons of any age involved in nuisance and who are in possession of alcohol in a place other than a place used as a private dwelling are also welcome.  I hope this is used successfully in conjunction with existing public order legislation to provide substantial powers to any garda attempting to curtail a person with alcohol causing a nuisance or annoyance to others, or where there is likely to be a danger to persons or property or a breach of the peace.  The real benefit of the new powers is that they will permit early intervention by the Garda and will help to prevent offences taking place.  I hope these new powers are wielded responsibly and for the public good by the hard-working members of our Garda force.From my perspective in North Tipperary, it is remarkable and regrettable that the traditional public house as we know it, which for generations has provided a controlled and safe environment for people to have a social drink, has gone into serious decline.  The pub sector has been decimated with approximately 1,000 public houses closed in the past three years.  This is worrying when statistics show that alcohol consumption is increasing and the role of the controlled environment of the public house is diminishing.  The balance is shifting towards the unregulated area of private drinking and for me this is a concern from both social and health perspectives.Regarding retailers, I welcome the recent consultation by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy Dermot Ahern, with stakeholders in the area and his announcement last night that he is now well disposed to deferring implementation of section 8.  It is common sense that if independent verification of compliance were to show that the code is being implemented effectively throughout the country and achieving its objectives through structural separation, it will not be necessary to commence the enforcement of section 8.If one manages a convenience store, there is nothing convenient about being required to queue for a second time to purchase a bottle of wine.  It is a significant and costly imposition to require a small trader to reconfigure his mixed trading premises so that alcohol sales are not only separated from other sales but that a barrier is erected, thus requiring dedicated staff.  I cannot see the purpose of this part of the legislation and I welcome the Minister's recent common sense comments on the issue.I am also pleased to note that the Bill includes a new statutory requirement to have a CCTV system in place in premises such as nightclubs and late bars.  It is hoped this will curtail offences and identify any perpetrators of offences at these venues.
#FinianMcGrath	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-party	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-dob	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-06-25 00:00:00	Prelude	614	I thank the Acting Chairman for the opportunity to speak on the Intoxicating Liquor Bill 2008.  This is an important debate and it is right and proper that we examine alcohol and the sale of alcohol in a calm and measured way.  Any State reaction is not the way forward.  I am not in the blame game and we need to focus on how we can resolve the issue.  Blaming shopkeepers and retailers is not the way forward.I spent recent weeks meeting and listening to people and staff involved in the trade, which I found worthwhile.  I met Gus O'Hara from Vernon Avenue in Clontarf, Lil Courtney from Fairview and Derek Moran, all of whom are involved in the trade.  They put forward sensible solutions and constructive ideas.  I lobbied the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform and I am delighted he listened to the common-sense ideas and the proposals included in the legislation.  I commend him for this.  He took the bull by the horns and listened.  He has taken these ideas on board in the legislation.  This is a common sense way to deal with the Bill.When one examines the detail of the legislation one sees the key points regarding alcohol abuse.  Community based retailers, for example Centra and Spar, strongly support many of the measures in the Bill.  They fully understand the role we must play in the responsible sale of alcohol.It is important that we reinforce the good points in the legislation.  The positive aspects of the Bill are the curtailment of opening hours, the strengthening of temporary closure orders, an increase in fines, the introduction of test purchasing by the Garda Síochána and the introduction of CCTV.  It is important that we realise many members of staff already implement these measures.The areas of concern in the legislation and the wider debate include the proposal that in small stores where separation is not possible, alcohol products can be displayed and sold only from behind a counter.  This will be extremely difficult to implement due to space and staff constraints.  It will be costly and time-consuming for many small shopkeepers.  Staffing the alcohol till will incur additional ongoing staffing costs.  These issues have been raised with the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform and it is important to recognise that he took these views on board and is dealing with the matter in the Bill.These issues should be seriously examined which is why I welcome the positive aspects of the Minister's response.  Let us examine good practice in other countries.  Why do they not have binge drinking in France?  This is an area we could examine closely.  I have been in France many times and have met many teenagers on social occasions.  Not one incident have I witnessed of binge drinking or alcohol abuse.  We can learn from other countries and ask ourselves questions.It is important to introduce health and education angles to the debate on alcohol.  This is a public health issue.  I welcome the fact that Dublin North Central counselling services have received €144,250 in extra funding during the past three or four days.  I particularly welcome the funding for the Northside Counselling Service of €102,000, for Doras Buí of €38,000 and the other grants provided to Dublin North Central.  These will enable groups to work with children and families through difficult and traumatic times.I welcome the debate, as there are many positive aspects to the Bill.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-06-25 00:00:00	Prelude	615	I am glad to have the opportunity, on behalf of the Labour Party, to express our support for the Bill tabled by Deputy Shatter and Fine Gael.  We would like a number of issues included on Committee Stage but the Labour Party has no reservation about supporting the thrust of the legislation.  It is not just a perception that victims are the forgotten people of the criminal justice system.  Having read Deputy Shatter's contribution last night and having examined the Bill, it is evident a great deal of work went into its preparation to tackle the deficit in which victims of crime find themselves.  I am reminded of a case on my desk, unfortunately, involving a loss of life and I can testify to the difference it makes when investigating gardaí maintain contact and communication with the deceased's family.Generally, in my experience, victims are not kept informed of progress while a crime is being investigated.  Why should gardaí not be required to maintain adequate contact through identified liaison officers with victims of crime and to keep them up to date in so far as they can on the progress of the investigation?  I would like a victims' compensation fund to be established where compensation could be awarded to victims of crime outside of the normal expenses against which individuals and businesses may be insured.  The expenses of the fund could be met by the equivalent amount collected in fines imposed on offenders.Only yesterday, I received an e-mail from the organisation, AdVIC, detailing its efforts to obtain a meeting with the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform.  It would like to discuss important issues, including victim impact statements, article 10 of the criminal injuries compensation tribunal, defence post mortem examination and non-statutory sentencing guidelines.  The organisation has been unable to secure the ear of the Minister.  I am reminded of our discovery last night during the debate on the Intoxicating Liquor Bill 2008.  The same Minister was able to set aside last Friday in a Dublin hotel to hear the views of licensed vintners, retailers and other interest groups, arising from which he dropped sections of that Bill.  If he can find a day to set aside to meet the publicans of Ireland — fine, upstanding men they all are — it is remarkable that he cannot find an hour in his diary to meet representatives of the victims of crime.I welcome recent improvements in the responsiveness of the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions to victims of crime.  Subject to obvious constraints, I would like that channel of communication to be enhanced.  The DPP has opened a sensitive debate touching on some of these issues and, provided we make haste slowly, the outcome might provide comfort for victims of crime.  It could be argued about the more central role being accorded victims in the legislation that most of the entitlements could be conferred administratively but, in our adversarial system of justice, crime victims are the forgotten people.  The merit of the Bill is that the recognition of victims will have a basis in statute, a right to be heard and it should bring more openness to the process.It is not possible in my experience to overemphasise the importance of information to persons who find themselves in the role of victims.  It is right that the Bill imposes obligations on State agencies such as the Garda, Courts Service, HSE and others.  Victims should be advised of what assistance is available to them and how that can be accessed.  The courts process can be a mystery and it can be intimidating for victims, most of whom will not have seen the inside of a courtroom in their lives but they have suffered hurt, isolation and trauma.  I know some of the outstanding persons who have given voluntarily of their time to advocate the cause of victims and their efforts in the past have frequently fallen on stony soil.If Deputy Shatter's Bill achieves no more than embarrassing the Government into action, it will have been worthwhile.  However, I fail to see the need to reinvent the wheel.  Why not allow this Bill proceed to Committee Stage where the Government can amend it as it sees fit?  That would not obviate the necessity for a victims of crime consultative forum, which could run parallel to the progress of this legislation.I was amazed to discover the amount of the Minister's contribution to the debate taken up detailing the supposed defects of the Fine Gael Bill and explaining the merits of his own initiative when we do not have anything tangible to go on at all yet.  It is a revelation into a very interesting mindset that so much of his script is taken up with an attitude of "Mine is bigger than yours".  I have read the Bill.  I have not spoken to Deputy Shatter about it and I do not know how he compiled it but I find the partisan controversy created by the Minister very odd.  I would love to know the author of the sentence, "Bootlegged Bills do not work", in his script.  I would not like to go through our Statute Book in too much detail if that is the case.  Why does the Minister have to devote his time to allegations about whether Deputy Shatter googled the Bill?  The Deputy can speak for himself but I am long enough in the House to know he was drafting Private Members' Bills before we ever heard of Google or the Internet.I am puzzled — I shadow him — as to whether this Minister will continue as he has started.  He has a difficult job and it will be more difficult if he seeks to kick the Opposition every time he passes.  We have a Bill for all to read and study tabled by Deputy Shatter and a speech and a press conference from the Minister responsible and a promise that next spring the buds of a new Bill will emerge.  Maybe they will and there are some good things in the script.  For the life of me, I do not see why we should not assent to passing Deputy Shatter's Bill onto Committee Stage where the Government could make its input in the interests of victims of crime and we could tease out the issues.  The Government has the resources and the victims have the need.  The former should engage on Committee Stage so that the House can produce a better Bill in the interests of the latter.

#DaraCalleary	unknown-#DaraCalleary-party	unknown-#DaraCalleary-dob	unknown-#DaraCalleary-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-06-25 00:00:00	Prelude	617	I welcome this debate and the fact that victims will finally be given a chance in our adversarial justice system to have their say.  I welcome the Minister's proposals, two of which I will focus on, namely, the reform of the law in respect of victim impact statements and the additional protection afforded victims at the pre-trial stage.The role of victim impact statements has grasped the public's imagination in recent years.  We all recall one instance, the effect of which was to place victim impact statements in the public's consciousness in a manner it had not been previously.  The Minister proposes to address the difficulties and inconsistencies in respect of those statements by broadening their scope so that the impact on victims' families and friends and other issues can be considered.  I welcome that the discretionary element will also be regulated so that victims need not depend on the good will of presiding judges.With the exception of high-profile media cases, only when people hear victim impact statements do they realise what has occurred and what the impacts of crime, beyond traditional feelings in this respect, have been on victims' families, work lives, health and ability to live.  For this reason, we should allow the statements to be used in a greater fashion and far greater weight to be given to them in terms of sentencing and the post-case process.  I welcome the Minister's proposal to amend the law to permit those directly affected to give evidence at sentencing and to empower courts to prohibit the broadcasting of same, as the latter has affected the fairness of justice at times.The fact that we must introduce legislation to protect victims at pre-trial stage is worrying.  In recent years, this has become a significant issue.  The intimidation of victims and their family members and witnesses generally at the pre-trial stage is causing them considerable fear and has the potential to discourage them from providing evidence.  The protections outlined by the Minister in this respect are necessary and should be the subject of considerable discussion.  For this reason, I welcome the Minister's plans for a debate in advance on his Bill.I welcome the Minister's decision to base many of his proposals on the recommendations of the Balance in Criminal Law Review Group, which comprised experts on the criminal system and had the ability to consider this matter without political pressure being placed on it.  Those people stood back to consider the system's difficulties, international best practice and how to enshrine victims' voices and rights further in our justice system.Since the State's foundation, the focus of 99% of criminal legislation has been on prosecutors or defendants.  I welcome the Minister's willingness to introduce a Bill next spring and to resource an office in his Department to address victims' concerns and to co-ordinate all of the good work that occurs in victims groups.  In this way, the work to set matters on a statutory footing can get under way without a significant delay.  For too long, Deputies have bemoaned the House's lack of powers and statutory agencies' lack of responsibility.  By placing matters on this level, the Minister will be in control and answerable to the House in respect of his work on behalf of victims.I hope that the forthcoming debate will be constructive and address all types of international practice.  Deputy Shatter is more than entitled to go to New Zealand if he so wishes.  That is the joy of a democracy and he should not be criticised.  However, we need a legislative system that places victims on a par with everyone else in the system.
#PatTheCope	unknown-#PatTheCope-party	unknown-#PatTheCope-dob	unknown-#PatTheCope-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-06-25 00:00:00	Prelude	618	Tá áthas orm deis a fháil labhairt san díospóireacht fíor-thábhachtach seo.  Léigh mé an méid a bhí ag an Aire Dlí agus Cirt, Comhionannais agus Athchóirithe Dlí, An Teachta Dermot Ahern, sa Teach aréir agus molaim go mór na moltaí atá aige maidir leis an cheist seo.I welcome the opportunity to participate in this important debate.  I welcome the Minister's confirmation of his introduction next spring of a substantial package of proposals.  They will be of benefit to the victims of crime because they will reform the law relating to victim impact statements and introduce exceptional measures to allow cases to be re-opened, subject to appropriate safeguards.  The package will introduce measures to restrict unjustified and vexatious imputations at trial against the character of the deceased or incapacitated victim or witness.  They will facilitate additional protection for victims on pre-trial stage as referred to by my colleague, Deputy Calleary.  I am pleased to note that the package will include the provision of any necessary statutory protection that will facilitate the DPP's intention to alter his practice of not giving reasons to victims for decisions not to prosecute.Currently, victim impact statements set out how incidents affected the victims or their families.  The victim is not legally represented at the trial.  Rather, the Garda prosecutes the defendant on behalf of the victim.  The only part played by the victim or his or her family is to make the statement and to give evidence to the prosecution or by way of direct evidence.  The victim impact statement is read by the presiding judge, who may or may not take it into consideration.I will refer to the Minister's planned legislative package for victims.  His dual approach — legislation and administrative measures — is to be applauded, as it will improve a victim's experience of the criminal justice system.  How many victims entering courts have knowledge of the system?  The approach will assist them in holding the perpetrators of serious offences to account for their actions.  This is not just of interest to victims, but to the wider community.  The Minister's approach will achieve this without involving the criminal justice agencies in the bureaucratic nightmare that would result from the House's acceptance of Fine Gael's Bill, the New Zealand Victims' Rights Act 2002.If we compare New Zealand's Victims' Rights Act 2002 with the Bill introduced by Deputy Shatter, who has had the distinction of having had some Bills agreed on Second Stage, we certainly cannot agree this Bill because most of the sections are similar, exactly the same or have a great deal in common——

It is important to understand the complexities of this issue.  Such complexities were emphasised in correspondence from the Irish Council for Civil Liberties which we all received today.  The correspondence states that in a better deal the Irish Council for Civil Liberties offers constructive alternatives designed to genuinely enhance respect for the human rights of victims in the criminal justice system.  I record that because it is important to acknowledge that is the type of representations we have received.I listened to all the contributions and will continue to do so.  I will not repeat some of the points that were made.  It is important to emphasise our strong support for the victims of crime.  Many people in all communities have been victims of crime; we have all encountered elements of crime.  It is important the Minister understands the need to deal with these issues.Some Members will know I am from Tallaght.  A parent from Tallaght has campaigned for justice for the past 15 years.  The Ceann Comhairle will be aware of this case because he was kind enough to look at this file when he was Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform.  This man's son, Kevin Reilly, died as a result of being stabbed and his father did not feel he got justice.  This case emphasises the need for victims of crime to believe that the Government and its agencies support them.  It is important to make that point.Provision is made for a victim support unit in the court house in Tallaght, the provision of which is important.  I have campaigned strongly in recent times for the redevelopment of the Garda station in Tallaght.  I have been told that when it is redeveloped it will also include a new court house.  I hope the Minister will convey to his senior Minister that I am strongly of the view that in all such facilities, and certainly in those in my constituency, proper provision should be made for a safe place where victims of crime can talk to counsellors.  Many improvements have been made in recent times with gardaí reaching out to crime victims, corresponding with them are making an attempt to tell them what is going on.  It is important that should happen in all communities.I wish the Minister, Deputy Dermot Ahern, well.  It is important he knows that he has support across the House for the work he is doing.  I am sure even those who give out about him sometimes will understand the great work he is doing.  His dual approach of legislative and administrative measures will improve victims' experience of the criminal justice system and will assist in holding the perpetrators of serious offences to account for their actions, something that is of interest not only to victims but to the community in general.  The Minister's approach will achieve this and will do so without involving the criminal justice agencies in the bureaucratic nightmare that would result if this House were to accept other proposals.Reference has been made and no doubt will made later in the debate to the restorative justice initiative.  I am proud that such a project has been based in Tallaght under the leadership of Mr. Peter Keeley, a local man who became involved in that initiative.  The Ceann Comhairle took an particular interest in this initiative when he was Minister.  Judge McDonald has also been very supportive.  When I was a member of the Joint Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women's Rights, I made the point that this initiative should be rolled out to other areas; I am sure I would have the support of Deputy Shatter on that point.  It is important we understand that when it was established in March 2007 it was an attempt to deal with victims of crime and those who committed crimes in a different way.  I hope that as we continue to seek innovative ways to deal with crime, that the restorative justice initiative will receive the funding it requires and will rolled out to the rest of the country because it is important we do that.I appreciate the short time the Chair has allowed me to make this contribution.  I look forward to supporting the Minister.  Having regard to the points made from the Opposition benches, we now have serious proposals for legislation.  People are entitled to make their political points, with which I have no problem.  I wish them well as they go about that business.  It is important for communities and for victims of crime that this legislation, when it is properly introduced, will be passed.  I look forward to supporting such legislation.
#MichaelMcGrath	unknown-#MichaelMcGrath-party	unknown-#MichaelMcGrath-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcGrath-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-06-25 00:00:00	Prelude	632	I very much welcome this opportunity to speak on this Bill proposed by Fine Gael during Private Members' time.  I wish to make a number of main points which are relevant to the debate.There is a need for a serious rebalancing of rights in the criminal justice system away from the criminal and in favour of the victim.  That should be our starting point and the central point of the debate on some of the detailed proposals made by Fine Gael Members and by the Minister in his announcement last week.The principal right that victims should have is for the perpetrator of a crime against them on conviction to be given a fair and just sentence appropriate to the crime he or she has committed.  In my view and in the view of many victims too often that is not the case and sentences do not match the severity of the crime that has been perpetrated.  When victims see criminals with multiple previous convictions for serious crimes receiving suspended or very short sentences, many of them lose faith in the criminal justice system.  It is not the function of this House to determine sentencing policy except where legislation provides for minimum, maximum or mandatory sentences in certain cases.  I feel compelled to make that point because many victims' dissatisfaction with the criminal justice system lies in the sentences being handed down by the Judiciary.I welcome very much the Minister's justice for victims initiative, which he announced last week and which I genuinely believe is a more comprehensive, reforming and far-reaching response to the needs of the victims of crime than the Bill before us.  No political party has a monopoly on concern for the rights of victims, whether it be Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael or any other party.  It is open to any party in our democracy to put forward proposals for victims' rights.  Fine Gael has tabled this Bill, the Minister outlined his detailed proposals last week and the House will decide on the Bill tonight.I support very much the Minister's proposal to introduce a substantial legislative reform package next spring based on the 2007 report of the balance in the criminal law group, also known as the Hogan report.  Many of the initiatives that are required urgently to assist victims can be implemented without legislation and may proceed now.  That is the route we should follow.The administrative package the Minister is proposing, in line with the Commission for the Support of Victims of Crime's framework document, will be implemented prior to legislation, including the new executive office in the Department to support crime victims, the reconstituted Commission for the Support of Victims of Crime and the victims of crime consultative forum.The Minister's proposal to end double jeopardy makes eminent sense, particularly where evidence emerges of interference in the trial process or where new evidence can emerge a number of years subsequent to a trial, which changes the whole interpretation of the evidence that was put before a trial.  We have seen the emergence of DNA technology and the improvement in the assessment of evidence and we should incorporate that into the trial process.I welcome also the victim impact statement reform that the Minister will introduce and the right of a next-of-kin in homicide cases, for example, to issue a victim impact statement as part of the trial.  Victims should be given more information before their case is even sent to the Director of Public Prosecutions.  As Deputy Rabbitte argued earlier, more information must be provided to victims while crimes are being investigated and before they reach court.  People find it frustrating when they report a crime and cannot subsequently obtain any information on the processing of their complaint.  This issue must be addressed.  I agree with Deputy O'Connor's remarks on the National Commission on Restorative Justice, which will report next year.  Restorative justice is an evolving area which we must examine closely.  I look forward to a comprehensive debate on penal reform.As legislators, we would be perpetrating an injustice towards victims if we approved an incomplete and inadequate response to their needs, as represented by this Bill.
#SeanConnick	unknown-#SeanConnick-party	unknown-#SeanConnick-dob	unknown-#SeanConnick-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-06-25 00:00:00	Prelude	633	I welcome the justice for victims initiative recently announced by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy Dermot Ahern.  The Minister gave a comprehensive outline of his proposals to the House last night.  These proposals mark a radical change in the way in which victims of crime interact with the criminal justice system.  It is significant that the justice for victims initiative will comprise a mixture of legislative and administrative proposals.  This approach of offering both legislative and administrative change is a pragmatic response to the needs of victims of crime and will avoid the bureaucratic difficulties that might arise if the legislative proposals placed before the House by Fine Gael were accepted.In recent days, victim support agencies have lobbied Members on all sides of the House to express their concerns regarding proposed victims' rights legislation.  Victims of crime and the support agencies which assist them through their trauma should be reassured that the justice for victims initiative will be based in large measure on the recommendations of the balance in the criminal law review group, chaired by Dr. Gerard Hogan.  With representatives of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, the Office of the Attorney General, the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions and the legal academic community, this group also included a representative from the Commission for the Support of Victims of Crime.The report of the Hogan group, and the subsequent proposals adopted from it, are based exclusively on the needs of the victims of crime in an Irish legal context.  Likewise, the justice for victims initiative is framed solely in the context of current deficiencies in the Irish legal system rather than being presented as a solution possibly based on another country's laws.  The initiative is based on the experience of victims of crime in Ireland.  I commend Dr. Hogan and the other members of his review group on their report.  Their findings will have a lasting effect on victims of crime when they are implemented through the justice for victims initiative.Unfortunately, many of us will be a victim of crime at some point.  There is no doubt that crime has a lasting physical and psychological effect on the victim and his or her family and friends.  The justice for victims initiative is not the first programme to be implemented by the Government in support of victims of crime.  In the last year alone, the Minister, Deputy Dermot Ahern, and his predecessor in the justice portfolio, the Minister for Finance, Deputy Brian Lenihan, established the anti-human trafficking unit to provide support for the victims of human trafficking, Cosc, to provide support to victims of domestic violence, and the National Commission on Restorative Justice, which is studying the possible introduction of a victim-focused restorative justice scheme.  A former Fine Gael Minister for Justice, Ms Nora Owen, who is now a member of the Commission for the Support of Victims of Crime, acknowledged this morning that the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform is making strong progress in accepting the recommendations of the commission and expressed support for his decision to establish an executive office in his Department to support victims of crime.The House has two choices when it comes to implementing proposals to support victims of crime.  We can adopt the Fine Gael proposals before us, the majority of which may have been drafted in response to the needs of victims of crime in other jurisdictions.  These proposals will only serve to add to the levels of bureaucracy already faced by agencies and bodies working in the criminal justice system.  Alternatively, we can wait some months until the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform is in a position to present the full details of his victims of crime initiative to the House.That initiative is based on the best advice available regarding victims of crime in an Irish context.  The findings of the Hogan report, on which the Minister's initiative is largely based, were fully informed by the needs of Irish victims of crime and identified the areas where support services must be improved.  The Minister's proposal to introduce the victims of crime initiative through a combination of legislation and administrative change will avoid the additional layers of bureaucracy which the Fine Gael proposals might bring.  The Minister will be in a position to place his legislative proposals before the House in early 2009.  We should avoid adopting the hastily put together proposals currently before the House and instead afford the Minister the opportunity to present his legislation.
#MichaelKennedy	unknown-#MichaelKennedy-party	unknown-#MichaelKennedy-dob	unknown-#MichaelKennedy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-06-25 00:00:00	Prelude	634	I welcome the opportunity to contribute to this debate.  I echo my colleagues' comments on the sentiment behind this Fine Gael Bill.  Whatever the difference of opinion on either side of the House as to the best way to approach the provision of victims' rights, we are all agreed that victims of crime deserve to be protected in the best way possible.  We all seek to achieve the same end, which is to improve the position of victims of crime within our judicial system and in line with our Constitution.Thankfully, so far as I am aware, few Members have been the victim of serious crime, but we can all appreciate the hurt, trauma and terror experienced by those who have.  However, I share the Minister's view that while admirable in its intentions, the Fine Gael Bill is not sufficient to deal with this serious issue.  Nor, in some cases, is it appropriate.  When compared with the Government's legislative proposals as contained in the justice for victims initiative, this Bill pales in its failure to advance appropriately far-reaching and practical changes.  This was illustrated in 2002 when the same Bill was struck out, only to be replaced by this minimally amended version.I urge Members to await the legislation being drafted by the Government, which will be introduced next spring.  The legislative proposals arising from the framework document prepared by the balance in the criminal law review group, including the proposal to create a victims of crime consultative forum, are far more comprehensive than those before us.  The increased rights proposed in the Government's legislative proposals balance the needs of the victim without interfering with the fairness of the trial process to which the accused is entitled.The report of the balance in the criminal law review group includes the following proposals: to reform the victim impact statement system and to extend it to families of victims of homicide and those affected by the offence; to empower the courts to prohibit the broadcasting or publication of statements deemed to be inappropriate; and to allow for the reopening of acquittal cases where the acquittal arises from mistakes made during trial by the judge.  The report also proposes the provision of greater powers to protect victims at pre-trial stage, with judges being empowered to order the accused to refrain from contacting the victim and his or her family, thus preventing any possibility of intimidation or interference.  We are all aware of recent high profile cases in which that type of intimidation occurred.Further consideration is being given to extending the scope of victim impact statements.  However, I agree it is safer to await the Law Reform Commission's deliberations in this regard.  In addition to the newly reconstituted Commission for the Support of Victims of Crime, there is provision in the Government's upcoming Bill to establish two new organisations.  A new executive office within the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform will administer and distribute funding to interest groups, as well as contributing to strategy in regard to crime victims.  In addition, a victims of crime consultative forum will liaise with the commission and represent victims' interests.The proposed Government Bill is far more wide-reaching and appropriate than the Bill before us.  Moreover, the Fine Gael Bill is completely inappropriate in parts.  I refer specifically to the provisions relating to the Director of Public Prosecutions, namely, the proposal that the DPP must inform the victim before accepting a lesser plea and explain the reasons for doing so, and the proposal that the DPP must consult with victims before granting bail.  I do not have time to deal with all the main elements of the Fine Gael proposal.  I reiterate that the Government proposals are far more wide-reaching and should be supported.

#LucindaCreighton	unknown-#LucindaCreighton-party	unknown-#LucindaCreighton-dob	unknown-#LucindaCreighton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-06-25 00:00:00	Prelude	636	I am astounded by the comments I have heard from the Government benches in the past few minutes.There is a strong perception, which is reflected in reality, that criminals have more rights under the current criminal justice system than victims.  While that is incorrect, it is certainly the perception.  What is great about the legislation before the House is that we are trying to address that issue and put forward constructive proposals and solutions.I commend my colleague, Deputy Shatter, on the substantial amount of work he has done in putting together the comprehensive legislation before the House.  We have no proposals from the Government.  I am amused to listen to Deputies speak about proposed Government legislation which has not been written or published and which, clearly, they have not read.  It is ludicrous.  The legislation we are discussing, in case they need reminding, has been proposed and published by the Fine Gael Party.  The Government has no proposals for victims' rights legislation, and there is no prospect of it in the immediate future.  Let us get real about this debate.The Fine Gael Party has put forward a comprehensive Bill, drafted by Deputy Shatter.  It is a substantial Bill that merits serious consideration.  The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, seems to be opposed to the recognition of victims' rights or, if he is not, he is opposed to any substantial recognition of victims' rights.  That is unfortunate.  He is unnecessarily opposing the Bill.  Our legislation would give victims substantial rights and restore dignity to them — which is extremely important — dignity that is not afforded to them by the criminal justice system.The only commitment to date is that the Minister has promised that he will sometime, perhaps next year, introduce legislation which would confer a statutory right on bereaved family members of a homicide victim to make a victim impact statement.  That is the only commitment and we do not know if or when it will become a reality.  That proposal is identical to that contained in the Fine Gael Bill.  It is unfortunate that appears to be the only aspect of our Bill the Minister has accepted.  It would appear he has ruled out a whole raft of other concrete and positive suggestions put forward by the Fine Gael Party.  If one looks at that proposal in isolation, it means that a tiny minority of victims would benefit from the legislation, but the vast majority of victims would not benefit from any additional protections, if the Minister has his way.  That would be unfortunate.It appears the Minister is opposed to the substantial reforms proposed by Fine Gael.  For example, we propose an independent commission for victims of crime, an important step, and that victims be furnished with victim impact statements before sentencing for all offences, not just for a few.  That is central to this debate and a point to which none of the Deputies on the other side has referred.I will not go through all the proposals contained in the Bill.  Some of them are particularly significant, for example, the obligation to keep victims informed at all stages of a criminal prosecution.  I practised for a short time as a barrister.  Victims of crime depend on what they are told by their barrister so it depends on the quality of the barrister.  There is no legal obligation on the DPP or anybody else to keep victims informed as the case proceeds.  This is alienating and leads to fear, isolation and a strong belief that victims are not catered for at the heart of the criminal justice system.The reality is that if Fianna Fáil was serious about addressing victims' rights, it would support the Bill, instead of doing the political thing.  As I said at the outset, this is not just a matter of rights for victims, but a fundamental matter of dignity for victims of crime.
#OlwynEnrightFG	unknown-#OlwynEnrightFG-party	unknown-#OlwynEnrightFG-dob	unknown-#OlwynEnrightFG-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-06-25 00:00:00	Prelude	637	I welcome the opportunity to contribute to this debate and thank my colleagues, Deputies Alan Shatter and Charles Flanagan, for bringing it forward.As the time available is short, I will concentrate on the impact of these proposals on the immediate victim of crime, the person against whom the crime is perpetrated, rather than on the families of the victims, which has been dealt with well by my colleagues.Sadly, the reality is that many survivors or victims who engage with the criminal justice system suffer either repeat trauma or what is often described as a secondary trauma — in other words, how they are treated by the State and its agents retraumatises them or, as some victims have said, can be worse than the original offence.The way in which our adversarial system works is that the victim is outside the process.  While many gardaí make an attempt to keep victims updated on the progression of cases, this does not always happen.  In my experience as a Deputy, I have often been approached by either a victim or their families to try to ascertain where a case against an alleged attacker is at in the criminal justice system.  This should not be how the system works.  Frequently, there have been long delays which have not always been adequately explained to the victim, or prosecutions have not been taken or proceeded without adequate explanation being given.  There have been instances where victims, family members and witnesses are in court but the case is not heard and no explanation is offered.  Effectively, the victim becomes just another witness when the case eventually reaches court and the trauma they suffer in the meantime is ignored.It is possible to deliver a systematic rights-based response, which becomes part of the healing process rather than of the continuation of the trauma and harm, and the Bill attempts to offer a solution in this area.  Many aspects of the Bill would have a very positive impact on victims and their basic rights, such as the right to clear and detailed information about the process, how the case is progressing, the hearing dates, the reason for delays, why cases are not being heard, when the case is expected to be heard, etc.  Those involved in the criminal justice system on a daily basis are used to cancellations and cases on lists not being reached, but those with no experience of the system can find this particularly traumatic.We should remember that the victim arrives in court, usually without legal representation, whereas the perpetrator will have his or her legal team, comprising a solicitor and a barrister.  Frequently, the victim is alone.  The right to be informed of the identify of the garda primarily responsible for investigating the offence and to have communication with that person is extremely important.  There is also the right to be informed as to the appropriate health, social or other services.  In this regard, I refer to the Government commitment given last year to develop a sexual assault treatment unit in the midlands.  Women in the midlands, in addition to suffering the trauma of being sexually assaulted or raped, often have to travel as far as Dublin in soiled, dirty and torn clothes for investigation and to receive treatment at one of the units in Dublin because of the lack of availability of such a unit in the midlands, west and other parts of the country.  This is not covered by the Bill but it highlights the need for courtesy and compassion and to ensure that the dignity and privacy of victims is respected and protected.  The lack of progress in delivering such units shows the lack of urgency with which the Government views this issue.I wish to outline a typical case study so that Deputies and the public view this from the perspective of the victim and are aware of the situation.  In the absence of Deputy Shatter's Bill and in the absence of a far more wide-ranging and appropriate Bill that has yet to materialise, this is what a victim of sexual assault is likely to go through.A victim will arrive at a Garda station and disclose what happened to him or her, often in a public area and to an officer who may not have previous experience of sexual violence and could be uncomfortable.  A statement will be made in a room designed to interview criminals, if a room is even available.  After that he or she may undergo a forensic examination, either in a non-specialised unit or have to travel to a location where a specialised unit is available.  The victim will return home and wait for news.  The victim may not know the name of the garda dealing with his or her case because there is no protocol for the garda to keep the victim informed of progress.  No one will tell the victim he or she has a right to get a copy of the statement and no one will send it to him or her.  Likewise, no one will inform him or her of what to expect from the legal process, nor of what services or supports are available.  A victim may contact the Garda station, but the garda to whom he or she needs to speak may not be present and any number of calls may be required.  A victim may not know that the accused has been picked up and interviewed, despite having told the Garda of his or her fears of a response from the accused once he or she knows that the case has been reported.  He or she may then be harassed by the accused or his or her supporters.  In response to a call to the station the Garda may send a marked car to the victim's house making the community aware that something is going on, and that could continue for months as the victim waits, while his or her anxiety builds.  In some cases that can lead to depression.  Some 50% of survivors of penetrative abuse or attempted penetrative abuse take anti-depressant medication and 17% become psychiatric hospital inpatients at some point.  He or she may bump into an acquaintance of the accused up to two years after the statement — the average time between first arrest and return for trial is 118 weeks — and hear that the accused's legal team has informed him or her that the case has been dropped.  On contacting the Garda, he or she may be told the DPP has advised that the case will not proceed but give no reason for that.  We should remember that the DPP does not proceed with six out of every ten cases of sexual violence.  That example has been provided to me by the Rape Crisis Network and it is something which I have heard from victims myself.  Are Members of the House comfortable with the idea of waiting until the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, who has played politics with the issue in the past week, brings forward a proposal?  People should be aware of what they are asking of victims while they wait.
#JimmyDeenihan	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-party	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-dob	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-06-25 00:00:00	Prelude	638	With the exception of a few disparate provisions in criminal justice legislation and policy guidelines, the area of victims' rights remains largely uncharted territory in Irish law.  If accepted, the Bill would form the legal basis for the rights and treatment of victims of criminal offences, and of their immediate families.  Like other Members I recognise the work of Deputies Alan Shatter and Charlie Flanagan in drafting the Bill, and the extremes to which they went to produce comprehensive legislation.Fine Gael's Victims' Rights Bill is designed to ensure the rights of victims of crime are taken into account in the prosecution of offences.  It does not deny the accused a fair trial but aims to provide fair treatment for victims.  If enacted, the Bill would provide the victims of crime with comprehensive statutory rights under Irish law.  If implemented, the measures in the Bill would bring about an immediate improvement to the lot of the victim.  I welcome the obligations the Bill would place on the Garda Síochána to ensure victims are treated properly and also to ensure victims and witnesses are not intimidated, as that practice has become more prevalent, especially in Dublin and Limerick.  The Bill will at least put the onus on the Garda Síochána to ensure that would not happen.  New obligations would also be placed on the Courts Services Board, the Department of Health and Children, the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform and the Health Service Executive.  The Bill contains a number of important features.  I cannot understand how anyone could oppose the establishment on a statutory basis of the Commission for the Support of Victims of Crime.  The commission was established in March 2005 on a non-statutory basis.Reference was made previously to anti-social behaviour in the context of the Intoxicating Liquor Bill.  The Bill provides for victims of anti-social behaviour.  Many people around the country are victims of anti-social behaviour.  We hear about such cases every day.  People have to leave their homes because of anti-social behaviour.  I met somebody recently who has to leave the house he bought in an estate because people on both sides of the house who live in rented accommodation cannot let him live in peace.  It is difficult to fathom how one can dismiss the Bill when it addresses issues such as that, especially given that there is no guarantee a Government Bill will be put before the House in the next two years.  That is totally irresponsible of the Government.In fairness to the Minister of State, Deputy Conor Lenihan, on a number of occasions he recognised the contribution of Deputy Shatter to legislation in this House.  It is a pity the senior Minister would not listen to him.  It is a disgrace that some of his colleagues have come to the House and parroted the brief from the Fianna Fáil press office and had a go at Deputy Shatter.  Fianna Fáil Members should give their views on the merits of the proposal.  I deplore the deliberate effort to in some way insinuate that Deputy Shatter cogged the Bill from New Zealand legislation, as indicated by the former Minister of State, Deputy Gallagher.  The Minister of State, Deputy Conor Lenihan, and his officials know that Departments examine legislation in other jurisdictions and persons in other countries examine our legislation.  I was in that position myself when I was involved in drafting legislation in the then Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry.  That goes on all the time.  The Bill may be modelled on New Zealand legislation but there is more to it than that.  Surely the Minister and all the Fianna Fáil Members who lined up one after another could have accepted that.The Bill makes provision for a range of issues that the Minister would deny victims.  Fine Gael Members who speak after me might repeat the point.  I asked a question today about a Bill concerning the Curragh of Kildare that was due to be introduced.  The heads of the Bill were drafted in 2004 but there is no indication of a Bill being produced in the foreseeable future.  In the case of victims' rights, the heads of a Bill are not even drafted.  From experience, I am not hopeful of a Bill coming forward even in 2009 or 2010.  If a Bill is introduced, it will contain many of the provisions contained in Deputy Shatter's Bill.

The debacle that has gone on in the past week started with the Minister's hastily arranged press conference and that is an appalling indictment of him.  I hope he will take on board some of the proposals contained in Deputy Shatter's Bill, the aim of which is to accord rights and recognition to victims.  The programme for Government contained a commitment to have a victims' support agency up and running but there is still no sign of it.  Nor is there any reference to a Bill relating to victims of crime in the legislative programme published in 2008.  Last week the Minister indicated he would bring forward ground-breaking legislation, but while I welcome it, the only commitment he made is to take into account the victim impact statement of family members of victims of homicide.  That is only one aspect of the matter.  The Bill brought to the House by Deputy Shatter is far reaching.  It could be 2009 or 2010 before we see the Bill promised by the Minister, as we do not know when it will be ready.  Given the slow rate of progress of the Government, it could kick it even further into touch.  Will the Government Bill create an independent statutory commission for victims of crime, as this Bill will?  Will the courts be furnished with victim impact statements prior to sentencing as provided for in this Bill?  Will providing information to victims concerning progress in investigation and prosecution of all alleged offences be included in the Minister's proposals?  Will the Minister oblige the DPP to keep victims informed of all stages of criminal prosecution?  Will he create an updated statutory victims' rights charter?  Will the Government Bill establish a complaints system for victims whose rights are not respected?  Will it impose statutory obligations on relevant State agencies to ensure victims are informed of services available to assist them?  Will it impose statutory obligations to inform victims of an application made to the parole board by a convicted offender for early release?  Will it require victims to be informed of the early release or escape of a convicted person?  Will the Minister's proposals oblige the DPP to explain the reasons for not initiating prosecution?  All these important proposals are included in this legislation.  Based on what the Minister said last night and in his press statement, I do not believe he will address the concerns and needs of victims.As many speakers have said tonight, victims find our justice system alien to them.  They can be confused because they are not legal experts in their own right.  There is no obligation to consult them on how the prosecution is proceeding and they often feel let down and feel that the law is not on their side or there to protect them.  While this Bill is not necessarily a reaction to them, there have been many high-profile cases recently.  The statement of the family of the late Siobhan Kearney was not delivered in court.  They were forced to deliver it in the midst of a media scrum outside the court, which left many people feeling very uncomfortable.  If the Government were to accept the Bill, something like that would not happen and that family would have been allowed to deliver their impact statement to the court.  It could have been taken into account by the judge prior to sentencing.We are dealing with real people who feel alienated by the system as it stands.  Deputy Enright has spoken about rape victims who find it so difficult to come forward.  Deputies on both sides of the House have received letters from the Rape Crisis Centre encouraging us to adopt this Bill to address the needs of victims by consulting them on how their cases are proceeding.  That is not happening at the moment.  Many people do not come forward because they feel they will not be given the necessary recognition or consultation and that their needs and concerns will not be addressed.  Let us not play politics with this and let us address the real needs of victims.  We have heard considerable negativity from the Government side regarding this Bill.  It is about real people who are victims whose needs are not being addressed.  I have no confidence that the Minister will introduce anything in the lifetime of this Dáil.  I ask him to allow the Bill to go forward to Committee where we can thrash out the issues with which the Minister disagrees.  Let us use it as a starting point.  Let us ensure that victims are included and recognised in our justice system.
#JoeMcHugh	unknown-#JoeMcHugh-party	unknown-#JoeMcHugh-dob	unknown-#JoeMcHugh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-06-25 00:00:00	Prelude	641	I welcome the opportunity to speak tonight.  I congratulate Deputy Shatter on introducing the Bill.  I concur with my colleagues.  Too much politics has been played on this issue since the end of last week.  Has a precedent been set that every Bill coming from the other side of the House must be legislation of original thought?  I feel sorry for the civil servants who will not be able to explore best practice in other countries.  They will not be able to look at good examples.  In Wexford, Dublin, Clare and elsewhere the Minister, Deputy Martin, has been given credit for introducing the smoking ban.  We all know that original idea did not come from the Minister, Deputy Martin.  It came from a cross-party delegation that went to Florida to see how it worked there.  I am not sure if the Ceann Comhairle was present, but I know Deputy Shatter was as was the Minister, Deputy Martin.  We should get real about where legislation comes from.  It is about carrying out extensive research into best practice in any part of the world.I congratulate Deputy Shatter for the practical ideas in the Bill, including an independent statutory commission, which the Government has opposed.  He has also proposed to provide the victims with reasonable information at an investigative stage and during the prosecution stage, which the Government has also opposed.  He has also proposed a mechanism to provide the victims through some conduit with information the DPP has in so far as practicable at a given time, which is again opposed by the Government.  The Government attitude in this debate has done a further disservice to the people who have been through an ordeal and become a victim.  We need to be very categorical.  Not many of us have been in the position of victimhood.  The victims are in a very lonely place where they find it very difficult to obtain any information from the initial investigation and right through the trial, an issue that we as legislators have responsibility to address.On 8 October 2005 Rochelle Peoples, Gavin Duffy, David Steele, Darren Quinn and Charlene O'Connor all died in a single car in a two vehicle accident.  Those five young people had an average age of 22.  Their families got no feedback from the DPP until 15 April 2008.  That information was only extracted because the five families got together and held a press conference.  It got national and local profile.  That was how they expedited their case to get information from the DPP.  It is a scandal in this day and age that they needed to wait for that period of time.  In addition almost two and a half years later no inquest into that case has taken place.  They have been in the dark.  In Donegal terms they have been seeking a wee bit of justice.  That is all they have sought.  The Garda cannot give them information.  The DPP will not give them information.  That is all they seek.  The Bill provides that such information would be given.We have heard that there will be legislation from the Government side of the House in the spring.  Which spring?  The Government has also referred to the future.  We may need to establish a new Department, the department for promises.  If past performance is a predictor of future performance, I feel sorry for the people who are still going through this ordeal.  We have a duty as legislators to do something about it.  It is a shame the Government did not adopt a bipartisan approach rather than lying about the Bill it claims to have.  Where is the Bill?  It does not have one.

I agree with the previous speaker that nobody has a monopoly on good ideas for victims.  Very many people in this House, by the nature of the work they do, have a great insight into the impact of crime on victims in society.  For the people on that side to suggest they have the only answer to this situation is farcical in the extreme.  If they were serious about a bipartisan approach they would not take the measures they have taken tonight.Yesterday evening Deputy Shatter asked what is so objectionable about a Bill that seeks to improve the position of victims of crime in the criminal justice system.  While the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform agrees with the sentiments behind the Bill, his approach is to legislate where necessary and introduce administrative structures where they are more likely to deliver real results for the people.  That is what he is doing in the justice for victims initiative.  The previous speaker discussed establishing an independent statutory commission, yet his colleagues are all talking about the fact that the Government has set up far too many quangos.  One cannot have it both ways and one must keep a balanced approach.  The advantage of establishing a victims of crime office in the Department is that it can be done almost immediately and be up and running by September 2008 rather than having to wait for the legislative process to take its course.  This way we get over the Deputy's concern as to when the spring might come.  The reconstituted commission will also be established in this timeframe and arrangements for the inaugural meeting with the victims of crime consultative forum can then be made.  The package of measures will begin to deliver results within a matter of months.To remove any doubt on the legislation side, the Minister's commitment is to bring forward a Bill in the spring of 2009.

Among these are the wide range of categories of victims requiring support and the uneven geographical spread of NGOs around the country with little or no presence in some parts of the country.  While the support of victims can be met by the commitment of volunteers with a small amount of training, there is an increasing requirement for specialised training and specialist support.  A significant number of applications for funding are for counselling services for victims of crime and I am aware, as Deputy McHugh would know coming from an isolated, rural community along the western seaboard, of the necessity of providing these services.  The provision of information to victims and the operation of a court support or accompaniment service for victims of crime is also envisaged.I particularly congratulate the Minister, Deputy Dermot Ahern, on bringing forward the justice for victims initiative, the most radical set of proposals for victims since the foundation of the State.

It will introduce new mechanisms to deal with an acquittal where compelling evidence of guilt emerges after the acquittal.  It will enable cases to be reopened where an acquittal arises from an error in law by a judge.  It will provide for new prosecutions where there is evidence that the original acquittal was tainted by interference with the trial process, including intimidation of witnesses.  It will introduce measures to restrict unjustified and vexatious imputations at trial against the character of a deceased or incapacitated victim or witness.  Those are very important measures.  None of these necessary measures is included in the Fine Gael Bill, so why would we accept a second rate, second best effort, when Fianna Fáil in government is already bringing forward a far more radical approach?In addition to these legislative proposals already noted, the justice for victims initiative also includes a series of administrative moves to increase support to victims.  These include the establishment of a new executive office of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform to support crime victims, focusing on the co-ordination of delivery of services.  They also include a reconstituted Commission for the Support of Victims of Crime with a role to distribute funding to groups working with crime victims, as well as providing general oversight of services and promoting awareness.  Also proposed is a victims of crime consultative forum, representing victims' interests, which will liaise with the commission.  Again, this is more than Fine Gael promises in what some have referred to as this bootlegged Bill.  Fine Gael has cut and pasted a piece of legislation from New Zealand and added a piece from the Fianna Fáil manifesto about a victims' agency.

The Victims Charter and Guide to the Criminal Justice System 1999 committed this State to giving victims of crime a central place in the criminal justice system, yet after nine years we are still waiting for legislative reform to establish these principles.  Last week outside this Chamber we had much trumpeting from the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform of a major new initiative for victims of crime.  I note from his press release he talks about a new groundbreaking Bill to be drafted and presented to the Oireachtas by spring of next year.  That is some ground breaking.  After ten years we may have legislation on the books.  This is the type of groundbreaking attitude of a Government so jaded, detached and arrogant that it favours the press conference and the creation of an impression of rolling up its sleeves and getting on with work.  I also note from the Minister's release last week that he makes much of his Department's disbursement of funds.  We are supposed to applaud the Minister and his Department because they have allocated €2.5 million to groups engaged in providing support to victims of crime.

#JoeCarey	unknown-#JoeCarey-party	unknown-#JoeCarey-dob	unknown-#JoeCarey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-06-25 00:00:00	Prelude	664	Is this paltry allocation supposed to keep quiet those who have requested this type of legislation over many years, those who feel it is not good enough to sail on with the occasional announcement of one of these "ground breaking initiatives"?  This old style politics of throwing a few bob to people to keep them quiet and Government by press conference and perception is running down politics in this country and is placing the people we are supposed to represent at the bottom.  Tonight's debate is a prime example of what is so wrong with the Government.Last week the Minister made disparaging reference to Deputy Shatter's initiative as legislation by Google and a copy of the New Zealand system.  There is no groundbreaking here, rather it is like groundhog day with the same old predictable stuff from a Minister who is so out of touch.  It is quite interesting to note that in his own Department with its recent comprehensive review on youth justice, that the jurisdictions of Northern Ireland, Norway, New Zealand, Canada, the UK, Scotland and Denmark were examined in order to develop an Irish strategy from "a wide range of published material".  Are we about to experience the most dynamic incumbent ever in the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, the man who will singlehandedly write all legislation?  I suspect not.I would prefer to have a piece of draft legislation before me in this Oireachtas that was properly researched using elements of international best practice than wait for ten years for one commission after another to come up with findings.  The Minister with all his resources including executive officers in the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, the Commission for the Support of Victims of Crime, the victims of crime consultative forum, the balance in the criminal law review group, the DPP and the Office of the Attorney General has merely indicated that it is his intention to have legislation published in the spring of 2009.  This is the same Minister who only two months ago managed to turn much of his Government's acute hospital policy for the north east on its head by saying there was not a red cent in the coffers.  This is truly inspiring stuff.I congratulate Deputies Shatter and Charles Flanagan on their work on this Bill.  For far too long the victims of crime have not had the support of both the law and the institutions of the State on their side.  This Bill as proposed goes a long way towards redressing that balance and deals with all impacts that the committing of a crime has on the individual.  The specific elements of the proposed legislation have been outlined during this debate.  These are distinct measures that for the first time enshrine the rights of victims of crime in Irish law.  Having the legislation on the Statute Book is one important conclusion in this process.  Sending out the clear message in adopting this legislation that a victim of crime, as a citizen, can expect to be treated properly by the State, is of equal importance and will go some way towards altering the imbalances we now experience in our criminal justice system.  I strongly support the Bill.
#MichaelRing	unknown-#MichaelRing-party	unknown-#MichaelRing-dob	unknown-#MichaelRing-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-06-25 00:00:00	Prelude	665	I compliment Deputies Shatter and Flanagan for bringing this Bill before the Dáil.  The Government and the Minister have a cheek to question the credentials of Deputy Shatter, who has brought more than 20 Bills through this House.  In the past, Governments had the courage to accept those Bills and put down the necessary amendments on Committee Stage.The Minister should have accepted this Bill and put down the necessary amendments.  He and his government talked about Bills like this for the past 20 years.  He has been in government for 18 of the past 20 years and all he could come up with last week was a press conference.  If he was serious about this Bill, it is in the House that he would have told us what he proposed.  But no, like all Fianna Fáil Ministers, he runs out either to "Morning Ireland" or the other media because he is afraid to come here and face Members on the opposite side.

#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-06-25 00:00:00	Prelude	681	I thank the Deputies on this side of the House who have expressed support for the Bill in all the different parties which have been represented.  I also recognise the groups represented in the Public Gallery.  Many of them are individuals who devote a huge amount of their time to assisting victims of crime.  They came here yesterday and today with some hope that there might be a realistic approach to this issue by the Government but they have been sadly let down.  The reality is that the victims of crime are now to be made victims of the political pettiness of an arrogant and incompetent Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform.I likened the Minister's intellectual approach to the Bill yesterday to that of Homer Simpson.  I want to revise my judgment in that regard because the Minister might be better described as "McDowell light."  The Minister's victims initiative as announced last week could be a tribute to George Orwell in the language he used in 1984 to describe how people deal with issues.  It was not so much a justice for victims initiative but an initiative to block a Bill designed to bring justice for victims of crime.We had the extraordinary spectacle today of the Deputies opposite welcoming a press conference and a promise, which is quite unique in a debate on legislation in this House, as far as I can recall.  The reality is that there is no similarity between the rights Fine Gael wishes to provide for victims in our Victims' Rights Bill and the proposals announced last Thursday by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform.  In his refusal to put party politics to one side and take a bipartisan approach to essential legislation, the Minister is unnecessarily delaying giving to victims of crime the rights to which they are entitled.  Even if he delivers on his proposals, the Minister will not give victims the recognition they deserve or the rights expressly identified in the legislation before the House.If one carefully analyses the script from the Minister's conference last Thursday and his speech delivered in the House yesterday, it is clear he and the Government are expressly opposed to the following provisions which are contained in the Fine Gael Bill.  He does not want to create an independent statutory commission for victims of crime because he will no longer be able to control it.

#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-06-25 00:00:00	Prelude	683	He is opposed to the courts being furnished with victim impact statements prior to sentencing in the context of the vast majority of offences.  He essentially wants to confine victim impact statements to bereaved family members of homicide victims and to circumstances in which they can at present be made.  In this legislation, we have express provision identical to that announced by the Minister last Thursday, published by Fine Gael last January, to facilitate the giving of victim impact statements by the families of homicide victims.  Today, the Minister who promised it last Thursday is voting against that exact provision.He is also opposed to the imposition of an obligation on the DPP to keep victims informed at all stages of the criminal prosecution process of progress being made and of court events, in so far as this can be done in a manner that does not prejudice a trial.  There is no possibility of such legislation being enacted by this Minister.He is opposed to the creation of an updated statutory charter of rights for victims of crime.  The commission created by the Minister——

It has been reviewing it since 2005 but there is no explanation why an updated charter has not yet been published either for discussion purposes or to be implemented.The Minister is opposed to the provision of a complaints system.  Where victims' rights are not properly addressed and dealt with, the Minister does not want any investigation or report produced, and he is opposed to the introduction of transparency within the criminal justice system in that way.  Thereby, where gardaí, the prosecution authorities, the Courts Service or the HSE get it wrong in providing the type of service that Deputy Enright discussed this evening for rape victims, the Minister is opposed to ensuring that is investigated and a report produced so in future it is put right and the same mistakes are not repeated.The Minister is opposed to the creation of a statutory obligation to inform all victims of an application made to the parole board by a convicted offender for early release and he is opposed to enabling and extending the right to all victims to make a submission to the parole board.  He is opposed to the creation of a statutory obligation to inform victims when an offender escapes or is being released.  He is also opposed to the imposition of a statutory obligation on the Director of Public Prosecutions to explain to victims of crime the reason for not initiating a prosecution in a case affecting them or the reason for accepting a guilty plea on a lesser charge than the one originally prosecuted.These are rights that victims of crime have in the United Kingdom, where the Crown Prosecution Service has created a protocol and procedures and they are reflected in legislation that is enacted there.  The Minister wants to deny to victims of crime in this State not just rights that victims of crime have in New Zealand but rights they have in many states in the United States, in many parts of Australia, in the United Kingdom and in many European Union countries.The Minister has promised that next year he will introduce legislation to confer a statutory right on bereaved family members of a homicide victim.  As I said earlier, he has promised to introduce legislation on that specific area which is directly replicated and contained in the Fine Gael Bill.  I would not be so asinine or foolish——

#SimonCoveney	unknown-#SimonCoveney-party	unknown-#SimonCoveney-dob	unknown-#SimonCoveney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-06-25 00:00:00	Prelude	720	We want to know what is happening in Cork University Hospital in terms of the relationship between management and consultants.  We also want to know whether the contents of a leaked e-mail are true.  I suspect the Minister will tell us this evening that the consultants and management at Cork University Hospital have resolved their differences and are now moving on and getting on with their job.  That is not good enough.  Either management or the consultant was wrong.  We need to know the truth; the public has a right to know.There were disturbing reports in the Irish Examiner at the start of the week, with extracts from a leaked e-mail written by a consultant plastic surgeon, Mr. Jason Kelly, who described the hospital as being in crisis and miserably failing patients:The article states:The correspondence [. . .] highlights how on just one shift, one critically ill woman was left without morphine on an A&E trolley after undergoing an emergency breast removal. A second patient, a 70-year-old, had to wait five hours for an emergency amputation of her forearm after a "devastating injury"."  The email describes how the 42-year-old woman "was admitted with a full thickness burn to her left breast and arm pit — it resembled a battlezone injury. She spent the night outside the plaster room in A&E. She did not get any morphine and her dressings were inadequate. She was also critically ill and did not receive adequate nursing care". Similar incidents at A&E "have happened before", the surgeon wrote, and "I have taken them through the usual channels without any obvious resolution". The surgeon says problems at the hospital need to be "fixed immediately".He expresses concern at the proposal to move breast cancer services from the South Infirmary-Victoria University Hospital to CUH, adding a further 300 or 400 breast cancer patients a year when its operating theatres cannot cope with the existing workload.  What is happening at CUH?  Is it true that the hospital cannot deal with its existing workload?  Is it the case that the two patients were treated as outlined in the e-mail?All consultants at CUH held an emergency meeting following the publication of the article in the Irish Examiner on Monday.  They formally backed their colleague, standing over the claims that were made.  The response from management at the CUH stated that the accusations were erroneous and inaccurate.  We want to know if the Minister of State is satisfied with the resolution agreed.
#BernardAllen	unknown-#BernardAllen-party	unknown-#BernardAllen-dob	unknown-#BernardAllen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-06-25 00:00:00	Prelude	721	I congratulate the Irish Examiner on its courage in publishing the story on Monday and the journalist, Ms Claire O’Sullivan.  Much of the content of Mr. Kelly’s e-mail has been denied by senior management at CUH but since that denial the consultant group has stood by Mr. Kelly’s report of systematic failures at the hospital and disagreed fundamentally with statements coming from the management at CUH.  They are demanding a review of the management structures.I have been an advocate of strong management boards in our acute hospitals and I advocated it during my time as a member of the southern health board.  This proposal has been rejected by management and consultant representatives on a number of occasions.  We are hearing two sides of the story but the patients' story is not being told.  It is important that future developments include representatives of the patients on the management boards.  CUH is a major hospital on an overcrowded site but is sucking in services from other hospitals, such as breast cancer services from the South Infirmary-Victoria University Hospital and cardiology services from the Mercy Hospital.  The Minister for Health and Children has given the go-ahead to a private hospital on an overcrowded site.Where is the Minister for Health and Children and why is she hiding from her responsibilities?  Where is the required leadership?  Going down a level from ministerial accountability, Professor Drumm visited Cork recently but failed to make a statement of clarification on any of the issues affecting health services in the Cork area.  There is an agenda to downgrade the South Infirmary-Victoria University Hospital and the Mercy Hospital in favour of an overcrowded site at CUH.  Bureaucrats are making decisions on balancing budgets rather than dealing with the needs of people.  This is a scandal.Another scandal is the advertisement by the Mercy Hospital of a 2,000 sq. ft. clinical space available in the hospital.  Is this advertising the rental of St. Catherine's ward, which closed with the loss of 31 beds and which is due to reopen at the end of the year?  Will we ever see St. Catherine's ward reopen in light of the recent advertisement seeking interested parties to take on the space?  There is more happening in Cork than meets the eye.  The Minister for Health and Children should come into the Chamber to tell those who represent the people of Cork what is happening.  People protest in the streets because they are not getting answers.  We should get answers in this House, otherwise we are failing those whom we represent.
#KathleenLynch	unknown-#KathleenLynch-party	unknown-#KathleenLynch-dob	unknown-#KathleenLynch-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-06-25 00:00:00	Prelude	722	I wish to share time with Deputy Ciarán Lynch.  Last Tuesday, Professor Drumm and the Minister for Health and Children appeared at a meeting of the Joint Committee on Health and Children.  I put questions to both and was dismissed as if I did not know what I was talking about.I referred to the two theatres at the maternity hospital, which is a magnificent facility, that have never been opened.  I spoke about two consultants there, one of whom told me he is drained by the constant battling with management to get more resources so that he can deal with his private and public list.  Both told me they could clear their lists within a 12-month period if they had the theatre space available.  In any week, they told me there are ten consultants waiting for theatre space who cannot get it.  This is happening in the same hospital that Professor Drumm told me had no problem and should get about its business.  If we believe the Minister and Professor Drumm, we are looking at additional consultants who will sit around drinking coffee because there is no theatre space in Cork in which to operate.  This is what happened with Mr. Kelly.  An unfortunate woman, who must have been in pain and quite traumatised by her injuries, had to wait five and a half hours to find a space in a theatre.  It was not that the consultant was not available — the theatre space was not available.  This is the same theatre space that Professor Drumm told me there was no problem with.The question that must be answered is straightforward.  Someone is telling the truth and someone is telling lies.  There can only be one person telling the truth because the two statements contradict each another dramatically.  An entire team of consultants and medical staff say that this happened, that it happens regularly and that the hospital is in crisis.  These people have nothing to gain from this being made public.  They must return, work under the same conditions and treat people every day and night.On the other hand, the manager says that there is nothing wrong, that the e-mail is erroneous and that it never happened.  The manager needs to say that because it looks as if the hospital is doing well and that nothing is wrong.  There are two conflicting statements and someone must be telling the truth.  I know who I believe.  There should be a board of management established in what is a major industry, given the numbers that work in it.  Where is the Minister for Health and Children?  Absent, as usual.
#CiaranLynch	unknown-#CiaranLynch-party	unknown-#CiaranLynch-dob	unknown-#CiaranLynch-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-06-25 00:00:00	Prelude	723	We have nothing short of an unprecedented crisis at the CUH.  Last week I questioned the removal of the breast cancer unit from the South Infirmary-Victoria University Hospital to the CUH.  The question has been answered tonight.  There has been a litany of mismanagement at CUH over the past three years, in respect of referral rates to the national treatment purchase fund, which are the worst in the country, the opening of the maternity unit, the gynaecological services and an overdeveloped, inefficiently run campus.  It is proposed to place a co-located hospital on the site.  Serious questions must be asked.  The Minister has abdicated her responsibilities on managing the health service through the HSE and the managers are now abdicating their responsibilities, apparent by their removal from the operation of the hospital itself.
#MaryWallace	unknown-#MaryWallace-party	unknown-#MaryWallace-dob	unknown-#MaryWallace-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-06-25 00:00:00	Prelude	724	I thank Deputies Simon Coveney, Kathleen Lynch, Bernard Allen and Ciarán Lynch for raising this important matter.  I assure the Deputies that the Minister and the HSE are committed to the highest level of patient safety in our hospitals and throughout the health service.  The issue of safety in the delivery of health services lies at the heart of any care system which has the confidence of the people using these services.  While the health sector is one of the most complex areas of activity in every country, it must by its very nature command the confidence of those who use it.  To obtain this confidence, the measures which must be undertaken are fundamental.  The patient safety and quality agenda is, in effect, fully prioritised.Two major initiatives in the past 18 months have addressed and reinforced this message.  In May 2007 the Health Information and Quality Authority, HIQA, and the Office of the Chief Inspector of Social Services were established to bring about a safer health and social services system which embeds quality at all levels and in all settings.  HIQA is responsible for setting and monitoring standards across health institutions and services in the public sector.In January 2007 the Minister established the Commission on Patient Safety and Quality Assurance.  One of its functions is to examine and develop proposals for a health service-wide system of governance based on corporate accountability.  Other key areas which the commission is examining are clinical audit, critical incident reporting and the participation of patients and carers in health service planning and provision of feedback on quality of care.  The commission is expected to report by July 2008.  The Minister looks forward to receiving this report, which will build on and inform the further development of the current system.  The foregoing initiatives are firm indicators of the Minister's commitment in the area of patient safety.Cork University Hospital is the largest acute hospital delivering health care in the HSE southern region.  It is a multi-specialty hospital in which many clinical and infrastructural challenges are faced on a day-to-day basis.  The hospital has more than 26,000 admissions each year, excluding day cases, with more than 50% of these patients admitted via the emergency department.  The Minister was concerned to learn in recent days of the matters which the Deputies have raised this evening with regard to the alleged lapses in the care provided recently to two patients at Cork University Hospital.  The HSE has advised the Minister that Cork University Hospital operates a quality and accreditation programme which incorporates a process for managing adverse incidents for patients and staff.  The Minister understands that the general manager, together with senior nursing, medical and clinical governance personnel at the hospital, and of the HSE southern region, has undertaken a detailed investigation of the matters concerned and is satisfied that the care in these cases was appropriate.The HSE advises that the key facts regarding the care of the two patients in question are as follows.  With regard to the woman who was alleged to have waited an inordinate amount of time for an amputation operation, from initial notification of the theatre team to their achievement of a state of readiness to accept the patient, the time elapsed was one hour and 25 minutes, not five hours as may have been suggested.

#MaryWallace	unknown-#MaryWallace-party	unknown-#MaryWallace-dob	unknown-#MaryWallace-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-06-25 00:00:00	Prelude	728	In so far as the second patient is concerned, the HSE has indicated that she was admitted on the patient administration system at 2.11 p.m., first received morphine within 20 minutes and was administered additional doses of the drug after that time.  She also received one-to-one special nursing care prior to her admission to theatre and afterwards.This afternoon, the HSE personnel involved met with medical staff at the hospital.  The division of plastic and maxillofacial surgery met with the executive management board, the membership of which includes three consultant clinicians including the chairman of the consultant medical staff, general manager and the director of nursing.  Arising from this, the HSE has advised that all parties concerned regret the potential for misrepresentation consequent upon the leaking of correspondence, subsequently interpreted out of context and without the consent of the parties concerned.

The intention of the executive management board is to implement governance structures which will have flexibility and innovation to respond to the continuing challenges of health care delivery.  This is being done in the context of the hospital being selected as an exemplar site for the implementation of the clinicians in management programme being developed by the HSE in the context of the new consultant contract.  This will involve a reorganisation and restructuring of the current clinical divisions and the participation of key staff in the leadership development programme.

I hope the report will be published as soon as it is completed.  It will tell a terrible story of injustice in our country.The commission has been dealing with matters of life and death, the health and well-being of thousands of citizens and a system of deplorable abuse amounting to a catalogue of crimes carried out over decades.  This system of abuse claimed the lives of many children.  We may never know exactly how many children died of neglect and ill-treatment in Irish institutions.  Our first and last concern should be the survivors of abuse and the memory of those who did not survive.  Many survivors became so marginalised and damaged from their abuse that they were never able to avail of the commission or the redress board.  We know that many of them ended up homeless on the streets of London and other foreign cities.  While many people have availed of the commission and redress board, others are not satisfied that they have received answers.I want to raise one case, that of the late Michael Flanagan, whose arm was broken by a Christian Brother in Artane Industrial School in 1954.  His brother Kevin is still fighting for full information about what exactly happened and, in particular, why their mother was only allowed to see her son eight days after the assault was inflicted.  This was an horrific example of what went on in these institutions.  The passage of time in no way erodes the importance of addressing these matters.  Michael Flanagan was then only 14 years of age.  A Christian Brother used a brush handle to break his arm.  The boy was locked in a shed at the back of the school for a full two and a half days.  The Christian Brother responsible was neither prosecuted nor expelled from the order.  The order admitted to the commission in 2005 that this member had simply been moved from Artane to another school.  After release from Artane, Michael Flanagan emigrated to England.  He was unable to read or write because Artane was, for him and many others, a school in name only.  His health never recovered and he died at a relatively young age.  His brother Kevin was asked by the commission to seek the information from them through a solicitor but he has informed my office that although he has done this, he has still not received the information requested.  These issues need to be resolved and I urge the Minister of State to give his full support and co-operation to the securing of same.The second main point is about the lessons that should have been learnt about the protection of children.  Have they been learnt?  The recent "Prime Time Investigates" programme exposed the woefully inadequate state of our child protection services, with insufficient social workers and other front-line workers in place.  The HSE knows of cases where children are in grave danger but the services are not in place to make the interventions required.  The nightmare of child abuse is not a thing of the past.  It is happening every day and most of this abuse takes place in the family home.  If the services are not in place, then the State today will be just as culpable as it was in the past when it conspired with the church to cover up the abuse of children in their joint care.
#SeanHaughey	unknown-#SeanHaughey-party	unknown-#SeanHaughey-dob	unknown-#SeanHaughey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-06-25 00:00:00	Prelude	737	Following the Taoiseach's apology to victims of abuse on 11 May 1999, during which a series of Government measures were announced for the redress of abuse, the Commission to Inquire into Child Abuse was formally established in May 2000.  The commission is independent in its functions and its operation is governed by the terms of the Commission to Inquire into Child Abuse Act 2000 and the Commission to Inquire into Child Abuse Amendment Act 2005.The broad terms of reference of the commission are to afford victims of abuse in childhood an opportunity to tell of the abuse they suffered to a sympathetic and experienced forum; to establish as complete a picture as possible of the causes, nature and extent of the physical and sexual abuse of children in institutions and in other places during the period from 1940 to the present; and to compile a report and publish it for the public on the activities and findings of the commission, containing recommendations on actions to address the continuing effects of the abuse and actions to be taken to safeguard children from abuse in the future.The commission acts through two committees which will provide the commission with a general report on the issues encountered in its work.  The confidential committee provides a forum for victims of abuse to recount their experiences on an entirely confidential basis.  The purpose of this committee is to meet the needs of those victims who want to speak of their experiences but who do not wish to become involved in an investigative procedure.  The confidential committee received evidence from 1,090 witnesses.  The committee's report will be a compilation of the evidence provided by the 1,090 witnesses and will form part of the commission's overall report.The investigation committee facilitates victims who wish to both recount their experiences and to have allegations of abuse inquired into.  The work of the investigation commission is broken down into three main phases.  In phase one, public hearings were held into a number of institutions where opening statements were provided by the relevant religious managerial bodies of such institutions.  In phase two, private hearings were held to investigate complaints of former residents of institutions.  This process finished in early 2006.  In phase three, public hearings were held during which a number of religious orders, Departments and the ISPCC gave evidence.  Religious orders who testified at the phase one public sessions returned for further examination on issues of relevance to the inquiry.  The Departments included Education and Science, Justice, Equality and Law Reform and Health and Children.Under the terms of section 5 of the Commission to Inquire into Child Abuse Act 2000, as amended, the commission is statutorily obligated to prepare and publish a report to the public.  The report "may contain findings that abuse of children, or abuse of children during a particular period, occurred in a particular institution and may identify the institution where the abuse took place and the person or, as the case may be, each person who committed the abuse, but only if he or she has been convicted of an offence in respect of abuse...".  The report shall not, however, "identify, or contain information that could lead to the identification of, persons the subject of abuse in childhood".  Similarly, it "shall not contain findings in relation to particular instances of alleged abuse of children".The legislation provides the framework for the commission's report and is quite specific in setting the parameters pertaining to its permitted content.  It is a matter for the commission, which is entirely independent in the performance of its functions, having regard to the relevant legislation to determine the content of the final report and the manner in which it will be released and published to the public.  In particular, the commission is obliged, in all circumstances, to ensure the confidentiality of witnesses and is not entitled to give judgments or make decisions in relation to individual cases.  Consequently, it is not open to me, in my capacity as Minister of State, to intervene in this matter or to influence the content of the commission's report.Both Houses of the Oireachtas have recently approved an extension to the specified period of the commission to the end of January 2009.  This extension was sought to allow the commission to complete its report and to make the necessary preparations for its publication.  It is expected, therefore, that the commission's report will be published by the end of January 2009.
#CatherineByrne	unknown-#CatherineByrne-party	unknown-#CatherineByrne-dob	unknown-#CatherineByrne-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-06-25 00:00:00	Prelude	738	"Written Off" is a series I have watched over the past number of weeks.  It was a joint project between RTE and the National Adult Literacy Agency, NALA, and it was well worth watching.  It followed the lives of 11 Irish adults aged between 17 and 50 as they attended an intensive eight-week course.  These people came from different parts of the country and from very different backgrounds.  The one thing they all had in common was that they all had difficulties with reading and writing and the series, which was the first of its kind in Ireland, followed their progress as they returned to education and faced the challenge of learning to read and write as an adult.  It also followed the highs and lows that this challenge brought, as well as the new friendships they made over the eight-week course.I watched this series with great interest because it struck a chord with my own brush with adult literacy.  I was one of the many who left school at 14 not because I wanted to, but because I had to.  I was pushed out the door because I was one of 56 in the class and I was not a "A" or a "B" student.  After leaving school, I started work in a small family printing firm, where it occurred to my boss that maybe I had something to offer.  He sent me to do a course in typing at night and that is where my education began.  I was one of the lucky ones.  I am still not the best speller in the class but I have learned invaluable life skills along the way.In Ireland today, the problem of illiteracy, especially among adults, is more common than we might think.  Agencies and organisations work to help people with this problem but the first and most important hurdle is for people to admit they have difficulties reading and writing.  NALA was established in 1980 and since 1985 it has received funding to run a national office.  It offers advisory services in adult literacy work and the agency has done great work in highlighting the adult literacy problem in the State.  However, more can and should be done to highlight the extent of the problem, to provide extended support services and to encourage people back into education.According to NALA, more than 28,000 people participate in VEC adult literacy programmes across Ireland.  This is a fourfold increase since 1997, when 5,000 people attended literacy services.  However, this is less than 5% of adults who experience literacy difficulties.  What about all the others who slip under the radar because, according to them, the services are not available?  This is where the problem lies.  A large number of illiterate people do not want anyone to know they cannot read or write and, therefore, they never obtain the help they need.  Incredibly, the most recent statistics the Department of Education and Science can provide on illiteracy date back to 1995 when approximately 25% of Irish adults aged between 16 and 64 were at level one, the lowest literacy level.  The Department assures us that the position has improved since then, but there is no proof of this.Although Ireland has experienced a huge surge in wealth in recent years, the level of illiteracy remains worryingly high.  According to the latest international survey, approximately 500,000 Irish adults have problems with basic reading, writing and mathematics.  Illiteracy can affect all strands of society, not just the marginalised.  Almost 30% of the workforce has only attained the junior certificate or lower, while a staggering 10% has only primary level or no formal qualification at all.  Furthermore, 25% of adults still lack basic skills in literacy and numeracy.  It is, therefore, vital that we put in place every support to encourage people to return to education, no matter their age.  The problem is people can be reluctant to admit they cannot read or write and feel a stigma attaches to being illiterate.Adult learning is an excellent resource and needs to be fully supported by the Government and the Department of Education and Science.  Last week, I had the privilege of presenting 20 FETAC awards to young people who had left school.  Their enthusiasm showed on their faces.  I told them that it was only their first step and that I hoped they would continue to learn.  To reach one's potential, one must learn.  I ask the Minister of State for his support.
#SeanHaughey	unknown-#SeanHaughey-party	unknown-#SeanHaughey-dob	unknown-#SeanHaughey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-06-25 00:00:00	Prelude	739	I thank the Deputy for raising this important issue.  As the Minister of State with responsibility for lifelong learning, I am aware of the importance of adult literacy.  The acquisition of adequate literacy skills is necessary for adults to derive benefit from any education or training courses in which they want or need to engage.  Adult literacy, in addition to reading and writing, extends to such basic education as numeracy, social and personal development, learning to learn and IT skills.  In the modern context, adult literacy is as much about an individual's self-esteem and confidence as it is about the traditional reading, writing and arithmetic.  Literacy in all its guises enables an individual to participate more fully in society, to contribute more in relationships, both personal and professional, and to make the most of himself or herself in our competitive, globalised economy.In concrete terms, funding for adult literacy has increased from €1 million in 1997 to €30 million in 2007.  This has increased participation in literacy tuition from 8,000 learners in 1997 to 44,000 in 2007.  Targets in the national development plan have consistently been met or exceeded.  Under Towards 2016, an extra 7,000 places are to be provided during the period 2007-09.  Some 3,000 of these were allocated in 2007 and provision has been made for a further 500 in 2008.  Adult literacy also features prominently in the national action plan for social inclusion and the programme for Government.Ireland is participating in the feasibility study for a new OECD survey, the programme for the international assessment of adult competencies, which will survey adults between the ages of 16 years and 64 years in their homes on a range of skills covering their interest, attitude and capacity to access, manage, understand, integrate and evaluate various types of information as well as to respond and communicate with others in the information age.  Participation in the survey will be decided after the results of the feasibility study.My Department supports a number of other initiatives in the field of adult literacy, not least of which is part-funding the television series "Written Off".  My Department has part-funded a number of television series organised by NALA over the years with the express aim of increasing awareness of adult literacy and encouraging individuals to participate in adult literacy classes or initiatives.  I am glad to report that this series is proving just as successful as its predecessors in these aims and I would like to commend NALA on its work in this area.  Hopefully, the example set by the courageous learners featured in the series will serve as an inspiration to individuals in a similar situation.  As the Minister of State with responsibility for lifelong learning, I attended the programme's formal launch and had the pleasure of meeting its participants.  I agree with the Deputy that they are inspirational.The delivering equality of opportunity in schools action plan, DEIS, has seen the extension of literacy and numeracy programmes and the commencement of a family literacy project that addresses literacy from the intergenerational perspective.  The key principle of early intervention underpins many of the initiatives being adopted under DEIS.  My Department also funds the intensive tuition in adult basic education programme, ITABE, which provides up to six hours of tuition per week to learners instead of the normal two hours.  As well as these initiatives, literacy tuition is available under the back to education initiative through which funds are also made available to community education programmes.There are specially targeted literacy programmes for those in need of particular literacy services, for example, deaf people, people with dyslexia and native Irish speakers in Gaeltacht areas.  There are a number of workplace literacy and basic education schemes in operation around the country, such as the return to learning scheme for local authority outdoor staff nationwide and the FÁS-VEC return to education scheme for participants on the community employment scheme operated by FÁS.I would like to reiterate my Department's commitment to addressing the issue of adult literacy to enable all people, particularly the low-skilled and disadvantaged, to participate as fully as possible in our modern, globalised society and economy.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-06-25 00:00:00	Prelude	740	I understand that the Deputy is concerned in particular about the current means testing arrangements applying in the case of the State pension (non-contributory) where a land-holder leases land or is otherwise in possession of land which is fallow or idle.  Currently, a group in the Department is undertaking a review of means testing arrangements generally and I understand that the issue raised by the Deputy is being considered by the Group.The State pension (non-contributory) was introduced in 2006 and it replaced a range of non-contributory payments for persons aged 66 and over including the old age pension. While no specific measures in relation to the leasing of land have been introduced in recent years, a wide range of important reforms were announced for non-contributory pensioners, including farmers, in conjunction with the introduction of the new pension. These reforms impacted on farmer pensioners generally including farmers who have let land or are considering leasing their land.  Prior to 2006 all of these pension schemes featured a common means disregard of €7.60 per week, which had not increased since the 1970s. This general disregard was increased to €20 with effect from September 2006 and was subsequently increased to €30 with effect from January 2007. This means that the first €30 per week of all means, including any means from the letting of land, is not taken into account in determining entitlement to a pension.Increases in rates and other improvements in pensions over many years have been among the major achievements of the Government. Since 2002, the level of the State pension (non-contributory) has increased by over 58% from €134 to €212 per week following Budget 2008. This improvement has had a marked impact on the living standards of older people enabling them to face the future with a greater sense of security and dignity.  The Government is determined, subject to the availability of resources, to maintain and improve on the progress we have made in improving pensioners' incomes.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-06-25 00:00:00	Prelude	741	I propose to take Questions Nos. 80 and 98 together.The effective delivery of services at both national and local levels with flexibility to adapt to change is essential in tackling poverty and social exclusion. This can best be achieved if the services are coordinated and, where appropriate, integrated at local and national levels and between these levels.  The importance of this approach is recognised in Towards 2016, the National Development Plan 2007-2013 and the new National Action Plan for Social Inclusion 2007-2016 (NAPinclusion).The Local Government Social Inclusion Steering Group is a key element in this process.  The Group is chaired by the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government and includes representation from this Department, the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, local government, the Combat Poverty Agency and the Institute of Public Administration.  The purpose of the Group is to promote and support the embedding of social inclusion in local government in the context of national policies.A key project is the development of Local Anti-Poverty Strategies, with a view to providing a model of good practice for counties and cities. Funding and support to a number of local authorities has been provided by the Combat Poverty Agency.  In 2003 supports were provided to Cork City Council, Donegal County Council and Westmeath County Council.  In 2005 Laois County Council and Wicklow County Council received supports.  It is understood that some other local authorities have also developed Social Inclusion Strategies. Discussions on the development of these strategies take place at Steering Group meetings, and include regular progress reports from the Combat Poverty Agency on its work in this area.The provision of social inclusion officers in local authorities is a matter for the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government.  In line with the commitment in Towards 2016, pilot social inclusion units have now been established in half of all county and city councils with support funding from the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government.  This Department has supported the social inclusion unit programme from the outset, particularly in the context of participation in the aforementioned Local Government Social Inclusion Steering Group.  The Department was also represented on the inter-departmental Group which oversaw the recent extension of the units to a further nine local authorities.  The ongoing exchange of information on social inclusion issues and activities between all levels of government is a key element of the process and as part of this the Steering Group recently oversaw the hosting of a seminar in April 2007 to disseminate information regarding Local Anti-Poverty and Social Inclusion Strategies to local authorities.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-06-25 00:00:00	Prelude	742	As the Deputy will be aware, the needs of older people have been a priority for Government for many years and we have managed to make very significant improvements in social welfare pensions. The rate of contributory pension has increased from just €95 per week in 1996 to more than €223 per week in 2008 and the non-contributory pension has increased from €82 per week in 1996 to €212 per week this year.  In the Government Programme we have committed ourselves to a pension rate of €300 per week by 2012.The overall policy in relation to pensions is to ensure that all residents will have an acceptable replacement income when they retire. The function of the social welfare element is to provide a basic income, while occupational and private pensions supplement this and give people additional resources related to their pre-retirement earnings and savings.  Many OECD countries have introduced mandatory State schemes for providing both basic income and earnings-related pensions. OECD surveys tend to focus in the main on the level of payments made to pensioners from these mandatory schemes.  Because of the way in which our pensions system is organised, such surveys can provide a distorted picture of the economic position of our older people. They make no allowance for important factors such as:Income from private pensions;The fact that the vast majority of older people would be home-owners by the time they retire; orAdditional supports provided by the Government such as the Household Benefits, Medical Cards etc.Accordingly, while such surveys are useful to compare aspects of the pensions systems across other countries, for the reasons outlined, they are not a true indication of the economic position of our older people.It is worth noting that the OECD statistics referred to by the Deputy relate to 2004 and do not take account of significant pension increases in recent years. The strong increases in social welfare pensions since 2006 should further improve the replacement rate of Irish state pensions.  Finally, the Deputy will also be aware that the consultation process on the Green Paper on Pensions has recently closed and the Government is committed to deciding on a new framework for future pensions policy by the end of the year.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-06-25 00:00:00	Prelude	743	The household benefits package is generally available to people living in the State, aged 66 years or over who are in receipt of a social welfare type payment or who satisfy a means test. It is also available to people aged under 66 who are in receipt of certain disability social welfare payments or carer's allowance. The package includes the electricity and gas allowance, telephone allowance and free television licence schemes. There are currently 355,000 people in receipt of household benefits at an annual cost of €317 million.The electricity allowance element of the household benefits package is paid as a credit on the person's electricity bill. The natural gas allowance is an alternative to the electricity allowance for people whose homes are connected to a natural gas supply. People can choose to have the allowance applied to either their electricity or their gas bill, whichever is most beneficial to them.  The national fuel allowance scheme also provides assistance to householders on long-term social welfare or health service executive (HSE) payments with meeting the cost of their heating needs during the winter season. Fuel allowances are paid for 30 weeks from end-September to end-April. The allowance represents a contribution towards a person's normal heating expenses. It is not intended to meet those costs in full. The allowance is €18 per week with an additional €3.90 per week paid to those in smokeless fuel areas.Fuel allowances are incorporated in the recipient's weekly social welfare payment. This reflects the objective that the total weekly income of benefit and assistance recipients, including the fuel allowance, is sufficient to meet all of their income needs, including heating costs.  It is estimated that over 290,000 people will benefit under the scheme in 2008 at a cost of €173 million.  There are no plans at present to amend the household benefits to include an allowance for oil based heating. However, I will continue to review the operation of the scheme with a view to identifying the scope for further improvements as resources permit.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-06-25 00:00:00	Prelude	744	Rent supplement is administered on behalf of the Department by the Health Service Executive (HSE), as part of the supplementary welfare allowance scheme.  The purpose of the rent supplement scheme is to provide short-term income support to eligible people living in private rented accommodation, whose means are insufficient to meet their accommodation costs, and who do not have accommodation available to them from any other source.  In recent years, a significant number of people have come to rely on rent supplement for extended periods. Currently almost 32,000 people are getting rent supplement for 18 months or more. For this reason, the scheme has to be viewed in the context of overall housing policy, particularly in the case of long-term claimants.In response to this situation, in July 2004 the Government introduced new rental assistance arrangements which include the rental accommodation scheme (RAS). This gives local authorities specific responsibility for meeting the longer-term housing needs of people receiving rent supplement for 18 months or more, on a phased implementation basis.  At the end of April 2008, 6,759 rent supplement cases have been transferred to RAS units with a further 6,276 transferred to other social housing options. A financial allocation is transferred from this Department to the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government in respect of the RAS scheme each year.  €27m is due for transfer in 2008.The Department works closely with the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government and is represented on a number of RAS implementation groups. That Department is provided with quarterly updates of persons on long term rent supplement for use by local authorities in targeting tenants for transfer to RAS.  Significant changes to the means test for rent supplement were implemented in 2007 specifically to facilitate people returning to work who had been accepted as eligible for accommodation under RAS. These measures are positive steps in assisting tenants in achieving a long-term housing solution for their needs.When the new rental assistance arrangements are fully implemented it is expected that in excess of 30,000 individuals will have transferred from the rent supplement scheme to the local authorities under the rental accommodation scheme or other social housing schemes.  The Department will continue to work closely with the Department of the Environment Heritage and Local Government in ensuring that RAS meets its objective of catering for those on long term rent supplementation while enabling rent supplement to return to its original role of a short-term income support.

The objective is to use resources to improve the position of all pensioners to the fullest extent possible. The results of this policy can be seen in the most recent results from the EU Survey on Income and Living Conditions (SILC), which showed that the position of older people improved significantly from 2005 to 2006, with the "at risk of poverty"rate falling from 20.1% to 13.6% and the consistent poverty rate falling from 3.7% to 2.1%. Furthermore, the number of people aged 65 and over "at risk of poverty" was significantly lower than the figure of 17% for the general population.  The needs of older people have been, and will remain, a priority for the Government. I will continue to keep the position in relation to the living alone increase under review in the context of future budgets.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-06-25 00:00:00	Prelude	746	The Government discussion paper, "Proposals for Supporting Lone Parents", put forward proposals to tackle obstacles to employment for lone parents and other low income families.  Extensive consultation has been carried out at all stages in the development of the proposal. Submissions were invited from a range of organisations when the working group was first established within the Department of Social and Family Affairs to analyse the income support arrangements for lone parents and parents on low income. Thirty-nine organisations were contacted, including organisations participating in social partnership, lone parent organisations and other relevant organisations. Submissions were received from thirteen of these.A consultative forum also took place with the Minister for Social and Family Affairs following the publication of the Government Discussion Paper. Attendees included representatives from a range of lone parent organisations, other NGOs, relevant agencies and other government departments, as well as opposition spokespersons and members of the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Social and Family Affairs.  In May 2006 the then Minister for Social and Family Affairs participated in a debate on the discussion paper in the Seanad and he presented the proposals to the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Social and Family Affairs. The consultation process has continued as the proposals are being developed in the Department with a number of meetings having taken place between officials and lone parent groups. Presentations on the proposals have been made at various fora around the country. The discussion at these meetings and events has assisted in the development of the proposals.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-06-25 00:00:00	Prelude	747	The Department is committed to providing a quality service to all its customers.  This includes ensuring that pension claims are processed and that decisions on entitlement are made as quickly as possible.  Claims for State Pension (Contributory) and State Pension (Transition) are now fully processed within three weeks of receipt of the applications where all information is available.  Average processing times for all claims now stand at less than 8 weeks for a State Pension (Contributory) and 5 weeks for State Pension (Transition).  Over the past year 59% of State Pension Non-Contributory claims were processed and decided within 8 weeks.  The processes involved in deciding State Pension Non-Contributory claims are currently being reviewed with a view to reducing the time taken to decide claims.In order to facilitate a good service people are advised to apply for a pension at least three months before reaching pension age.  Recently, the Department introduced a process of contacting people inviting them to claim the State Pension Contributory pension in advance of reaching pension age in order to ensure their entitlement to pension is decided by the due date.  Similarly, people who are in receipt of long term means tested payments, such as Disability Allowance, Jobseekers Allowance, etc. are also notified to claim State Pension Non-Contributory in advance of reaching pension age.  I am satisfied that pension claims are processed in a timely manner and that customers do not experience undue delay.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-06-25 00:00:00	Prelude	748	The Department exchanges data with a range of agencies and is committed to using the most modern, efficient and secure methods available for this purpose. The Department actively supports government policy which aims to facilitate the greater use of electronic payment systems in the economy in the interests of developing a world class payments environment in Ireland.  The Department's payment strategy is designed to ensure that cost effective arrangements are in place for making payments to social welfare customers by using a range of payment options and to ensure that new payment facilities are made available to customers as they arise. The current range of payment options offered by the Department to customers includes payment to a local post office, bank or building society account and credit unions that have financial regulatory approval.Over one million payments across a range of schemes are issued to customers of the Department on a weekly basis. These payments are generated from several individual IT systems and merged into a single payments file prior to transmission to the payment agency concerned. The Department transfers over 40 data files containing customer payment information electronically, via the mechanisms outlined, on a weekly basis to payment agencies.  The interagency data transfer mechanism on the Government Network is used for large volumes to and from public sector agencies. Secure point-to-point connections are used for the transfer of large data volumes to private sector agencies mainly for the purpose of generating payments. Smaller volumes of data are transferred via other secure, encrypted, data transmission facilities.Departmental officials regularly review the security and efficiency aspects of information transfer arrangements. As well as internal reviews, officials are in regular contact with recipient agencies to ensure that arrangements for the transfer of data are the most efficient and secure mechanisms available at the time. The Department is also involved in discussions at EU working group level to ensure that future exchanges of data will be carried out in a secure, consistent and efficient manner between social security agencies in member states.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-06-25 00:00:00	Prelude	749	I propose to take Questions Nos. 90, 112, 113 and 132 together.In February 2006 the Government decided to transfer certain non core functions from the Health Service Executive to the Department. The General Registrars Office transferred to the Department with effect from 1 January 2008 and plans are well advanced for the transfer of a number of disability related payments including domiciliary care allowance. The transfer of the Community Welfare Service to the Department is also to take place.The work of the community welfare officers requires them to exercise discretion when making decisions regarding entitlement of supplementary allowance. From the outset, assurances have been given that when they transfer to the Department they will continue to make discretionary payments under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme. This discretion is recognised as being fundamental to the scheme and there is no proposal to make any change in this regard; the existing flexibilities will be retained. The 2007 and 2008 Social Welfare and Pensions Acts which provided the legislative basis for the transfer of functions did not in anyway alter the existing discretionary element of the scheme. In relation to the location of Community Welfare Officers who transfer to the Department the position is that arrangements have been agreed with the HSE for the continued use of their existing accommodation. They will continue to operate from Health Centres but opportunities for co-location with other locally based Departmental staff will be examined on an ongoing basis taking account of service needs.The transfer represents a significant change for the staff involved and there are a considerable number of human resources issues to be dealt with. Discussions are taking place between the management side comprised of officials from the Department, the Department of Health and Children and the HSE and the staff unions SIPTU and IMPACT. These discussions are being facilitated by an independent chairman. An intensive series of meetings took place between October 2007 and April 2008. A summary position paper outlining management's proposals for the transfer has been sent to the Unions and I understand that this will form the basis of further discussions. Discussions are also taking place with unions representing existing staff in the Department in relation to the transfer proposals. The aim is to reach a collective agreement with all the unions involved that addresses the concerns of all the staff involved.In addition to administering the supplementary welfare allowance scheme on behalf of the Department some Community Welfare Officers working in counties other than Dublin, Kildare and Wicklow are also engaged in means assessment work for medical cards, nursing home subventions and other schemes which will continue to be administered by the HSE. It has been decided that a proportionate number of staff will remain in the HSE to deal with this work. Out of a total of 1,033 posts, 167 will be retained in the HSE and 866 will transfer to the Department. This distribution of posts is based on a study undertaken by external consultants engaged by the HSE to examine the work of the CWS in order to determine the exact level of staff resources engaged in the various functions. The final detailed figures were agreed between the Department and the HSE taking account of service delivery requirements in relation to the full range of work involved.The integration of the Community Welfare Service with the Department will allow for the development of the role of Community Welfare Officers. There is already a significant level of liaison between them and locally based staff in the Department. Under an integrated management structure existing areas of duplication of work can be reduced and ultimately this will lead to an improved and more efficient service for the public. The Department is moving to a more dynamic response to the needs of the unemployed, lone parents and persons with disabilities. This involves a more direct engagement with these groups and the introduction of a case management and activation approach.Community Welfare Officers have developed a huge level of experience and expertise in relation to dealing with persons who are disadvantaged. They are well placed to become involved in the development of the case management and activation approach. There will be ongoing consultation with staff in relation to these developments.  The Department's priority is to maintain the existing high standard of service to the public during the implementation of the transfer of functions from the HSE.

The new MOU is designed to build on the close co-operation that already exists between this Department and the Revenue Commissioners by improving and intensifying the levels and scope of existing administrative and operational arrangements between the two organisations.   To that end, it is mindful of the respective roles and missions of each as public service organisations, of the particular importance of the services provided by each and recognising the growing interdependencies between them in achieving delivery of those services to the highest standard. The scope of the draft MOU covers aspects such as:the timely collection by Revenue on behalf of the Department, of pay related social insurance (PRSI) contributions;transfer to the Department of monies collected in an agreed manner and within agreed timescales;the provision of accurate customer information and data;the timely transfer of information and data by the Department to Revenue;active joint co-operation in combating fraud;maximising the opportunities offered by new technologies;shared services (for example in relation to printing);joint training;  andrelated practices and provisions on governance, monitoring, consultation and ongoing review.Detailed discussions have taken place and very good progress has been made.  A final round of discussions is now under way with a view to concluding the new MOU in the coming months.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-06-25 00:00:00	Prelude	752	I propose to take Questions Nos. 93, 114 and 139 together.Fuel poverty has been described as the inability to afford adequate warmth in a home, or the inability to achieve adequate warmth because of the energy inefficiency of the home.  Various studies have been conducted in recent years which highlight fuel poverty problems affecting particular groups including households on low income, pensioners and lone parents. Studies include the Institute of Public Health's "All Ireland Paper on Fuel Poverty and Health" published in December 2007 and, more recently Sustainable Energy Ireland's "Energy in the Residential Sector" in June 2008. These studies give varying estimates of the numbers and types of households affected by fuel poverty.One of the primary contributory factors to fuel poverty identified in reports is the low energy efficiency of parts of the private and public housing stock. Problems in this regard relate mainly to older housing, with poor insulation and draught-proofing or inefficient heating systems. All new housing, including social housing, is being built to modern energy efficiency standards. Local housing authorities are undertaking an ongoing programme, including draught insulation and energy efficiency, to upgrade the older social housing stock and provide better living conditions generally for tenants.I am aware that the Chief Executive of Bord Gáis recently spoke about the issue of energy affordability in Ireland. He acknowledged that the Government currently provides substantial support for energy affordability through the National Fuel Scheme and the Household Benefits Package but that in addition to this, the energy industry needs to take a pro-active approach on the issue. The increasing cost of fuel will present a challenge to the Government on a number of fronts including the income support response for social welfare recipients.The main role of the social welfare system in relation to fuel poverty is to provide income supports. Government policy in recent years has focused on significantly increasing primary social welfare rates to ensure that people on social welfare can meet their basic living costs, including heating costs throughout the year. Since December 2001, overall inflation has increased by 27% while energy product prices have increased by 65%. However, increases in social welfare payments have been between 71% and 88% in the same period. The government will continue to use annual budget increases to compensate social welfare recipients for increases in living costs.  In addition to primary payments, there are a number of social welfare programmes to assist with heating costs, specifically – the national fuel allowance scheme, the household benefits package and the special heating needs supplement. These arrangements too have been improved in recent years.The household benefits package was improved in January 2007 when the number of units of electricity covered by the scheme was increased from 1,800 to 2,400. An equivalent increase in the natural gas allowance had already come into effect in October 2006. These allowances also cover standing charges and the associated VAT. The natural gas allowance is an alternative to the electricity allowance for people whose homes are connected to a natural gas supply. People can choose to have the allowance applied to either their electricity or their gas bill, which ever is most beneficial to them. As currently structured, these allowances are linked to unit energy consumption so that people are protected against unit price increases in electricity or gas.The Department is cooperating with a number of organisations including Sustainable Energy Ireland and Combat Poverty Agency and with the Department of the Environment Heritage and Local Government in action research projects on energy efficiency. Reports on these fuel research projects, due later this year, will help to inform Government policy in relation to fuel poverty.  Any changes to social welfare programmes to assist with heating costs will be considered in a budgetary context and available resources. However, the main focus will be to increase social welfare payments in real terms to enable social welfare recipients to better meet heating and other needs.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-06-25 00:00:00	Prelude	753	The Government is anxious to ensure that as many people as possible can be accommodated within the social welfare pensions system, with due regard being paid to the contributory principle underlying entitlement to contributory payments and, in the case of non-contributory payments, the need to ensure that resources are directed to those who are most in need. Over the last 10 years, means tests have been improved and qualifying conditions for contributory payments made easier. Many women in both the private and the public sector left employment on marriage because they were required to or because that was the societal norm at the time. Civil servants who left the workforce through the operation of the marriage bar were not insured for social welfare pension purposes. Accordingly, the loss of pension rights in their case relates more to their occupational position rather than social welfare pension entitlements.That said, the Green Paper on Pensions, which was published on 17th October 2007 includes a full discussion on the social welfare pension position of women who had to resign due to the marriage bar. In this context, the Green Paper sets out a range of reforms for consideration, including the use of universal entitlements and back-dating the homemakers scheme.  A consultation process commenced following the paper's publication and submissions were invited on all aspects of the pensions system. The consultation period has just concluded and work has recently commenced on developing a framework for future policy in this area. Decisions in relation to those who are not at present receiving support through the social welfare system, including those who had to leave employment on marriage, will be considered in that context. It is expected that the policy framework will be finalised by the end of the year.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-06-25 00:00:00	Prelude	754	The primary objective of my Department's information policy is to ensure that all citizens are made aware of their entitlements and that they are kept informed of changes and improvements in schemes and services as they occur.  In relation to older people, the Department produces a comprehensive range of information leaflets and booklets.  For example, a booklet entitled "Checklist for Pensioners" (SW10) which sets out the benefits for which a pensioner may qualify, has recently been updated and is currently being distributed to all Social Welfare local offices, and Citizens Information Centres.  This booklet, along with other related information leaflets and claim forms, is available from the Department's LoCall Leaflet Line at 1890 20 23 25.The Citizens Information Board, (CIB) which comes under the aegis of my Department, produced a booklet called "Information Age – How to access Senior Citizen Benefits" as part of an initiative to meet the information needs of older people. The booklet contains brief information on retirement, health services, income and support, and safety and security.  Its primary purpose is to direct older people to sources of information, advice and support.  In 2007, this booklet was sent to all Social Welfare pensioners and was promoted in a short media campaign.  It is available through Citizens Information Centres, the Department's local offices and Health Centres.  The Citizens Information Board also provides information through some 260 Citizen Information Centres and other outlets around the country, through a phone service which operates from 9 a.m. to 9 p.m. Monday to Friday, and the website www.citizensinformation.ie.The Department operates a network of approximately 130 local and branch offices throughout the country.  Each Local Office has officers who are dedicated to providing information and are available to explain supports and services to people.  This locally based service is supported by a central Information Unit which operates a LoCall information line (1890 66 22 44) which customers may call for information and guidance on their entitlements.  In addition, information on all our schemes and services is available on the Department's website, www.welfare.ie.  Information leaflets can be downloaded from this site or a request can be made on-line for a booklet to be posted out.As well as attending exhibitions and seminars throughout the country promoting information on social welfare rights and entitlements, presentations and talks are given by staff directly to various groups of people approaching pension age.  The Department has consulted widely with stakeholder groups representing older people and works closely with voluntary and community organisations involved in an information giving role.  I am satisfied that the Department is taking all necessary steps to ensure that older people are made aware of their entitlements.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-06-25 00:00:00	Prelude	755	I propose to take Questions Nos. 96, 102, 124, 125 and 136 together.The Government discussion paper, Proposals for Supporting Lone Parents, put forward proposals to tackle obstacles to employment for lone parents and other low income families.  Under the proposals, the lone parenthood category would no longer exist. Instead, a new payment would be made to all parents, living alone or with a partner, with young children, on low income. The proposed payment would remove the current disincentive for lone parents to form stable relationships and facilitates a more neutral social welfare system with regard to people's choice of life style or living arrangements.The tests in Coolock and Kilkenny were carried out to facilitate the development of the policy and operational details of the new scheme. They have highlighted how lone parents are not a homogenous group, are of different ages, have experienced different routes into lone parenthood and have different needs. The experience of this engagement process is feeding into the development of our approach to working with lone parents and qualified adults to support them into education, training and employment. Work is also ongoing in addressing possible poverty traps in the new income support scheme. These elements will form part of the proposals which I hope to bring to the Cabinet Committee on Social Inclusion in the coming months.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-06-25 00:00:00	Prelude	756	The setting of waste management charges and the introduction of waivers in respect of waste charges is, as has been stated in this House on many occasions, a matter for each local authority. Local authorities operate under the auspices of the Department of Environment, Heritage and Local Government. The introduction of a national social welfare scheme as part of the household benefits scheme to address the issue would not be feasible given the wide range of charging regimes and cost structures that exist in respect of waste management throughout the State. Charges vary across local authorities and within local authorities where there is more than one provider. In addition, some local authorities and private operators already operate waiver schemes but, again, the qualifying conditions for these schemes also vary. Any system put in place to assist people with waste collection charges would have to take account of the different local arrangements.My officials have discussed this issue with their counterparts in the Department of Environment, Heritage and Local Government and I understand that said Department does not have any plans at present to introduce a national waiver scheme. Similarly, I have no plans to introduce a waiver scheme through the social welfare system.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-06-25 00:00:00	Prelude	757	The Society of St. Vincent de Paul has a proud tradition of supporting and championing the rights of the poorest members of our society. I met with representatives of the Society recently and listened carefully to their concerns about increased demands on their supports and services generally and in the Dublin area, in particular.At the outset, I would like to draw attention to the fact that persons who are experiencing immediate financial emergencies can avail of the Community Welfare Service which operates the Exceptional and Urgent Needs Payment schemes on behalf of my Department.  Improvements in social welfare supports are normally introduced by way of the annual Budget. Following Budget 2008, overall social welfare spending in 2008 is projected to be just under €17 billion. This is an increase of €1.5 billion (or nearly 10%) over 2007. Over the last five Budgets, the lowest social welfare rates have increased by 58% compared to cumulative price increases of 17% in the same period. In 2004, the lowest social welfare rate of payment equated to 24% of gross average industrial earnings. In 2008 this rate will equate to over 30%.Budget 2008 provided for increases in welfare rates of payment which are ahead of the projected increases in prices for 2008. These included:An increase in the maximum personal rates of contributory pension of €14, or 6.7%, per week, andAn increase of €12.00 per week, or 6.5%, in the lowest personal rate of payment.In addition, a wide range of improvements for families with children were also announced. Following Budget 2008, total child income support for a welfare dependant family with one young child will be €87.77 per week or an increase of 7% over 2007.The level of increases introduced this year clearly demonstrate the Government's determination to fully protect the most vulnerable in our society and to making real progress towards achieving our commitments for pensioners, carers, people with disabilities and all others relying in whole or in part on a welfare payment. I look forward, subject to available resources, to making further progress in this regard in the years ahead and I will take into account the views put forward by the Society and other welfare organizations in this regard.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-06-25 00:00:00	Prelude	758	The purpose of the review of the social welfare code, which is currently being undertaken in the Department, is to examine its compatibility with the Equal Status Act, 2000 (as amended). The review will examine all the schemes and services provided for both in social welfare legislation and the administrative schemes operated by the Department. It will identify any instances of direct or indirect discrimination, on any of the nine grounds under the Act that are not justified by a legitimate social policy objective or where the means of achieving that objective are either unnecessary or inappropriate.The review is being undertaken in two phases. Phase 1 involved undertaking a scoping exercise to establish the most appropriate approach and methodology to carrying out the main review, which would be robust and verifiable. The results of Phase 1 then formed the basis of the terms of reference of the main review. A request for tender for Phase 2 of the work, involving the undertaking of the main review, issued in April 2007. Consultants were selected to carry out the work in July 2007, with work commencing in October 2007. The work is expected to be completed by early 2009.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-06-25 00:00:00	Prelude	759	I propose to take Questions Nos. 101, 126 and 141 together.I welcome the recent research by the Vincentian Partnership which clearly demonstrates the considerable progress made by the Government since the publication of their original research entitled "Minimum Essential Budgets for Six Households" in late 2006.  This is one of a number of research modals and, it presents some very useful information and the updated findings will certainly be studied with interest by the Department.  The recent update shows significant improvements in the position for most household types. In particular, pensioner couple households and lone parents or couples with younger children have seen their position improve dramatically.The decisive steps taken by the Government in the last two years on a wide range of fronts have addressed some of the problems and challenges identified in the 2006 report, and in other similar studies. Such actions include the introduction of the early child care supplement, increases in social welfare rates and the National Minimum Wage.  Social welfare pensions have increased by €30 per week and basic welfare rates by €32 per week since 2006.  These increases have been well in excess of both inflation and wage growth.  In addition, child benefit rates have increased by over 10% in the same period while the qualified child allowance has been significantly restructured and enhanced. Other measures have included:Improvements in the means testing arrangements for a range of schemes such as jobseeker's allowance and disability allowance. These are designed to encourage recipients and their spouse/partners to work, thereby increasing total household income;Changes in the upper earnings limit for one-parent family payment;Improvements in the family income supplement focused on larger families.This Government remains committed to significantly improving the standard of living of welfare dependent and low-income households and to implementing the National Action Plan on Social Inclusion, a key objective of which is the elimination of consistent poverty.   We will continue to pursue these policies having regard to available resources.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-06-25 00:00:00	Prelude	760	I propose to take Questions Nos. 103, 120 and 137 together.Rent supplement is administered on behalf of the Department by the Health Service Executive (HSE) as part of the supplementary welfare allowance scheme. Rent supplement is subject to a limit on the amount of rent that an applicant may incur. Rent limits are set at levels that enable the different eligible household types to secure and retain basic suitable rented accommodation, having regard to the different rental market conditions that prevail in various parts of the State. The objective is to ensure that rent supplement is not paid in respect of overly expensive accommodation having regard to the size of the household.Setting maximum rent limits higher than are justified by the open market would have a distorting effect on the rental market, leading to a more general rise in rent levels. This in turn would worsen the affordability of rental accommodation unnecessarily, with particular negative impact for those tenants on lower incomes, including people in low wage employment.  Under existing arrangements the HSE may, in certain circumstances, exceed the rent limits currently applying. This discretionary power ensures that individuals with particular needs can be accommodated within the scheme and specifically protects against homelessness.Rent limits were last set in January 2007 and a review of these limits is currently being finalised.  Any adjustments to rent limits, resulting from this review, will be effective from 1 July 2008.  Rent supplement is calculated to ensure that a person, after payment of rent, has an income equal to the basic SWA rate, less a specified minimum contribution, currently set at €13 per week, which recipients are required to pay from their own resources. This minimum contribution has not been increased since January 2004, despite significant increases in basic social welfare payments in the intervening period.  The tenant makes the application for rent supplement and the Department's relationship is with the tenant in all cases. Payment is made to the tenant, it is the property of the tenant and is specifically for the benefit of the tenant to assist them with their accommodation needs.Where a landlord charges a rent in excess of that declared by him/her on the rent supplement application form, the matter should be reported to the relevant community welfare officer who will deal with the individual case. There are existing legislative provisions in place relating to the making of false statements for the purpose of obtaining payments from the Department.Responsibility for setting and enforcing housing standards rests with the local authorities. The community welfare service of the HSE is not qualified to undertake this work. However, accommodation occupied by rent supplement tenants should at least meet minimum housing standards. Under legislative provisions introduced by the Department in 2006 and 2007, the HSE can decide that a rent supplement may not be payable where it has been notified by a housing authority regarding non-compliance with housing standards.  Where a notification of non-compliance with standards is received from a housing authority in respect of an existing tenant, guidelines recommend that a community welfare officer discuss the situation with the tenant and take whatever action is necessary in the best interests of the tenant. The objective is to ensure that substandard accommodation does not come within rent supplementation.The HSE must be satisfied that accommodation funded under the rent supplement scheme is reasonably suited to the residential and other needs of the claimant. Where the HSE becomes aware of accommodation or blocks of accommodation which appears to it to be sub-standard, it notifies the local authority and it may advise prospective tenants at that premises that rent supplement will not be paid in respect of those tenancies.  Details of long-term rent supplement tenancies are provided to local authorities via the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government. Over 30,000 cases have been notified to date and this information sharing assists in enforcing housing standards. In addition, details of rent supplement tenancies are provided to the Private Residential Tenancies Board in order to ensure that tenancies are registered with the Board by landlords. Revenue generated from registration of new tenancies supports the inspection of housing standards.The Department has no plans to undertake research in the area of rent supplements. However, a review of the Housing (Standards for Rented Houses) Regulations 1993 is being undertaken by the Minister for State at the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government. The Department is feeding into that process as required, and will fully support the implementation of any provisions that impact on the rent supplement scheme. Departmental officials meet with Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government on a regular basis to discuss issues of common interest including standards for rented accommodation.  The Department is committed to supporting the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government Action Programme which aims to promote further improvement in private rented accommodation standards.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-06-25 00:00:00	Prelude	761	The supplementary welfare allowance scheme, which includes rent supplement, is administered on behalf of the Department by the community welfare division of the Health Service Executive. The purpose of the scheme is to provide short-term income support, in the form of a weekly or monthly payment, to eligible people living in private rented accommodation whose means are insufficient to meet their accommodation costs and who do not have accommodation available to them from any other source.The community welfare service must satisfy itself that an applicant for rent supplement has a genuine accommodation need for which he or she cannot provide, that a bona fide tenancy arrangement exists between the applicant and the landlord and that the property being rented is suitable to his or her needs.   In determining whether the accommodation is suited to the person's accommodation needs, a community welfare officer must establish the household composition, the size of the accommodation unit and identify any special needs that the person may have. As part of this process, the officer may carry out a visit to the residential premises in question.A community welfare officer has the flexibility and discretion to make payment of rent supplement in any case where it appears to him that the circumstances of the case so warrant, including cases where both parents have custody of a child but reside apart. Documentary evidence of child custody arrangements is normally required before a decision could be made on entitlement in such circumstances.  Every claim for rent supplement is determined having regard to the particular circumstances of the applicant.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-06-25 00:00:00	Prelude	762	Rent Supplement is administered on behalf of the Department by the community welfare division of the Health Service Executive. The purpose of the rent supplement scheme is to provide short-term income support to eligible tenants living in private rented accommodation, whose means are insufficient to meet their accommodation costs and who do not have accommodation available to them from any other source.The Department is committed to effective co-operation with the Revenue Commissioners and in this regard, details of rent supplemented tenancies, for many years, have been supplied to the Revenue Commissioners, in a format agreed with them. The information supplied pursuant to Section 888 of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997, consists of the full address of the tenancy, the name, address and telephone number of the landlord or agent and a statement of all payments arising from each individual tenancy. The Revenue Commissioners have indicated that they have had significant success in matching landlords of rent supplemented tenancies with their database of clients.Section 123 of the Finance Act 2007 requires that my Department and/or the HSE request a PPS No. or other tax reference number from the owner of premises in respect of which rent supplement is to be paid. The required data must be supplied to the Revenue Commissioners by my Department or advice to the effect that the landlord has not complied with the request for such information.   Section 123 of the Finance Act also requires the Department to request the landlord to furnish to the Department his or her PPS number. The Department is then required to transmit the PPS number to Revenue or to notify them if the landlord fails to provide this information.  The Revenue Commissioners have been formally advised that the Department is making the necessary arrangements to collect, record and transmit landlords PPS or tax reference number. The earliest implementation date is estimated to be October 2008. The timescale proposed is acceptable to the Revenue Commissioners who will not be in a position to process 2008 data until October 2009 i.e. when 2008 returns are due from the self employed.The scheme established by the Social Welfare Consolidated Act 2005 in relation to PPS numbers envisages the number being disclosed only to specified bodies for their public functions and does not envisage the PPS numbers being required to be disclosed to individuals. The Data Protection Commissioner has in the past, objected to the use of PPS numbers by non-public bodies. In the circumstances it would not be appropriate to require the tenant to request the landlords PPS number and for this reason the application form for rent supplement does not provide for collection of the number.  Section 473 of the Taxes Consolidation Act covers the relationship between the Revenue Commissioners and a tenant claiming tax relief and would only be relevant if the tenant receiving rent supplement is also claiming tax relief.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-06-25 00:00:00	Prelude	763	Child benefit is a universal payment, paid in respect of children up to the age of 16 years.  It continues to be paid in respect of children up to age 19 who are in full-time education, or who have a physical or mental disability.  The policy of the Government over the past number of years has been to substantially increase the amount spent on child benefit for all families.  Commitment to this policy is reflected in the significant resources invested in the scheme since 2001, increasing monthly payments to €166.00 for each of the first two children and €203.00 for the third and subsequent children from April 2008.In recognition of the need to target limited available resources at persons on low incomes with children in full-time education, a number of provisions have been introduced, including the extension of entitlement to an increase for qualified child to age 22 where the parent of a full-time student (including third level) is in receipt of either a long-term social welfare payment, or a short-term social welfare payment for six months or more (short-term schemes include such payments as jobseekers benefit and allowance, illness benefit and supplementary welfare allowance).The back to school clothing and footwear allowance is paid in respect of children in the most vulnerable families, at €200 for children aged 2 to 11 and at €305 for children aged 12 years and older.  In addition, in-work cash payments are provided to low-paid employees with families through the family income supplement scheme.  Under this scheme, a qualified child is any child under the age of 18 or aged 18 to 22 if in full-time education.  This supplement is paid where a family's weekly income is below a specified income threshold for the family size, and is calculated at 60% of the difference between the net family income (gross pay less tax, PRSI, health contribution, superannuation) and the relevant income threshold.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-06-25 00:00:00	Prelude	764	This transfer arises from a Government decision to reallocate certain functions to the Department from the Health Sector. It involves the transfer of Domiciliary Care Allowance, the associated Respite Care Grant, Blind Welfare Allowance, Infectious Diseases Maintenance Allowance and Mobility Allowance. Legislation contained in the Social Welfare and Pensions Act 2008 provides for the transfer of Domiciliary Care Allowance, Respite Care Grant and Blind Welfare Allowance. This legislation will come into effect in 2009 by commencement order when all other arrangements have been put in place.  In the case of Infectious Diseases Maintenance Allowance there are only 15 people currently in receipt of this allowance. It is proposed to transfer these recipients to another more appropriate income support payment at an equivalent rate of payment, and to discontinue the allowance. The transfer of Mobility Allowance will be considered in detail at a later stage.A detailed project plan is in place and significant progress is being made to ensure that the transfer of these payments runs smoothly as possible and without any disruption in service to recipients of these payments.  As part of the transfer programme a communication and consultation strategy has been devised by the Department and the HSE. This strategy commits to ongoing dialogue with all stakeholders associated with the transfer programme.A primary focus of the communications strategy must necessarily be directed towards service users and recipients of the system. The Department is also acutely aware of the importance of engaging in consultation with representative organisations. In this regard, regular updates are given to the Department's Disability Consultative Forum which is attended by a range of organisations representing people with disabilities. They are quite supportive of the transfer proposal and the approach being taken. The specific communication measures to occur in advance of the transfer include:Mailshots will be issued both by the HSE and the Department to existing recipients of these payments advising them fully on the transfer arrangements and about details of their individual payments.Fact sheets outlining the principal features of the transfer will be distributed to a wide range of information providers.Ongoing consultation with disability and carers representative organisations will occur.A comprehensive national media campaign will also be put in place to supplement the information programme.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-06-25 00:00:00	Prelude	765	I propose to take Questions Nos. 108, 189 and 190 together.In order to qualify for the maximum rate of the state pension (contributory) a person must, amongst other qualifying conditions, achieve a yearly average of at least 48 contributions paid or credited on his/her social insurance record over their working life. Reduced pensions are paid to those with yearly averages as low as 10 contributions.  Arrangements are also in place to cater for those with social insurance contributions at different rates, with contributions from other EU member States or countries with which Ireland has reciprocal social security agreements and with pre-1953 contributions. These arrangements have made it easier for people to qualify for a contributory pension.Measures are also in place to protect the social welfare pension entitlements of those who leave work to care for sick or elderly relatives. People who qualify for payments such as carer's allowance or carer's benefit may, subject to certain conditions, qualify for credited contributions.  The homemaker's scheme, which was introduced in and took effect from 1994, allows up to 20 years spent caring for children or incapacitated adults to be disregarded when a person's social insurance record is being averaged for pension purposes. This scheme applies to people who take time out of the workforce for caring duties but who do not qualify for credits through the carer's allowance or benefit schemes.Any person, including a carer, may pay voluntary contributions once they satisfy certain qualifying conditions. Voluntary contributions allow a person to remain insured once they leave the compulsory PRSI system.  To become a voluntary contributor a person must have at least 260 PRSI contributions paid in respect of either employment or self-employment and apply within 12 months of the end of the contribution year during which they last paid compulsory insurance or were last awarded a credited contribution.  From June 2006 the number of hours a person can engage in employment, self employment, education or training outside the home and still be eligible for carer's allowance, carer's benefit and the respite care grant was increased from 10 to 15 hours per week. Where a carer remains in employment he or she will continue to pay the appropriate social insurance contribution.Overall, I am satisfied that adequate arrangements are in place to protect the pension entitlements of people who leave employment to provide full-time care so that they can qualify for a contributory pension. There are, of course, people caring who cannot benefit from these measures. The position of these, and others who are at present not receiving support through the social welfare pension system was considered in the Green Paper on Pensions. A consultation process on the Green Paper was conducted recently.  The Government will respond to the process by developing a framework to address the pensions agenda over the longer term and I expect that this will be finalised before the end of the year. The position of those who are at present without a contributory pension entitlement will be considered in that context.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-06-25 00:00:00	Prelude	766	I propose to take Questions Nos. 109 and 121 together.The Department delivers a front-line service through a network of 60 Local Offices and 65 Branch Offices countrywide.   The main services provided from these offices include Jobseekers Payment, One-Parent Family Payment and an Information service.  The staffing levels in Local Offices are reviewed from time to time.  Following on the most recent reviews undertaken by the Management Services Unit of the Department as a consequence of the increasing Live Register, an additional 31 posts have been allocated to some 15 offices and the necessary assignments are currently being made.  This will not give rise to any curtailment of services in other areas of the Department.In the past few years the Department has coped with increasing demands arising from significant changes to the social welfare code and in the numbers of persons accessing the system.  Operational procedures and the organisation of work continue to be reviewed and restructured to maximise the benefits of technology and new developments in processing techniques and business information.  The department monitors the fluctuations in the live register on an ongoing basis in order to address any customer service issues.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-06-25 00:00:00	Prelude	767	The Working Group on Long Term Care was established in 2005 to identify the policy options for a financially sustainable system of long-term care. It comprises senior officials from the Departments of Finance, Health and Children and my Department. The report of that working group has influenced recent Budgets and the national partnership agreement Towards 2016. The Department of Health and Children published the report on its website in January 2008.Towards 2016 includes a commitment to a study of the extent to which children undertake inappropriate care roles in order to establish the extent and degree to which this issue arises and the levels of impact it has on the lives of children concerned. The Office of the Minister for Children, which has the lead role in relation to this study, has invited tenders for a research project on mechanisms to identify young carers aged 5-17 years and the positive and negative impact of caring on their lives and to make recommendations for ways in which they can be assisted. Officials from my Department have been working closely with that Office in that regard. It is expected that the study will begin in July 2008.I am aware of the particular difficulties faced by young carers and I accept that special help, advice and support are essential for young carers in particular and that services must be put in place to support the household and to ensure that young carers remain at school. These include the services of home helps, public health nurses and home care packages generally, which are a matter for my colleague, the Minister for Health and Children.The Department provides income support to carers by way of carer's allowance, carer's benefit and the respite care grant. The respite care grant, which is an annual payment for carers who look after certain people in need of full-time care and attention, is payable from age 16. The payment is made regardless of the carer's means or social insurance contributions but subject to certain qualifying conditions. From June 2008 the value of the grant was increased to €1,700 per year in respect of each care recipient. Carer's allowance, which provides income support to people who are providing full time care and attention to a person in need of such care and whose incomes fall below a certain limit, is payable from age 18.I am always prepared to consider changes to existing arrangements where these are for the benefit of recipients and financially sustainable within the resources available. However, I consider that it is through the provision of health and education services rather than income that we can best support young carers.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-06-25 00:00:00	Prelude	768	A person may qualify for payment of a back to school clothing and footwear allowance if they are in receipt of a social welfare or Health Service Executive (HSE) payment, or are participating in an approved employment scheme or attending a recognised education and training course and have household income below standard levels. The scheme provides a one-off payment to eligible families to assist with the extra costs when their children start school each autumn. The allowance is intended to provide assistance towards the cost of school clothing and footwear, not to meet the full cost.If a person is self-employed, they or their spouse may qualify in certain circumstances for jobseekers allowance or family income supplement subject to meeting the qualifying criteria of these schemes. Self-employed people may receive back to school clothing and footwear allowance provided they are receiving a qualifying payment, such as Family Income Supplement or Jobseekers Allowance. If a self-employed person is not in receipt of a qualifying payment such as jobseeker's allowance, then they will not qualify for the back to school clothing and footwear allowance.The back to school clothing and footwear allowance scheme is an important support for parents at a time of particular financial strain. I am satisfied that improvements to the scheme in recent years, namely an increase in income limits and an increase in the rates of payment respectively, provide a major boost to meeting the financial costs associated with return to school for those who most need assistance.  Any changes to the structure of the scheme, rates of payment, income limits or amendments to the qualifying criteria would have cost implications and would have to be considered in a budgetary context and in the light of resources available for improvements in social welfare payments generally.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-06-25 00:00:00	Prelude	769	The social welfare appeals process is quasi-judicial and the procedures are designed to ensure that every appellant's case gets full and satisfactory consideration. It is necessary for the Appeals Officer to be satisfied that he/she has all the facts before making a decision on a case. The Appeals Officer must give the person making the appeal and the Deciding Officer the opportunity to make their views known on the facts of the appeal. In addition, in some cases it may be necessary to have further investigations carried out by the Department's Social Welfare Inspectors or Medical assessors and this, of course, can give rise to inevitable time lags in processing appeals.In order to speed up the process, the Department introduced a right of review in 2002 to ensure that members of the public who receive adverse decisions could have them reviewed by Deciding Officers in the light of any new evidence they brought forward.  People whose claims are disallowed or who are otherwise dissatisfied with a decision are advised they should bring any new facts or evidence to the attention of the Deciding Officer in the first instance for re-examination and, if appropriate, a revised decision.  They are informed of this right is in addition to their right of appeal.  They can seek a Deciding Officer's review before making an appeal or can do both concurrently.  The right of appeal to the social welfare appeals office remains an option if the review by the deciding officer is not fruitful.I am advised that the Social Welfare Appeals Office deals with over 14,000 appeals on an annual basis and the provision of a prompt service remains a major customer service objective for the Office.  Available resources are prioritised to the greatest possible extent so as to achieve the best possible standard of service to its customers.  However, due to the quasi judicial nature of the social welfare appeals system, any improvements made in processing times must be achieved in a manner which is consistent with natural justice and the need to ensure that every appeal is fully investigated and determined on all its circumstances.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-06-25 00:00:00	Prelude	770	I propose to take Questions Nos. 116 and 127 together.In the context of social partnership The National Economic and Social Council (NESC) was asked to examine the feasibility of merging the family income supplement (FIS) with the increase for qualified children (IQC).  While NESC failed to reach a consensus on this issue, a research paper by Dr. John Sweeney was made available late in 2007 as a contribution to the debate. This included a proposal to abolish both FIS and IQCs in favour of a new means-tested payment, estimated by Dr. Sweeney at a net (additional) annual Programme cost of €775 million in 2006 terms. Such a payment would be distributed where appropriate by means of a refundable tax credit, and otherwise by cash transfer. Consideration of this scheme would raise a number of policy issues as well as posing significant administrative challenges.In view of the above, an examination of existing selective child income support measures is underway in the Department, adopting a two strand approach which includes an analysis of families already receiving FIS and an examination of qualifying families who may qualify for FIS but have not applied for payment and the underlying reasons for their failure to avail of FIS. The results of this study are expected to be available later this year.  This review, together with consideration of the issues raised in Dr. Sweeney's discussion paper, will inform future policy in this area. In considering any change, all policy, administrative and cost implications would, of course, be fully taken into account.  In developing future policy in this area it is important to keep in mind the multiple objectives behind the provision of child income support and to maintain the correct balance between broad based supports such as child benefit and more targeted supports such as FIS and IQCs.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-06-25 00:00:00	Prelude	771	I propose to take Questions Nos. 117 and 142 together.There is a constant balance to be maintained in ensuring that social welfare programmes provide an adequate safety net for those who need to avail of them and, at the same time, provide opportunities to assist people to become less welfare dependent. In this context, a number of measures have been introduced in recent years to remove disincentives to taking up employment and to assist in the transition from welfare to work.  These include the easing of means tests through income disregards, tapered withdrawal of benefits as earnings increase and the provision of employment supports.  Examples of disregards and the tapered approach include: the weekly cash disregard on one parent family payment (OPFP) and 50% assessment of the balance, with the earnings ceiling increased to €425 from May 2008 and payment of half rate OPFP for 6 months where earnings exceed €425; the earnings disregard which applies to people with disabilities when engaging in work of a rehabilitative nature, and the enhanced disregards of earnings introduced in 2007 in relation to the rent supplement scheme which complement the rental accommodation scheme that was introduced in 2004.Important progress in removing poverty and inactivity traps is also shown in two significant reforms which were introduced in September 2007. These improved the method by which a person's earnings from employment, or the earnings of their partner, are means tested and facilitate people in increasing their level of employment and income. This means that both adults associated with a jobseeker's allowance claim are now assessed in a similar manner and ensures that the families gain when earnings increase, encouraging qualified adults to move beyond long-term part-time employment.  These changes are designed, in particular, to be progressive for women, who currently make up the majority of qualified adults in the social welfare system. Under the previous assessment procedures a trap existed whereby the loss in benefits to a household could exceed the gain in income attained by an increase in the earnings of a partner. The improved assessment applies to jobseeker's allowance, disability allowance, farm assist and pre-retirement allowance.Family income supplement provides support for people in low-income employment with children, even where they have not previously been in receipt of a social welfare payment, preserving the incentive to take up or remain in employment.  Farm assist is a weekly means-tested payment for low income farmers, including those who may have off-farm employment or additional self-employment.  Recipients of various social welfare schemes may also qualify for a transitional payment under the back to work programme which provides for retention on a phased basis of their social welfare payment when taking up employment or self employment.It is important to ensure that work pays and a number of policy instruments crossing a range of Government Departments are used as a way of alleviating poverty amongst people in low wage employment. In addition to those already mentioned, these include changes to the taxation system, the introduction of the national minimum wage, provision of training and access to lifelong learning opportunities and assistance with job search.

There are 53 independent companies nationwide with over 240 money advice staff operating the service. Almost €18 million has been provided in 2008 to assist the MABS in dealing with its workload.  In 2007, MABS provided services to almost 12,500 new clients throughout the country and to date in 2008 some 6,600 new clients have approached the service. The MABS National Telephone Helpline, which was launched in October 2007, has dealt to date with over 5,500 calls.The issues that give rise to problems of over-indebtedness for people are highly complex.  Research shows that lack of information about money management can be a contributory factor in many cases. The cost and availability of credit for people on low incomes and the barriers they face in accessing mainstream and cheap forms of credit add to the difficulties people encounter in managing their finances. Officials of the Department have met, in the past, with the Department of Finance and continue to engage with the Financial Regulator on these matters.The MABS is making a unique and expert contribution to meeting the needs of people with debt difficulties in today's society.   This includes promoting greater awareness about household budgeting and shaping the strategies, especially those of services providers such as the banks and the credit unions, to ensure greater financial inclusion in Ireland.  The MABS works closely with the Financial Regulator in developing initiatives in this regard.  For example the MABS and the Financial Regulator have developed an education programme on money management for Transition Year students which will be rolled out to schools from September 2008.

Proposals to extend the free travel scheme to Irish born people living abroad and those receiving pensions from the Department have been examined and, in this regard, officials of the Department have engaged in discussions with EU Commission officials. However, at this stage, it has not been possible to progress the matter as, under EU legislation, discrimination on grounds of nationality is prohibited.  More recently, the European Commission has indicated that to extend the scheme to people in receipt of an Irish pension could also be considered discriminatory.

A working group, chaired by the Department of An Taoiseach, is working on developing the strategy.  The Department of Social and Family Affairs provides the secretariat to the working group which also includes representatives of the Departments of Finance, Health and Children and Enterprise, Trade and Employment as well as FÁS and the Health Service Executive.  To date, the working group has met on four occasions, in February, March, April and June 2008.Developing the strategy involves consultation with other government departments and bodies not represented on the working group.  The Department of Social and Family Affairs, on behalf of the working group, has met with a wide range of organisations including the Equality Authority, Combat Poverty Agency, Citizen's Information Board, the National Council on Ageing and Older People, the Office of the Revenue Commissioners, the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government and the National Disability Authority.  A request for submissions from the public was published in regional newspapers in early March.  The closing date for submissions was Friday 18 April 2008.  There was a good response from individuals and organisations and the submissions received are currently being examined."Towards 2016" commits the Department to hosting an annual consultation meeting of carer representative groups and relevant government departments and agencies.  Such a meeting was held on 23 January 2008.  Representatives of 12 groups and 9 departments and agencies attended.  The theme was the National Carers' Strategy and groups were given an opportunity to comment on the draft terms of reference and to raise other issues considered relevant in the context of the strategy.  It is intended to hold a second meeting with carer groups.  The commitment to the development of a National Carers' Strategy also includes a commitment to appropriate consultation with the social partners.  The first of two consultation meetings with the social partners was held on 8 May 2008.  Key issues raised were recognition for carers and their work, access to suitable health services, income support, training, gender issues and balancing employment and care.  It is intended to publish the strategy later this year.

The industrial action being taken involves non co-operation with lunchtime opening in the Department's local offices and a ban on answering phones at lunchtime.  Every effort is being made by the Department to minimise inconvenience to the public arising as a result of the industrial action and to bring about a resolution of the dispute.  In this regard, officials from my Department recently attended two meetings in the Labour Relations Commission.  A further meeting in the Labour Relations Commission has been arranged.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-06-25 00:00:00	Prelude	776	The telephone allowance is a component of the household benefits package which also includes the electricity/gas allowance and free television license schemes.  The package is generally available to people living in the State, aged 66 years or over who are in receipt of a social welfare payment or who satisfy a means test.  It is also available to people aged under 66 who are in receipt of certain social welfare disability payments or carer's allowance.  There are currently in the region of 355,000 people in receipt of the household benefits at an annual cost of €317 million.The primary objective of the telephone allowance scheme is to ensure access to help in an emergency and to provide an element of security.  A secondary objective is to encourage social contact and to assist in the prevention of social isolation for those living alone.  The Department has endeavoured to meet the demands of deregulation, notably in the telecoms market, where it supports multiple providers within the fixed line telephone business.A restructuring of the telephone allowance to a cash value was undertaken in 2003 and this has facilitated the inclusion of additional providers in the scheme since July 2004.  The scheme was further extended to include mobile phones in April 2007 as a result of improvements announced in Budget 2007.  Since then, people have the choice of either opting for a direct credit to a telephone company for their landline or for a cash payment in respect of their mobile phone.  This means that it is no longer necessary for a person to have a fixed line phone in order to benefit from the telephone allowance.  There are currently approximately 15,000 people availing of the mobile phone option.  In addition, the value of the telephone allowance was increased in line with general price increases in August 2007 from €296 per annum to €310.80 per annum.The Programme for Government includes a commitment to extend the scheme further to incorporate broadband services for older people.  The Department is currently examining how best to implement this commitment.  It should be noted that where people access the internet using a landline, the telephone allowance applies to their bill usage and will cover the cost of calls or internet usage up to the level of their allowance.

Responsibility for issues relating to paternity leave rests with the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform.  Following commitments made in the social partnership agreement "Towards 2016", a Working Group led by the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform has been convened to review the level of provision of maternity leave and of paternity leave. The Group is currently examining options with regards to both maternity and paternity provision and is due to conclude its deliberations before the end of 2008.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-06-25 00:00:00	Prelude	778	The school meals programme gives funding towards provision of food services for disadvantaged school children through two schemes.  The first is the long-standing statutory urban school meals scheme, operated by local authorities and part-financed by the Department.  The second is the school meals local projects scheme through which funding is provided by the Department to participating schools and local and voluntary community groups who run specific school meals projects.  The school meals programme has expanded significantly in recent years and this trend will continue throughout 2008.  Expenditure on the programme increased from €13.6m in 2006 to €28.2m in 2007, and is expected to be in the region of €32m in 2008. In 2006, 1,394 schools and almost 125,000 pupils benefited from the programme and this increased to over 189,000 pupils in 1,900 schools in 2007.The decision to operate a school food project or to apply for funding under the school meals local projects scheme rests with the school itself.  Funding under the scheme is targeted at disadvantaged school children and is intended to assist schools or groups who are operating their own school food projects with the food costs of the project only. Responsibility for all aspects of the day-to-day operation of the scheme lies with the school.  Demand for funding under the school meals local projects scheme remains high. Additional funding in 2008 will be used to include more DEIS schools in the scheme.  The focus of the school meals scheme will remain on disadvantaged children and the inclusion of all eligible DEIS schools will continue to be the main priority for the scheme.

Farm operators normally pay Class A social insurance contributions and therefore, subject to satisfying the contribution and medical requirements, would be entitled to the full range of illness and disability payments. Should they suffer from a specified illness related to their employment or an accident while at work they can apply for injury benefit which would be paid for a period of 26 weeks.A person who acquires an illness or disability outside the work environment, or who is still unable to work after 26 weeks of receiving injury benefit, may qualify for illness benefit.  They must meet certain medical and contribution requirements in order to receive this payment which can be paid for a period of 52 weeks or, if more than 260 contributions have been paid, may continue indefinitely.  A person who does not satisfy the contribution conditions for illness benefit, and whose means are below a prescribed level, may qualify for disability allowance instead.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-06-25 00:00:00	Prelude	780	The Civil Public and Services Union (CPSU), the union which represents clerical and supervisory grades in the civil service, is currently engaged in industrial action in pursuit of a claim for the extension of flexi time bands in the Department.  Initially, the industrial action commenced with the withdrawal of co-operation with the implementation of a new Time and Attendance (T&A) system by the Department.  The implementation of the new system had been agreed in November 2006 as part of the Department's "Towards 2016" Modernisation Action Plan, progress on which has been the basis for pay awards under the Agreement.  Industrial action was escalated with effect from 28 April 2008 to include the withdrawal of lunch-time service to the public at the Department's local offices and not answering telephones during the lunch-time period across the Department.  Discussions at departmental level, in the course of which the Department made a number of moves aimed at resolving the issue, did not yield a positive result.Following the intervention of the National Implementation Body (NIB), the parties were referred to facilitation discussions at the Labour Relations Commission (LRC).  At the end of two sessions, on 29 May and 12 June, agreement was not reached.  The CPSU escalated industrial action, with effect from 16 June, to include not answering telephones in all of the Department's offices and a ban on overtime.  However, on foot of a statement issued by the National Implementation Body on 19 June 2008 and the agreement of both the Department and the CPSU to engage in further discussions in the Labour Relations Commission, the CPSU stood down the escalated action that had been in effect from Monday 16 June.  In accordance with the recommendation of the National Implementation Body the discussions at the LRC are to be completed by 1 July 2008.Pending resolution of the dispute the Department's local offices will be closed and telephones will not be answered during lunch-hour.  However, apart from this, services are being provided as normal.  Clients who may be unable to attend at a local office during current opening hours may continue to make application for various payments by post.  Application forms are widely available at post offices, Citizens Information Bureaus and on the Department's website www.welfare.ie.  It is not envisaged that the current dispute will lead to delays in payments, but the matter will be kept under review.   I was reassured to hear the Assistant General Secretary of the Civil Public and Services Union, state in an interview on national radio that "nobody's payment will be affected" and that it will continue to be a priority that "nobody suffers in terms of payments".
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-06-25 00:00:00	Prelude	781	The overall goal in the National Action Plan for social inclusion is to reduce the number of those experiencing consistent poverty or basic deprivation to between 2 per cent and 4 per cent by 2012, with the aim of eliminating consistent poverty by 2016.  The rate of consistent poverty was 6.5 per cent in 2006 (latest figures available), down from 8.2 per cent in 2003.  The proportion actually in poverty is often confused with the bigger proportion identified as being "at risk of poverty".  People who fall into that category have incomes below a set threshold, which in the EU has been set at 60 per cent of average median income.  This threshold increased in Ireland by 98 per cent from €102.44 in 1997 to €202.49 in 2006, as a result of the rapid increases in household incomes generally, due to the exceptional economic growth.  Over the same period prices (Consumer Price Index) increased by 35.8 per cent, average industrial earnings increased by 61.8 per cent and basic social welfare payments by 99.7 per cent.The "at risk of poverty" measure, therefore, does not indicate that a majority of this group are in poverty, but that despite substantial improvements in income, the rate of improvement in living standards for those on lower incomes has not fully kept pace with the very rapid growth in incomes generally over recent years.  However this trend is also being reversed.  The percentage of persons "at risk of poverty" reduced from 19.7 per cent in 2003 to 17.0 per cent in 2006. Ireland's comparative position with other EU Member States has also improved, having reduced from the third highest "at risk of poverty" rate in 2005 to tenth highest in 2006.The NAPinclusion 2007-2016, and Chapter 10 of the National Development Plan 2007-13 are designed to build on the substantial progress already made.  The Government's priority aim under the National Action Plans is to provide, over the coming years, the extra assistance and support over a whole range of policies to lift the most vulnerable in our society out of poverty and to enable those on low incomes generally, especially children, to steadily improve their living standards towards the norms prevailing in Irish society.  These are ambitious objectives, and the means to achieve these objectives are in the strategic plans.  The Government are fully committed to their implementation.

#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-06-25 00:00:00	Prelude	783	I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that the Excise and VAT content of a litre of Diesel, based on a price of €1.43 per litre are as follows:Price per litreExcise contentVAT contentTotal TaxExcise as a % of priceVAT as a % of priceTotal tax as a % of price(cent)(cent)(cent)(cent)Diesel143.036.824.861.625.7%17.4%43.1%I would point out that excise duty rates on fuels in Ireland are relatively low by EU standards.  Excise rates for diesel, petrol and other fuel oils have not been increased in the last four Budgets. The Exchequer yield from excise, as excise is set at a nominal amount, does not increase as the price of fuels increase. On the other hand, the yield from VAT, as VAT is set as a percentage of the price, increases as the price of fuels increase.  However, in this regard it should be borne in mind that to the extent that spending in the economy is re-allocated to petrol, diesel and other oil products, and away from other VAT liable spending, and to the extent that the overall level of economic activity is reduced by higher oil prices, there may be little or no net gain to the Exchequer.  In relation to VAT, I should also point out that businesses are of course entitled to reclaim VAT incurred on their business inputs, including VAT incurred on diesel, as a deductible credit.

While the amount of the Grant-In-Aid shows an increase each year, it is in fact a diminishing percentage of the yearly income of the IPA.Year€20043,237,00020053,318,00020063,401,00020073,500,000All Government Departments are members of the IPA with their subscription included as part of the Grant-in-Aid.  An expenditure review of the Grant-in-Aid to the IPA was completed in 2005. The review recommended that the Grant-in-Aid continue with the proviso that the IPA submits an annual performance statement to the Department as part of the estimates process. The first of these statements will accompany the 2007 accounts when presented.The IPA provides a wide variety of training, education, research, consultancy and publishing services in relation to public administration to the civil service and the public service. The Civil Service Training and Development Centre (CSTDC) has primary responsibility for training and staff development policy within the civil service and also delivers a range of training products for civil servants; however it does not deliver third level education programmes. The Expenditure Review confirmed that the Grant-in-Aid primarily supports the IPA's third level and higher level education and research activities. There is therefore no overlap between the services of the CSTDC and the grant-supported activities of the IPA.The IPA carries out research that is focused specifically on public administration matters and/or best practices in particular areas of public sector management.  The absence of the IPA would result in individual Government Departments commissioning such research at a potentially higher cost. Unlike other educational institutions many of the courses provided by the IPA have a particular focus on the public sector. The publishing function is a resource that satisfies a small but vital market; its published material is important to students, teachers and researchers. The Institute's extensive collection of books and journals makes it a major resource for the study of the public sector. Without support it is quite likely the important material produced by the Institute would not be available.  The IPA is subject to the normal procurement rules when tendering for training and/or development programmes.
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-06-25 00:00:00	Prelude	785	The 2003 EU Energy Tax Directive incorporated  special derogations which allowed specific excise duty reliefs to be applied in a number of Member States. In the Irish context, these derogations allowed inter alia for reduced rates to apply to fuel used for public transport services which includes school transport services. While these derogations expired on 31 December 2006, Ireland, along with other Member States, sought retention of its derogations beyond that date. However the European Commission, who is the deciding authority, refused such requests.  The Finance Act 2008, as the Deputy is aware, consequently provided the legislative changes to withdraw the relief in respect of fuel used for public passenger transport vehicles. The relief will be withdrawn with effect from 1 November 2008 and the appropriate full excise rates will apply from that date. In the circumstances outlined above the question of reconsidering or deferring the withdrawal of the existing relief does not therefore arise.The Department of Transport and other relevant line Departments have, in conjunction with my Department, explored alternative mechanisms that might be used to direct Exchequer resources toward such services from that date, subject of course to compatibility with competition and EU State Aid requirements. While the matter is still being considered it is necessary however to stress, despite the claims being made otherwise, that introducing an alternative suitable mechanism is not a straightforward matter.

Having said that, I would point out to the Deputy that this Government has provided significant supports to home owners with large mortgages. In Budget 2008, the ceiling for first-time buyer mortgage interest relief was increased to €10,000 for a single person and €20,000 for a married couple or widowed person, fulfilling the commitment contained in the Government programme. The increase in Budget 2008 follows on from the increase in interest relief for first-time buyers in Budget 2007.   In that Budget, the ceiling for first-time buyers was doubled from €4,000 for a single person and €8,000 for a married couple or widowed to €8,000 for a single person and €16,000 for a married couple or widowed person.Cumulatively, therefore, as a result of the two Budgets, first-time buyers have obtained additional relief of up to €100 per month, if single, or €200 per month, if married or widowed, subject to paying sufficient mortgage interest to avail of the relief.  In addition to the increase in mortgage interest relief, the limit of the exemption from income tax which applies to rent received when a person rents out a room or rooms in his or her principal private residence was increased from €7,620 to €10,000 in Budget 2008.

My Department has been advised by the Appeals Office that up to the 13th June 2008, 3,359 completed appeal forms have been received.  1,206 of these completed appeal forms were received in 2007 and 2,153 completed appeal forms have been received in 2008.Following the establishment of the Appeals Office a temporary appeals officer was seconded from the Chief State Solicitor's Office.  Subsequently, a recruitment process was undertaken by the Public Appointments Service and a panel of appeal officers has been established.  A second appeals officer is due to begin work shortly.  In addition, four administrative staff support the work of the appeals officer.The appeals officer must investigate each appeal independently, his investigations can require additional reviews by the Health Service Executive and the Scheme Administrator and certain appeals present a high level of complexity.  In addition a very high percentage of appellants have requested an Oral Hearing and, up to the 13th June 2008, the appeals officer has completed 555 Oral Hearings at locations around the country.  The appeals officer has carefully and thoroughly considered and assessed 1,612 appeals and he has issued decisions to each of these appellants.  Taking the 193 appeals which have been withdrawn into account the Health Repayment Scheme Appeals Office currently has 1,554 appeals awaiting a decision.

#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-06-25 00:00:00	Prelude	797	Almost 130,000 people work full-time or part-time in our public health services.  In recent years, the Government's ongoing high level of investment in health has achieved and maintained significant increases in the numbers of doctors, nurses and other healthcare professionals employed in the public health services.  The Government has also invested heavily in the education and training of such personnel in order to secure a good supply of graduates to provide for the healthcare needs of the population into the future.Subject to overall parameters set by Government, the Health Service Executive has the responsibility for determining the composition of its staffing complement. In that regard, it is a matter for the Executive to manage and deploy its human resources to best meet the requirements of its Annual Service Plan for the delivery of health and personal social services to the public.  The Executive is the appropriate body to consider the matter raised by the Deputy.  My Department has requested the Parliamentary Affairs Division of the Executive to arrange to have the matter investigated and to have a reply issued directly to the Deputy.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-06-25 00:00:00	Prelude	798	Policy in the delivery of health services has been determined by Government as the development of health services in all regions of the country, capable of providing safe, high-quality services that achieve the best possible outcomes for patients in primary care settings or when accessing a hospital service. My Department has developed a broad range of strategy documents and associated policies to guide it in its work.  The National Health Strategy, Quality and Fairness — A Health System for You, was announced by Government in 2001 to provide vision and strategic direction for the health and personal social services. The Strategy sets out the key objectives for the health system up to 2010, which are centred on four national goals of Better Health for Everyone, Fair Access, Responsiveness and Appropriate Care Delivery and High Performance.The Health Reform Programme derives from Quality and Fairness.  It was clear that new structures and supporting processes were required to best meet current and future health needs as expressed in the goals and objectives of the Strategy. The Health Reform Programme also comprehends the Primary Care Strategy as well as the Prospectus, Brennan and Hanley Reports. These reports are guiding the future of the health service in that they layout the overall direction for the major changes in the health services and how they should be addressed and delivered in the coming years.Another contributor to the way in which policy in the delivery of health services is being determined are the targets and objectives set out  in Towards 2016, the current national social partnership agreement. The Government and social partners have agreed to work together to deliver tangible improvements in the health outcomes for all sectors of Irish society, including children, young adults, people of working age, older people and people with disabilities. The negotiating partners involved in agreeing the shared overall goals contained in Towards 2016 included the Government, trade unions, employers, farming organisations and the community and voluntary sector. The Government and social partners have agreed to continue to work together over a ten-year period to further develop and enhance the health care system in this country.The Reform Programme is an enormous challenge, which will require the ongoing commitment of all relevant parties over the coming years. It is my belief that the policies and mechanisms currently being implemented by my Department will further advance the development of a world class health service in the years to come.  Given the wide range of interested parties currently inputting to the provision of an effective healthcare system, I do not consider it necessary to establish a national health care forum.

#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-06-25 00:00:00	Prelude	803	A core function of the Health Information and Quality Authority (HIQA) is to set standards on safety and quality of health services and to monitor enforcement of those standards in an open and transparent way. The Health Act 2007 gives HIQA strong powers in this area in relation to services provided by the Health Service Executive (HSE) and bodies funded by the HSE to provide services on their behalf.  The process by which such a regulatory regime is introduced first in the public sector is a feature of similar developments in other jurisdictions.   A system of inspection of private nursing homes has been in place within the HSE for a number of years and arrangements are currently being made to transfer this function to HIQA as provided for under the Health Act 2007. The extension of this type of monitoring and control to other areas of the private health sector will involve further legislation of a complex nature.The Commission on Patient Safety and Quality Assurance was established last year to develop proposals for a health service wide system of governance based on corporate accountability for the quality and safety of all health services.  One of its terms of reference is to specifically examine and make recommendations in relation to a statutory system of licensing for public and private health care providers and services.  The Commission is due to report by the end of July this year.  There is already in existence extensive legislation governing the activities of healthcare professionals which includes those operating in the private sector.  I will consider what additional appropriate regulatory framework should be applied to public and private healthcare providers and services when I receive the report of the Commission on Patient Safety and Quality Assurance.

In addition, certain elements were under review pending the outcome of a court case which was withdrawn last year);Commission Directive 2006/141/EC of 22 December 2006 on infant formulae and follow-on formulae and amending Directive 1999/21/EC (the main part of this Directive has been transposed with one other element outstanding) andCommission Directive 2007/68/EC of 27 November, 2007 amending Annex IIIa to Directive 2000/13/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council as regards certain food ingredients.These Directives are being dealt with by my Department and will be transposed as soon as possible.  In addition, there are a number of recently issued Directives relevant to my Department that are not yet due for transposition.  It is intended that these Directives will be transposed and implemented on time.  In view of the volume of Directives involved in the 35 years since 1973, I am not in a position to provide the Deputy with a list of the numbers and titles of those Directives relevant to my Department since that time.  However all such Directives are published in the Official Journals of the European Communities.

Projects are approved through the Dublin Transportation Office's TMG Committee and are implemented by the relevant local authorities.

#NoelDempsey	unknown-#NoelDempsey-party	unknown-#NoelDempsey-dob	unknown-#NoelDempsey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-06-25 00:00:00	Prelude	807	The EU Energy Tax Directive incorporated special derogations which allowed specific excise duty reliefs to be applied in a number of Member States below the EU minimum duty rate.  In the case of public transport services under my responsibility, these derogations included reduced rates to apply to fuel used for scheduled bus services. Scheduled bus services comprise bus passenger services provided by Bus Átha Cliath, Bus Eireann, private operators in accordance with bus route licences under the 1932 Road Transport Act and holders of Authorisations pursuant to European Council Regulation 684/92 as amended.  While these derogations expired on 31 December 2006, Ireland, along with other Member States, sought retention of its derogations beyond that date.  However the European Commission, which is the deciding authority, has to date refused all such requests.  The Finance Act 2008 provided the basis for the removal of these excise duty reliefs with effect from 1 November 2008.My Department, in conjunction with the Department of Finance and other Departments, has been exploring whether alternative support mechanisms could be appropriate and could be done in a manner compatible with EU State Aid and other legal requirements.  My Department has also met the Coach Tourism and Transport Council, as well as CIE, on this matter.  My Department has also received a written submission from the Coach Tourism and Transport Council.  While my Department is in discussion with the Department of Finance on these issues, it is necessary to stress that, despite claims being made otherwise, introducing an alternative suitable mechanism is not a straightforward matter in the current economic climate.

#PeterPowerFF	unknown-#PeterPowerFF-party	unknown-#PeterPowerFF-dob	unknown-#PeterPowerFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-06-25 00:00:00	Prelude	810	The humanitarian situation across Somalia remains grave, particularly in and around Mogadishu and I remain deeply concerned for the safety and well-being of Somalis and the aid community seeking to assist them. In what was already a precarious environment for humanitarian agencies, security and access have deteriorated even further in 2008. Security issues for those seeking to deliver relief in Somalia include random violence, piracy, kidnapping threats, the non-discriminating scourge of landmines and general banditry.I welcome the recent Djibouti Agreement, brokered by the UN Secretary-General's Special Representative for Somalia, but many armed groups remain outside the process. My officials will continue to raise the situation in Somalia in the appropriate fora, including in our bilateral consultations with UN agencies.  Ireland has made substantial efforts to raise the crisis in Somalia at the EU level. Conclusions adopted by the General Affairs and External Relations Council on 16 June called for unimpeded humanitarian access for relief agencies in Somalia and urged all parties to comply fully with international humanitarian law.Ireland's commitment to the ongoing crisis in Somalia is demonstrated by our status as the seventh largest bilateral contributor to humanitarian endeavour in Somalia in 2007 when we provided funding of over €7 million.  In response to the 2008 United Nations appeal for Somalia, funding of €3.1 million has been provided to key UN humanitarian agencies in support of food security, health, shelter and coordination. Irish Aid also supports the work of Concern in Somalia and, since 2007, has allocated €2.67 million to its work in that country.An Irish Concern development worker is currently based in Nairobi, Kenya from where support is provided to Concern's Somalian staff in-country. World Vision Ireland also received €1,237,521 from Irish Aid in 2007 for its work in Somalia while Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) received €700,000 in the same year. The above commitment has been complemented by three successive deployments of members of the Rapid Response Corps to assist UNHCR with their work for Somalia.  I will communicate with the Deputy the addresses of the organisations concerned.

However, Zimbabwean Government representatives have made clear their refusal to accept monitors from the EU. As will be appreciated it is simply not possible to monitor elections without host country consent.  I utterly condemn the systematic campaign of state-sponsored political violence and intimidation which has made it impossible to hold free and fair elections and which left Morgan Tsvangirai no option but to withdraw from the run-off against President Mugabe. It appears as if the elections may nevertheless proceed. If so, the outcome of such a charade can have no legitimacy.I strongly welcome the clear and unequivocal position taken by the UN Security Council on Monday in unanimously condemning the violence, which has led to scores of deaths. It is imperative now that the international community continue to speak with one voice and work together to resolve the crisis and chart a democratic future which reflects the wishes of the people of Zimbabwe. The African Union and governments in the region, especially South Africa, have a particular responsibility to bring all possible influence to bear.

The Joint Committee is to be congratulated on the quality of its report.  The report clearly identified the need to establish EU business as part of the regular routine of both Houses of the Oireachtas. I fully support that objective.  Following last week's day-long debate in this House, the Government will be undertaking a detailed analysis of the outcome of the Referendum and its implications. I expect that the Houses of the Oireachtas and the relevant Joint Committees will have an important role to play in exploring the various issues that arose during the referendum campaign.

During the course of consideration of possible locations, it was brought to the Department's attention that there was a suitable site, already in State ownership, at Carrickcarnan, Co Louth. This site is visible from the motorway from both the Northern and Southern approaches, it is easy to access and already has preliminary car parking facilities.  On 7 March of this year, it was announced that the Monument would be located at this site.In relation to the overall development of the Peace Monument, a Project Steering Group has been established, including representatives from the Department of the Taoiseach, the Office of Public Works and my own Department. The former Taoiseach, Mr. Bertie Ahern T.D., announced in April last that €5 million would be allocated towards the project. €2 million was provided in this Department's Estimates for 2008 to take forward the necessary work.

This responsibility rests with the Departments which are responsible for our national legislative and regulatory framework in the policy areas covered by individual Directives.  I would recall that the volume of Directives adopted at EU level since 1973 is very substantial and that Ireland has benefited greatly over the past 35 years from the successful elaboration and implementation of EU law.

#MartinCullen	unknown-#MartinCullen-party	unknown-#MartinCullen-dob	unknown-#MartinCullen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-06-25 00:00:00	Prelude	816	Under the Sports Capital Programme, which is administered by the Department, funding is allocated to sporting and community organisations at local, regional and national level throughout the country. The aim of the Programme is to maximise participation in sport through the provision of modern high quality, safe, well-designed and sustainable facilities and sports equipment.  The provision of such facilities allows for increased numbers to participate in sport.The position is that under the Sports Capital Programme, grantees in receipt of funding over a specified level must enter into a Deed of Covenant and Charge in order to protect the Minister's interest and ensure that the property remains in sporting use.  To date, €290,790 has been allocated to this group in 2001, 2006 & 2007 under the Sports Capital Programme and a Deed of Covenant and Charge is currently being drafted to cover this amount.  It is also the case that the grantees have taken out a loan and the bank in question has placed a legal charge on the grantee's property.  The ranking of charges placed on a grantee's land is regulated by means of a Priority Agreement.  In such situations it is my Department's established practice to seek a valuation of the lands in question from the grantees, so that it may determine whether the property may bear the burden of the combined charges.In this instance, it is proposed that the bank's charge ranks first in priority.  The valuation provided by the grantees, however, means that the combined value of the prospective bank loan and cumulative grant allocations is in excess of the current valuation.  You will appreciate that serious consideration must be given to this matter and my Department will make every effort to progress these issues with the grantee's solicitors through the CSSO.

#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-06-25 00:00:00	Prelude	818	The Department of Social and Family Affairs administers a number of schemes designed to help working families on low incomes.  Family income supplement is the principal income support for people in low-income employment with children. It is designed to provide the incentive to remain in, or take up, employment rather than be fully welfare dependent. Qualification for payment under this scheme requires that a person must be engaged in insurable employment for a minimum of 38 hours per fortnight. A couple may combine their hours of employment to meet the qualification criteria.Improvements to FIS include the change of assessment from a gross income basis to net income, the increase to €20 per week in the minimum payment and, in recent years, the re-focusing of income thresholds to include additional gains for larger families.  If a low income worker does not work sufficient hours to claim FIS, there is a range of other payments which may be more appropriate. For instance, people working up to three days per week may instead apply for a jobseeker's payment, provided they are unemployed for the remainder of the week and continue to seek full-time work. Entitlement can be either insurance based (jobseeker's benefit) or means-based (jobseeker's allowance).The part-time job incentive scheme is available to those who were previously on a jobseeker's payment for 15 months or more and are now working under 24 hours per week while seeking full-time employment. This payment is not means-tested.  Farm assist is a weekly means-tested payment for low income farmers, including those who may have off-farm employment or self-employment.  In addition, many social welfare payments, including one parent family payment and disability allowance provide for earnings disregards and tapered withdrawal of payments as earnings increase.  Any changes to the qualifying criteria of any scheme can only be considered in a budgetary context.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-06-25 00:00:00	Prelude	819	The free travel scheme is available to all people living in the State aged 66 years or over. All carers in receipt of carer's allowance and carers of people in receipt of constant attendance or prescribed relative's allowance, regardless of their age, receive a free travel pass. It is also available to people under age 66 who are in receipt of certain disability type welfare payments, such as disability allowance, invalidity pension and blind person's pension. At the end of 2007, there were over 630,000 free travel passes in issue. A more detailed breakdown of this number by scheme can be found in the Appendix.There have been significant improvements to the scheme in recent years. In September 2006, all peak time restrictions were removed so that pass holders can now travel free on participating services at any time.  In spring 2007, the all-Ireland free travel scheme was introduced. This scheme is based on a reciprocal agreement between the Department and the Department for Regional Development in Northern Ireland, which operates the Northern Ireland concessionary fares scheme. Under the scheme, free travel pass holders aged 66 or over can travel free on services operating within Northern Ireland and senior smartpass holders aged over 65 from Northern Ireland can travel free on participating services here.

However, those in question have benefited from a range of improvements in social welfare schemes in recent years.  Widows and widowers can qualify for one of a number of different schemes depending on their particular circumstances. The contributory widow(er)'s pension is available to those who satisfy the necessary PRSI contribution conditions, either on their own record or that of the deceased spouse. People qualifying for this benefit are not subject to a means test.People without the necessary PRSI contributions can, if they have qualifying children, receive the one-parent family payment. This is a means tested payment which comprises an earnings disregard, designed to assist with the extra costs lone parents with children face in trying to access training or employment.  Up to €146.50 of earnings per week is completely disregarded, while earnings in excess of that and up to €425 per week are assessed at 50%. In addition, people whose earnings have risen above €425 per week may be entitled to half of their payment for up to 26 weeks.  The widowed parent grant, introduced in 2000, provides additional assistance following a bereavement to those with children and is paid in addition to the usual after death payments such as the bereavement grant, currently €850. The widowed parent grant was increased by €2,000 to €6,000 in the last Budget in recognition of the particular difficulties faced by widows and widowers with children on the death of a spouse.The social welfare budget 2008 enhanced the value of all weekly rates of payment, including the rate of widow's and widower's pensions, in relative terms, by giving increases well in excess of projected inflation for this year. Younger widows and widowers benefited from the €12 per week increase in the weekly rates of payment for persons of working age. This increase brings the rates of payment for widows and widowers to €197.80 per week for non-contributory payments and €203.30 for contributory payments.  Increases in the rates of child benefit assist those widowed with children. Since 1997, the monthly rates of child benefit have been increased significantly in accordance with Government commitments.Following Budget 2008 the rates of child benefit were increased to €166.00 per month for each of the first and second children and €203.00 per month for the third and subsequent children. In addition, the annual early childcare supplement (ECS) announced in Budget 2006 and applicable to children under 6 years of age was increased by €100 per annum. Furthermore, widows and widowers with children also benefited from the increase in the child dependant allowances to €24 per week.  Widowed people are also entitled to the fuel allowance, back to school clothing and footwear allowance and other secondary benefits on the same basis as other social welfare recipients. Under the terms of the supplementary welfare allowance scheme, an exceptional needs payment (ENP) may be made to help meet an essential, once-off cost which the applicant is unable to meet out of his/her own resources. Eligible people would normally be in receipt of a social welfare payment (including widow(er)'s pension) or health service executive payment.The level of increases and other improvements announced in the Budget were a further demonstration of this Government's ongoing commitment to the most vulnerable in our society. I will continue to keep the range and adequacy of the supports provided under review.

The extension of the scheme to all carers was introduced in Budget 2005. The Grant is payable from the first Thursday in June of the year in question.

Such refusals are based on the advice of the Department's Chief Medical Advisor, whose advice is in turn based on information supplied on the application form by the General Practitioner of the person being cared for.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-06-25 00:00:00	Prelude	822	The Department currently has bilateral social security agreements with 7 countries, and also social security arrangements under EU Regulations with the other 26 EU countries, 3 EEA countries, and Switzerland. These arrangements are generally working satisfactorily.  The time taken to process claims that fall to be examined under bilateral agreements can be longer than that for standard Irish entitlements, reflecting the added complexity that arises in determining entitlements under these agreements and the necessity to obtain the relevant foreign insurance details.Liaison procedures to ensure the secure transfer of personal data have been established with each country and are kept under review.  Regular contact is made with the appropriate agencies to ensure the accuracy, completeness and timeliness of transfer of the information required to decide on claims.  Delays, in general, occur where people have had a varied employment history over a long period and this can lead to some difficulties in completing their full insurance record.   Where particular delays occur in the exchange of information, every effort is made to minimise delays, having regard to ensuring people receive their full and correct entitlements.Pension applications from people who have worked in the UK represent the largest category of claims under bilateral agreements. The Department has established a very good working relationship with the U.K. Department of Work and Pensions, with regular direct communication on operational matters.  Delays in processing applications do not result in any losses to pensioners in that those who qualify for payment, receive payment from the due entitlement date.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-06-25 00:00:00	Prelude	823	The back to education allowance (BTEA) is an educational opportunities scheme for unemployed people, lone parents and people with disabilities in receipt of particular social welfare payments.  It affords them the opportunity to undertake approved second or third level courses of education to improve their skills and qualifications and, consequently, their prospects of returning to the active work force.  The objective of the scheme is to enhance the employability skills of vulnerable groups who are distant from the labour market.  It is paid at a standard weekly rate equivalent to the maximum personal rate of the relevant social welfare payment that qualifies the applicant for participation in the scheme. Increases for qualified adult and child dependants are also payable, where appropriate.  In addition, an annual cost of education allowance of €500 is payable.To qualify for BTEA a person must be in receipt of a primary social welfare payment which, depending on the scheme, could be subject to the habitual residence condition.  The requirement to be habitually resident in Ireland was introduced as a qualifying condition for certain social assistance schemes and child benefit with effect from 1 May 2004.   It was introduced in the context of the Government's decision to open the Irish labour market to workers from the new EU Member States without the transitional limitations which were being imposed at that time by many of the other Member States.  The operation of the habitual residence condition was reviewed in 2006 and a report of the review published in 2007.  There are no plans to change this condition.The current back to education scheme has been subject to review and modification over the years to ensure that it continues to support those people who are most distant from the labour market and whose need is greatest.  The number of people availing of the scheme is at its highest ever level, with more than 8,800 participants in the last academic year.  I am satisfied that, overall, the current arrangements applying to the back to education allowance meet the objectives of the scheme and ensure that resources are targeted at those who are most in need. Any further changes to the scheme would fall to be considered in a budgetary context and in the light of the resources available for improvements in social welfare generally.

The number of claims for carers allowance submitted in 2007 was 18,000 compared to 10,700 in 2006 representing an increase of 68%.   Some 9,600 new applications for carer's allowance have been received in 2008 to date. The large increase in applications received is mainly due to the introduction of the half rate carer's allowance payment which came into effect from 27th September 2007.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-06-25 00:00:00	Prelude	825	I propose to take Questions Nos. 191 to 194, inclusive, together.The supplementary welfare allowance scheme (SWA) provides for a weekly or monthly supplement to be paid in respect of rent or mortgage interest to any person in the State whose means are insufficient to meet their needs.  The purpose of the rent supplement scheme is to provide short-term income support to eligible persons living in private rented accommodation, whose means are insufficient to meet their accommodation costs and who do not have accommodation available to them from another source.  Similarly, mortgage interest supplement provides short-term income support to eligible people who are unable to meet their mortgage interest repayments in respect of a house which is their sole place of residence. The supplement assists with the interest portion of the mortgage repayments only.In recent years, a significant number of people have come to rely on rent supplement for extended periods, including people on local authority housing waiting lists.  At 13 June 2008, over 63,000 people were in receipt of a supplement of which almost 32,000 recipients are getting a supplement for 18 months or more.  The scheme was not designed to meet long-term ongoing housing needs.  One of the measures introduced to address the issue of long-term rent supplementation is the Rental Accommodation Scheme (RAS) which gives local authorities specific responsibility for meeting the long-term housing needs of people receiving rent supplement for eighteen months or more.  Almost 13,000 tenants have been transferred from the rent supplement scheme to RAS since 2005.Significant changes to the means test for rent and mortgage interest supplement were implemented in 2007.  Additional provision was made specifically to facilitate people on rent supplement returning to work and those accepted as eligible for accommodation under RAS. These measures are positive steps in assisting tenants in achieving a long-term housing solution for their needs while also increasing the financial return from employment for those returning to work or moving to full-time employment.  Expenditure on rent supplement and mortgage interest supplement for the past 5 years is shown in the attached tabular statement.  The estimated provisions for the current year are also shown in the statement.Overall, I am satisfied that the current rent supplement and mortgage interest schemes provide an adequate short-term "safety net" within the overall social welfare system to ensure that people do not suffer hardship due to loss of employment. Nonetheless I intend to keep the schemes under review to ensure that the schemes meet the objective of catering for those who require assistance on a short-term basis while long-term housing needs are dealt with in a more appropriate manner.  Developments in relation to current year expenditure are being closely monitored in the context of the Government's framework for reporting on public expenditure.YearRent SupplementMortgage Interest Supplement€000€0002003331,4717,6632004353,7626,3332005368,7056,3392006388,3397,8732007391,46612,1982008*392,100*14,350*As per Revised Estimates Volume.

#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-06-25 00:00:00	Prelude	830	The escalation of fuel costs is a result of global economic, market and political conditions. The Common Fishery Policy (CFP) has no remit as regards the pricing of fuel in the market place.  It is important to note that the fishing industry in Ireland already receives favourable treatment in the form of a full rebate on excise and VAT on marine fuel, if the enterprise concerned is registered for VAT.  Fuel subsidies, in terms of operating aid for fishing vessels, are not permitted under EU State Aid rules and any such measures introduced by EU Member States would be in breach of EU law and subject to Infringement proceedings in the European Court of Justice.My officials and I are fully committed and will continue to strive, within the confines placed upon us, to bring about a situation whereby our fishing fleet can sustain itself from an economic, social and commercial perspective.  Minister Killeen and I yesterday attended the Council of Fisheries Meeting in Luxembourg where we conveyed in the strongest possible terms the depth of feeling of Irish fishermen on this matter and the seriousness of the situation facing them.  We outlined a strong case for a package of EU-funded measures to address the current difficulties experienced by fishermen across Europe but, particularly in Ireland.  I am particularly pleased with the progress made in a number of areas of concern to Irish Fishermen and I believe the meeting was positive as regards the restructuring of the industry and action to combat illegal fishing.

I pressed the Commission to examine new initiatives at EU level to increase the return received by fishermen at the quayside and improved labelling to assist customers.  I also asked the Commission to bring forward initiatives on research and innovation into ways to develop more fuel-efficient engines and fishing practices.  I was particularly pleased with the support offered by a number of other Member States and with the response of the EU Fisheries Commissioner Borg, who has undertaken to come back to the issues at the next Council meeting on the 15th July.

As Scheme participants can no longer be regarded as active farmers for the purposes of forestry grants, any lands planted by them after the date they join the Early Retirement Scheme can only attract grants or premiums at the non-farmer rate.

Specifically, the following sections have been commenced: 1, 2, 14(1)(a), 14(1)(c), 14(2) to 14(4), 19 to 37, 40 to 53.  In addition, the Special Education Appeals Board (SEAB) was established in April 2007, under section 36 of the EPSEN Act 2004, to hear and determine appeals pursuant to a number of sections of the Act.My Department is now at an advanced stage in finalising proposals to facilitate implementation of the remaining sections, including the provisions in respect of assessment and individual education plans (IEP). The time taken to finalise proposals reflects the complexities involved, the need for consultation across the wide range of people and sectors involved, the need to align with the requirements of the Disability Act, 2005 and define how the Health Service Executive (HSE) and NCSE will work together under both acts.My Department's priority is to ensure that the necessary training, guidance and supports are in place to facilitate the commencement of the remaining sections of the Act. It must also be acknowledged that, during this necessary period of preparation and planning for the roll-out of the EPSEN Act, my Department continues to expand capacity and services for students with special educational needs across the schools network through the work of the National Council for Special Education.

Applications for SNAs may be considered by the NCSE where a pupil has a significant medical need for such assistance, a significant impairment of physical or sensory function or where their behaviour is such that they are a danger to themselves or to other pupils. The NCSE operates within my Department's criteria in allocating such support.My officials have been in contact with the NCSE and have been advised that the pupil referred to by the Deputy is currently in receipt of 5 hours resource teaching per week. The pupil in question currently has access to support from a special needs assistant (SNA) on a full time basis.  It has been determined that the SNA will be able to support the care needs of this pupil and another pupil in the school with effect from September 2008. The school has agreed to implement this arrangement.  The NCSE will undertake to review a decision taken by a SENO on foot of a request from a school or parents/guardians, when accompanied by relevant additional information, which may not have been to hand at the time of the decision. The NCSE has outlined this process in its Circular 01/05.All schools have contact details of their local SENO. It is also open to parents to contact their local SENO directly to discuss their child's special educational needs, using the contact details available on www.ncse.ie.  I understand that the SENO will be in contact with the parents in the near future.

Students who had a prior entitlement to certain Social Welfare payments receive a training allowance instead of their Social Welfare payment at a rate equivalent to the maximum rate of unemployment benefit.  A person will qualify for a bonus payment of €31.80 if they have been in receipt of an unemployment payment for one year directly before their course commencement date.Vocational Education Committees (VECs) are authorised to grant a third year on the VTOS programme in very exceptional circumstances such as: entry with very low levels of literacy/numeracy, where an extra year is required to reach accreditation or significant amounts of tuition time lost through serious personal health problems.  Payments to VTOS students by the VEC cease following completion of the two year VTOS programme.  Decisions on whether a student can stay on VTOS for a third year have to be ratified at a meeting of the VEC.  In cases where students are approved for extension of the VTOS scheme any additional payments are reinstated and backdated.

Tenders have been received for the project and it is now awaiting approval to proceed to construction.  I am not in a position to give the go ahead for any more projects to proceed to construction at this time.  I indicated this clearly to the school in question when I visited it recently.  I am currently reviewing, with my officials, the Department's spending plans for this year and I will not be making any decision on any further capital expenditure until that process is completed.What I can say is that the new building for the school in question will be provided when the requisite funding is available and on a time line consistent with the priority attaching to the project under the published prioritisation criteria for large scale building projects.  My Department has been in receipt of regular correspondence from the school authorities in question and this will continue to be dealt with in the normal fashion.I can confirm that the school recently submitted a proposal to my Department in relation to how its project might proceed this year without incurring Departmental expenditure.  This proposal will be examined by the School Planning and Building Unit in my Department and a response will issue directly to the school authority.  The examination will be strictly governed by the capital allocation available in 2009 and the priority attaching to the project in this regard.  Any other approach would be unfair to schools in a similar situation which cannot provide start-up funding for their projects.

(IILT) approached my Department earlier this year with a proposal to withdraw from direct tuition for adult refugees and with a request that this tuition be mainstreamed. IILT envisaged continuing direct tuition for a group of up to 200 programme refugees. My Department accepted that mainstreaming of service provision was appropriate as it accords with the overall approach to provision of services to migrants as set out in "Migration Nation" — a statement on integration strategy and diversity management which I recently launched. In doing so the Department decided that all provision should be mainstreamed and provided by VECs as it would make no sense to seek to continue with a small element of provision by IILT.The funding allocated to IILT will now be redirected to provide for the continuation of this service through the VEC network. The Irish Vocational Education Association has confirmed that it is happy to cooperate and collaborate with my Department in delivery of necessary English language services. The VEC sector has already developed best practice in ESOL (English for Speakers of Other Languages) provision. The sector is already providing English language services for those whose first language is not English.At present services are provided to over 12,000 people annually which clearly demonstrates the capacity of the VECs in this area. A further advantage of mainstreaming such provision through the VEC sector is the fact that the VECs have a nationwide network across all counties and cities that can readily provide classes where needed in the country using their facilities in schools and centres.  My Department is currently in discussion with the IVEA to ensure the minimum of disruption to students and the smooth transition to the new basis of delivery.

This will enable teachers to carry out initial and on-going assessments of the language proficiency of newcomer children. The Assessment Kit has also been placed on the Department's website.  It is proposed to have an assessment kit for post-primary schools available later in the year.

This application is under consideration at present and it is expected that a decision on this application will be made and conveyed to the school authorities shortly.
#BattOKeeffe	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-party	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-06-25 00:00:00	Prelude	854	The decision on eligibility for maintenance grants is a matter for the relevant local authority or VEC. These bodies do not refer individual applications to my Department except, in exceptional cases, where, for example, advice or instruction regarding a particular clause in the relevant scheme is desired.  When assessing the means of students other than independent mature students, the means test provision of the scheme specifies that the students' means and those of their parents or guardians must be below a prescribed limit. This provision requires that parental income be taken into account irrespective of the individual circumstances in any case where the student is not an independent mature student.Under the Higher Education Grants Scheme an approved course is defined as a full-time undergraduate course of at least two years duration or a full-time postgraduate course of not less than one year duration pursued in an approved institution.  An approved institution is defined to mean a university, college or other institution of higher education in so far as it provides a course or courses of not less than two years duration, being a course, or courses, which the Minister for Education and Science approves for the time being for the purposes of the Acts.  The Higher Education Grants Scheme specifies a list of approved institutions.  For a number of the institutions only specified courses are approved.  The courses in these particular institutions are reviewed annually.  Mater Dei Institute of Education is one of those approved institutions under which specified programmes listed.The Deputy's question refers to a student participating on a BA in Education in English & Religion.  As this is not listed in the 2007 Grant Scheme, students on this course would not be considered for funding under the terms and conditions of the Higher Education Grant Scheme.  The Deputy will appreciate that the terms of the schemes are of general application and it is not open to me to make exceptions in individual cases.

The long term projected staffing, on which the accommodation needs will be based, has been determined.  The progression of all large scale building projects, including this project, from initial design stage through to construction phase will be considered on an on-going basis in the context of my Department's multi-annual School Building and Modernisation Programme. However, in light of current competing demands on the capital budget of the Department, it is not possible to give an indicative timeframe for the progression of the project at this time.The issue of road safety measures outside the vested site areas of schools, such as road signage, traffic calming measures etc., is a matter that should be raised in the first instance with the relevant Local Authority. Local Authorities have the power to decide on road safety measures outside schools and should ensure that measures are in place to protect the safety of local school children.

The Bill is with the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel to the Government for drafting.  My Department is reviewing the strategic, procedural and technical issues relating to the role of the proposed Statutory Authority.  This will take into account the varying usage by a range of different interests, not least the Defence Forces.  It is not possible to progress the drafting of the Bill further pending completion of this review.  As a result, I expect that it could be some time before the Bill is published.

The complainants declined to make formal statements of complaint when invited to do so.As the Deputy is aware, the Garda Síochána is responsible for the investigation of offences.  Statutory powers of search and entry are bestowed upon the Garda Síochána under various legislative provisions and when authorised by a judge.  However, these powers are exercised in circumstances where a member of the Garda Síochána reasonably suspects that an offence has occurred.  These powers can only be used, therefore, where a Garda has a reasonable suspicion supported by some evidence.  The mere assertion of wrongdoing by a member of the general public is clearly insufficient in this regard.  If the Gardaí were to accede to every such demand, unsupported by evidence, it would amount to an abuse of authority.I am advised that inquiries by the Garda Síochána established that the plane in question was not, in fact, en route to Guantanamo Bay.  I would remind the Deputy that the Garda Síochána has investigated a range of complaints of alleged unlawful activity at Shannon Airport and, where appropriate, files have been submitted to the Director of Public Prosecutions.  In all these cases, no further action was found to be warranted, owing to a lack of any evidence of unlawful activity.  Any person with credible information that Irish airports have been used for any alleged unlawful purpose should report their concerns to the Garda Síochána.

I am also informed that local Garda management is aware of public order and anti-social behaviour type offences being experienced by residents of the area concerned.  Regular foot, bike and mobile patrols are conducted in the area by District and Divisional uniform and plain-clothes personnel supplemented, as required, by the District Detective and Drugs Units, the Community Policing Unit, which has dedicated patrols in this area, and the Divisional Crime Task Force and Traffic Corps personnel.  Personnel are deployed on duties as appropriate by local Garda management.The formulation of proposals in relation to the opening and closing of Garda stations is a matter, in the first instance, for the Garda Commissioner in the context of the annual policing plan, as provided for in section 22 of the Garda Síochána Act 2005.  I am advised that the long-term plans for Mountjoy station are being considered in the context of the future of both it and Fitzgibbon Street Stations and taking into account the overall policing requirements of the area.  Current policing policy in the area is predicated on the prevention of crime, including crimes of violence against persons and property, the prevention of public order offences and the maintenance of an environment conducive to the improvement of the quality of life of the residents.  This strategy is, and will continue to be, central to the delivery of the policing service in this area.

I am further informed that the personnel strength of the Bridewell Garda Station on 31 May 2008, the latest date for which figures are readily available, was 178.  The Bridewell Garda Station forms part of the Dublin Metropolitan Region (DMR) North Central Division which had a personnel strength of 689 on 31 May, 2008 which are deployed on patrol, on bikes, in patrol cars and on other duties as appropriate by Garda management.The Deputy will appreciate that, as with any large organisation, on any given day personnel strengths of individual divisions, districts and stations may fluctuate due, for example, to promotions, retirements and transfers.  It is the responsibility of the Garda Commissioner to allocate personnel throughout the Force taking all relevant factors into account.  In that regard, the needs of the Garda Station referred to by the Deputy will be fully considered by the Commissioner within the overall context of the needs of Garda Stations throughout the country.Following the submission of a report and recommendations by an expert group on crime statistics, it was decided that the compilation and publication of crime statistics should be taken over by the Central Statistics Office, as the national statistical agency, from the Garda Síochána. The Garda Síochána Act 2005 consequently makes provision for this, and the CSO has established a dedicated unit for this purpose. The CSO has published crime statistics since the third quarter of 2006.  I have requested the CSO to provide the crime statistics sought by the Deputy directly to him.

#JohnGormley	unknown-#JohnGormley-party	unknown-#JohnGormley-dob	unknown-#JohnGormley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-06-25 00:00:00	Prelude	867	Scientific assessment of this site dates back to the early 1970s when it was surveyed by An Foras Forbatha.  The site was then surveyed in detail in 1984 as part of The National Raised Bog Survey (NPWS). The site features in the report The Raised Bogs of Ireland (1990), where it is compared to a number of other raised bog sites in Co. Galway.  In 1995 the site was considered for selection as a Special Area of Conservation (SAC) under the EU Habitats Directive as part of a study (Kelly, Doak and Dromey 1995) carried out for the National Parks and Wildlife Service, now part of my Department.  Broadly, the site can be characterised, from a scientific point of view, as being a raised bog, of the subgroup "western type", of moderate quality with the hydrology seriously damaged but with restoration of that damage being possible. This site was considered for SAC designation in conjunction with other similarly assessed sites in County Galway which included Lough Tee, Raford River, Derrynagran, Camderry, Kilsallagh, Cloonmore, Clooncullaun, Funshin, Lisnageeragh, Leaha, Moorfield and Keelogues.  Some of these sites have been designated as SACs and other sites from this group have been designated as Natural Heritage Areas under the Wildlife (Amendment) Act, 2000.The Directive does not require that all qualifying habitat be selected for SAC designation in any particular locality. Carrownagappal was considered to be the best representative sample in its immediate geographic area and as such was selected on scientific grounds and put forward for designation.  This site merits SAC status on the basis of three qualifying interests under the Directive — Active Raised Bog, Degraded Raised Bog and Rhynchosporian depressions on peat substrates.In March 1997, 86 landowners in the area proposed for designation were notified directly in writing and supplied with information on the scientific rationale for designation and on the objections procedure. The proposed designation of the site was also advertised in the Connacht Sentinel and the Galway Advertiser in March 1997.  These advertisements indicated that there were procedures in place for objecting to the designation and advised on how to obtain further information. This notification/publicity exercise was supplemented by information supplied by regional staff of the National Parks and Wildlife Service.  In all, 6 landowners objected — 3 were partly successful, 1 was unsuccessful and 2 withdrew their objections.The statutory deadline for receipt of objections for inclusion/exclusion of land in this SAC has expired and no further objections can be accepted.  I appreciate the escalating cost of fuel alternatives and envisage that an appropriate compensation mechanism will be applied in the context of the cessation of turf-cutting on designated bogs.

It has been widely sold for many years as an oxygenating plant for garden ponds and aquaria.   However, it is viewed as a major threat to Irish lakes and their associated wildlife since it became established in Lough Corrib in 2005.  A Lagarosiphon Task Force has been established to address the spread of the pondweed in Lough Corrib and in any other areas where it is identified. The Task Force, which is chaired by Galway County Council, includes representatives of my Department's National Parks and Wildlife Service, the Central Fisheries Board, the Western Regional Fisheries Board, the Office of Public Works together with Galway County Council. Last year my Department provided funding to the Central Fisheries Board to purchase a weed cutting boat to be dedicated exclusively to removing Lagarosiphon major in Lough Corrib. I understand that the boat recently began weed cutting operations.  I have also provided additional funding of €200,000 this year to the Central Fisheries Board for work involving the removal and control of Lagarosiphon major in the lake.In relation to adjoining lakes, the Central Fisheries Board have carried out surveys which have found no evidence of Lagarosiphon major in either Lough Mask or Lough Carra.  I am aware that the Western Regional Fisheries Board recently appointed consultants to undertake a Biosecurity Plan for Lough Mask. The Plan will examine current biosecurity threats including invasive species and take into account the need to protect upstream lakes such as Lough Carra.  Finally, my Department is examining the appropriate regulatory measures necessary to control the possession and dispersal of ecologically harmful and invasive species of plants (including Lagarosiphon major) in Ireland.  I expect to address this issue in regulations to be made under the Wildlife Acts later this year.

Broadband service providers operate in a fully liberalised market, regulated, where appropriate, by the independent Commission for Communications Regulation, ComReg.  Details of broadband suppliers, prices and locations throughout the country are available on www.broadband.gov.ie.  The role of the Government is to formulate regulatory and infrastructure policies to facilitate the provision of high quality telecommunications services by competing private sector service providers.The widespread provision of broadband services continues to be a priority for the Government.  In that regard my Department has undertaken initiatives to address the gaps in broadband coverage.  These included providing grant-aid under the Group Broadband Scheme (GBS) and ongoing investment in Metropolitan Area Networks (MANs).  Although broadband is now widely available in Ireland there are still some parts of the country where the private sector will be unable to justify the commercial provision of broadband services.  These areas are being addressed by the National Broadband Scheme (NBS), which will provide broadband services to areas that are currently unserved and will ensure that all reasonable requests for broadband are met.The first phase of the NBS procurement process (Pre-Qualification Questionnaire (PQQ)) is now complete.  The remaining candidates have been engaged in "Competitive Dialogue" with my Department and are developing their proposed solutions to meet my Department's requirements.  Judicial Review proceedings regarding certain elements of the NBS mapping process took place on 10 and 11 June 2008 in the High Court and a judgment is awaited.  While the outcome of the Judicial Review cannot be anticipated, it is currently expected that a preferred bidder for the NBS will be selected in September 2008, with roll out to commence as soon as possible thereafter.

The outstanding Directives are expected to be transposed shortly and it is intended that all recently issued Directives will be transposed and implemented on time.  If the Deputy wishes to request information in regard to a specific Directive falling within the remit of my Department, I will have the relevant information forwarded to the Deputy.The volume of Directives involved since 1973 is quite substantial.  Full details of all EU Directives are published in the Official Journal of the European Union and details of relevant implementing legislation are published in the Iris Oifigiúil.  As the cost of compiling the information requested by the Deputy would be excessive and, given that the information is already in the public domain, I am not in a position to provide the details requested.
