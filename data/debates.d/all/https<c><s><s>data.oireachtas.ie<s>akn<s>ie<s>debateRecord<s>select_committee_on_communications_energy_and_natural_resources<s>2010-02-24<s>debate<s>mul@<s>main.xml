          <p eId="para_13">I was not aware the committee wanted me to make some opening remarks.  This is an important moment for inland fisheries.  We are anxious to consolidate the level of activity and move to one central board.  We are, therefore, removing all of the regional fisheries boards and reorganising the fisheries resource around the river basin districts.  This, essentially, is a restructuring Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_14">I am prepared to accept a number of Opposition amendments which are both positive and welcome, including those suggesting the inclusion of provisions relating to the protection of whistleblowers, to allow by-laws made by the Minister to be circulated electronically and to allow the Minister to appoint to the board on a temporary basis a person to represent employee interests, pending the outcome of an election to elect an employee director.  There are a number of other technical amendments tabled by Opposition Deputies which I am also prepared to accept.  We are, therefore, open to improving and changing the Bill.  I thank members in advance for their co-operation.</p>

          <p eId="para_17">I tabled this amendment to get the view of the Minister of State and the Department on the issue.  The new authority, Inland Fisheries Ireland, will have responsibility for inland waterways, including rivers, harbour mouths and so on.  There is a reference to a figure of 12 nautical miles offshore which in this section the Minister states he can change should he want to do so.  I would like to get the view of the Minister of State on the capacity of the new body to deal with sea angling which is covered by the 12 nautical miles offshore rule.  It is an aspect which is not well managed and policed.  If the Minister was to change the size of the zone of responsibility, it would be a substantial decision and subject to approval by the Dáil.  That is why I tabled the amendment which is not one I will push to a vote.  I understand the 12 nautical miles offshore rule is in place to cover sea angling, the use of inshore nets and so on.  If it is to be changed, the Dáil should have a say.  It should not be done via a ministerial regulation.  That is the basis of the amendment.</p>

          <p eId="para_18">The section to which the Deputy refers is a restatement of the provisions contained in the Fisheries Act 1980.  It ensures that Inland Fisheries Ireland will maintain the same operational jurisdiction as the existing central and regional fisheries boards, which at present extends to the 12 mile limit of Ireland's territorial seas.</p>
          <p eId="para_19">Section 7(3)(<i>b</i>) provides that the Minister may, by order, amend the reference to the 12 mile limit if necessary.  The Deputy proposes that such an amendment should be subsequent to the approval of Dáil Éireann.  I have discussed the matter with the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel and I am advised in the first instance that an amendment to the reference to the 12 mile limit must be by way of a ministerial order.  I am further advised that any order made under this section should be subject to the approval of both Houses of the Oireachtas.  The legislative mechanism for achieving this is by making provision for the order to be laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas and allowing a 21 day period for either House to pass a resolution annulling that order.  Accordingly, while I am unable to accept the amendment as drafted, I propose to bring forward an appropriate amendment to this section on Report Stage to ensure any order will be made subject to the approval of both Houses of the Oireachtas.</p>
          <p eId="para_20">We are taking on board the Deputy's principal point, that there should be strong Oireachtas involvement where the situation arises for something as radical as changing the limit.</p>

          <p eId="para_23">There was a failing in the way in which the regional fisheries boards overlooked the management, monitoring and promotion of sea angling.  Nearly all of the resources were concentrated on inland waterways and river catchment areas.  It is an area that the new Inland Fisheries Ireland must place an emphasis upon and allocate resources to so we can exploit the opportunity offered by sea angling tourism to its full potential.  It is a potentially huge industry.  That is another reason I tabled the amendment; it is an area of responsibility for the new body where there should be improved management.</p>

          <p eId="para_24">I agree.  One of the more difficult areas has been the tendency of local authorities in coastal areas to designate areas as closed to anglers because of swimmers and so on.  Inland Fisheries Ireland must get a grip on this because it is not acceptable that someone could be prevented from angling in two very similar places.</p>

          <p eId="para_29">We want to include the marketing function.  The 1999 amending Act amended the 1980 Act and made angling and marketing promotion a central function of the Central Fisheries Board.  Likewise, the same Act amended section 11 of the 1980 Act for angling and promotional marketing.  In the Inland Fisheries Ireland Bill, however, marketing and promotion are watered down and there is no mention at all of marketing in section 7.</p>
          <p eId="para_30">Also, in section 7(8), an inference can be made that IFI could focus on protection and conservation of wildlife with the National Parks and Wildlife Service.  Fish are a natural resource and can bring income into the State and it is important to recognise that.</p>

          <p eId="para_31">My officials were somewhat sceptical initially about the Deputies' efforts in this direction.  I have made it clear through the liaison with the chief executives of the old boards that the marketing element is not being watered down.  I have taken on board the Deputies' views because we do not want a lessening of their role in marketing.  Overarching international marketing will be conducted by the tourism bodies in conjunction with IFI.  Resources still remain for IFI to promote particular rivers and areas.  I completely agree with that.</p>

          <p eId="para_36">It is appropriate that Deputy Sherlock has just mentioned the importance of marketing.  Section 7(3)(<i>k</i>) mentions marketing activities, which is welcome, although perhaps the function is not strong enough in the Bill as a whole.  This subsection states that IFI shall support angling promotion and marketing activities and co-operate with the relevant State agencies in developing international promotion and marketing strategies and activities in game, coarse and sea tourism angling.  That is welcome.</p>
          <p eId="para_37">The proposal is to add that IFI would co-operate with relevant State agencies and sectoral interests.  It is important that IFI works actively with the private sector as well.  In marine tourism and game, coarse and sea angling tourism, it is primarily the private sector that drives this area.  IFI should work with those sectoral interests.  Whether the term "sectoral interests" is the most appropriate to get across the point I am making is up to the Minister of State but it is a useful addition to the section.</p>

          <p eId="para_38">I fully agree.  We would accept insertion of the words "relevant sectoral interests" and I will table an appropriate amendment on Report Stage.  It is important because we do not want a body to sit in Dublin that does not have contact with the vital sectoral interests involved in this area.  It looks restrictive in the current form without the reference to relevant interests.  I emphasise the relevant nature because we do not want to include "sectoral interests" in general, because that would allow almost everyone to be included and to take part in discussions that are far removed from their core activities.</p>

          <p eId="para_47">The Bill states that IFI shall establish and manage a forum.  We wish to strengthen the wording, with "after consultation with the Oireachtas Joint Committee".  It broadens the remit and fleshes out the provisions on the forum and ensures the Oireachtas will be consulted.  It could be argued that there is no real provision for regional input by stakeholders.  There could be a massive void when the fisheries boards cease to exist.  That is the basis of the amendment.</p>

          <p eId="para_48">The purpose of this subsection is to oblige Inland Fisheries Ireland to establish and manage a national inland fisheries forum, the composition and terms of reference of which will be subject to the agreement of the Minister.  This is seen as a means of formalising stakeholders' input into policy formulation and will act as a conduit to provide advice and inform policy deliberation on the conservation, protection, management and marketing of all species of inland fisheries.</p>
          <p eId="para_49">Deputies McManus, Coveney and Sherlock seek to have the terms of reference of this forum subject to consultation with the relevant joint Oireachtas committee.  The establishment and management of this forum is primarily an operational matter for Inland Fisheries Ireland.  Given the Department's corporate governance role over this body, the legislation makes provision for the terms of reference to be subject to the agreement of the Minister.  It is not appropriate for the joint committee to be consulted on the terms of reference.  The agreement of the Minister should be sufficient to ensure that the terms of reference of the forum are fit for purpose.  Any additional consultation requirements could unnecessarily delay or jeopardise the establishment of the forum.</p>
          <p eId="para_50">There is nothing to prevent the joint committee making a submission to the Department or Inland Fisheries Ireland on the operation of the forum.  I assure the members that any submission received will be given due consideration.</p>
          <p eId="para_51">The amendment tabled by Deputy McManus and moved by Deputy Sherlock describes the purpose of the forum.  I accept that the provision, as drafted, can be expanded and I intend to consult the Parliamentary Counsel with a view to bringing forward an appropriate amendment at Report Stage that will set out the purpose of the forum.  The amendment tabled by Deputy McManus refers to regional sub-fora.  Obviously the workings of the forum will primarily be a matter for Inland Fisheries Ireland but I expect the forum will be managed on a regional basis.</p>
          <p eId="para_52">Regional input is vital to the operation of a forum.  I strongly believe that country-wide input will be critical to the successful operation of the forum.  Accordingly, I do not intend to accept the amendments tabled by Deputies Coveney and McManus but I will bring forward an appropriate amendment on Report Stage to set out the purpose of the national inland fisheries forum.</p>
          <p eId="para_53">I do not wish to be confrontational on this.  While I recognise the spirit of the amendment tabled by Deputy Sherlock, I believe the matter is a management function for Inland Fisheries Ireland to produce the terms of reference, subject to my approval.  If the members have very strong ideas on how the terms of reference should operate and on how the forum should work, I will be very open to suggestions.  My innate sense of how it should work is that it will be established by Inland Fisheries Ireland, subject to my approval and on the basis of whatever submissions Deputies feel appropriate, and operate on a rotational basis in the regions.  While it will technically be a single forum of a national character, it could have regional sub-fora that would accommodate the regional dimension to the work in the inland fisheries sector.  We are flexible in this regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_54">There should be a strong regional dimension to the forum.  It should not just be a game of restricted numbers.  One of the dangers of creating a national forum is that there would be a restricted number of people on such a forum.  A national forum should be truly regional and allow for strong regional membership because there is diversity of interest in the area, not only on the part of the different types of anglers involved but also the different types of interest groups.  We should try to maximise their input on the forum while at the same time having the forum move around the country in a formal sense.  It should not meet in Dublin all the time but should move through the regions and host meetings there so people will learn from what is happening in each region.  I hope that satisfies the Deputies.</p>

We have discussed this matter informally previously.  Most lobbying on the Bill was by regional interests.  They say we are putting in place a centralised system and ask if they will have any say.  We need to ensure we meet the concerns that arise, which are very different in different parts of the country depending on the resources and topography, be it in the south west, north west or along the Irish Sea.  Sectoral interests and those of different types of anglers and fishermen must be represented properly.</p>

I refer to a small commercial net man or a bed and breakfast business running an angling service.  We need to ensure the legislation is worded so it will assure people that the membership of the forum will take into account the broad spectrum of interests across the angling and fishing fields.  If such wording is included, I will be happy for no further role to be given to the Oireachtas committee and for the Minister of State to deal with the issue.  However, it is not good enough for the Minister of State to say how he envisages the legislation working because the reality is that he might not be a Minister of State in the Department this time next week, never mind in two years.</p>

Various sectoral representative groups are in place, including the Shellfish Growers Association and the game angling clubs in every county.  The Minister of State could tap into those representative groups.  An important point I raised on the debate on Second Stage is that we need to examine the cross-Border dimension.  From a parochial point of view, I always emphasise the work of the Loughs Agency, but it has a remit into our country in terms of management of tributary rivers and the same position applies in Carlingford.  Representative groups are in place on the voluntary side.  There are game angling clubs and tourism representative bodies.  As Deputy Coveney said, we must take cognisance of the private sector as it is the sector that is driving the industry of game angling.  There is a regional dimension to this.</p>

          <p eId="para_82">The subsection in question provides that inland fisheries may carry out research and experimental work necessary for the performance of its functions but with the proviso that Inland Fisheries Ireland should not be able to carry out such work in regard to any species of sea fish within the meaning of the Sea-Fisheries and Maritime Jurisdiction Act 2006.  The 2006 Act defines sea fish as including anadromous and catadromous species and all crustaceans and molluscs found in the sea.  Given that salmon are classified as an anadromous species — I apologise for my pronunciation, I am bit tongue tied on the pronunciation of that species — and eels are classified at catadromous species, the Bill, as drafted, will preclude Inland Fisheries Ireland from carrying out research on those species.  This was not the intention of the legislation.</p>

While it was always the intention that the provisions of this Bill would mirror the provisions in the Fisheries (Amendment) Act 1999, in the course of the drafting process the wording which is the subject of this proposed amendment was unintentionally omitted from the Bill.  The proposed amendment ensures that Inland Fisheries Ireland will be able to continue the important research work currently undertaken by the Central Fisheries Board in regard to certain species of sea fish, including those that I have already mentioned, albeit rather badly.  I hope the amendment will be accepted.</p>

Such research results will nearly always be made available electronically.  Even though the Marine Institute has an interesting website and much of its research is available on it, I would like it to be provided in legislation that a public body such as the IFI would make the results of its research publicly available so that people who are interested in monitoring these matters will have access to the information that the new State body is producing.</p>

          <p eId="para_98">This subsection concerns the function of Inland Fisheries Ireland to carry out research or experimental work considered necessary for the performance of its functions.  Most of the work undertaken by the Central Fisheries Board in regard to the EU water framework directive and habitats directive and the eels regulations requires reports, which are published on a annual basis.  Furthermore, research summaries have been published by the Central Fisheries Board on its website annually in recent years.  I see no reason this would change with the move to the new structure.</p>
          <p eId="para_99">In general terms, research undertaken by scientists is peer reviewed and published.  This is part of its validation and is, as I understand, standard practice for this type of work.  I sound a word of caution to the Deputy in terms of incorporating a blanket rule for publication in that there may be some instance where it may not be appropriate or necessary to publish the results of research where, for instance, it would expose vulnerable fish populations, where analysis is partial or misleading or where blanket publication of such research would not be appropriate other than to account for it in the annual report of the agency, as is currently done by the Central Fisheries Board.  There are circumstances where it may not be helpful or positive to release the results of research precisely because it would be partial and, in that sense, it could be misleading or misrepresented in one fashion or another.  That is the caveat or concern we would have about a rule that all research should be published.  Protecting vulnerable fish populations is also an issue in circumstances where research indicated there was a concentration of fish in a certain area.  I am plucking this scenario out of the air.  I am not particularly expert in this area, but if one was to expose a particular population of fish to potential poachers or people who particularly wanted to overfish a stretch of river, lake or water resource, making the findings of research public might only assist the manufacturers, so to speak, as opposed to what would be in the public good in terms of preservation and conservation of fish stocks.  I do not want to overstate that, though.</p>

          <from>Deputy Simon Coveney</from>
          <p eId="para_100">I understand the point the Minister is making.  The point I was making was that this is a public body, financed by the taxpayer and it needs to be seen to be transparent in all its work.  When it undertakes research particularly into fish populations, fish stocks and the state of those fish stocks, it is not acceptable for it to pick and choose what it wants the public to see and, in doing so, to perhaps drive its own agenda around building up fish stocks in a way that would be unfair to anglers or commercial fishermen.  The problem with not publishing everything is that one raises suspicions in the industry that IFI is only showing us what it wants us to see.</p>

          <from>Deputy Conor Lenihan</from>
          <p eId="para_101">I fully accept that.  Where research is relied on by the fisheries body to defend a particular conservation move, it should always be published and made available to the public.  I share Deputy Coveney's concern that a public body would rely on research without making it available for all to see.  Obviously, not all research is perfect.  As we saw with the ESRI, for instance, in regard to environmental matters, sometimes research can be deeply flawed so it is important to share it with the public.  In other words, it should be contestable from an expert point of view.</p>
          <p eId="para_102">I have no particular problem with the principle of what Deputy Coveney said that the new body should publish as much as possible of its research evidence and only not publish it in situations in which it believes vulnerable fish populations might be jeopardised by so doing.  There would want to be a very strong public interest reason for a body, such as IFI, not to publish research given what was said earlier that there is a shared responsibility among many interest groups to protect and conserve the resource.  They are positive groups.  Anglers are a positive influence in terms of fish conservation.</p>

It states that the Minister may if he or she thinks fit authorise IFI to engage in the processing and marketing of such species of fish as are specified in the authorisation.  I do not believe it will be the role of IFI to get involved in processing of fish.  It is not a fish processor.  Perhaps it will be involved in marketing but I do not believe it will be directly involved, that is, the people doing the marketing.  That is why I propose the wording "activities relating to".

If through BIM, the Government decides to engage in a very proactive marketing campaign for Irish fish, IFI would be part of that marketing campaign in terms of enhancing it, providing research for it and so on.  Likewise, if Fáilte Ireland decided it wanted to get involved in an intense marketing campaign for river angling and sea angling, IFI could support that process with back-up information and so on which it would have available to it.  I do not believe anyone would envisage IFI going to Britain, the Continent and the US embarking on a marketing campaign to bring fishermen here.</p>

While six of the river basin districts lie predominantly within the State, a small area of the Neagh Bann river basin district also lies within the State.

We are trying to provide ourselves with the flexibility to change the arrangements and move away from the river basin district model.

An order would obviously have to be laid before the Houses to facilitate such action.</p>

          <p eId="para_152">My concern is that we are changing a regional fisheries board structure into a centralised model which will operate on a regional basis which will be founded upon the river basin districts.  That is the one aspect of the legislation which provides people in the regions with some reassurance that their basin districts, as they will now be known, will be managed on a regional basis by IFI.  Under this section, there is an opportunity for the Minister of the day, should he or she so desire, to turn the entire system on its head.  All that would be required would be for the Oireachtas to approve such a move within 21 sitting days.  As the Government has a majority in the Oireachtas in any event, that would be somewhat irrelevant.</p>
          <p eId="para_153">I was surprised when I first read the section because it provides the Minister of the day with the capacity to entirely alter the effect of the legislation by means of a ministerial order.  There would be no onus on him or her to introduce amending legislation.  I am somewhat uncomfortable with that.  If a Minister wants to change the new structures we are putting in place — which are based on river basin districts — then he or she should be obliged to introduce amending legislation, particularly as any such change would be substantial in nature.</p>
          <p eId="para_154">The Minister is being given power to throw out the legislation before us.  If the Minister of the day wishes to do so at some point in the future, that is fair enough.  However, he or she should be required to introduce amending legislation and should not be in a position to do so through the issuing of a ministerial order.</p>

          <from>Deputy Conor Lenihan</from>
          <p eId="para_155">The only reason I would not be inclined to do so would be in circumstances where it might be necessary to make minor changes to the river district basins that are specified.  It might, for example, prove more efficient, from an operational point of view, to make such minor changes or to split the districts and create sub-districts.  The Shannon, because of its length, is a good example in this regard.  In the future we might wish to split the latter into upper and lower river basin districts for the purposes of management and we would be obliged, if section 9(2) and (3) were removed from this Bill, to introduce primary legislation to achieve this objective.</p>
          <p eId="para_156">I do not envisage that this will happen in the near future.  However, if the resources became available we might want to split the Shannon into two parts for the purposes of management and we would be able to do this under section 9(2) and (3) and would not be obliged to introduce amending legislation.  I can understand that the Deputy might be concerned if it were our intention to amalgamate the seven river basin districts into one, three, or two larger entities.  It would be dangerous if the Minister of the day, with a wave of his or her hand, could centralise the entire system.</p>

          <from>Deputy Simon Coveney</from>
          <p eId="para_157">What the Minister of State is saying is not really reflected in the wording used in the section.  Section 9(2) states "The Minister may, following consultation with IFI and such other bodies as he or she deems appropriate, specify by order alternative means by which IFI shall manage and report its business".  In other words, the legislation allows IFI, on the basis of a ministerial order, to put in place an entirely new management structure.  If the section were to state that the Minister, in consultation with IFI, retains the power to merge, abolish or expand individual river basin districts as he or she sees fit in the future, I would have no difficulty with it.  That would be a good step.</p>
          <p eId="para_158">At some point we may decide that the south-eastern and south-western river basin districts should be merged.  I do not believe that is the position at present but if the case were made in the future, there would be merit in being able to change the river basin districts and the way in which they are structured by means of ministerial order.  I would not have a difficulty with that.  However, allowing the Minister of the day to change the way in which IFI shall manage this entire sector will give him or her enormous power, should he or she so desire, to instruct that organisation to change its management structures entirely.  The wording will make the Minister somewhat all-powerful.  If it might prove of assistance, I can bring forward a more exacting amendment for Report Stage.</p>

There are concerns in the industry as to the make-up of the IFI board and that there will be sufficient numbers of anglers and commercial fishermen on it to balance each other's arguments.

There is an opportunity for the Oireachtas committee to make recommendations on the various ministerial appointments to the board.  The committee can balance its composition, providing a safety valve.</p>

If the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government can make an appointment, why should the Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs make an appointment too?  They both have an overlapping interest from an environmental and heritage point.  I would appreciate it if the Minister of State would consider that possibility before Report Stage, but I support my colleague’s amendment as well in relation to paragraph (<i>e</i>).</p>

          <from>Deputy Conor Lenihan</from>
          <p eId="para_194">I am halfway there with Deputy Coveney on the specific Ministry involved and the argument that tourism would be more relevant, but the instruction is for the board and IFI itself to be the strong executive liaison with the tourism promotional side.  I do not necessarily believe that incorporating the Ministry for tourism into the nominating process will be helpful at this stage.  I have written to the Ministers asking them for nominations and I am about to announce an interim board comprising the three nominees I would elect.  I want an interim board of three to act as a transition to the new body since I am quite anxious, given the speed at which this is moving and the imminent deadline for the vesting of this body, that there should be some degree of continuity from the old to the new.</p>
          <p eId="para_195">The particular issue I am concerned with, and I have been consistent in this regard, is that I want people serving on this board who are almost dual qualified and expert-driven and who possess strong financial accounting, business or marketing skills.  It is not going to be a board for everyone in the audience, to paraphrase Gay Byrne, and will not be representative in character.  The chief focal point for representation is the forum.  I do not see the nine-member board as being representative of the various interests, whether commercial, angling or otherwise, and it would be almost invidious if a representative characteristic were to be imported into a board such as this.  Clearly, there will be someone with a strong interest in angling among the three members I have the right to appoint.  I will not be appointing people who have no interest in angling, which perhaps addresses the issue raised by Deputy Sherlock about cronyism, pals, friends or whatever other phrases are used to do with State appointments.</p>
          <p eId="para_196">I am very anxious that the people on the board should have a clear, demonstrable interest in angling and the water resource, but mainly that they should not be there as representatives of one particular interest group or other in the angling water scene.  My main concern is that a serving board member should have an interest and also an expertise, whether financial, business, legal or otherwise.  We want a constructive board that has the ability to run, direct and task the chief executive of IFI and not one that necessarily will be enormously interested in angling, its commercial side or otherwise, while not having the necessary expertise and skills to be able to patrol the executives, give them instructions, read financial statements and reports, and, in overall governance terms, run the board as a proper entity.</p>
          <p eId="para_197">Having looked at a number of State boards over the years, I believe we have tended to ask people to serve who were political appointees and who were not particularly skilful at dealing with financial reports or commercial issues.  That has been one of the failings of that approach.  That is why I am concerned with dual tasking the people to be appointed to the board in this case.  They will have a clear interest in angling or the water resource while at the same time possessing actual expertise that can add value to the board.  In that sense I am not accepting the Deputy's amendment but I hope what I have said is somewhat more reassuring.</p>

          <p eId="para_199">I thank the Deputy for withdrawing the amendment.  The only interesting point is that if the wider Oireachtas assisted appointments, it would be an interesting process as well.  I appeal to Deputies if they are nominating candidates for such appointments to think about that aspect, namely, that we want people who are dual qualified, not just a person who is the most popular angler in the region, so that he or she has to be accommodated.  It would be preferable to have people with strong skills in their occupational life who would add to the board.  It is not simply a question of having partisan anglers of one type or another.</p>

          <p eId="para_205">Under the Bill as it stands, the Oireachtas committee only suggests three names.

          <p eId="para_206">This addresses the idea that there should not be complete and utter ministerial control of appointments and that the Oireachtas committee should be given a real say in terms of how the board is constituted, thus recognising the validity of the committee in making an appointment to the board.

However, I shall be appointing, as Minister of State, the three interim nominees at my disposal.  By way of compromise I suggest to the Deputy that I would instruct them, as soon as practicable after they are appointed, to appear before the committee to explain how they view the work in terms of the transition arrangements.  In other words, they will be transitional in that they will not be fully appointed until the board is vested and the legislation has been passed.  It might be helpful for them to be informed that they will have to appear before the committee in the interim stage to discuss matters.  If the committee has issues it wishes to examine about their qualifications or otherwise, this can be done.  When I am appointing an interim group for the transition period, I expect the committee would have the opportunity to speak to them directly.</p>

          <p eId="para_208">I am surprised the Minister of State will not accept my amendment No. 14.  It is not aimed at undermining the process or weakening the power of the Minister or anything.  If the Minister of State is serious about coming to the committee with his appointments and wants it to provide three names which will appropriately balance the board, having seen the appointments he has made and heard the reasons for appointing them, he should deal with any matters the Oireachtas joint committee considers relevant.  In other words, lines 25 and 26 read much better if "Minister" is replaced with "Joint Oireachtas Committee" so that if our Chair, having consulted with the committee, decides we need some information or guidance from the Minister of State, he or she may provide it as opposed to any such other matters the Minister of State considers relevant to the process.</p>
          <p eId="para_209">We certainly can ask for consideration, information, advice or support from the Minister of State.  However that subsection would make more sense were it to say, the Minister in respect of an appointment under subsection such and such shall provide a statement to the Oireachtas joint committee indicating the relevant experience and expertise of the person or persons appointed by the Minister – fair enough — and such matters as the Oireachtas joint committee considers relevant.  In other words, if we need more help from the Minister of State in getting our appointments right, which is what the process is about, this should be forthcoming, rather than he or she making the judgment call on what the committee needs to make the right choice.  Does the Minister of State know what I am saying?</p>

This does not weaken the Minister of State's position or strengthen our position.  It just gives us the capacity to ask him to deal with other matters that we consider relevant before we make proposals to him.  He does not even have to accept our proposals or our proposed names.  These proposals come from section 12(1)(<i>b</i>), and the Minister of State makes the appointment anyway.  We are only helping the process by giving him the names.</p>

          <p eId="para_241">I propose to take amendments Nos. 15 to 18, inclusive, together.  These amendments concern the criteria under which potential appointees to the board of Inland Fisheries Ireland must have had experience of shoal capacity.  Following discussions with the regional fisheries boards and the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel, it was considered that the criteria heading "riparian ownership of fisheries" could be too restrictive.  In law, "riparian" generally refers to land adjoining a river.  Riparian ownership of fisheries could therefore be interpreted to only include ownership of such land and fisheries.  It is therefore proposed that in the interests of clarity and in order to ensure that those with experience and knowledge of the ownership of fisheries, including rated occupiers, are not precluded from being eligible for appointment to the board, that a new criteria, "ownership of fisheries" be included in the Bill.  Given the connection between riparian ownership and agriculture, the agriculture description is to include riparian ownership.  Those amendments make some small but necessary changes to the array of criteria under which a person must have experience in order to be eligible for appointment to the board of Inland Fisheries Ireland.</p>
          <p eId="para_242">In the amendment tabled by Deputy Coveney it is considered that the heading of recreational fisheries covers both sea angling and river angling.  Consequently, there is no need to separate the categories.  Accordingly, I urge that amendments Nos. 15, 16 and 17 be accepted.  For the reason stated I cannot accept amendment No. 18.</p>

          <p eId="para_243">I strongly disagree with the Minister of State.  It is important to include the word "angling".  Recreational fisheries almost trivialises what is a massive industry in terms of sea angling.  Fly fishing and catching sharks off Kinsale are two entirely different industries attracting a very different type of person.  For the sake of giving those sectors some recognition in the legislation, it would be preferable to include "recreational fisheries including sea and river angling".  To put the term angling on that list would provide reassurance to people who are concerned that angling will not get a fair representation on the board.  There cannot be any difficulty in including these two categories.</p>

          <p eId="para_244">No, but it is something we can look at on Report Stage.  It is not the intention in this provision to exclude anybody.  Whatever one's view of the term "recreational fisheries", it surely covers both sea and river angling.  However, if the Deputy considers it important, we can incorporate a reference on Report Stage which enhances the definition and ensures nobody is excluded.</p>

          <p eId="para_245">The term "recreational fisheries" may be said to cover sea and river angling but it is a catch-all term in the vein of business and commercial affairs.  Specific reference is made in the subsection to commercial fishing, fish processing, aquaculture, agriculture and so on, but in "recreational fisheries" we have a broad term to cover the myriad of different industries involved.  Even if we just had the term "angling", that would be a recognition that this is an important element of expertise in the make-up of the board.  I will not be satisfied if there is no mention of angling on this long list.</p>

I am not entirely sure of the meaning of the legal term “composition” but it is certainly the case that people make arrangements with creditors all the time for the restructuring of debts.

However, I still wish to raise the issue because the view that a chief executive should have no room to manoeuvre seems highly limited.  Chief executives tend to be bright people with integrity who demonstrate professionalism in their jobs.  Consequently, it seems extraordinary that they must be gagged in this manner to the point of being unable to express an opinion on the merits of any governmental or ministerial policy or on the merits of its objectives.  Members lose out as a consequence of such gagging because the use of a chief executive officer's judgment to advise a committee is of benefit to all.  Regrettably, I presume the Minister of State will proceed to rule out this amendment.  However, I wish to make the point that I do not agree with treating chief executives like children.</p>

          <p eId="para_304">In respect of governance, the purpose is not to treat them like children but rather as part of a State-funded operation.  Ultimately, I am a firm believer in the proposition that those who do not agree with the aims and objectives or who have serious policy issues with the organisation for which they work, be it governmental or otherwise, have the great sanction of resigning and leaving the organisation.  This is the finest way in which chief executives can express their dissent from Government policy in respect of their remit.  In this instance, the chief executive will be required to work with the Minister and with inland fisheries Ireland, IFI, which will be a State body.  I believe sufficient flexibility has been provided to enable a member of IFI to brief and to be involved in discussions with Opposition spokespersons.  Such a person will be able to engage in discussions in which he or she may express his or her own concerns, as an operator of a State body, to members of the Opposition, Members of the Dáil or county council members regarding particular issues on which he or she considers the Government may not be listening to them.  Such board members might enjoin committee members to become involved to bring matters to the attention of the Government.  I have no difficulty with activity of this nature on the part of a chief executive.  However, when it shifts into public commentary——</p>

This is not about scenarios in which a fundamental disagreement has taken place, which constitutes a clash.  This pertains to the contribution chief executives can bring to a policy debate because their unique position affords tremendous expertise and knowledge.  I refer to the shutting down of the possibility of having a rounded and informed input that would contribute constructively, whereby a chief executive could note that while certain measures were being taken, more could be done or whatever.  A phrase like that probably would be disallowed under this section of the Bill.  Does this provision extend to body language?  Quite often, body language informs better than anything else.</p>

          <p eId="para_308">The point being made is that no one has a difficulty with chief executives being required to work in a manner that is consistent with Government policy because that is the Minister's job.  Ministers are elected to put in place policy, correct or otherwise.  They have a mandate to so do and they employ chief executives to implement it.  I have no difficulty with this proposition and were one to begin to undermine this ministerial power, one would be undermining the essence of Government.  However, that differs from stating that a chief executive should not question or express an opinion on the merits of any Government policy.  Surely, chief executives should be allowed to express an opinion that a measure may or may not be working but that as it is Government policy, it is his or her job to implement it.</p>

          <p eId="para_312">It is quite the opposite.  It is about the ability of people like members of this committee to ask a question of them in the expectation of receiving an honest answer.  Chief executives should be able to state that while some flaws exist, their job is to implement Government policy and that they will do so.  However, members' capacity to put together alternative policies that make sense and which the Government might consider or accept is hampered by not allowing such chief executives even to express an opinion.</p>

          <p eId="para_313">I will not consider it because it is akin to people who pretend to be members of a parliamentary party but who consistently have views that fundamentally and completely are at odds with it.  Ultimately, such a dichotomy is pointed to and contradictions and controversies flow therefrom.  If one is part of an organisation, in this case a governmental structure or apparatus, one is obliged to work within it.  In a sense, a chief executive who has a problem in getting a Minister to understand that he or she has a serious issue has failed as a chief executive because he or she has failed to persuade the main shareholder.  The same holds true in respect of private industry, in that a chief executive who fails to convince his or her board or investors of the merit of his or her changes has failed and should resign.  Moreover, it is not open to a chief executive operating in the private sector, where I worked for many years, to invoke or mobilise party political or media opinion against the policies of his or her own board.  In the private sector, chief executives are obliged to work with their boards and shareholders.  At times, I may have been partial to the removal of a chief executive in a private sector company who believed he could do this.</p>

          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_350">(2) Where a person communicates his or her opinion, whether in writing or otherwise, to the Minister that a direction given by the Minister under this Act has been or is being contravened then, unless the person acts in bad faith, he or she shall not be regarded as having committed any breach of duty towards any other person, and no person shall have a cause of action against the first-mentioned person in respect of that communication.</p>

          <p eId="para_354">These amendments make a statutory provision for the protection of whistleblowers in the Bill.  In this day and age, it is important to have such provisions set out on a statutory basis.  Wrongdoing can occur in any organisation and it is important that individuals believe they can report such instances without being penalised.  Stringent penalties apply where a person falsely reports wrongdoing in an organisation.  These are designed to deter individuals from making vexatious allegations.  The proposed provisions are based on precedents contained in existing statutes and have been included following discussions with staff representatives.  I move that these amendments be accepted.</p>

          <from>Deputy Simon Coveney</from>
          <p eId="para_355">I agree with these amendments.  It is good to put whistleblower protection in place in legislation.  The management of a considerably valuable fish resource is an area that needs whistleblowers.  If people know that something is going on that should not be, they should be able to give information to the Garda, IFI, the Minister's office or whoever they choose.  They need protection.</p>
          <p eId="para_356">While I agree with what the Minister of State is doing in this respect, my one reservation is that it is not good practice to introduce a large new section into the Bill by amendment on Committee Stage.  To be perfectly honest, I have only skimmed through these amendments.  They make sense but I have not given them the type of scrutiny I would have given the rest of the Bill.  We did not have them for a long time as we only got them when we got the list of amendments.  Whereas I am supportive of the amendments, it is difficult for Opposition spokespeople to scrutinise legislation as we should on Committee Stage when new sections are being introduced to the Bill, even when those sections are worthwhile.  We will now need to examine them in the same way as we would have examined the rest of the Bill for Report Stage, but we will only have a short opportunity on Report Stage to make persuasive arguments to the Minister of State if we are to chop and change and improve the sections.  I am supportive of the legislation but the procedure puts us at a disadvantage in terms of giving the amendments the scrutiny required.</p>

          <p eId="para_357">I support the amendments.  We all do because the issue of whistleblowers has often been raised by my party in terms of a Bill that we published.  However, I am curious as to Government policy on whistleblowers.  As far as I recollect, the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney, made a point in respect of health, where whistleblowers constitute a significant issue, that coming legislation would include this provision.  Rather than having a whistleblowers Bill, the provision would be embedded in legislation as a matter of course where relevant.  This is my understanding of Government policy.  As such, why is it being inserted on Committee Stage instead of being included in the Bill as presented to the House initially?</p>

          <p eId="para_364">With all due respect, when we are dealing with legislation that will govern our behaviour as citizens, it is not right to hold back fundamental parts of a Bill back because the Government is not ready and must consult internally.  Deputy Coveney has made this same point.  I have no problem with consultation, but the Bill should not have been published until that consultation was done.  Neither should the consultation have delayed the Bill unduly.  We have pages of amendments that I have not read because they have only recently appeared.  This is not the way we should be providing oversight of legislation.  It is a feature of the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources that we find amendments on Committee Stage are longer than the original Bill.</p>

The most extraordinary example concerns another section of the Department, relating to premium rate services.  That is not directly the responsibility of the Minister of State.  It is a feature that is not appropriate in terms of how we provide oversight.

          <p eId="para_405">Section 54 concerns the power of the Minister to make by-laws and is essentially a restatement of section 9 of the Fisheries Consolidation Act 1959, as amended by subsequent fisheries legislation.  This amendment proposes to delete section 54(5) — a restatement of section 9(3) of the 1959 Act — which provides that no by-law shall be made which is repugnant to any law in force in the State or which would tend to injure the effective working power of any mill or factory.  It is proposed to remove this provision on foot of discussions with the fisheries boards and the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel.  While such provision would have been relevant when drafted in 1959, in current times one must be cognisant of existing environmental legislation introduced since the enactment of the original Act.  Instruments such as the EU water framework directive, the habitats directive, and eels regulation, demonstrate that protection of the environment is of paramount importance.  The retention of this provision would be against the spirit of current national, EU and international environmental policy.  In some cases a factory could be the polluter and the defender against the environmentalist and this provision would serve to protect the polluter.  The provision is archaic and not in keeping with current norms.</p>

          <p eId="para_409">I seek the deletion of the words in brackets regarding the website.  It would be a pity if we leave the option open whether the IFI should have a website.  There is no doubt the web has created an extension of democracy to an extraordinary degree.  Increasingly, people use the web to ensure they have access to information.  I urge the Minister of State to have a principle that where we are here setting up a body like this, a website is part of what it does rather than suggesting there should be a website if there is some money lying around.  This is an essential part of communication for reference, for archive, for information and for insight.  It also serves to promote the IFI and the website is a useful tool in that regard.  Leaving it as an optional extra is minimising the impact of this kind of communication, which should be part and parcel of any public body.</p>

          <p eId="para_410">This amendment permits the publication of any by-law made under section 54 of the Bill on the website of the IFI.  Deputy McManus seeks to have the term "if any" removed from the provision.  I have consulted the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel and I am advised this provision should not be amended.  The inclusion of the term "if any" offers protection to Inland Fisheries Ireland in case of any unforeseen difficulties with the webpage.  In any event, publication is provided for in the traditional media.  Accordingly, I cannot accept the proposed amendment.</p>
          <p eId="para_411">To finesse that point, although it is desirable it is not compulsory for bodies to have website.  From my engagement at constituency level, I know the websites of public organisations often have information that is not the full story on their websites.  That is one of the weaknesses of the web in this regard.  In order to make a website digestible or attractive, the criteria on the website do not match the policy of the body.  I have noticed this in respect of local authorities.  There must be some flexibility.</p>

          <p eId="para_451">I am not necessarily anti-privatisation but if such a decision is to be made, it brings us back to the argument of whether we should seek the approval of Dáil Éireann or ask the Minister to consult the relevant Oireachtas committee.  Selling State assets involves large strategic decisions and should involve some consultation with the appropriate committee or require the approval of the Dáil.  We may well be in a situation where the State must start raising money by selling assets deemed to be non-strategic.  I have already proposed that we should be doing so in the energy sector.  If we decide to do so in the fisheries or any other sector, a Minister needs to be able to make a coherent and persuasive case before the Dáil or an Oireachtas committee prior to so doing.  There needs to be a check on a ministerial decision, rather than just getting the consent of the Minister for Finance who may know nothing about fishing but just wants money.  I withdrew a previous amendment on the back of an assurance from the Minister of State that he would table an amendment to consult the appropriate Oireachtas committee.  If he takes the same approach in this instance, I will happily withdraw the amendment.  Otherwise, I will press it.</p>

          <p eId="para_452">This is not an ordinance that applies to other Ministers with regard to disposal; it is a standard feature that the Minister for Finance is consulted.  However, sanctioning a sale or disposal is an Executive power.  It is clear that selling large fisheries belonging to the State would have enormous policy implications; therefore, it is fair to give a Minister flexibility in this regard.  On the purchasing of assets, from time to time certain owners who may not be Irish and who may have their antecedents in our colonial past want to dispose of their fisheries.  Placing a requirement that he or she consult the Dáil before executing a significant purchase would restrict the Minister in his or her actions.</p>

          <p eId="para_501">This amendment concerns an amendment to section 55 of the Fisheries (Consolidation) Act 1959, which makes provision for the striking of rates on fisheries.  At present, rates are struck in respect of fisheries in each fisheries region.  Different rates can be struck in different regions.  Given that the fisheries regions will no longer exist on the establishment of Inland Fisheries Ireland, it is necessary to bring forward this amendment to allow Inland Fisheries Ireland to strike rates within its fisheries districts.  This will facilitate the striking of different rates in different districts, where appropriate, thereby maintaining the status quo.</p>

          <p eId="para_583">My apologies.  It is just that we had not commented on it.  I would make the same point — that this is a whole new section that I have not quite got my head around.  It puts in place a complaints and rights commissioner, as well as dealing with enforcement orders from the Labour Court and things like that.  I will come back on Report Stage if we have concerns about it.  I had not realised that amendment No. 68 had been taken with amendments Nos. 30 to 32, inclusive.</p>

It is not unusual for this Department, but many of my colleagues have a frustrating time on Committee Stage.  There are many examples of that but to be fair to the Minister of State, he is trying to accommodate us where he can.</p>
