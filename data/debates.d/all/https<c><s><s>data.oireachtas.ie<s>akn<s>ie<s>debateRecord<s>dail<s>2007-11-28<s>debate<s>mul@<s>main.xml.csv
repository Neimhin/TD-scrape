#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-28 00:00:00	Prelude	0	The provision of cancer services is a matter of very serious concern to a great number of people at the moment.  In 2000, the House debated a report on the employment of locum consultants around the country.  The then Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Martin, committed himself to setting up a working group to examine the structures, criteria and standards that should be in place for the employment of locums.  We have heard of concerns in very high profile cases recently about the involvement of locum practitioners.  I refer to the case of Rebecca O'Malley and her misdiagnosis.  A locum who worked in Galway for six months and who left Galway under a cloud was subsequently employed in Cork.  The individual working in Portlaoise was a locum before taking up permanent employment.What has been the impact of that working report in respect of the implementation of the structures for the employment of locums?  What changes were brought into effect?  Was there contact between officials in the health services in Galway, who were so concerned about the locum who worked there that they contacted HIQA, and officials in the health services in Cork in respect of the employment of the locum in question?What happened to the working group set up by the then Minister, Deputy Martin?  What are the conditions and why was there a breakdown in communications between health services whereby a locum in one area left under a cloud and was subsequently employed in another?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-28 00:00:00	Prelude	1	Locums have always made up a fundamental part of the health service.  That has been the case for decades and I am sure the system will continue to operate on that basis.  It is a crucial part of providing the services for holidays and for stand-in for the period it takes to employ a consultant.  In the general scheme of things, when a consultant appointment comes up many of the consultants who seek posts here are Irish doctors who have been senior registrars here and have gone to hospitals in the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia or the United States.  There is quite a gap between a vacancy and an appointment.  That has always been the case and I do not see how this can be done in a better way.From where I am looking at the figures, and not being a medical expert, the difficulty with a number of these posts is that it is not attractive for locums to take up these posts, especially in the small centres.  In most of these instances very few people applied for the posts.  I believe there was difficulty getting somebody to take up the post in Portlaoise, but that is not unusual either.  In the main centres these posts are seen as being enormously attractive.As I understand it, there was contact with the Health Information and Quality Authority.  It followed up and found out where the individuals had gone.  In a number of these cases that we have looked at recently there was medical contact and contact between the HSE and Galway and Cork.  In some cases the consultants might have gone further afield also.  If memory serves me, one of the briefings I received stated that when the consultant went out of the country the authority endeavoured to contact the authorities in that country — I do not know if this was successful in that.  The procedures are in place——

I do not want to give an impression that the removal of locums from the system can happen.  Locum appointments are part of the structure.  The aim of the group set up by Deputy Martin when he was Minister for Health and Children was to make sure there were standards in place for locum services.  They are in place, but that does not always mean one will get a suitable person to fill locum appointments.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-28 00:00:00	Prelude	4	I do not suggest the system can work without locums.  The question related to whether the terms set out in the working group report were implemented and whether there was communication between the health service in Galway and the hospital in Cork where the individual in question worked.Every Member has referred to the professionalism of Dr. Ann O'Doherty.  I listened to the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney, speak last night on the report and review carried out by Dr. O'Doherty, who did an enormous amount of work in a very short time.  The Minister stated on the record last night that she is not entitled to see the report.  She is the Minister for Health and Children and she requested and directed that this review be carried out.  She stated that the problem had arisen due to a breakdown in communications, which appears to be the latest excuse.  Can somebody explain why the Minister for Health and Children is not entitled to see Dr. O'Doherty's report?  I am sure she does not require legal editing of a report.  She is the Minister for Health and Children and the report is prepared for her perusal, yet she cannot see it.The Taoiseach and the Minister committed themselves to publishing this report.  Why is that not happening for the benefit of everybody?  The same situation occurred in the Leas Cross incident in which Deputy O'Dowd was involved for many years.  It was more than 12 months before that report was published.  Both the Taoiseach and the Minister for Health and Children have given a commitment on this, yet the Minister stated in the House last night that she is not entitled to see the report.  Is that in the interests of patients who have suffered great trauma?

#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-28 00:00:00	Prelude	16	Everybody has an interest in getting to the bottom of what happened so it is important that we see the report.  In that context, I was advised this morning that the final special clinic was provided by Professor Arnie Hill yesterday evening for all the women who were contactable and available.  Only a very small number of women did not attend and alternative arrangements have been made for their surgical review on a priority basis at the earliest date.  Every effort is being made to contact a small number of women yet to be contacted, including visiting known addresses for these women.  A small number are believed to have physically left the jurisdiction and a significant effort is being made to contact them.Of the group seen last night, some need further diagnostic investigations, similar to those who were seen last Saturday.  This is being organised as a matter of urgency.  For the small number of women who still need to be surgically reviewed because they were unable to attend either clinic on 24 and 27 November, the HSE will ensure they are accommodated for such review at the earliest opportunity.

These new pricing arrangements are due to come into effect next Saturday, 1 December.  In response, pharmacists have threatened to withdraw from dispensing medicines under the GMS scheme.  If that goes ahead next Saturday, medical card holders throughout the country will be unable to fill their prescriptions in the normal way at their chemists.  The problem has arisen because the HSE claims it cannot negotiate directly with the Irish Pharmaceutical Union because of the provisions of the Competition Act.  I understand some form of consultative process has been put in place under Mr. Bill Shipsey, SC to substitute for direct negotiations.Can the Taoiseach assure the House that all medical card holders in the country will be able to have their prescriptions filled in the normal way in their local pharmacy after next Saturday?  Second, will implementation of the pricing arrangements announced by the HSE be deferred from 1 December to allow negotiations to take place?  Third, does the Taoiseach accept that when the Competition Act was passed it was not intended by any Member of the House that it would be used to prevent direct discussions taking place between the Health Service Executive and bodies such as the Irish Pharmaceutical Union?  Is he prepared to accept the Labour Party Private Members' Bill, in the name of Deputy Michael D. Higgins, which would amend the Competition Act to allow bodies such as the Irish Pharmaceutical Union and Irish Actors Equity to negotiate directly with appropriate State agencies on behalf of their members?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-28 00:00:00	Prelude	20	I wish to return for a moment to Deputy Kenny's question.  When he asked me about the Minister's position, I answered as if it was the Minister's responsibility.  Of course, the reason for the legal position is that the Minister did not commission the report.  The HSE commissioned it, so legally the HSE must get clearance for the report.  That is the point in law.

#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-28 00:00:00	Prelude	23	In reply to Deputy Gilmore, we are making every effort to try to bring the pharmacy issue to a resolution.  Members have met a large number of pharmacists and my colleagues raised the issue with me last week.  We have been trying to find a resolution; there are a number of elements involved.  Discussions between the HSE and the IPU have continued under Mr. Bill Shipsey, SC on a mechanism to establish the community pharmacy contract.  Considerable progress has been made and the HSE management considers it appropriate to allow further time for this process to proceed.  The HSE has decided to defer the implementation of the reimbursement rates on 1 December to a later date.  That pressure is therefore removed.  Members will welcome that decision.  It is an issue my colleagues had asked me to raise.Following the completion of the new agreements with the drugs manufacturers last year, the HSE announced the new arrangements on the margins on 17 September.  That affects the basic supply of drugs and medicines.  This is distinct from the dispensing fees paid to the community pharmacists under the medical card and drugs payment scheme.  The new price arrangements will not come into force on 1 December.With regard to the Deputy's question about the process of dialogue established under Mr. Shipsey, that process is continuing.  As the union does not appear to accept the legal position under the Competition Act, the Minister for Health and Children has been exploring, in consultation with the Attorney General and other relevant Departments, the best way of progressing the development of a new contract with pharmacists.  Those discussions are ongoing.  Obviously, the Government and Minister are anxious to find a way of making a new arrangement for arriving at revised pricing arrangements for a new pharmacy contract, consistent with the legal advice the Minister has received.  Any new process must be consistent with competition law.  As I told the House a few weeks ago, it is not Irish competition law but European competition law.

#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-28 00:00:00	Prelude	29	It is planned that there will be continued engagement under Mr. Shipsey as the best way for both pharmacists and the HSE to continue to discuss the matter of mutual interest.  Efforts are continuing.  However, the pressure whereby people were being told that after Saturday they would have to start paying or make other arrangements, which was not factual in any case, has been avoided.
#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-28 00:00:00	Prelude	30	I welcome the fact that the HSE has deferred the 1 December deadline.  That will be a great relief for many medical card holders, pensioners and others who have been concerned about their access to prescription medicines.  There was a great deal of worry about it.  I hope the process under way will result in a new agreement on pricing arrangements which will avoid problems arising in the future.However, what gave rise to this is the problem with the Competition Act.  It is absurd that the Act is being used or interpreted in a way that amounts to competition dogma gone mad, where common sense is thrown out the window.  It is absurd that a body such as the HSE cannot meet with the Irish Pharmaceutical Union and directly work out the pricing arrangements.  Similarly, actors, for example, who do voice-overs for advertisements cannot have their fees negotiated by Irish Actors Equity.  That is ludicrous.There is a need to change the Competition Act to allow for common sense discussions and negotiations to take place in the normal way between unions and professional bodies representing their members and the different agencies to whom they provide services.  Will the Taoiseach examine the Bill prepared by the Labour Party and tabled by Deputy Higgins which would address this problem by amending the Competition Act to allow for common sense discussions to take place directly?  The situation with pharmacists at the moment is that the two sides cannot talk to each other directly so they must each separately send a representative into a room with Mr. Shipsey and talk through him.  It is nonsense.

I welcome the fact that the immediate threat of problems with prescriptions for medical card holders on 1 December has been lifted, at least for the time being.  However, the core problem with the Competition Act needs to be addressed.  I ask the Taoiseach again to consider seriously the Bill tabled by the Labour Party.
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-28 00:00:00	Prelude	33	I acknowledge Deputy Gilmore's point about the urgency with regard to what will happen on Saturday.  This was presented to me by my colleagues last week.  The recent developments are helpful and will allow the negotiations to continue.  As Deputy Gilmore will appreciate, I would be the first one to say that negotiations are necessary on every issue.  It is what I believe in.  The difficulty with the Competition Act not just from the point of view of pharmacists, but in other areas, is that the case was being put forward that to allow cartels or any group of people to fix their prices and arrangements was to prevent proper competition.  That is where the current arrangements came from.  The Competition Authority devised the system.  Obviously, it creates difficulties.

When the HSE, the Attorney General, the IPU and the APMI sought legal advice they all received the same advice from their eminent legal representatives that this was the difficulty.  That is where the current system came from.  It is creating problems in a number of areas. The difficulty in finding a resolution is the need to avoid returning to the cartel-type arrangements that were creating problems——

The total cost incurred by the unit for the first ten months of 2007 is €311,270, with €144,698 being a direct cost to the Department of the Taoiseach and €33,314 on average being borne by the five other Departments who have staff seconded to the unit.  The estimated annual cost for the communications unit in 2007 is €385,398.The unit provides a media information service to Government Ministers and their Departments.  It furnishes news updates and transcripts which ensure that Departments are kept informed in a fast and efficient manner of any relevant news developments.  In this way, Departments are able to provide a better service to the public.The communications unit works an 18-hour day based on a flexible rota of three working shifts.  The unit is staffed by six established civil servants, five of whom are seconded from other Departments.  The work of the unit means that Departments have greatly reduced their use of external companies and ensure that they no longer duplicate work such as transcripts and tapes.

As the response indicates, substantial public moneys are involved in the provision of this service.  Is it not, therefore, appropriate that the communications unit's reportage and updatings should be open to all Members equally so that we would enjoy the same access to information that it provides to the Taoiseach and his colleagues at Cabinet?  I think it is appropriate that this should be done.  While the Taoiseach has answered in the negative on this matter on many occasions, he has failed on every occasion to explain why it cannot be done.  If he will not do it, will the Taoiseach please explain the reason to the House?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-28 00:00:00	Prelude	44	There are two reasons.  The first is that work done by civil servants is not made open to the entire House.  This is similar to all other work done by civil servants in their professional capacity.  Second, all the parties in the House receive considerable aid for their own press offices.
#CaoimhglinOCaolain	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-party	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-dob	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-28 00:00:00	Prelude	45	With all respect, there is hardly any great secrecy around items which are news.  This is something to which we have general access through the reportage of our friends in the Fourth Estate.  Surely it is a very reasonable request that, in order to establish equality of membership of this House and the associate Chamber, the information flow, the reports from the communications unit, should be put on the internal Oireachtas website so that Members could enjoy the same access as the Taoiseach and his colleagues in Cabinet.  We are all paying for this.  These are established civil servants.  It is long past time that the information flow they provide in relation to breaking news and updating of stories should be openly and transparently available to all elected Members in both these Houses.  The Taoiseach's response fails to indicate adequately the reason, other than, I suggest, a stubborn holding on to something which he is not prepared to share.  I ask him to elaborate on his position.
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-28 00:00:00	Prelude	46	As I stated, this is not work done by the Oireachtas Commission.  If it were, it would be open to anybody.  Any work done within Government Departments is for the Government and in this case the staff of those Departments as well as Ministers.  The Deputy is right in that this is communications data, but on that basis everything would be provided by all civil servants.  On that basis, Sinn Féin would have to give me its communications and intelligence unit information, which would be far more interesting than this.

#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-28 00:00:00	Prelude	48	Deputy Fergus O'Dowd submitted a freedom of information request about the output of the communications unit in mid-June to see if it flagged the Irish Examiner story of 13 June which stated that Aer Lingus was to introduce new routes from Belfast.  That announcement, as everybody will be aware, led to the cessation of flights from Shannon and the transfer of the slots to the Belfast-Heathrow route.In that request Deputy O'Dowd was told that the communications unit did not inform the Taoiseach of the article in question.  However, in the report entitled "Report to the Minister for Transport on the circumstances surrounding the Aer Lingus decision on the Shannon-Heathrow link" produced by the Secretary General of the Department of Transport, Ms Julie O'Neill, we see that the Secretary General was aware of the article of 13 June and she made others aware of it.  That begs a number of questions.  First, what is the point in having a communications unit that does not see an article with as significant a consequence as this?Second, is the Taoiseach aware that the communications unit missed not only the Irish Examiner report but also the Irish Independent coverage of that story?  Does the Taoiseach find it a little strange, or certainly unusual, that while the communications unit reported and highlighted articles from the Irish Examiner and the Irish Independent of 11 and 12 June, for some strange reason it did not highlight any article from 13 June where, clearly, in two newspapers, there were references to this story?  What is the point in having a communications unit that appears to be selective or that, for some unusual reason, missed one of the major stories of the summer?It is frankly incredible that a Secretary General of a major Department would not keep a Minister properly informed on an ongoing basis of what is happening.  For the short period I was in the Department across the road the Secretary General was in the office ten times a day stating I should be informed of the consequences of this written question or an incident that happened.  The question for the communications unit and, indeed, for the Taoiseach relates to when the Secretary General of this major Department became aware of this story.  What is the difference between her being informed and the Minister not being informed?  The Emergency Powers — No. 144 — Order 1942  referred to this matter and the question raised was:Here the State, by the instrumentality of the Government, was the acquiring entity".  Was ‘the State' the same as a ‘government department'?I realise this is straying a little from the communications unit, but under company law all shareholders would have been notified of the consequence and if the Secretary General was informed or became aware, through the communications unit or by some other method, and the Minister was left in the dark, was the Government informed by virtue of the fact that the Department knew?

That is what it does a number of times every day.The Aer Lingus decision on the establishment of a hub in Belfast and the withdrawal of Shannon-Heathrow services was announced by the company on 7 August.  The position is no reports of the decision came to the attention of the communications unit in my Department in advance of the company's announcement on 7 August.  It picked it up on 7 August, but it did not pick it up in the northern newspapers, which it does not monitor, or in the Irish Examiner earlier than that.

The public is paying for a communications unit.  This is a major story.  It is followed on the same day by another headline, “Donaldson urges Aer Lingus to use Belfast”, yet the personnel working in the communications unit did not see this.  The Taoiseach stated it was reported on 7 August, but it was in leading articles in the newspapers on 13 June.

Was she informed by the communications unit or by some other method?  Certainly, she was wise to what was going on.The Taoiseach has not answered the second question about whether information given to the Secretary General is informing the Government because she is Secretary General of a Department.Was anybody in the communications unit asked specifically why these two stories with major implications, which caused so much rumpus during the summer and which will cause so many economic consequences in the mid-west, were missed by the communications unit?  Why were these two articles from both newspapers not circulated to the Minister in June, long before this came to a head in August, when he stated he was not informed about it until the weekend before?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-28 00:00:00	Prelude	63	It was not picked up by the communications unit.  It was not listed as one of its stories of the day, even though it had a long list of stories that day.  It was in the Irish Examiner and the Belfast Telegraph.  That was seen by the Department but, as we know now from the reports that the Minister, Deputy Dempsey, has, the Department did not believe at that stage that that was a major story.  It did not believe, even on 7 August, that it would be a major story.

The communications unit is supposed to take relevant current affairs issues and, apparently, circulate them to Ministers so that they are well informed.  Here are two pages from two major newspapers in the Republic and, for some reason, the communications unit reported on 11 and 12 June, but missed 13 June.  That is, if not coincidental, very strange.  I do not know whether the Taoiseach has asked the head of the communications unit why this was passed over, or was it just one of those mornings?

The Minister would have been informed and I am quite sure that the Minister for Transport, Deputy Dempsey, was so informed.

Sometime beforehand, newspapers had reported that such a review was being carried out.  Did the communications unit miss that story as well or was it communicated to the Department of Health and Children?My difficulty in this regard and with the Taoiseach's reply to Deputy Kenny is that the communications unit seems to be doing no more than scanning the headlines and providing a service to Departments that they could easily get by clicking onto any number of websites to see the day's news headlines.  When we put it to the Taoiseach previously that the unit, for which the taxpayer pays €400,000 per year, was effectively a political operation and that it was in place to provide political spying and reporting on the press and critics of the Government, he told the House that it provided a great public service and would provide information to Departments alerting them of stories in newspapers concerning important public events.  It is not a scanning-the-headlines job.  It is trawling the newspapers and finding the stories, whether in respect of Aer Lingus at Shannon or the ultrasounds review, to alert Departments and Ministers.Is this outfit, which costs almost €400,000 per year, doing its job properly?  Given the Taoiseach's answer, it is difficult to know what it does for 18 hours per day, which is a long time to read newspapers, and for the money in question if it is not doing what we suspect it of doing, namely, finding out how many times Professor John Crown appears on RTE and reporting such to the Minister for Health and Children.

#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-28 00:00:00	Prelude	87	It is not like party press offices that misrepresent statements in the House every day.  That is not its function.  Even if Deputy Gilmore believes it is a matter of someone in a Department just clicking on websites, then someone must be doing that.  It is what the people in the communications unit do.  They send back someone else's data.  This is why they have been seconded to the unit.  The data cannot click itself over to the Department without someone being there to do it.  Let us not be silly about the issue.
#BrianHayes	unknown-#BrianHayes-party	unknown-#BrianHayes-dob	unknown-#BrianHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-28 00:00:00	Prelude	88	Would the Taoiseach run that by us again?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-28 00:00:00	Prelude	89	They do not communicate every single headline in every newspaper everyday, only when asked.  Before, every Department used outside agencies to get interviews, tapes and cassettes, costing the State a fortune.  The unit monitors, keeps the data and does scripts, saving the State a large amount of money.  Ten years ago when it was done the old way, we spent nearly as much money as we are spending now.  The unit is saving money, but it does not list every single story.  It gives information to Secretaries General, assistant principal officers and a range of people.  Reporting every single headline would be meaningless.It handles the main headlines of the day fairly well.  I scan the report early every morning and it is a fairly good assessment of news headlines, but it will not go to page 17, 18 or 15 to take up every single heading.  It has never done so because that would defeat its purpose.
#BrianHayes	unknown-#BrianHayes-party	unknown-#BrianHayes-dob	unknown-#BrianHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-28 00:00:00	Prelude	90	There are not too many vacancies in that Department.

In that reply, he stated:The communications unit works an 18 hour day based on a flexible rota of three working shifts.  The unit is staffed by six established civil servants, five of whom are seconded from other Departments.According to the Taoiseach, the unit's purpose is to furnish "news updates and transcripts which ensure that Departments are kept informed in a fast and efficient manner of any relevant news developments" so that they may "provide a better service to the public".  This is different from doing a summary of headlines everyday and sending clippings to the relevant Departments.  These questions have been asked in the House a number of times.  The justification for the communications unit given to date was that it is a fast and efficient operation that spots something in a newspaper and alerts the relevant Department.  Today, we are being told a different story, namely, that the unit's job is to scan headlines, the purpose of which I do not see.When we ask why the communications unit, which costs almost €400,000 per year, does not alert Departments to significant issues — the Department of Transport's excuse was that it did not see the newspaper story about Aer Lingus and the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney's excuse was that she did not see the newspaper story about the ultrasound review and was relying on HSE officials to tell Members — the Taoiseach's new answer is that such is not the unit's job.It does not take 18 hours per day and three shifts to read newspaper headlines and e-mail them to Departments.  Why is the taxpayer spending €400,000 per year for a unit that is supposed to alert Departments to significant events when it did not alert them to two of the most significant public events in the Government's lifetime because the stories were on inside pages or in small print, which the unit does not read?  It is ludicrous.  We have always suspected this unit to be for political purposes.

The data is regularly sought under FOI in the House.  A large number of Deputies put down FOI requests.It is known precisely how these civil servants function.  All senior Civil Service ranks get those sheets, tapes and transcripts every day.  It is an apolitical job.  I have outlined before in reply to Deputy Kenny how there were protocols and procedures during the general election that kept them outside the political system.  To make an accusation and insinuate, as has been done, that they are monitoring or collecting data for any use about anybody is incorrect.  They do not do that, not to mind for a political purpose.  They do not cover every single headline in every single newspaper.

He is the one who has done the greatest disservice to the independence of the Civil Service in his continuing refusal to respect the right of all Members to the reportage this team of established and well-paid civil servants carries out.  It is a function he holds in reserve for himself and his Cabinet colleagues.It is simply insufficient and is not a proper utilisation of public moneys.  In equating the communications unit with his Fianna Fáil publicity team, as he has drawn the analogy with the publicity teams of other parties, it is he who has created the problem.  He should recognise the problem he has created and that it is his role and responsibility to apologise.  Will the Taoiseach reconsider his stubborn refusal to have the information these public servants provide to him and his colleagues placed on the Oireachtas website so that every Member can have equity of access?

#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-28 00:00:00	Prelude	133	What I told him this morning is what I have always told him.  The communications unit is not working for the Commission of the House of the Oireachtas.  It is part of the Civil Service of the State.  It is supervised, monitored and answerable to the Civil Service of the State, like any other State office.  Any other office of the State does not provide the data it prepares to Members.  This data is provided to Ministers and Ministers of State, along with over 100 users of the system across Departments, from Secretaries General to Assistant Secretaries and Principal Officers.The data is a summary of newspaper headlines and 7 o'clock radio headlines of which an electronic copy is available to all users from 7.30 a.m.  The main news bulletins are summarised throughout the day.  It consists of detailed summaries of "Morning Ireland", lunchtime news programmes, early evening television news, 9 o'clock news and current affairs programme such as "PrimeTime" and "Questions and Answers".  These are summarised and then faxed or, mainly nowadays, e-mailed to users.  A two-weekly library of news programmes, including weekend programmes, is maintained.  Copies of video and audio tapes are available to all Departments on request.This eliminates what used to happen when the same news stories would be gathered by a half dozen Departments and the State paid outside operators to collect the information.  The unit is not involved in any other function.It does that well and as professionally as it can.  It works 18 hours but the five people in the unit are not all there at the one time.  From early morning to late evening, they update the information and present transcripts and data to all Departments and Minister of State sections.  It carries out a good service that is not in any way politicised.  It had clear protocols in the run-up to the general election when it could make no reference whatsoever to it.I do not know the people from this section from Adam.  I may have met the individual in my Department but I have not met the others.  I do not go to the unit's office.  It is not in any way politicised and that is why I react to these claims.  These are civil servants doing their job.  It is not the same as a political party press office.  There is no, and there never was any, association or affiliation with any political party press office, be it Fianna Fáil, the Green Party or the Progressive Democrats.  It is an entirely efficient and small operation that is saving the State money compared to what used to be an inefficient system.  I have never even walked into the unit's office but if any Member wishes to see it at work, they are welcome.  I have been answering questions on this for years but today Deputy Gilmore has phrased it differently.  There is no political element to this unit whatsoever.

Three times in replies the Taoiseach refused to answer the question.Three times the parliamentary question was forwarded to the Department of Transport.  The reply sent to me asked if the communications unit of the Department of Transport ever noted the story, a question I never asked.  I was informed that it never had and does not have such a unit.  There is an issue of due process, knowledge and treating Members with respect.  The Taoiseach spoke of treating civil servants with respect, with which I agree.  However, Members are entitled to key and particular information.The Taoiseach's reply also refused to answer the other part of my parliamentary question — to whom are these topics circulated.  I want a full list of civil servants who receive this information.  We spend €350,000 per annum paying the unit to do this job.The Secretary General of the Department of Transport prepared a report which contains a comment from an Irish Examiner story on 13 June.  Where did she get it?  The communications unit did not see this story or summarise any story from the Irish Examiner for 13 June 2007.  The Department of Transport informs me it has no communications unit.  Where in the name of God did this come from?The Taoiseach's communications policy is an absolute and disgraceful mess.  Members cannot get an answer to a parliamentary question, even when it is tabled three times.  It is not good enough to treat us with such absolute contempt.  To whom are those documents circulated?

#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-28 00:00:00	Prelude	154	I replied to the effect that I noted that the Deputy had made reference on a number of occasions to the transfer of parliamentary questions which he had put down to me to the Minister for Transport.  I stated that far from there being a reluctance on my part to engage with the issues concerned, I was merely following well-established precedent that questions are answered by the Minister of the Government having responsibility for the substantive question.  I stated that I had in Leaders' Questions and on other occasions addressed the matters which were the subject of the Deputy's query.  I continued that the position was that the Secretary General of my Department had inquired of the Secretary General of the Department of Transport about the likelihood of industrial action arising in Aer Lingus in the event that changed work practices were imposed on 1 August.On the margins of the interdepartmental meeting about other matters held in my Department on 27 July, the Secretary General of the Department of Transport and the Assistant Secretary advised my Secretary General, who had raised the query in his role as Chairperson of the National Implementation Body, that it was not expected that such an industrial relations issue would arise.  They went on to say that they had learned that it was the intention of the company to announce a new base in Belfast and this would have implications for Shannon and there would likely be industrial relations consequences.I continued that they also advised that they were prepared to brief the Minister and would be in contact with the CEO of Aer Lingus on his return from leave the following Monday and the Minister would be meeting representatives of the company later that week.  I further stated that I was informed by the Minister for Transport on 3 August that he had been told by company representatives that it was their intention to terminate the Shannon-Heathrow service and that this would be announced on 7 August.I stated that with regard to the media monitoring unit in my Department, the position was that the unit disseminates a summary of radio and television headlines and of newspaper headlines on a regular basis to a wide range of personnel across Departments.  Its role is purely one of dissemination of the news summaries and it does not have the role of bringing specific matters to my or any other Minister's attention.  The unit did not bring any matter relating to Shannon or Belfast to attention.In fairness to me, and with the greatest respect to Deputy O'Dowd, I did not answer questions which were not in order for me to answer, but I did not ignore him and I went to the trouble of writing personally to him.  He should at least acknowledge that because it is not something I do regularly.

#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-28 00:00:00	Prelude	158	On a point of order, that is not the question.  I followed what is a well established precedent.  I could not answer but rather than ignore the Deputy, I sent him a written reply which I would not normally do.  However, I did so out of respect for the Deputy.  I could not answer questions that were not sent to me, or that were not for my Department.
#FergusODowdFG	unknown-#FergusODowdFG-party	unknown-#FergusODowdFG-dob	unknown-#FergusODowdFG-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-28 00:00:00	Prelude	159	The question the Taoiseach is answering orally today is what his communications unit does.  My parliamentary question was whether his communications unit noticed this story in the paper.  He refused to answer that and I had to raise it three or four times.  If the Taoiseach checks that in the Official Report, he will find out how many times I raised it here.  I said we would make the Taoiseach accountable in the Dáil.  That is the purpose of this question.  That is why this trouble happened.  The Taoiseach refused to answer my question.  Worse than that, the question — did the communications unit there notice it? — was sent to a Department in a format which the Department could not possibly answer because it does not have a communications unit.  This makes the parliamentary question process look foolish.  That is why I am putting pressure on the Taoiseach today to be more transparent, open and accountable.  That is our job and we will make sure the Taoiseach responds.

#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-28 00:00:00	Prelude	175	The Taoiseach's description of the communications unit is rather charming.  It sounds like a downtown library of which we would all like to be members.  It sounds as if this service is better than the RTE website.  If it is as innocuous and value free, as politically unloaded and unbiased as the Taoiseach suggests, what would be wrong with making it available to all Members of the House?In recent debates about who knew what and when in the health services, the Tánaiste asked last night for bipartisanship in respect of the development of cancer services, an idea with which most people would agree in principle.  If real bipartisanship was to develop on this important issue, a critical factor would be to establish what the Minister knew about the ultrasound review carried out by the surgeon, Dr. Peter Naughton, to which several newspaper reports referred.  The Taoiseach referred to this yesterday in a reply to the leader of the Labour Party when he said that Dr. Naughton had carried it out "to be sure, to be sure".  If we all had the benefit of this wonderful clippings service, which could be distributed to everyone here at a nominal cost on top of the existing €400,000 cost, we might then be in a position to have some serious bipartisanship.  Would the Taoiseach consider that suggestion?  Why could information not go in the format the Taoiseach has described to every Member, or why not post it on the Taoiseach's website?  Similar services are provided in other countries.

#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-28 00:00:00	Prelude	183	I do not oppose the proposal but is the Taoiseach satisfied that the Copyright and Related Rights (Amendment) Bill 2007 and the motion on the despatch of Defence Forces personnel represent sufficient business on the Order Paper to necessitate the House sitting later than 8.30 p.m.?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-28 00:00:00	Prelude	184	The Whip advises me that there is sufficient business.

#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-28 00:00:00	Prelude	186	I do not object to the proposal but this is part of the triple lock mechanism whereby the Dáil must consent to the despatch of troops.  My party does not object to this and has never objected to such matters being debated in the House but the Minister for Defence suggested this morning that the central issue is that the Government must wait for a report on the matter from Lieutenant General Pat Nash, operational commander of the EU mission to Chad.  I am informed that there is a likelihood of a major civil war in southern Sudan and that millions of refugees could stream across the border to Chad from Darfur.  Has the Government considered the logistics of dealing with a human catastrophe that may erupt there?  Whether we give consent to despatch troops is a matter for the Dáil.  However, is it wise to give consent now if we find later that Irish troops, as part of the EU force, do not have the necessary logistical back up, particularly in the area of air transport?  The military commander in charge of the mission may yet decline to send the force because there is no agreement on the capacity for air transport.
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-28 00:00:00	Prelude	187	Until Lieutenant General Pat Nash, operational commander of the EU mission to Chad, gives his approval we will not proceed but today's motion, I understand, relates only to the first 50 troops to be sent in December.  It is hoped that the issue of air transport will be resolved if it has not yet been resolved because the situation in the area is difficult.  Rebels in Sudan have been on the move of late, as they were this time last year, and this has made the situation problematic in the past week.  The Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Dermot Ahern, visited the area two weeks ago and reported to the House on the situation.  There will ultimately be 800 Irish troops in the region and the first group to arrive will be the Army Ranger wing, which is to make preparations.  Lieutenant General Nash feels that sending this group will not present a difficulty but we will have to decide what to do after that.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-28 00:00:00	Prelude	188	Will the Dáil have to give its consent again to the sending of further troops?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-28 00:00:00	Prelude	189	It will probably be March before the full brigade is sent and if there are difficulties with this the matter will probably come before the House again.  It is necessary that the first 50 troops be sent.
#JohnODonoghue	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-party	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-dob	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-28 00:00:00	Prelude	190	The Taoiseach has replied but I will allow Deputy Gilmore a brief intervention on No. 10.
#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-28 00:00:00	Prelude	191	I appreciate the Ceann Comhairle's indulgence because everyone in the House is proud of our Defence Forces, our missions abroad and the courageous work that will be done in Chad.  We also recognise that this is a potentially dangerous mission and I ask that the Taoiseach or Minister for Defence tell the House in the course of the debate the arrangements being made to ensure troops have the necessary resources, particularly air transport, to enable them carry out the mission effectively and ensure their safety.
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-28 00:00:00	Prelude	192	That will be done in the course of the debate.  Lieutenant General Nash, as operational commander of the EU mission to Chad, is satisfied with arrangements.  The outstanding matter was the issue of helicopters because it is a huge country and the logistics of the operation present difficulties.  Many refugees are in the area and rebels have been creating many problems in the past week so this has added to pressure.  The 50 troops that are to be sent in advance of the main body are well equipped and are from the elite wing of the Defence Forces.  However, there is no point suggesting the mission is not difficult.
#JohnODonoghue	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-party	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-dob	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-28 00:00:00	Prelude	193	Is the proposal relating to No. 10 agreed?  Agreed?
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-28 00:00:00	Prelude	194	When is No. 20, the minerals development Bill, likely to come before the House?  It is supposed to be published in mid 2008 and I would appreciate an update.
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-28 00:00:00	Prelude	195	That will come before the House around the middle of 2008.
#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-28 00:00:00	Prelude	196	There have been reports in the media that the Taoiseach indicated the referendum on the EU reform treaty and the referendum on children might be held on the same day.  If that is the case, when is it anticipated that the committee on the children's referendum will report?  Is it the Taoiseach's intention to indicate a date for the referendum on the EU reform treaty to the Heads of State he meets in Lisbon on 13 and 14 December?  Does the Taoiseach intend to consult Opposition parties on the referendum on the EU reform treaty and will he discuss with us the implications of holding that referendum on the same day as the referendum on children?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-28 00:00:00	Prelude	197	As I previously stated, the matter of whether the two referenda should be held on the same day will be discussed with party leaders.  I understand the children's committee will take about four months to report, the referendum Bill will come before the House and a Green Paper and White Paper will be published and circulated around the country so logistics will influence the timing of that referendum.  At the European Council I will point out that a referendum on the EU reform treaty is a constitutional requirement and will be held by the due date.
#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-28 00:00:00	Prelude	198	Is the Taoiseach aware of the difficulties being experienced by numerous people, including young first-time buyers, in closing house sales because of difficulties with various banks, the credit crunch and the collapse of several solicitors' businesses?  In that context, does the Government propose to bring forward the financial services regulation Bill?  Several of these entities, although acting as financial services agents and intermediaries, are not regulated.  Considerable suffering is being caused to a growing number of first-time buyers and others selling houses and involved in a transaction chain because the title deeds and mortgages have not been cleared by banks.
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-28 00:00:00	Prelude	199	The legislation is due next year.  The Department is examining some of the issues referred to by the Deputy.
#JanOSullivan	unknown-#JanOSullivan-party	unknown-#JanOSullivan-dob	unknown-#JanOSullivan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-28 00:00:00	Prelude	200	Will the Taoiseach clarify his reply to Deputy Stagg yesterday on the nursing home support scheme Bill?  Each time I ask about this, the Taoiseach says that the new scheme will be implemented on 1 January.  I sought clarification from his office in this regard last week.  However, his reply yesterday indicated that the introduction of the new scheme may now be deferred.  This would be welcomed by the groups representing older people because it would allow time for consultation to take place.  The Taoiseach said the Bill would be published before the next session.  Does he still intend to bring it through both Houses before the Christmas recess?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-28 00:00:00	Prelude	201	That is the intention.  However, the Bill is not yet ready.  It will be published this session but we will have to wait and see.
#JanOSullivan	unknown-#JanOSullivan-party	unknown-#JanOSullivan-dob	unknown-#JanOSullivan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-28 00:00:00	Prelude	202	The groups concerned would welcome a deferral if that facilitated consultation.
#JamesBannon	unknown-#JamesBannon-party	unknown-#JamesBannon-dob	unknown-#JamesBannon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-28 00:00:00	Prelude	203	Many primary schools throughout the State are struggling with limited space and working out of substandard buildings.  Meanwhile, new guidelines are being introduced by the Minister for Education and Science to oblige schools to retain data on pupils for 17 years.  Will this be dealt with in the education Ireland Bill?  When can we expect that Bill to come before the House?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-28 00:00:00	Prelude	204	It will be brought before the House next year.

The commencement order for the scheme was signed by the Minister for Health and Children on 12 September 2007.  However, these groups report that the operation of the scheme is on a restricted basis only due to the rigours applied by the HSE.  Given that these organisations represent people who have suffered as a result of State failure, neglect and worse — some of them fatally — can we now expect legislation to amend the Hepatitis C Compensation Tribunal (Amendment) Act 2006, the flaws in which many Members pointed out at the time, or will a new order in regard to the rules and regulations of the scheme be introduced to address——

#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-28 00:00:00	Prelude	215	The Deputy should put down a question to the Minister.  That is how he will obtain a response.
#BrianHayes	unknown-#BrianHayes-party	unknown-#BrianHayes-dob	unknown-#BrianHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-28 00:00:00	Prelude	216	One of the problems in regard to third level maintenance grants is the late payment to so many students throughout the State.  The Government has promised to introduce a student support Bill to address this and other issues.  I understand the Taoiseach told Deputy Quinn yesterday on the Order of Business that it is likely this Bill will not come before the House until the next session.  Given the urgency of trying to put a new regime in place for September of next year, will the Taoiseach undertake to publish the heads of the Bill, which I understand have been passed by the Cabinet?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-28 00:00:00	Prelude	217	I will raise that with the Minister.  The heads of the Bill have been approved and I understand the legislation will be available this session, but that may be in January.
#LeoVaradkar	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-party	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-dob	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-28 00:00:00	Prelude	218	There is an ongoing problem in providing school sites and developing new schools in rapidly growing areas.  I refer to page 42 of the programme for Government, entitled High-Quality School Buildings and Planning for New Schools, in which a specific commitment is given to ensure that no rezoning of land for residential development can take place without a prior commitment to provide an appropriate portion of land for a school.  However, the recent "Prime Time" special report showed that local authorities throughout the State are rezoning land willy-nilly without making provision for schools.  With the exception of the provisions for strategic development zones, there is currently no legislation that would allow local authorities to require that school sites be provided as part of residential developments.  This issue does not form part of the remit of the review group currently reviewing local government and proposing amendments to the Local Government Act.  When will the Taoiseach introduce amendments to the Planning and Development Act to honour the commitment in the programme for Government?
#JohnODonoghue	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-party	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-dob	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-28 00:00:00	Prelude	219	Is legislation promised on this issue in the programme for Government?

#MaryUpton	unknown-#MaryUpton-party	unknown-#MaryUpton-dob	unknown-#MaryUpton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-28 00:00:00	Prelude	221	A large number of my parliamentary questions to the Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism have been returned to me this morning or passed on to other Departments with the advice that they are not the responsibility of the Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism.  Whose responsibility are they?  For example, one of my questions asked the Minister about the discussions he has had with the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform in regard to Garda vetting of persons involved in sport.  That question has been passed to the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform.  It seems the Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism has no responsibility to initiate any discussion on such Garda vetting.  It is a ridiculous situation.  I do not know whether quangos are running the State or if the Minister is responsible for his Department.

#SeymourCrawford	unknown-#SeymourCrawford-party	unknown-#SeymourCrawford-dob	unknown-#SeymourCrawford-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-28 00:00:00	Prelude	223	We have had good news in Monaghan in that some minerals have been discovered.  When will the minerals development Bill be brought forward to consolidate legislation in this area?  The second issue to which I refer is not so easy to address.  More than 2,000 people attended a protest in Monaghan town last night regarding EirGrid.  It is absolutely essential that a debate on this issue be held in the House.  There are several ways this can be done, whether through Private Members' business or by bringing forward the electricity (transfer of transmission assets) Bill.  We were told that the Minister has no responsibility for this issue, but the transfer has not taken place and the legislation has not been brought to the House.  Who has responsibility and when will a debate be facilitated in the House?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-28 00:00:00	Prelude	224	The first Bill to which the Deputy referred will be introduced next year, as will the electricity (transfer of transmission assets) Bill.

No questions are being answered by the Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism.  Who is responsible for rejecting questions that are clearly related to the Minister's brief?  Is the Minister responsible for anything?

Yesterday during Question Time, I tried to ascertain the Government's view on the probability of a unilateral declaration of independence in Kosovo and the possible implications for our forces there.

What emerged from yesterday's session is that a multitude of organisations are involved in public transport, participating in turf warfare with public money.  This should be a growth sector and taxpayers' money is at stake when people will not co-operate with each other.  If the Dublin Transport Authority is to proceed, this Bill should be introduced.

This interest was in evidence during the extensive debate here on Second Stage and subsequently in the amendments put down on Committee Stage.Equally, I thank Deputies for the constructive and co-operative spirit they have shown in enabling this legislation to be taken swiftly through the Houses.  It is important Ireland comes into compliance with EU law in this area and the passage of this legislation in both Houses safeguards this objective.I thank the staff of the Bills Office and the Whips' Office for dealing expeditiously with the Bill.  I also thank my own staff in the Department.  As this is urgent legislation, I am grateful to the House for its prompt passage.

The area of copyright and intellectual property is complicated and it was very necessary that this piece of legislation be enacted as quickly as possible.  I thank the Minister of State and the staff in his Department, the Bills Office and the Whips' Office because complicated pieces of legislation are never easy and take a degree of time to put together, which we all know.As a result of the measure's urgency, the co-operation of everyone was very important.  It will give a degree of comfort to people relying on the legislation for protection.  Although we sometimes cannot physically put our hands on something, it can nevertheless be someone's property.  This piece of legislation will ensure that protection will be given to people operating in this area.  I am very glad to see the legislation going through and I thank the Minister for his courtesy.

#WillieODea	unknown-#WillieODea-party	unknown-#WillieODea-dob	unknown-#WillieODea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-28 00:00:00	Prelude	257	I move:That Dáil Éireann approves the despatch, pursuant to section 2 of the Defence (Amendment) (No. 2) Act 1960, as applied by the Defence (Amendment) Act 2006, of a contingent of the Permanent Defence Force for service with the EU military operation named "EUFOR TCHAD/RCA", established under the authority of United Nations Security Council Resolution 1778 (2007), including headquarter elements to be located as may be determined from time to time.I thank the Members for agreeing to take this motion today on the planned deployment of a contingent of the Defence Forces to Chad and the Central African Republic and I look forward to a constructive and positive debate in this regard.As the House is aware, under the Defence Acts, the deployment of a contingent of the Defence Forces on an overseas mission requires prior UN authorisation, Government approval and the approval of Dáil Éireann.  This process is referred to as the triple lock, which is a cornerstone of this Government's approach to deploying our forces abroad.In commending this motion to the House, I will briefly outline the background to the proposed EU operation in the Republic of Chad and the Central African Republic, which has been authorised by the United Nations Security Council and the reason the Government decided to authorise the despatch of a contingent of the Permanent Defence Force for service with the new EU operation.The multiple conflicts in the border areas between Darfur, Chad and the Central African Republic constitute a threat to peace and security in the whole region.  In Chad, following an agreement between the Government of Chad and the peaceful political opposition in August 2007, a peace deal was signed between the government and four rebel groups in October 2007.  However, there continue to be major problems with ongoing clashes between rebels and government forces.  Arising from these clashes, more than 180,000 internally displaced Chadians and 236,000 Sudanese refugees now live in camps in eastern Chad.In the case of the Central African Republic, the already fragile situation has been exacerbated by the activities of criminal gangs, the spillover of instability from Darfur and Chad and an armed rebellion in the north west and north east.  Approximately 170,000 people have been forced to flee their homes since September 2005 and more than 43,000 refugees in the Central African Republic reside in Chad, with 20,000 people thought to have fled to Cameroon.  Malnutrition has reached alarming levels, particularly among children.While conflict and lack of security have resulted in the mass displacement of the local population, the humanitarian crisis thus created has been exacerbated by natural disasters.  In August 2007, serious flooding in eastern Chad washed out several camps and seriously hampered aid agencies' assistance to tens of thousands of people.Since early September 2007, the crisis in Chad has been given greater prominence by the visit of UN Secretary General, who was there to build support for the proposed multidimensional UN mission.  Former President, Mary Robinson, together with a group of women leaders, also led a well-publicised visit to Chad's camps in the same period.  Her report of what she witnessed and what she heard from the women refugees is shocking.  Women who had escaped from horrific attacks by militiamen in Darfur now faced being targeted and raped in the refugee camps, afraid to go out to collect food and firewood.  She has called for an EU force to protect refugee camps, highlighting the need for security as the refugees and displaced persons, in particular women, are not safe in the camps.The authorities of Chad and the Central African Republic have welcomed a possible EU military presence in their respective countries.  This was reiterated during the visit of the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Dermot Ahern, to Chad on 15 and 16 November where he received such assurances from the Chadian Prime Minister.  The signing of the peace deal in Chad in October 2007, although under some strain now, can still provide an opportunity for greater stability in the region and, with the deployment of the UN mission, an improved environment for assisting and protecting refugees and supporting the distribution of humanitarian aid.  The EU mission to Chad will complement the planned UN and African Union hybrid mission being launched by the UN in Darfur-Sudan by limiting the spillover potential from the conflict in Sudan.On 25 September 2007, the UN Security Council unanimously adopted Resolution 1778 establishing a multidimensional United Nations mission in Chad and the Central African Republic that will help strengthen security in the region.  The multidimensional presence will comprise a United Nations mission in Chad and in the Central African Republic, to be known as MINURCAT, focusing on the security and protection of civilians — particularly refugees, internally displaced persons and civilians in danger — and on human rights and the rule of law in eastern Chad and north-eastern Central African Republic; and troops deployed by the European Union with a robust authorisation to protect and support it.  In its decision of 15 October 2007, the Council of the European Union agreed a joint action to launch the ESDP mission in support of the UN operation in Chad and in the Central African Republic.The United Nations element of the mission is targeted primarily at supporting the civil administration in Chad and the Central African Republic to protect refugees and camps with the support of a UN police element and liaison officers.UN Security Council Resolution 1778 authorises the European Union, under Chapter VII of the United Nations Charter, to deploy for a period of one year from the date that its initial operating capability is declared by the European Union in consultation with the Secretary General.  The EU forces will be deployed to eastern Chad and the north-eastern Central African Republic.  The EU forces are authorised to support the UN and to take all necessary measures, within their capabilities and their area of operation to fulfil the following functions: to contribute to protecting civilians in danger, particularly refugees and displaced persons; to facilitate the delivery of humanitarian aid and the free movement of humanitarian personnel by helping to improve security in the area of operations; to contribute to protecting United Nations personnel, facilities, installations and equipment; and to ensuring the security and freedom of movement of its staff and associated personnel.  The EU is intent on launching this operation as a matter of urgency.  The intention has been to have an initial operational capability on the ground in December with the operation fully functional by the end of March 2008.Force generation for the mission is ongoing.  While troop contributions are broadly in line with the requirements identified by the operation commander, there are still gaps in the force structure, particularly in vital enabling elements, such as helicopters and tactical aircraft, and medical support associated with the launch of this operation.  These shortfalls are being actively examined and addressed by EU military staff in consultation with the operation commander.  At a recent Defence Ministers' meeting in Brussels, I expressed my concerns about these and urged my EU ministerial colleagues to take another look at the shortfalls and to actively support the mission, ensuring that it is adequately resourced and capable of fulfilling its mandate.  I can assure the Members of the House that there is no question of the Defence Forces deploying in-theatre without the required enablers being in place.Ireland's participation in EU-led peace support operations is entirely consistent with our foreign policy commitment to collective security which recognises the primary role of the UN Security Council in the maintenance of international peace and security and our tradition of support for the United Nations.  Ireland is a strong supporter of a substantive involvement by the EU in crisis management missions within the framework of ESDP and under a UN mandate.Against this background, and having regard to the contribution which the mission can make to peace and security in the region and the creation of a safe and secure area for refugees, the Government is fully supportive of the participation of the Defence Forces in a substantive manner in the EU mission to Chad and the Central African Republic.  The enhanced capability being developed, arising from our participation in operations, such as the proposed EU mission, will serve to maintain and further develop Ireland's effective involvement in peace support operations in support of the UN.In the past, the European Union has engaged in two military operations outside Europe where the EU provided a force under a UN Security Council resolution.  The EU's first such operation was Operation Artemis to the Democratic Republic of Congo, which ended in September 2003 and to which Ireland contributed five Defence Forces personnel.  In 2006, Ireland also contributed seven Defence Forces personnel to the EU military operation in support of the United Nations Organisation Mission in the Democratic Republic of Congo, MONUC, during the election process, which took place in 2006.Ireland from the outset has been positively disposed towards the proposed mission and has supported a positive response from the EU to the UN request for assistance in this mission.  In its decisions of 2 October and 23 October 2007, the Government decided to deploy the then deputy chief of staff of operations, Major General Pat Nash, as operation commander of the EU force, together with up to 11 additional personnel, to the headquarters of the operation.  Dáil Éireann approved the deployment of Major General Nash and his personal support staff on 9 October 2007.  The post of operation commander is the highest profile post Ireland will have undertaken in an EU operation to date.  In agreeing his deployment, it was always understood that there would be a substantive and significant Defence Forces contribution to the mission.  Further personnel will also be deployed to the headquarters during the mission build-up period and for the duration of the mission.The likely location for the deployment of the Irish contingent will be eastern Chad.  The role of the contingent will be to contribute to establishing a safe and secure environment in order to contribute to protection of civilians in danger, facilitating the delivery of humanitarian aid, the free movement of humanitarian personnel, the protection of UN and associated personnel and encouraging the return of internally displaced persons.The Irish contingent will be based on a mechanised infantry battalion group comprising manoeuvre elements and combat support and combat service support elements.  The contingent will amount to approximately 400 personnel.  Owing to the nature of the operation, and the mission area and environment, force protection will be a key consideration.  The Defence Forces will deploy MOWAG APCs and close reconnaissance vehicles, which will provide armoured protection, mobility, firepower and a communications platform.  Discussions are ongoing with other member states with a view to possible collaboration with their forces in the area of operations.  The final configuration of Ireland's contingent contribution to the mission is being further worked out in consultation with the EU military staff and the operation commander.The Defence Forces initial entry force will comprise an advance party of approximately 50 personnel of the Army Ranger Wing and support elements, which will act as reconnaissance and also force protection for engineers in the selection and establishment of the Irish camp.If this motion is approved, these personnel will be deployed next month for approximately four months.  The main contingent, which is undergoing selection and concentration prior to detailed mission specific training, will probably deploy in January or February of next year.  Further staff will be deployed to the operational headquarters in France and the force headquarters, which will initially be located in France before it is deployed to Chad.  The Army Ranger Wing and the main Defence Forces contingent will overlap for a while.  Therefore, Ireland's total commitment to the mission will amount to 450 personnel during that time.A Defence Forces fact-finding team participated in an EU reconnaissance mission in October of this year.  The mission included visits to the region and to the operation's designated operational headquarters in Paris.  Intelligence staff of the Defence Forces then made a reconnaissance visit to the proposed area of operations to conduct a detailed threat assessment.  The chief of staff of the Defence Forces has advised that the threat level in the area of operations is assessed as "medium risk".  Rebel and bandit groups using 4 x 4 pick-up vehicles, and using hit and run tactics, constitute the main threat EUFOR may have to face.  Such groups operate opportunistically — they concentrate and dissipate quickly when engaging weaker targets including aid workers, the local population and weaker military elements.  The groups in question, which do not have the potential for any prolonged engagement, operate mainly along the border between Chad and Sudan.  French forces based in Chad have indicated that they have had no engagement with any of these groups to date, possibly because the groups do not have the potential to engage well trained and equipped military elements.  The military authorities assure me that while the level of risk is consistent with any operational deployment into an African conflict zone, the Defence Forces have the capability to manage it.This will be the most expensive operation on which the Defence Forces have been deployed.  All costs of EU operations relating to the deployment, operation and sustainment of contingents are met directly by the relevant troop-contributing nation.  When Ireland is involved in United Nations "blue hat" operations, the UN meets the substantial costs of deployment, repatriation, rotation, sustainment, accommodation, food and water supply and resupply, etc.  The UN also looks after the strategic and in-theatre tactical lift of the contingent.  However, the EU does not reimburse Ireland for such costs.  The only costs met by contributions from EU member states are the costs of establishing and operating headquarters facilities.  Such costs have been assessed at approximately €95 million, to which Ireland will contribute, or has contributed, €1.3 million pursuant to a European Council decision of 17 June 2002.  It is estimated that the cost to the Defence Vote arising from the 12-month participation of the Defence Forces in this mission, including the contribution to common costs, will be approximately €57 million.  Provision for meeting the additional costs of the operation will be made in the Defence Vote in the 2008 Estimates.Ireland's contribution to this EU operation is commensurate with its long-standing support for and participation in peacekeeping, particularly in Africa, and its standing in the European Union.  Our involvement in the mission represents a clear manifestation of the importance the Government attaches to the development of EU capabilities in crisis management and peacekeeping in support of the UN.  Ireland is determined to play a meaningful and constructive role in this mission, as the expected second largest contributor, and the provider of the operation commander.  In contributing to the mission in Chad and the Central African Republic, Ireland has the opportunity to contribute substantively to bringing stability to a key area of Africa.  Our participation in this mission will help to create the security conditions conducive to a voluntary, secure and sustainable return of refugees and displaced persons to their homes.  I commend the motion to the House.

The Minister will accept that this could be the most challenging and dangerous mission in which Ireland has been involved since the Congo deployment.  It is important for us to give every possible support to the approximately 400 troops who are to be sent to Chad.  I was somewhat concerned to hear the Minister say the UN will meet the cost of the supply and resupply of food and water, and the cost of accommodation.  I ask him to clarify that remark.

#JimmyDeenihan	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-party	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-dob	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-28 00:00:00	Prelude	262	I am glad the Minister has clarified the matter.  The most important thing about this mission is the provision of resources for our troops.  It is one thing to send soldiers to Africa, but it is another to support them while they are there.  Various doubts have been expressed about our capacity to provide that support.  I raised these issues when I asked a question in the House about Ireland's air transport capability.  Major concerns continue to be expressed about our capability in this regard.  I accept that many of these matters may have been resolved.  However, I understand that at least 20 helicopters will be needed, whereas just three helicopters are being provided as things stand.Most Members received a communiqué yesterday from the Irish section of Amnesty International pointing out our lack of air transport equipment.  The e-mail sent to me argued that there is an urgent need to commit adequate resources to the air transport sector.  It states:Lack of air transport support is a crucial issue that could delay the force and delay effective protection of civilians in the region.  There is a real danger that the force's deployment will now be significantly delayed due to under-funding and a lack of adequate air transport, such as helicopters.  Effective implementation of the mandate can also be undermined if insufficient resources are authorised.  The resources authorised for this UN operation should correlate to the mandate that it is expected to perform to avoid situations where a mandate to protect civilians is not matched by the capacities of deployed forces.  In addition, given that the local gendarmerie in eastern Chad is poorly equipped, adequate material assistance is needed to ensure reasonable conditions of service.  Otherwise, their capacity to operate and act in accordance with international standards and principles can be significantly undermined.Many people seem to suggest that insufficient resources are being provided.  Our mission in this region, which is 2,000 km inland, will not be the same as our mission in Liberia, which proved to be quite successful.  The Irish contingent returned from Liberia relatively unscathed in the sense that there were very few problems.  This will be entirely different, however.In addition to the air transport difficulties I have highlighted, which will have an impact on the delivery of supplies, the issue of water will be very important.  I read last week about the visit to Chad of the Minister for Foreign Affairs.  He mentioned that the temperature in that country was 45° Celsius.  That will present a major challenge to Ireland's 400 troops, who will never have worked in such conditions.  The availability of a quality water supply will be important.  People who served in Liberia told me that the water supply there, which was made available through the UN, was not of the quality that might be expected by armies in this day and age.  They used to borrow water from the Swedish troops, who had their own supply of much higher quality water.  The availability of decent water could be a matter of life and death in a mission of this nature.  It is obvious that water will have to be supplied in large volumes.  This issue will have to be addressed before our troops leave this country.I would like to speak about the medical back-up personnel available to Irish soldiers.  The Army does not have numbers required by the White Paper or mentioned in the previous PriceWaterhouseCoopers report, which proposed the retention of 47 medical staff.  Currently, the Army has 27 medical personnel, some of whom are non-nationals.  It is important that the medical personnel accompanying our mission should be Irish because they must look after not only the physical well-being of the troops, but also their emotional and psychological well-being.  This also raises the issue of communication and, where possible, Irish doctors should accompany them.  The primary hospital of the mission will be based on mainland Europe but it is important that the other medical supports be provided  in situ and that will create a number of complications.Amnesty International has highlighted the treatment of women, especially in the internally displaced persons area, and that will demand particular attention on the part of the mission.  Our troops will be aware of this issue since the war broke out.The French will make up half the force but their involvement raises a number of issues.  France is a former colonial power in Chad and it has been a strong supporter of the current regime, led by President Déby, who is a former French-trained helicopter pilot.  He staged a coup in Chad and the French have been accused of launching attacks on the militia to defend the Déby regime.  As a  result of this significant involvement, the mission could be targeted by four or five different militia or rebel groups and our troops could become embroiled in that scenario.  The mission is, therefore, fraught with risks and potential dangers.The key issue is whether the EU force will be used to support the Déby regime in the event of attacks by rebels.  Will Irish and other EU troops become involved in the political instability in Chad as opposed to protecting the victims of the instability?  The Minister will have to clarify the precise role of the mission before the troops are deployed in the country.Deputy Kenny met people from Egypt yesterday who advised him of the likelihood of a major civil war in the Sudan shortly.  That will result in more refugees crossing the border into Chad into the refugee camps, thereby putting more pressure on the EU mission to protect them.  The region will also become more volatile because different rebel forces will be involved and the Janjaweed, the principal rebel force, which is very active, well organised and reasonably well equipped, will present a threat to the mission.  That must also be taken into consideration before the Minister makes the final decision.A number of rangers will be deployed shortly to set up camp and so on but I disagree with the Taoiseach who gave the impression there would be no threat to them.  Even though they are highly trained, efficient soldiers, they will be under threat.  Will the Minister come back to the House before he makes the final decision on sending the main force or are we giving him approval to deploy 400 troops to Chad at the conclusion of the debate?  Next March or April he will know more about the warring conditions in the country.  Will he come back to the House to make sure we are happy the safety of our 400 troops is assured, every support and service is available to them and the logistics on the ground are appropriate to protect them so that they can pursue their peacekeeping mission?
#JimOKeeffe	unknown-#JimOKeeffe-party	unknown-#JimOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#JimOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-28 00:00:00	Prelude	263	On the one hand, I feel a great sense of pride at the nobility of the actions of the State in sending troops into an area that needs protection but, on the other, those of us who know a little about the area feel a great sense of apprehension regarding the safety and security of our troops.  I should declare an interest, as a member of my family has lived on the other side of the Chad border with personnel from Concern and the UN agency based in Al Fashir, western Darfur.  I receive e-mails regularly regarding the situation there, which causes me to believe our troops are being sent into bandit country and the government, particularly in Sudan, is utterly sinister, corrupt and unreliable.  It is one of the worst governments in the world, as it arms various militia and breakaway groups, which has created an insecure environment.I have the greatest respect for the Minister who has examined this proposal in detail but he referred to the report of the chief of staff in his contribution who described the mission as a "medium risk".  What is a "medium risk"?  Like Deputy Deenihan, I would like an absolute assurance that risks will be minimised.  The logistics are outrageously difficult with problems relating to air strips, helipads and other equipment.  While soldiers are trained to look after themselves and I have the greatest respect for their training, I would like to ensure this "medium risk" will be minimised and reduced.  The troops are capable of doing a very good in Chad but let us ensure they do it in conditions of the greatest security and safety.  If our troops are sent, I wish them the best of luck.  I will be proud of their work.
#BrianOShea	unknown-#BrianOShea-party	unknown-#BrianOShea-dob	unknown-#BrianOShea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-28 00:00:00	Prelude	264	Tá áthas orm seans a fháil labhairt sa díospóireacht ar an rún an-tábhachtach seo.  Beidh Páirtí an Lucht Oibre ag tabhairt tacaíocha don rún, cé go bhfuil nithe áirithe ag cur imní orainn, mar shampla an tacaíocht atá ag teastáil ó thaobh fearais, cúrsaí leighis agus córais taistil.  Má bhíonn an tacaíocht is caoi ar fáil, creidim go n-éireoidh go maith le saighdiúrí na hÉireann a bheidh páirteach i MINURCAT.  Beidh na daoine atá faoi bhrú uafásach i Sead faoi láthair go mór níos fearr as.  Beidh mé ag iarraidh ar an Aire a dheimhniú go mbeidh an tacaíocht sin ar fáil.The Labour Party will support the motion moved by the Minister for Defence against the background of the deepening humanitarian crisis in Darfur and eastern Chad.  Approximately a quarter of a million lives have been lost in the conflict in Darfur while more than 2 million people have been displaced.  The Labour Party supports the deployment of 400 Irish UN-sanctioned troops to eastern Chad but has concerns regarding the resourcing of the mission, as well as the safety and welfare of our troops.Following his four-day visit to Chad and the Sudan earlier this month, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Dermot Ahern, stated that the environment in which the Irish troops will be located is one of the harshest in the world.  He described the terrain as stark and noted that temperatures can reach up to 45° Celsius.  The Minister for Foreign Affairs also noted there were no roads to speak of and that travel over land can be very time consuming and, in some instances, dangerous.  The Minister pointed out that for the mission to be a success, it must get the full support of member states.  This involves ensuring the troops will be provided with the requisite medical supplies, hardware and, in particular, helicopters to get around.  According to the Minister, only three helicopters were deployed at the time of his visit, while the French peacekeepers there have insisted that 20 are needed to support the troops in the region.  What has been the response to the plea to European governments by the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Dermot Ahern, to supply much-needed transport for the thousands of troops on this humanitarian mission to central Africa?  I note the Minister for Defence has also made similar pleas.The unfolding humanitarian crisis in the region in recent years is not due solely to an overspill of the conflict from the Darfur region of Sudan as local tribal and ethnic tensions are also a factor.  The situation is further compounded by the actions of militias and bandit groups.  The Irish deployment of 400 troops will form the second largest component of the 4,300 troops which will make up the UN-mandated EU force.  France is to contribute more than half the force, which will facilitate humanitarian access, as well as protecting refugees from Darfur and displaced Chadians who populate the camps in eastern Chad.  This extraordinarily difficult and demanding mission is not without its dangers and is the most challenging to date.Today, Members will complete the triple lock mechanism, following the mission's approval by the Government and that of the UN last September.  All Members are proud of our troops and have full confidence that they will make a major contribution in this most difficult situation.  It is a matter of particular pride that on Tuesday, 9 October 2007, this House unanimously approved the despatch of Lieutenant General Pat Nash to the position of operations commander for the proposed EU military operation in the Republic of Chad and the Central African Republic.  The challenge posed by this mission is illustrated by considering that Chad, which is the main area of operation, is the same size as France, while the total area involved is the same as France, Germany and Spain combined.  Moreover, Chad is landlocked and is approximately 2,000 km from the nearest port.I understand the Chief of Staff of the Defence Forces has described the threat level related to this mission as one of medium risk.  One issue to arise concerns the potential for our troops to be drawn into the government-rebel conflict there.  There is also the matter of the increasing level of banditry on vulnerable targets, while the risk from breakaway rebel factions seeking arms, ammunition and vehicles is on the increase.  Reportedly, the Irish Army mission, which is to be the most expensive ever, will cost €57 million.  Only yesterday, there were reports of hundreds being killed in fighting in eastern Chad.  The Chadian army stated that several hundred rebels were killed in fighting on Monday last, while the rebels stated that 200 soldiers and only 20 of their fighters were killed.  This incident may well constitute the heaviest fighting since last year.The Minister noted that following the passing of the motion in the House today, the initial entry force, which I understand will consist of up to 70 troops, will be deployed next month.  In addition to the ranger wing, it will include logistics and communications specialists who will join the UN forces already in eastern Chad.  This will facilitate the subsequent arrival of the remaining troops to be deployed.  Despite the signing of a peace deal last month between the Chadian Government and four rebel groups, clashes continue, not least last Monday's incident.  The existence of 180,000 displaced Chadians and 236,000 Sudanese refugees living in camps in eastern Chad, as well as the continuing fighting, gives an indication of the difficulties that face the mission.  The Minister has already outlined the horrific treatment of women in the camps and the huge problem associated with malnutrition.  Consequently, a range of skills will be required from our contingent in Chad.While one does not wish to reflect on former times when sad events have taken place, Members should recall the people who were lost in the Congo in the early 1960s.  Although Members hope and pray there will be no fatalities in the present mission, it is always a possibility.  This raises again the issue whether the medical and hardware backup will be available.  The question that probably will be of the greatest ultimate importance is whether the 20 helicopters required will be supplied, as opposed to the three that the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Dermot Ahern, indicated were available during his recent visit.  The Minister for Defence should outline to the House the progress that has been made in this regard in the interim.  I seek an undertaking from the Minister that he will hold firm until the appropriate and adequate backup is in place for our troops.The initial force, comprising 50 to 70 personnel, will deploy in December to get things ready for the main contingent to follow.  Can Members be certain that all necessary steps to ensure the safety of our troops in Chad from the perspective of health, safety and general security will be taken?  Can the Minister provide Members with more information regarding the problems with fighting in the region?  Has he had official confirmation or does he possess reliable figures regarding the incident that took place last Monday?  The figures involved are startling and it appears that just as our troops are about to be deployed, the worst incident since last year has just taken place.Previously, I have raised in the House the issue arising from the incident in which an attempt was made to take children from Chad. What is the up-to-date information in that regard?  It appears that these children were being taken abroad to be fostered and perhaps in some cases to be adopted, but in a significant number of cases the children involved had at least one parent.  The House should be informed of whether there is any danger of human trafficking, especially child trafficking, occurring in the area and to what extent this has been taken into consideration in the planning of the mission.None of us should underestimate this undertaking or the challenge it presents.  A number of international political issues are bound up in this matter.  The resourcefulness and skill of our troops and officers in eastern Chad will be called upon, especially in terms of diplomacy and on other levels.  I have no doubt our people will rise to the occasion.  We all expressed great confidence in Major General Pat Nash when we debated the authorisation of his appointment as operations commander for this mission.  We have the people to do this job, which very badly needs to be done.  It is obvious that the humanitarian crisis in Chad is worsening.  If our people do not have the tools to do the job in the most effective way, serious issues will arise when we will deploy people to take part fully in the mission.I am seeking information and guidance from the Minister.  It is quite probable that he has a great deal more information than he has already told us.  I am not aware of anything being flagged in terms of where the additional helicopters will come from.  I read a report which stated there are 400 km of road in the area to which the Army is going, which is pretty minimal when one considers the vast area with which the mission will be dealing.The Labour Party is proud that the Permanent Defence Force is to take part in this mission.  I believe it will make a contribution that will bring great credit to its members, the Defence Forces generally and to the country, but those involved must be given the tools to do the job and the wherewithal to protect themselves from the point of view of health and security.
#TomKitt	unknown-#TomKitt-party	unknown-#TomKitt-dob	unknown-#TomKitt-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-28 00:00:00	Prelude	265	I am pleased to have an opportunity to speak in this debate with my colleague the Minister for Defence, Deputy O'Dea, and other colleagues.  The Taoiseach already referred to this issue this morning.  It is obviously a matter of significant importance to Members of the House.My interest in this area dates in particular from my time as Minister of State with responsibility for overseas development aid.  In 2004, I visited Sudan and the refugee camps in El Fasher and Darfur.  I saw at first hand the suffering of the men, women and children in those camps.  I was accompanied by officials from the Department of Foreign Affairs and representatives of NGOs like Concern and GOAL.  We heard horrific stories of the suffering of the people there, especially women who were abused, attacked and raped if they left the camps.  They were extremely frightened.  On a broader level, it is a terrible reflection on the international community that this conflict has continued for so many years and has not been resolved.Returning to Deputy O'Shea's point, it is clear that the main reason we are sending troops to Chad, where these refugees are fleeing from Sudan, is for humanitarian purposes.  I am very proud of the fact that our Army personnel are going there.  I accept there are legitimate concerns about safety and these are being addressed.  My colleague, the Minister for Defence, Deputy O'Dea, has referred to them, as I will in my contribution.  I note what he and Lieutenant General Dermot Earley stated yesterday about safety.  Lieutenant General Earley stated the risk would be similar to that in Liberia.  The terrain in Chad is more vast and the climactic conditions will be more difficult there as the temperature is hotter.  Serious issues arose in terms of malaria in Liberia also.  The personnel travelling will be well resourced.As the Taoiseach stated this morning and as my colleague, the Minister, stated today, 50 members of the Army Ranger Wing will be going in advance next month.  From my experience of travelling to Liberia, it is clear they will be very well equipped.  I will try to deal with some of the issues raised by Deputy O'Shea and others in my brief contribution.I note that the office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, UNHCR, has identified deteriorating security as one of the major challenges it faces in addressing the humanitarian issues in Chad.  For that reason it is most appropriate that the Army, which has done tremendous work in other parts of the world, should go there, notwithstanding the very serious points that have been made on security.There are approximately 240,000 Sudanese refugees in eastern Chad and 180,000 internally displaced persons.  The country also hosts approximately 45,000 refugees from the Central African Republic.  The problem in Chad is inextricably linked with developments across the border in Sudan.  In recent years Ireland has played a significant part in helping to alleviate the humanitarian suffering in Chad, as we have also been doing in Sudan.  Since 2006 we have provided over €6 million in funding endeavours in Chad and a further €2 million was announced recently for humanitarian support by the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Dermot Ahern.  That money is going to the United Nations and NGOs, including Irish NGOs.  I see this involvement as complementing the tremendous reputation we have abroad on the humanitarian side.  I will try to deal with some of the issues raised by Deputy O'Shea, as will my colleague, the Minister, Deputy O'Dea, in concluding this debate.The basis of Ireland's participation in international peacekeeping is firmly grounded in the United Nations.  Ireland is, and always has been, a strong and committed supporter of co-operation and multilateral arrangements for collective security through the development of international organisations, particularly the United Nations.  In tandem with this, Ireland has recognised and defended the primary role of the Security Council in the maintenance of international peace and security, in accordance with the UN Charter.In recent years, the UN has recognised the advantages presented by the existence of regional organisations, such as the European Union, to which it can assign crisis management and peace support missions.  Today, the European Union has the capacity to mount major peacekeeping operations and, to date, a total of five military operations, both in and outside Europe, have been undertaken by the Union.  The comprehensive range of instruments available to the Union, including the capacity to deploy military forces, means that the Union now has the ability to play a major role in supporting international peace and security and in support of the United Nations.Co-operation between the European Union and the United Nations is being continuously developed to ensure a coherent and complementary response in peace support operations.  There is also increasing co-operation between the UN and the EU in the area of crisis management, with EU involvement in the areas of rule of law, incorporating courts and prisons, civil administration and civil protection, including response to natural disasters.The increasing necessity for post-conflict peace building has also called for the involvement of civilian police, typically including a training element, and the Garda has participated in a number of such operations and has built up a capacity in this field that is well recognised internationally.The touchstone for Ireland's participation in overseas missions continues to be the UN.  Decisions on Irish participation in ESDP missions are taken on a case-by-case basis and are subject to the "triple lock" process.  Irish participation in ESDP operations is fully in keeping with Ireland's commitment to the UN.  The Government is fully supportive of the participation of the Defence Forces in a substantive manner in the EUFOR mission.Turning to the current conflict and the proposed operation in Chad and the Central African Republic, the multiple conflicts in the border areas between Darfur, Chad and the Central African Republic constitute a threat to peace and security in the whole region.  In Chad, following an agreement between the Government of Chad and the peaceful political opposition in August 2007, a peace deal was signed between the government and four rebel groups in October 2007.  However, there continue to be major problems, with ongoing clashes between rebels and government forces.  Arising from these clashes, more than 180,000 people are displaced and 240,000 Sudanese refugees now live in camps in eastern Chad.In the case of the Central African Republic, the already fragile situation has been exacerbated by the activities of criminal gangs, the spillover of instability from Darfur and Chad and an armed rebellion in the north west and the north east.  Approximately 170,000 people have been forced to flee their homes since September 2005.  In addition, more than 43,000 refugees from the Central African Republic reside in Chad and 20,000 people are thought to have fled to Cameroon.  Malnutrition has reached alarming levels, particularly among children.  The very troublesome situation in the region, in Sudan, Darfur, Chad and the Central African Republic demands an immediate response from the international community.  The Defence Forces will play a crucial role in helping to provide a more secure environment for the camps.That innocent people, already uprooted from their homes, terrorised, raped and murdered, continue to be at risk in camps for refugees and internally displaced persons cannot be tolerated.  The authorities of Chad and the Central African Republic have welcomed a possible EU military presence in their respective countries.  On 25 September 2007, the UN Security Council unanimously adopted Resolution 1778 establishing a multidimensional UN mission in Chad and the Central African Republic that will help strengthen security in the region.  The multidimensional presence will comprise, first, a United Nations mission in Chad and in the Central African Republic, to be known as MINURCAT, focusing on the security and protection of civilians — particularly refugees, internally displaced persons or IDPs and civilians in danger — and on human rights and the rule of law in eastern Chad and north-eastern CAR and, second, troops deployed by the European Union with a robust authorisation to protect and support it.  In its decision of 15 October 2007, the Council of the European Union agreed a joint action to launch the ESDP mission in support of the UN operation in Chad and in the Central African Republic.UN Security Council Resolution 1778 authorises the European Union, acting under Chapter VII of the UN Charter, to deploy for a period of one year from the date that its initial operating capability is declared by the European Union in consultation with the Secretary General.  The EU forces will be deployed to eastern Chad and the north-eastern Central African Republic.  The EU forces are authorised to support the UN and to take all necessary measures within its capabilities and its area of operation to contribute to protecting civilians in danger, particularly refugees and displaced persons; to improve security in the area of operations to facilitate the delivery of humanitarian aid and the free movement of humanitarian personnel; and to contribute to protecting United Nations and associated personnel, facilities, installations and equipment.The EU is planning to launch this operation as a matter of urgency. The intention is to have an initial operational capability on the ground in December with the operation fully functional by the end of March 2008.  The Minister for Defence has called on his European ministerial colleagues to step up to the plate and provide the required assets to allow this important mission to proceed speedily.  Ireland from the outset has been positively disposed towards the proposed mission.  In its decisions of 2 October and 23 October 2007, the Government decided to deploy the then Deputy Chief of Staff, Major General Pat Nash, as operation commander of the EU force, together with up to 11 additional personnel, to the headquarters of the operation.  Dáil Éireann approved his deployment and that of his personal support staff on 9 October 2007.  The role of the operation commander is to manage the overall military operation and to provide the military interface between the military operation and MINURCAT, the EU and the UN.The likely location for the deployment of the substantive Irish contingent will be in eastern Chad.  The Irish contingent will be based on a mechanised infantry battalion group comprising manoeuvre elements and combat support and combat service support elements.  The contingent will comprise some 400 personnel.  Due to the nature of the operation and the mission area and environment, force protection will be a key consideration.  The final configuration of Ireland's contingent contribution to the mission is being further worked out in consultation with the EU military staff and the operation commander.The Defence Forces initial entry force will comprise an advance party of approximately 50 personnel of the Army Ranger Wing and support elements.  The main contingent, which is currently undergoing selection and concentration prior to detailed mission specific training, will likely deploy in February or March 2008.  A full assessment of the Chad-CAR operation was undertaken, including a comprehensive and detailed reconnaissance of the area of operations by an experienced Defence Forces team, before the final decision was made.  The Chief of Staff of the Defence Forces has advised that the threat level in the area of operations is assessed as medium risk.Rebel bandit groups using 4 x 4 pick-up vehicles and hit and run tactics constitute the main threat EUFOR may have to face.  These groups operate opportunistically, concentrating and dissipating quickly, and engage weaker targets, including aid workers, the local population and weaker military elements, but without the potential for any prolonged engagement.  These groups operate mainly along the border between Chad and Sudan.  French forces based in Chad have indicated that to date they have had no engagement with any of these groups, possibly due to the fact that the groups do not have the potential to engage well trained and equipped military elements.The Defence Forces have a strong tradition of participation in missions of this nature and Ireland has a particular commitment to Africa, evidenced by, among other things, our bilateral aid programme.  Having regard to the importance of this mission for peace and stability in the region and Ireland's abiding interest in Africa and its development, the Government is satisfied that we should participate in the mission.  Ireland is determined to play a meaningful and constructive role, as the expected second largest contributor and the provider of the operation commander.  As I stated earlier, the launch of the operation depends on the response of the European Union.  In this regard, it is vital that those member states who have access to medical and air assets come forward in support of the mission.  Planning is continuing in earnest and I look forward to a successful launch of the mission in December.  The House will join with me in wishing our troops a successful and safe mission.
#LucindaCreighton	unknown-#LucindaCreighton-party	unknown-#LucindaCreighton-dob	unknown-#LucindaCreighton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-28 00:00:00	Prelude	266	I thank the Minister for his educational lesson on how ESDP and the triple lock operate.  It was most enlightening for Members on this side of the House.  I have mixed views on this mission.  I understand the logic behind Resolution 1778 and the desire of the Government to participate, given the situation in eastern Chad.  A total of 230,000 refugees from Darfur are currently living in camps run by the United Nations and at least 180,000 Chadians have been left homeless as a result of attacks by armed groups and militia.However, this situation arose as a result of the abdication of responsibility by the international community for the situation in Darfur.  The Irish Government and the European Union cannot be held responsible for it but they have all had a part to play in it.  The United Nations failed to broker a meaningful peace deal in Darfur and stood idly by as it witnessed genocide.  The Minister referred to the genocide when he visited the area.  In addition, there was mass rape and the absolute subjugation of human rights in Darfur.  This led to the outbreak of further violence in Chad and the CAR.  It is a highly unsatisfactory situation.There is a huge need to protect the people who have been displaced and forced to live in horrendous circumstances in refugee camps in eastern Chad.  The Minister is misleading us somewhat by saying that the Irish Defence Forces have a tradition of participating in missions of this nature.  I do not accept this is the case.  This is by far the most dangerous mission in which our Defence Forces have participated, particularly under the ESDP.  The scale of the mission and the potential danger to our troops are significant and we must weigh up the pros and cons of participation.  The potential impact that the troops will have by attempting to provide peace and stability must be contrasted with the risks and dangers to the Irish men and women who will serve there.We are talking about sending an Irish force of 400 troops, the second largest in the entire deployment.  In one sense this is very brave, but it must also be regarded as somewhat foolish.  No troops have been committed by larger countries such as Germany or Italy.  This must cause us to ask ourselves why Ireland, a small island state, must provide such a large number of troops to this mission.  The region has been under siege in recent weeks and violence flared up in recent days in the area in which the Irish troops are to be based.  That in itself is a cause for serious concern.Let us consider the logistics of this mission.  Irish troops are to be sent to an area that is entirely landlocked and 2,000 km inland.  Based on the history of such missions, there is likely to be a considerable strain on the supply of necessary provisions, particularly water, food and medical supplies.  I have major concerns about that aspect.  I do not want our troops facing similar conditions to those experienced by troops in German East Africa during the First World War, when a lack of water, food and medical supplies resulted in the loss of thousands of lives.  I hope we are not entering that type of situation.  Deputy Deenihan mentioned this also in his remarks.  The area of Chad is vast — more than three times the size of California — and there is a history of despotism and rebel groups and much danger involved.  I have already mentioned the harsh conditions that will be faced.  We are talking about temperatures of over 45° Celsius.  Obviously, dehydration and the potential risks associated with that are of major concern.The critical aspect of this mission, which is also my main concern, is the issue of aircraft.  The Minister has entirely failed to deal with this point.  It is acknowledged that in order to make the mission sustainable there is a requirement for approximately 20 helicopters and other aircraft.  We have had no commitment on this from either the European Union or the Government.  I am very concerned about it.  Perhaps the Minister can emphasise to our European partners at ministerial level the need to provide assistance in that regard.  I do not believe the Government should be providing these, given that we are already sending 400 troops.  I hope the Minister will ensure that a guarantee will be given in this regard before we give this the go-ahead.  I am concerned about us sending 400 troops to a landlocked area with a back-up of three helicopters, which will make it extremely difficult to provide the necessary supplies.As we are aware, the infrastructure in Chad is very poor.  There are 20 airports in the country but only seven of these have tarmacked runways that would be suitable for landing aircraft, a critical aspect of this mission.  There is also a risk of disease.  African countries, particularly Chad, are major risk areas for malaria and other tropical diseases.  I want a guarantee from the Minister that adequate medical provisions will be made available and that doctors will be at hand with the necessary medical resources to deal with any problems that arise among our troops.The focus of this mission is concern about the refugee camps in Chad.  I would like to hear the Minister acknowledge that there are large numbers of displaced people who have not even made it into camps but are on the outskirts and have absolutely no protection.  I hope our troops will look after the needs of these people and provide adequate protection for them.  They are in a most vulnerable position, more vulnerable than that of the displaced people who are currently in refugee camps.  I hope this will be acknowledged by the Minister in the terms of the mission.We know the history of French colonialism in Chad.  I hope the presence of French troops will be counterbalanced by the other troops on the mission and that there will not be a negative backlash from locals.  The presence of French troops will be an advantage because they will know the area and the people involved, but there is the risk of a backlash.  There is also a major risk of civil war.  If this happens, I would like to know what the position of the Irish troops will be.  What will happen if local tribes react in a negative manner to the current leader who, as we are aware, rose to power through a coup d’état that was backed by France?  There is much tension about this aspect.  Where do the Irish troops stand?  Will we take one side or the other?  Will we be neutral and how will that work in practice?  Have these things been thought through?While I understand the motivation behind this mission, I do not accept that it is a mission like any other because it is not.  The conditions are harsher and more perilous, and the scale is far greater, than in any other mission undertaken by the Defence Forces.  I ask the Minister to respond to the issues that have been raised by me and my colleagues on the Opposition benches.
#MaryORourke	unknown-#MaryORourke-party	unknown-#MaryORourke-dob	unknown-#MaryORourke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-28 00:00:00	Prelude	267	I am proud to speak on this motion put forward by the Minister for Defence and, in so doing, to pick up on some of the points that have been made in the House during the debate.I come from an Army town, with the headquarters of the Western Command across the River Shannon.  The proposed mission is a Western Brigade mission.  It is important that we mark this fact.  Troops from Athlone, Galway, Longford, Mullingar and Donegal will be going, along with some troops from other areas.  It is essentially a Western Brigade mission.  In my town and county we are very proud of the men and women who have gone abroad on other missions.Although Deputy Creighton has left, I must point out that there is no such thing as a safe mission.  The idea that one mission is safer than another is ridiculous.  If one goes abroad to fight or, as we are doing, to keep the peace, one does not believe one is going on a sunshine holiday.  I was reminded sharply of what happened in the Congo during a graveyard commemoration last summer for some of the people who had been lost there.  We can only think back to that; it was surely the most perilous mission of all.  However, every command is perilous and nobody who goes on a mission thinks it is easier than Cyprus, the Lebanon or Liberia.The Army is not imbued with those kinds of spirits or feelings.  They are imbued with spirit for going where they are sent as part of their mission statement when they enlisted in the Army.  The troops and officers on this mission know that they are going on a perilous journey.  The journey will be simple enough, but the operations of the troops will be fraught with danger.  How could it not be so, working in an area of that size?  I was amazed that the area is the size of France, Spain and Germany combined.They are going to Chad under the triple-lock mechanism, an enormous safeguard for us under which the Europe Union, the United Nations and our Parliament give permission.  That is as it should be.  They are our troops who are fighting for our country and enlisted in our Army.Of course it is a humanitarian mission.  I was taken by the enormous perils which the people who have come into the camps are undergoing and I do not know how they are able to manage their daily lives.  I commend the fact that the Minister for Defence, Deputy O'Dea, the Minister of State at the Department of Defence, Deputy Tom Kitt, and the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Dermot Ahern, went separately to see what the terrain and the circumstances would be like and to know what we were taking on and going into.  Likewise, I commend the group of women headed by former President Mary Robinson who went there and reported on what the women told them.  The women have gone from one difficult situation to another extremely difficult one in camp there and the Army will be fully stretched in dealing with the aspect of their mission on this occasion.We all have approved of Lieutenant General Pat T. Nash and I wish him well as he sallies forth with his troops to do his duty.  For a country the size of Ireland with our troop capacity, which is not enormous, it is amazing — the Minister and I had a brief conversation about this previously — that we are able to go with such vigour and enthusiasm to such dangerous spots around the world to take charge of a mission to keep the peace, which is what it is all about, and to care for the dispossessed.There is sure and firm evidence of many other missions which established great friendships.  There are people still visiting Athlone as a result of friendships made in Cyprus, in the main, by our soldiers who went there on difficult missions.  I am sure the friendships will endure.I note that the advance force departs in December, but it will be January when the main mission departs.  Lest we think that they will have a less perilous time than the time before, it is not at all like that.  I deal in the main with many women and while I understand from the Minister that there will be women Army personnel taking part in this mission, in many instances it is the mothers, wives, sweethearts, sisters and daughters of the male personnel involved who will bear the burden of worry, who will scan the news for every word from eastern Chad and read the newspapers for everything they can glean from them about Chad, and who never thought that they would find themselves in these circumstances.Due to the work of Army personnel, we now are acquainted with places with which we never would have become acquainted previously.  Liberia and Chad are two of those exotic sounding places news of which we would not have bothered listening to, except that we now know that our troops are going there or have been there, and have acquitted themselves in such a fine fashion.I am not speaking in terms of fairy tales and Pollyanna.  I know what I am talking about as I was born, brought up and reared in the town of Athlone with many of the sons and daughters of those who have been abroad.  The town is proud of our forces.  We are proud of the Western Brigade.  We are very proud that Athlone is the headquarters of what was the Western Command, now the Western Brigade.People ask why Athlone was picked to be the Western Brigade headquarters.  That is the way history laid it out.  Custume Barracks is across the River Shannon.  The Minister, Deputy O'Dea, is an honoured guest whenever he comes to our town and we hope that prior to this deployment he will pay us a further visit, perhaps to say farewell to them.I am very much in favour of the motion.  I am conscious of the dangers our troops will face.  At the same time, I am proud of what Irish troops from a peace-living and peacekeeping country have done over the years in wishing to ensure that they can spread their peace and humanitarian message into the strife-torn country of eastern Chad.  I pay tribute to those who lost their lives over the years or were injured in various other missions in which the Irish forces were deployed.
#TerenceFlanagan	unknown-#TerenceFlanagan-party	unknown-#TerenceFlanagan-dob	unknown-#TerenceFlanagan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-28 00:00:00	Prelude	268	I welcome the opportunity to speak on this motion.  I thank the Minister, Deputy O'Dea, for his speech which provided us with the background to the mission to Chad.  However, will the Minister please assure the House that there will be adequate air support, including 20 helicopters which are needed on this deadly mission?The instability in the region has been evident again this week when heavy fighting broke out between rebels in the UFDR and Government forces in eastern Chad.  Only two days after rebels had declared an end to a month-long ceasefire that had been brokered by Libya, rebels accused the Chadian Government of launching an attack on them.  The fighting is in the area where EU forces are to be based, which is of major concern, which is only 25 miles from the border into the Darfur area of Sudan.Obviously, Chad has faced constant instability and coups since it achieved independence from France in 1960.  It has had a colourful history.  One president after another has been overthrown.  As previous speakers stated, it is the fifth largest state in Africa, at 1.284 million sq. km.  It is also land-locked, which no doubt provides many challenges to our Army.Chad is slightly more than three times the size of California and larger than any state in western Europe.  Some 47% of the population is below the age of 15 and the life expectancy is 47 years, which is not high.  Obviously, there is much poverty.  There are health issues.  Some of the social conditions are the worst in Africa.  This poses many challenges.Regarding the physical infrastructure, there are 55 airports, of which only seven have paved runways and 48 are unpaved.  This also will prove challenging for our airborne personnel.  In addition, only 267 km of the 33,000 km of roads are paved, which is seriously outrageous.Obviously, there are many diseases associated with Chad, including malaria, hepatitis A and typhoid fever.  Can the Minister assure the House that there will be adequate medical support?

#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-28 00:00:00	Prelude	270	In March, the European Council agreed that administrative burdens arising from EU legislation should be reduced by 25% by 2012.  Taking into account the different starting points and traditions, the Council invited member states to set their own national targets of comparable ambition within their spheres of competence by 2008.Prior to the Taoiseach's departure for the spring European Council meeting, the Government agreed that I should lead the cross-departmental and agency drive and put in place a mechanism to drive the agenda at national level.  As part of this effort, I established a high level group on business regulation earlier this year under the chairmanship of my Department's Secretary General.  The group comprises representatives of Departments, governmental agencies, the business sector and ICTU.  It has decided to focus initially on ways to reduce, simplify and eliminate unnecessary administrative burdens and associated costs in the five priority areas identified in the Business Regulation Forum's April report and to capture the savings arising from that work on a case-by-case basis.  The five priority areas identified by the BRF are taxation, statistical reporting, environmental regulations, health and safety regulations and company and employment law.  I expect the group to submit an initial report to me by July 2008.In submitting its report last April, the BRF did not recommend the introduction of the standard cost model as employed in the United Kingdom and the Netherlands, which pioneered this approach.  Instead, the BRF recommended:Given the resource implications associated with undertaking a full baseline measurement exercise, a prioritised and selective approach would be the most realistic way forward for Ireland.  In line with this recommendation, the high level group is pursuing a prioritised and selective approach.International evidence states that the World Bank's Doing Business 2008 report ranked Ireland eighth of 178 in terms of ease of starting and running a business.  Of our EU partners, only the UK and Denmark are ahead of us.  Recently, I took a number of initiatives to help to reduce the administrative burdens on business, including legislation introduced at the end of last year to raise the audit exemption thresholds applying to small companies in respect of turnover and balance sheet to €7.3 million and €3.6 million, respectively.  The previous thresholds were €1.5 million and €1.9 million.  This will remove the compulsory annual audit cost from the large number of companies qualifying for the enhanced exemption levels.In company law, we approved the general scheme of the companies consolidation reform Bill as prepared by the company law review group.  The Bill is being drafted and will consolidate the 13 Companies Acts into one.  In addition to a number of significant proposed reforms, the Bill will make it easier for firms and practitioners to understand and comply with the law relating to the incorporation and operation of companies in Ireland.

We estimate that business could be saved up to €1.25 billion in five years were the standard cost model adopted.Like many Ministers, the Minister has only half answered the question I asked.  I assume his answer in respect of using the standard cost model is no.  I did not ask whether it was recommended by the BRF, I want to know whether the Minister will use it.  Will he clarify that?I asked the Minister when he would set a national target, but he did not answer.  Is he not embarrassed by his failure to set a target?  I will provide a few examples.  Austria set a reduction target in April 2006, the Czech Republic set a three-year 20% target in July 2007, Italy——

#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-28 00:00:00	Prelude	281	Yes.  Due to the imposition in terms of staffing and costs, the route we are taking is more realistic and effective.  The EU invited member states to have targets by 2008 and we will have begun a realistic and informed process to that effect.  Anyone can set a target, but achieving the target is the key issue.

Research is ongoing in that respect.  Through simplifying the process by which companies recover redundancy payments, we have effected a saving of approximately €1.2 million to the companies concerned.  That is a global figure.Where there are clear and realistic examples of removing red tape from the system, I will follow them.  We are addressing five areas——

#BillyKelleher	unknown-#BillyKelleher-party	unknown-#BillyKelleher-dob	unknown-#BillyKelleher-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-28 00:00:00	Prelude	287	Ireland will continue to adopt a constructive approach to the European Union negotiations on the proposed EU directive on temporary agency work.  While I support the objective of providing for the equal treatment of agency workers, the proposal for consideration as currently drafted is imbalanced.  We have concerns about exemptions or derogations that would be to the benefit or advantage of some member states but not others.  Ireland has indicated with other member states that if permanent derogations through collective agreements are to be allowed, other means providing for derogations should also be allowed in those member states without such collective agreements.Ireland considers that the derogation from equal treatment provided for in Article 5.4 of the proposed directive in respect of short duration temporary agency assignments of a maximum of six weeks is too short.  This is particularly so in comparison to the derogation available to those member states with collective agreements that can and do deviate from equal treatment in pay levels and in the areas of wider working and employment conditions under the terms of Article 5.3.  In some cases, these derogations can be for six months or longer.A longer time period than currently on offer in respect of short duration assignments — a maximum of six weeks is being proposed under Article 5.4 — would represent a more balanced approach.  The short time period on offer could damage future job creation prospects and deter the use of temporary agency working, which would be to the detriment of our economy.  This is particularly the case because agency work can provide in certain circumstances a useful stepping stone for some persons to enter the labour market.  The opportunities available to agency workers should not be reduced as a result of any new arrangements.  Overall, the longer period being sought would provide the best balance between employment creation and flexibility on the one hand with employment protection and security on the other.Ireland will continue to adopt a constructive approach to these discussions.  In principle, we support the thrust of the directive, but we are still participants in a wider negotiation on the details.
#RuairiQuinn	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-party	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-dob	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-28 00:00:00	Prelude	288	I thank the Minister of State for his reply and I support his efforts to ensure we have one of the most flexible labour markets in the EU.  We have had it for many years, but it need not come at the cost of denying agency workers on sites or locations working alongside domestic workers the same rights as those on the shop floor.  This is the net point.  Some 27,000 people, 2% of the workforce, are agency workers and this number will increase.  As the economy takes a downturn, the likelihood is that employers in some sectors will, for competitive reasons, shift from the traditional form of employment to that of agency workers.  In the Minister of State's city and elsewhere, it will create racialist and nationalist tensions of a xenophobic nature between Irish workers displaced and replaced by agency workers.I am asking a simple question.  Why can the Minister of State not embrace the principle of the directive and support it in December when the Portuguese President tables it?  Why can the Minister of State not introduce legislation subsequently and enact it domestically in terms and conditions appropriate to the Irish labour market to avoid some of the fears he has expressed regarding how the directive has been framed?  We are facing a serious problem.  I do not understand why the Government cannot agree with SIPTU and the Labour Party's position on having no discrimination between workers in the workplace, irrespective of where they come from.
#BillyKelleher	unknown-#BillyKelleher-party	unknown-#BillyKelleher-dob	unknown-#BillyKelleher-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-28 00:00:00	Prelude	289	We support the thrust of the directive but the difficulty is that other member states have derogations and collective agreements.  That allows them to enact legislation which enshrines disparity between agency workers and others, putting Ireland at a competitive disadvantage to them.  We want to achieve a level playing pitch in our negotiations.  We do not want to undermine competitiveness but, equally, we accept agency workers must be protected.  It is unfair to claim Ireland is the only EU member state holding up this directive.  Discussions and negotiations are ongoing.  As Deputy Quinn was a Minister, he will be aware of how Council negotiations proceed.
#RuairiQuinn	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-party	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-dob	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-28 00:00:00	Prelude	290	It is precisely because I know how Council negotiations proceed that I have put this question.  For those coming to Ireland as agency workers, particularly in the skilled and semi-skilled areas, the type of competition in question is not necessarily across borders from the continent to the island.  Ireland is not suffering in attracting labour.Ireland will remain attractive to other workers outside the island of Ireland.  My concern is that we will institutionalise discrimination of indigenous workers.  They will be at risk if there is a downturn in the economy, as we know there will be, but it will not be as large as some fear.  The Minister of State knows what an employer would do if faced with the choice of cheap agency workers or letting Irish workers go to remain competitive, not in the continental market but in the Irish market.  Irish workers will be let go because they are dearer than agency workers.  This will be a problem for all of us, not just in the workplace.  Endorsing the directive is important.
#BillyKelleher	unknown-#BillyKelleher-party	unknown-#BillyKelleher-dob	unknown-#BillyKelleher-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-28 00:00:00	Prelude	291	I share the Deputy's concerns.  Agency workers being paid below the normal rate is a matter that is being examined in legislation.  The directive is in a different context as we would put ourselves at a competitive disadvantage if we sign up to it.  We are negotiating in that context.  In protecting employment regulation orders, EROs, and registered employment agreements, REAs, the Government will not allow agency workers to be paid less than agreed labour rates.  It can be dealt with through legislation.
#RuairiQuinn	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-party	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-dob	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-28 00:00:00	Prelude	292	We saw what happened in Irish Ferries.  The only way to deal with it is through immediate domestic legislation.  When will that legislation be introduced?

#MichaelAhern	unknown-#MichaelAhern-party	unknown-#MichaelAhern-dob	unknown-#MichaelAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-28 00:00:00	Prelude	294	The Government has set a goal for Ireland to become a leader in research and development and innovation.  It has committed a budget of €8.2 billion under the National Development Plan 2007-2013 and the Strategy for Science, Technology and Innovation 2006-2113 towards achieving this goal.One objective of the strategy is to increase participation in the sciences by young people and to bring about a significant increase in the number of people with advanced qualifications in science and engineering.  Chapter 5 of the strategy sets out the goals towards this end while chapter 8 outlines the implementation and co-ordination mechanisms intended to facilitate, drive and achieve those goals.The Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment has overall responsibility for overseeing and directing the full implementation of the strategy.  Governance structures have been established to ensure effective interaction, co-ordination and review of outputs across eight Departments, including the Department of Education and Science, the Office of the Chief Scientific Adviser, State agencies and higher education institutions, all of which are working together to implement the strategy.At the apex of this is a Cabinet committee on science, technology and innovation, chaired by the Taoiseach.  Its membership comprises the key stakeholder Ministers, including the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, the Minister for Education and Science and myself.  Its objective is to ensure the environment for science, technological development and innovation is conducive to maintaining Ireland's competitiveness and to further developing Ireland's position as a dynamic and knowledge-driven economy.The interdepartmental committee on science, technology and innovation, chaired by the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, reports to the Cabinet committee on progress being made in implementing the strategy.  Several subsidiary implementing bodies and dedicated working groups work under aegis of the committee.Implementation of the strategy will be monitored and reviewed by means of an annual report prepared by the interdepartmental committee for the Cabinet committee and drawing on all the programmatic and policy strands and the expertise available to it.  The first such report will be produced in spring 2008 and will be laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas.Additional information not given on the floor of the HouseAll of the above actions demonstrate the whole of Government nature of the strategy.  The Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment will continue to oversee and co-ordinate the work of the various groups and sub-groups to ensure the objectives of the SSTI are realised.On the promotion of science — public awareness in schools — we recognise the importance of science in primary and secondary schools as well as the need to promote interest in science across all elements of society.  The Department of Education and Science working with the Higher Education Authority has begun extensive syllabus redevelopment and continues to tackle curriculum reform, investing in professional awareness, guidance and technical assistance to support science in the educational system.  This is supplemented by the work of the Discover Science and Engineering Programme, the Government's integrated science awareness programme.
#DeirdreClune	unknown-#DeirdreClune-party	unknown-#DeirdreClune-dob	unknown-#DeirdreClune-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-28 00:00:00	Prelude	295	I accept the Minister's argument that for Ireland to become a knowledge-based economy and less dependent on manufacturing, we need to move up the value chain and increase the number of graduates available to work in these industries.My question was related to the fall-off in the uptake of science subjects at second level.  A recent competitiveness report stated that one weakness facing Ireland was the lack of uptake of science and mathematics at second level.  The number of students entering third level taking up ICT courses has dropped by 58% since 2000.  While the strategy for science, technology and innovation outlines improvements in the take-up of science subjects, no specific targets have been set.  How can the innovation policy be progressed without the pool of students to satisfy it?

#MichaelAhern	unknown-#MichaelAhern-party	unknown-#MichaelAhern-dob	unknown-#MichaelAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-28 00:00:00	Prelude	298	At second level, 90% of students study science at junior certificate level, for which a new syllabus was introduced in 2003.  Up to 60% of students study one of the three science subjects at leaving certificate level; 14.7% study physics and 13.5% study chemistry.The uptake in these subjects has been a concern for some time.  Numbers taking these subjects dramatically declined during the 1980s but there is evidence of a turnaround.  A critical concern is to increase the numbers studying these subjects at senior level.  The objective is to increase the percentage taking chemistry and physics at leaving certificate to 20% of the overall student cohort.  As part of this approach, concerted efforts will be made to encourage a better gender balance in the taking up of physics.The Discover Science and Engineering Programme, chaired by Leo Enright, has recently launched its annual roadshow.  The number of students at primary and second level attending this has increased significantly.  With the changes in the syllabus and the system and with the promotion of the Discover Science and Engineering Programme, the numbers will be brought back up.  There is evidence that this is happening.
#DeirdreClune	unknown-#DeirdreClune-party	unknown-#DeirdreClune-dob	unknown-#DeirdreClune-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-28 00:00:00	Prelude	299	I agree the Discover Science and Engineering Programme is excellent and I met Leo Enright recently in Cork.  However, science student numbers are down 4.5%, particularly in computer science.  We are not generating the interest or the pool of students to feed our third level courses.  The Minister for Education and Science changed the leaving certificate examination timetable this week but the science subjects did not feature.  Interest at second level must be generated to ensure students take up third level courses in the future.  The Minister of State also seems to have different figures from mine.
#MichaelAhern	unknown-#MichaelAhern-party	unknown-#MichaelAhern-dob	unknown-#MichaelAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-28 00:00:00	Prelude	300	I accept the Deputy's concerns.  The Government is concerned about the matter.  That is why changes to the curriculum were made and the publicity campaign launched by the Discover Science and Engineering Programme is being promoted.  The Government acknowledges that there is a need to reverse the trend that was evident in the 1980s.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-28 00:00:00	Prelude	301	The total number of people recorded on the live register for October is 157,449.  This is a significant decrease in the numbers recorded in the previous four months of 2007.  It also equals the average numbers recorded on the live register for the year in 2005 and 2006.  Employment has increased by 247,300 in a three year period since 2004 and the number in employment is 2,140,900.The live register is not designed to measure unemployment.  It includes part-time, seasonal and casual workers entitled to unemployment benefit.  Unemployment is measured by the quarterly national household survey, collated and published by the Central Statistics Office.  The most recent quarterly national household survey, quarter 3, 2007, indicates that employment has increased by 67,600 in the year.  The unemployment rate is 4.7%, down from 4.8% in the same period last year.The predictions for the medium term are for continued employment growth, albeit at a slower pace than that experienced to date.  Ireland's overall employment rate is 69.9%, which compares favourably to the EU rate of 64.4%.  The range of services provided by FÁS will be available to anyone who becomes unemployed.  This will include active engagement with persons on the live register to help them obtain jobs either directly or through further training, education or work experience and access to the various training and employment programmes provided by FÁS.FÁS also emphasises the training of low-skilled workers in vulnerable industries to ensure that, in the event of becoming unemployed, they will have the skills necessary to make the transition to other employment.  The development agencies, the IDA, Enterprise Ireland and the county enterprise boards will continue to promote job creation through the delivery of programmes to help the enterprise sector develop, thereby creating new jobs.Over the period of the National Development Plan 2007-13, the NDP, the Government will invest €7.7 billion in public funds to support training and skills development.  This is a significant increase on the level of spending at €5.9 billion over the previous seven year period.  The level of investment reflects the importance the Government attaches to maintaining an educated, skilled and adaptable workforce in Ireland.Additional information not given on the floor of the House.The NDP will focus on upskilling the workforce and the activation and participation of groups outside it.  Upskilling the workforce will include measures to improve training for people in employment, help upskill those affected or likely to be affected by industrial re-structuring, improve and enlarge the apprenticeship system and provide progression opportunities for school leavers.  A total of €2.8 billion has been provided to support these measures over the lifetime of the NDP.  Activation and participation of groups outside the workforce will include measures to provide targeted training and services to the unemployed, people with disabilities, lone parents, Travellers and prisoners, as well as encouraging the increased participation of women, older workers, part-time workers and migrants in the workforce.  A total of €4.9 billion has been provided to support these measures over the lifetime of the NDP.  FÁS and Skillnets will provide most of this training and €1,076.5 million has been provided for these activities in the pre-budget Estimates for 2008.

#RuairiQuinn	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-party	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-dob	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-28 00:00:00	Prelude	304	Getting value for it is another matter.  I accept that we have a vibrant economy to which many in our society have contributed, not least the Minister.  I would like him to focus, however, on the extra 8,000 people who are unemployed since this time last year.  Do we know who they are?  Do they feel displaced by the vibrancy of the labour market and the economy?  Do they feel they have a chance to get back into the workforce with the requisite skills to compete against a cohort of European citizens who have the same right to come to this country as we had in our darker days to go elsewhere?  If we do not reach out and address them, and if the Minister does not use the resources under his Department's remit to do so, we will lay the foundations for the kind of right wing racist backlash that has occurred in every other medium sized European country whose economy has slowed down, as it is in the nature of a cyclical market economy to do.What mechanism does FÁS have to track and identify the extra 8,000 people who have become unemployed and ask them what they need in order to get back into work?  The macroeconomic performance of this economy is good but there is a danger inherent in the fallout.  What steps is the Minister taking to identify the extra 8,000, bringing the total unemployed to 164,000, who have fallen out of this economy, notwithstanding its growth, and bring them back onto the pitch?
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-28 00:00:00	Prelude	305	I have given the statistics to show that the rate has fallen since this time last year.  The key point is that FÁS undertakes activation measures.  After three months, FÁS and the Department of Social and Family Affairs meet everybody who is on the register and offer them a variety of programmes for reorientation, training or opportunities.  The macro and microeconomies are not separate.  The long-term unemployment rate, people on the register for longer than 12 months, is approximately 1.3%.

#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-28 00:00:00	Prelude	307	The Deputy mentioned people who feel displaced and one begins to feel displaced and alienated from the labour force if one is out of employment for longer than 12 months.  That remains a key sector for activation.Our Department works with FÁS in an interdepartmental group with the Department of Social and Family Affairs to activate a significant cohort of the live register who are not designated unemployed but who are on welfare because there are barriers to their re-entry to the workforce.  These may be people with disabilities or lone parents.  We have to change mind sets to endeavour to reach out to that 4% who need access to the labour market.  We are satisfied that the rate is at 1.3%.
#RuairiQuinn	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-party	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-dob	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-28 00:00:00	Prelude	308	Deputy Penrose and I would be happy to return to discuss that issue with the Minister.  Today, however, I am talking about the 490 workers in Waterford Glass who traditionally had secure and well-paid employment but whose jobs are disappearing, the workers in C&C in Tipperary and the 51 threatened redundancies in Aer Lingus.  These people have commitments, such as families, and expectations.  Three months is too long to wait to help these people — FÁS and the Department should be at the door to help them into new jobs as soon as the redundancies are made known.  I have met these people, as the Minister has in his official capacity.  They feel displaced and that is the first step to a sense of alienation and everything that flows from that.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-28 00:00:00	Prelude	309	The Deputy should inform himself better because we are at the coalface when people are made redundant.  FÁS goes straight in.

When Waterford Glass closed in Dungarvan and over 200 workers were made redundant, we were in there immediately with the IDA, Enterprise Ireland and FÁS.  Only approximately 20 are still out of work.  A couple of hundred jobs were lost in Motorola and the three agencies went in as quickly as they could, past management and the company structures, to help the people start their own businesses and ensure that they could avail of FÁS training programmes.  The IDA tried to assess their skill sets to match companies that might come in.  IBM came in and bought an indigenous company, Vallent and employed approximately 150 people in the software development area.  The programme is activated quickly in response to redundancies.

Fifty one inspectors hold appointments with the National Employment Rights Authority, NERA.  The Public Appointments Service's recruitment and selection process for ten inspectors with specific language skills has been completed while my Department's competitions for the remaining inspector positions were completed yesterday, 27 November.  By the end of the year we will have the 90 labour inspectors as committed under Towards 2016.  It is a good news story all round.

There is a shift from employing Irish to non-national workers, some of whom receive lesser terms and conditions than Irish employees.  There is a perception that no Irish need apply to some companies, which causes two problems.  Coming back to the point made by Deputy Quinn earlier, this is causing resentment and is putting responsible companies out of business.  Fines imposed by the labour inspectorate are increasing annually but do inspectors target specific sectors in the economy to ensure this abuse is eradicated?
#BillyKelleher	unknown-#BillyKelleher-party	unknown-#BillyKelleher-dob	unknown-#BillyKelleher-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-28 00:00:00	Prelude	316	The role of the National Employment Rights Authority, NERA, is to ensure employment legislation is complied with and its purpose is to educate and inform to ensure companies are aware of their obligations and employees are aware of their entitlements.  In this context there is a strong emphasis on information and education with programmes being rolled out in various sectors of the economy.  Labour inspectors will be targeting specific areas and will soon launch a programme, under the Protection of Young Persons (Employment) Act 1996, to ensure young people are not exploited in the approach to Christmas.There will be 90 inspectors by the end of the year and great interest was shown by people with language skills.  This is a welcome development due to the diverse nature of today's economy and the potential exploitation that immigrants face, which we must ensure is not allowed to permeate the economy.  Language inspectors will be engaging in discussions and the unions played an important role in this area; I recently met representatives of the Services, Industrial, Professional and Technical Union, SIPTU, regarding how it will inform its members of the role of NERA.  It is a proactive organisation and we will have 90 inspectors by the end of the year who will educate, inform and enforce.

This was a complex matter because it was necessary to ensure candidates had language skills and the selection process was detailed.  It attracted huge interest.

It is a complex area because they must be aware of compliance and employment rights legislation and when they are trained they will get their labour inspector warrants.

#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-28 00:00:00	Prelude	325	I understand that WorldSkills Council Ireland manages the selection, training and participation of Ireland's team for the WorldSkills competition.  The council is chaired by the Department of Education and Science and is representative of the various partners in vocational education and training, including the Department of Education and Science, FÁS, the institutes of technology, the Dublin Institute of Technology, Fáilte Ireland and the Irish Vocational Education Association.Ireland's participation in this competition, involving almost 50 countries with 824 participants in 47 skills areas, is essential to benchmark our strong craft and technical vocational education training against the technological advances in training in other countries.  The WorldSkills competition was established with the aim of achieving world-class standards and competencies in commerce, services and industry.  Ireland first competed in 1957 and hosted the competition in Dublin in 1963 and in Cork in 1979.Ireland has an excellent record in this competition and finished third overall in 1999.  In 2005 the Irish team finished seventh in the world with three gold medals, one silver, one bronze and nine medallions of excellence.  In Japan 2007, the Irish team achieved one gold medal, four bronze medals and ten medallions of excellence and finished 13th of 47 participating counties.The results achieved in the WorldSkills competition signal to multinational companies wishing to invest in Ireland that its young people have a wide range of skills, knowledge and competencies to support technically advanced industries and service providers.In the context of a global economy and Ireland's economic success over the past decade, there has been a very significant increase in the number of young people engaged in apprenticeship training and education.  This is reflected in the increase in competitors from skills areas by over 50% from the 2001 competition.This year Ireland sent 85 people to the competition, including 54 competitors, judges and team leaders, and 31 others, including logistical and support staff.  Some 37 of the 85 team members were FÁS apprentices, experts, technical staff or WorldSkills Council Ireland members.The increased numbers from the previous competition are directly attributable to the inclusion in the competition of four additional skills areas, a change in competition rules requiring an additional team leader and an additional six technical supports for all skills areas due to the dispersed nature of the competition site in ten different buildings.Participating organisations in the competition contribute pro rata to the cost in accordance with the numbers from each organisation.  I understand that it is expected that FÁS will contribute around €480,000 towards the cost of preparing and sending the Irish team to participate in the WorldSkills competition in Japan in November 2007.  This includes the cost of pre-departure training, the payment of FÁS training allowances during the pre-departure and competition periods, materials and equipment for use in the competition and the travel, accommodation and subsistence costs of the FÁS participants, other than the apprentices.
#LeoVaradkar	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-party	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-dob	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-28 00:00:00	Prelude	326	I asked this question because of the concerns expressed by the organisers at the extremely high number of people sent from Ireland to this event.  It seems extraordinary that we are spending half a million euro of taxpayers' money to send 85 people to this event.  Only 54 of these people are participants and not all of that group are actually competitors.  Does the Minister feel that the amount being spent is justifiable and did he seek a cost estimate beforehand?  With previous WorldSkills competitions in mind, can the Minister explain the huge change in the ratio of participants to hangers-on?  In Helsinki the numbers were 43 and 22, respectively, a ratio of 2:1 and in St. Gallen the numbers were 42 and 16, respectively, a ratio of 3:1.  This time the ratio is 1:1.5.  Why has there been an explosion on this occasion and why are we so big in Japan?
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-28 00:00:00	Prelude	327	FÁS is a contributing partner to this event and I take a different approach to this matter than the Deputy.  I have been familiar with the Skill Olympics since my time in the Department of Education and Science and I know that the staff of the colleges do not have to partake in it.  It is a labour of love for many of the personnel of our institutes of technology and we should celebrate and appreciate them because they drive the national effort at the Skill Olympics.I do not know the exact details relating to the Deputy's question but I can explain the increase in personnel.  However, I take a totally different approach.  I will consult the organisers to see if particular issues arise and if the Deputy has a problem I would appreciate if he shared it with me.  On a broader level, we should not undermine something that has been good for generations of apprentices in Ireland.When some institutes of technology, including Cork Institute of Technology, CIT, and Dublin Institute of Technology, DIT, were drifting from apprenticeship training we made great efforts and were heartened by the fact that people in these institutions and elsewhere were prepared to fight the good fight, celebrate apprenticeship at the highest level and strive for world-class excellence.  The only way this can be done is by participating in international competitions and my attitude to this matter is different from the Deputy's.I will not take a niggardly approach, trying to pull the rug from under these people by suggesting there were many hangers-on there merely to have a good time.  I know the exacting efforts the participants put into these competitions.

#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-28 00:00:00	Prelude	329	Activity levels increased on this occasion.

#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-28 00:00:00	Prelude	333	The Deputy put the question and is labelling these people hangers-on; I am not describing anyone as a hanger-on.

#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-28 00:00:00	Prelude	335	We are in the business of trying to inform and question and I suggest the Deputy should talk to the people who organised our participation in this event.  He can come back to me if his perspective on this matter has not changed.
#LeoVaradkar	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-party	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-dob	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-28 00:00:00	Prelude	336	I will, but so should the Minister before he spends half a million euro of taxpayers' money.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-28 00:00:00	Prelude	337	Under the Industrial Development Act 1986, as amended by the Acts of 1993 and 1995, IDA Ireland has the power to acquire, hold and dispose of land and any other property or any interest therein for the purpose of facilitating an industrial undertaking.  Accordingly, the management of IDA Ireland's industrial property portfolio is a day-to-day operational matter for the agency, as part of the statutory responsibility assigned to it by the Oireachtas.  It is not a matter in which I have a function.The agency has a stock of buildings that it either owns or leases.   These are marketed along with buildings on its industrial parks that are owned by private developers.  The use to which IDA Ireland property can be put is prescribed by legislation and the disposal of property for any alternative use requires the consent of the Minister of the day.  However, the agency is always available to discuss proposals regarding availability or suitability of individual buildings with local authorities, enterprise boards or community groups, and I will be pleased to consider any request for such consent should it be required.With regard to the 67 buildings that are owned by IDA Ireland, 28 of these are now vacant.  Of these 28 buildings, a total of 11 are classified as available.  However, only four smaller units of these 11 buildings are considered suitable for use by small business and the agency is in discussion with the respective local authorities regarding passing the buildings to them.  The other seven buildings that are classified as available would not be suitable for use as incubator units or for small businesses.With regard to buildings that are leased by IDA Ireland, there are several large factory buildings which it leases in gateway, hub and other towns for use by client companies of the agency, Enterprise Ireland and the county enterprise boards.  These buildings would not be suitable for use as incubator units.  Conversion costs and the relatively short period left in the leases would make it uneconomic to refit them for such a purpose.  They were designed as single-occupant facilities for manufacturing use.  However, IDA Ireland also leases 18 smaller units, which are available, and is in discussion with the landlords and local authorities regarding their future use.  Each of these units will be assessed on a case-by-case basis.The number of buildings in which IDA Ireland has an interest has fallen dramatically in recent years.  The policy decision to divest of buildings was taken in the 1990s and this decision was re-affirmed in the expenditure review of the IDA Ireland property programme that was concluded in 2004.  In disposing of these buildings the agency must balance the need to have properties available in key locations that will help it deliver on its mandate.  The agency must also seek to maximize the financial return to the Exchequer in disposing of property.
#LeoVaradkar	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-party	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-dob	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-28 00:00:00	Prelude	338	I thank the Minister for his reply.  I acknowledge that he does not have day-to-day responsibility for the activities of IDA Ireland.  I accept it is now the policy of IDA Ireland to move away from owning and operating properties.  At the time that policy was adopted, 18% of the agency's properties was vacant.  However, although it has since off-loaded many of its properties, there is now a vacancy rate of 41%.  In other words, the number of vacant properties has increased phenomenally despite this policy of off-loading buildings.Would it be appropriate for the Minister to request an audit of all vacant properties and to ask IDA Ireland, within a defined timeframe of  perhaps one or two years, either to dispose of properties that are no longer suitable or to make suitable properties available to local authorities, county enterprise boards or local community groups?
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-28 00:00:00	Prelude	339	Where it makes sense in local environments, we work with IDA Ireland to make a site available for an enterprise centre, for example, or for indigenous enterprise as opposed to foreign direct investment.  Some 41% of properties are vacant but this percentage relates to a much smaller total than was the case previously.  In 1998, there were 613 buildings in the IDA Ireland portfolio, but this figure has decreased to 150.I issue a note of caution in response to the Deputy's suggestion.  Yesterday, we announced the investment decision by Merck, Sharp & Dohme to open a 65-acre facility in Carlow.  I have visited Carlow frequently in the past three years and the pressure was on us to lease that site.  We almost leased  a small part of it to an indigenous enterprise but that arrangement fell through.  In hindsight, this seems like a positive outcome because the 65 acres are adequate for a value-added, high-end manufacturing investment.  This is an example of a case where one might lose out by getting rid of property too quickly and so be left without options.  In Ballina, there have been long-standing difficulties in securing a site for the county council to market the town for the purposes of securing foreign direct investment.  That scheme is being held up by legal difficulties between the council and the vendor.IDA Ireland's strategic approach to property is to dispose of those it does not need, to develop more strategic land sites, such as those in Oranmore, Athenry and in the north east, that can accommodate high-end industry, and to use the private sector more effectively.
#ArthurMorganSF	unknown-#ArthurMorganSF-party	unknown-#ArthurMorganSF-dob	unknown-#ArthurMorganSF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-28 00:00:00	Prelude	340	I am sure the Minister is aware of the difficulties encountered by entrepreneurs in getting started in business.  I agree entirely with the sentiment of the question and the points made by Deputy Varadkar.  Does the Minister accept that one of the difficulties experienced by entrepreneurs is acquiring accommodation?  The Minister does not have responsibility for planning but would he be prepared to advocate within the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government to secure some provision for what might best be described as "garage industry" for a limited period, thus enabling and facilitating enterprise?
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-28 00:00:00	Prelude	341	That is a fair point.  Through Enterprise Ireland's enterprise centre programme, we have allocated significant funding for enterprise.  In recent weeks, for instance, we announced a significant raft of decisions in regard to enterprise centres throughout the State, particularly in rural areas and in those counties that may not have had the same success as others in securing foreign direct investment.In regard to planning, I have encountered individual cases in rural areas, for example, where long established businesses struggle when new planning edicts or frameworks are introduced.  Such businesses, which may have been providing as many as 100 jobs for a long period, often have limited capacity to expand other than through the purchase of expensive properties close to a town.  I ask planners and local authorities to give greater consideration to the needs of enterprise in this regard.  Account should be taken of history and heritage and how these businesses have functioned in communities.  These are not fly-by-night entities but people who have been in business for many years and have come under pressure in recent times to move to expand, with significant cost implications.
#DamienEnglishFG	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-party	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-dob	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-28 00:00:00	Prelude	342	Will the Minister issue instructions to local authority planners to zone a certain amount of land to facilitate enterprise?  It is often the case that planners are unwilling to zone too much land, for whatever reason.  Guidance from the Department in this regard would be useful.Will the Minister consider assigning vacant land in the ownership of IDA Ireland for the purposes of providing car parks to serve small businesses in towns in which there is significant traffic congestion?  There are parking problems in most towns that are not bypassed and businesses there are under serious pressure because of lack of footfall.  The provision of temporary parking facilities on vacant land belonging to IDA Ireland would remove employees' cars from the town centre.  Is the Minister open to considering such a scheme?
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-28 00:00:00	Prelude	343	I am not in a position to instruct local authority officials.
#DamienEnglishFG	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-party	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-dob	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-28 00:00:00	Prelude	344	I accept that.  I refer to guidance rather than instruction.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-28 00:00:00	Prelude	345	I take the Deputy's point.  We work closely with local authorities and there are many pro-enterprise county managers and town clerks throughout the State with innovative development plans.  In Mallow, for example, a proactive leadership approach is being taken in terms of involving the local community in decisions regarding the zoning of land for enterprise purposes.  In Dungarvan, there have been positive responses from the county manager in terms of providing sites and engaging with enterprise.
#DamienEnglishFG	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-party	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-dob	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-28 00:00:00	Prelude	346	Some of the planners get it right.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-28 00:00:00	Prelude	347	That is the model we want.  We invariably find that the types of practices to which the Deputy referred occur most often in those areas that are loudest in seeking investment but have the least proactive policies.The Deputy's second question relates to a function of local authorities.  Park and ride facilities are the type of infrastructure that can best facilitate access to parking for workers.  There has been innovation from some local authorities in this regard.
#DamienEnglishFG	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-party	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-dob	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-28 00:00:00	Prelude	348	If vacant IDA Ireland properties are available, is the Minister willing to allow them to be used to provide temporary car parks?
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-28 00:00:00	Prelude	349	That is a matter for local authorities.  It can only be decided on a case-by-case basis.
#DamienEnglishFG	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-party	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-dob	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-28 00:00:00	Prelude	350	I ask only that the Minister does not rule out such an arrangement.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-28 00:00:00	Prelude	351	Under the Employment Permits Acts 2003 and 2006, it is illegal to employ a non-EEA national without an employment permit where one is required.  These Acts provide for a large number of obligations and offences, including those relating to the employment of foreign nationals except in accordance with an employment permit, refusal to co-operate with Garda inquiries, forgery, fraudulent alteration or fraudulent use of an employment permit, and misuse by employer or employee of an employment permit.  Prosecutions under these Acts have been initiated by the Garda Síochána, which comes under the auspices of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform.The Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform has provided details of the proceedings commenced and convictions secured under the Employment Permits Act 2003.  In 2003, 90 proceedings commenced, with eight convictions;  in 2004, 81 proceedings commenced, with 20 convictions; in 2005, 73 proceedings commenced, with 45 convictions; in 2006, 45 proceedings commenced, with seven convictions; and in 2007, three proceedings commenced, with one conviction.  I understand no proceedings have commenced to date for offences under the Employment Permits Act 2006, which commenced on 1 January 2007.With regard to the breakdown of these proceedings and convictions into those against employers and those against employees, I am informed the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform has made inquiries with the Garda authorities but it has not been possible in the timeframe available to obtain the statistical information requested.  This information will be forwarded to the Deputy as soon as it is available.
#RuairiQuinn	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-party	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-dob	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-28 00:00:00	Prelude	352	I thank the Minister for his reply, which is very similar to the response given on 24 October.  Unfortunately, since that time the Minister's colleagues in the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform have not been able to provide the breakdown asked for.Is it not time for the Department, or a relevant sub-agency within the Department, to take on the responsibility for proceedings, as the Revenue Commissioners have done?  All of us have enough experience of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform to realise this is very low on its priorities.  It will not enter into prosecutions of this kind because the matter is low on the scale of criminality as far as the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform is concerned.I appreciate that the breakdown of employees and employers will be sent to me but the Minister might respond to my net question.  There should be teeth to initiate prosecutions in order to give effective policing of the labour market, of which this is a part, along with the welcome addition of the labour inspectorate, or we will not go the final mile.  If the Department depends on the Garda and the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, there will be no value for the increase in inspections of the labour market.Will the Minister consider taking back or giving the Department a power to initiate prosecutions, as the Revenue Commissioners have done?  It was previously dependent on other agencies.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-28 00:00:00	Prelude	353	I agree with the Deputy and the Employment Permits Act 2006 gives me those teeth.  It states "the Minister may appoint in writing such and so many of his or her officers to be authorised officers for the purposes of all or any of the provisions of this Act or the Act of 2003".  It was a gap in the 2003 legislation that the issue of prosecution was left to An Garda.

We were quite vulnerable to legal challenge, even in the compilation of a report.  I have instructed my officials that the national employment rights agency, NERA, will be the agency to prosecute for breaches of the Employment Permits Act2006.

#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-28 00:00:00	Prelude	357	The Bill to give NERA statutory provision is being drafted currently by the Parliamentary Counsel, and it should be placed on a statutory footing in early 2008.  The overall approach is to build compliance.  NERA is in discussions currently with the GNIB——
#RuairiQuinn	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-party	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-dob	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-28 00:00:00	Prelude	358	I welcome the Minister's reply but I am conscious of the time.  When NERA is brought into effect, can the provision be activated from the first day?  Will the Minister undertake to do so?
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-28 00:00:00	Prelude	359	They are authorised officers of my Department so I can activate it.  I have had discussions with NERA on this specific issue last week.  The GNIB still has a significant role to play because there is a migration aspect to this.  A benefit of this Act, which will give us more teeth, is the capacity for the Revenue Commissioners, the Department of Social and Family Affairs and my Department to work collaboratively on a specific sector or a particular company.  This has already had an impact, particularly in the construction sector.The message for anybody out there who wishes to break employment permit or labour law is that we will bring the whole house down on top of them.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-28 00:00:00	Prelude	360	Under the new employment permit arrangements I launched earlier this year, registered nurses and specialist nurses are both occupations for which green cards may be issued for posts with an annual salary over €30,000.  Nurses must be fully qualified and registered with An Bord Altranais.  In 2007 to the end of October, a total of 1,331 employment permits have issued in respect of nurses, of which the majority would have been green cards.The work permit scheme, on the other hand, is designed to address labour shortages and, accordingly, it is not normally required that work permit holders would be expected to have a third level education.  All work permit holders are however required to possess skills and experience appropriate to their position.The Deputy should note that only in exceptional circumstances are new work permits issued for positions where the annual salary is less than €30,000.  In contrast to the green card system, a labour market needs test is applied for each case.  In 2007 to the end of January , a total of 1,083 employment permits have issued in respect of carers and nurses' aides, with 375 new applicants and 708 renewals.With regard to nursing homes, if the Irish Nursing Homes Association has concerns about the new system, we are open to having discussions to facilitate the concerns.

If he has not done so, I hope he will as soon as possible.  This is an issue in which I have an interest and am involved.  Since the introduction of the new rules in February this year, there has been a clear problem for many nursing homes in meeting the 50% rules and in getting carers or nurses who would, in general, be paid less than €30,000.It is possible a number of nursing homes will have to close wards or curtail numbers in the coming months, particularly as longer-standing Filipino staff go on maternity leave or go on holidays later in the summer.  It is an emerging problem in a sector with a long history of Filipino and Indian nurses, in particular, coming to Ireland to work in nursing homes.  Labour is not necessarily available from other EU countries.I am not sure if the Minister has received a request for a meeting yet from the Irish Nursing Homes Association but if he has, I encourage him to meet with a delegation as soon as possible.  If he has not yet received an invitation, he will shortly.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-28 00:00:00	Prelude	362	My officials discussed the matter this morning and we understand the association may have articulated the difficulties outlined by the Deputy; we will facilitate a meeting to work through a proper system.  There has always been a specific allowance for health care because it was an area identified repeatedly, along with IT and construction professionals, as having skills shortages.This must be balanced with ensuring there is no exploitation and there is proper policing of rights.  We can achieve that balance, and we have dealt with other sectors.  The €30,000 limit can be a bit high if one considers initial trainees in some instances but we are flexible in facilitating measures for a genuine need, without in any way compromising basic and proper standards in accordance with our labour laws.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-28 00:00:00	Prelude	363	Broadband infrastructure and telecommunications policy is the primary responsibility of my colleague, the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources.There has been much debate and discussion about broadband provision over the past few years.  As a result of forward-thinking investment many years ago our international broadband connectivity is superior to or as advanced as any provided by our competitors.  This is a key factor in Ireland winning ground-breaking investment, most recently from Microsoft that will see an investment of $500 million in a new data centre that will house tens of thousands of Internet servers.  Furthermore Novell has decided to centralise its Europe, Middle East and Africa TeleWeb operations in Ireland.These are just a few of the major Internet investments we have won against robust international competition from other countries equally ambitious to be knowledge centres for tomorrow's Internet and broadband economy.  Ireland has been successful because these companies rely on robust, resilient and extensive broadband networks for their business, which we provide.I am aware that there are still challenges in this area and that we are playing catch-up with regard to overall on-line applications, participation rates and penetration.  We have seen significant increases in this respect and I recently received a copy of a letter sent to the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, Deputy Eamon Ryan, from the director of eBay and I have agreed to meet with him to discuss his concerns.At national level broadband subscriptions now account for over 63% of all Internet subscriptions, of which there are almost 700,000.  This is an 87% increase on the corresponding June 2006 figure, so we are making belated but dramatic progress.  ComReg estimates that Irish broadband penetration, including mobile broadband, in June this year was 16.48% compared with 18.1% across the EU 25.Of much more significance is how broadband penetration is growing.  The recent OECD report shows that Ireland has the strongest per capita subscriber growth rate in the OECD, adding 6.6 subscribers per 100 inhabitants during the year, far ahead of the OECD average of 3.65 per 100 inhabitants.  Accelerating broadband connections at this pace is rapidly shrinking the gap between Ireland and other countries.  On residential costs, which are also important for competitiveness, Ireland is five places less expensive than the European Union average.  None of this is to suggest complacency on our part.  There are issues around the evenness of availability of broadband across the country as well as the adequacy of the infrastructure in use.Additional information not given on the floor of the House.Total investment under the communications and broadband programme 2007-13 will be €435 million.  To date all gateways have open access, high-speed fibre networks constructed under the MANs.  The MANs consist of high speed, fibre optic rings linking the main business districts to a co-location centre.  By making these available to all operators on an open access, carrier-neutral basis they are stimulating competition by removing the need for service operators to build their own networks.  The group broadband scheme enables smaller communities to obtain broadband through Government grants.  Some 27 MANs have been built and between 2007 and 2008 some 90 networks will be completed.  A total of 160 GBS projects have been approved.  Funding has also enabled the construction of a third fibre optic backbone network by ESB Telecom and the upgrading of more than 50 telephone exchanges to permit DSL broadband delivery.  Consideration will be given to a further phase of MANs once the effectiveness of spending under the first phase has been assessed.With a view to our future needs in the domain of telecommunications, the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources will, in the coming months, publish a policy paper on next generation networks, NGNs.  The paper will consider and learn from international experience in NGN roll-out, review current communications policy and analyse policy options on the optimum role for Government in the evolution to next generation broadband.  I understand the Minister intends to convene a national advisory forum on NGNs to critique the paper and provide expert high-level guidance on future developments in the telecommunications sector.  This is an important initiative because next generation communications infrastructure is emerging as an important factor in the competitiveness of advanced economies and in our circumstances to help progress to the next stages of economic growth.

It is perhaps a more honest answer than the one I got from the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, Deputy Ryan.  John McElligott, managing director, of eBay also wrote to me on foot of previous questions I asked.  I will quote one line from his letter.  "I am embarrassed to tell my peers in other countries about Ireland's connectivity problems.  Ireland is nowhere in terms of on-line application usage and innovation."  While that might be an exaggeration, it is clear that we are behind and playing catch up.  My difficulty is that the Minister's answers always seem to relate to EU averages.  Ireland should not be talking about EU averages.  We should be a world leader in broadband and technology.I highlight the area of broadband speeds where we are behind other countries.  I would particularly like the Minister to address this area.  The average advertised speed for broadband in Ireland is 3,011 megabits per second compared with Japan where it is 93,000 megabits per second and France where it is 44,000 megabits per second.  If Ireland is to become a fibre island, a knowledge economy and the world leader about which we all talk and preach, we cannot afford to be 30 times slower than Japan or in 28th place in the broadband league table of OECD countries, ahead of only Turkey and Mexico.  I appreciate that the Minister is not being complacent about it, accepts there is a problem and that we are playing catch up.  However, we are not catching up fast enough and are very far behind.  I would particularly like the Minister to address the issue of speeds.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-28 00:00:00	Prelude	365	I accept the Deputy's point on speed.  There is no argument about the OECD measurement.  There are reasons for this in that countries like Japan have higher population densities, which give them some advantage over lower speed countries.  For example, 26 million people live in the greater Seoul area, half of whom live in apartment blocks.

#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-28 00:00:00	Prelude	367	The point is that I do not disagree with the Deputy.  The other competitive issue regarding the digital and Internet space is energy.  That would be of concern to me in the medium term as it affects the cost base that may apply.  I have also discussed that area with the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, Deputy Ryan.  The Deputy has said we are playing catch up.  We know and it is accepted that the privatisation of Telecom Éireann, now Eircom, caused difficulties here in the interim period.  The Government introduced the MAN initiative, which has had an impact.  We are now the fastest growing country in the OECD.  We are catching up pretty quickly.  To be fair, the private sector companies are putting their shoulder to the wheel in this regard.

#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-28 00:00:00	Prelude	375	I take the Deputy's point that we always aim to be the best.  Although I note that just as the Deputy criticises me for using European parameters, on another day the Opposition loves to use European averages.  I accept the Deputy's basic point that it is not the key issue for us.  The key issue for us relates to FDI.  We compete with Israel, Singapore, Puerto Rico, eastern Europe and other countries for significant investments.

Is he aware of the negative impact its lack is having on enterprise?  Every week all Members of this House get a bundle of representations on the dearth of broadband provision.  I ask him to bring to bear any influence he can on the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, Deputy Ryan, to prioritise the matter, which is a huge problem for Irish industry.  Clearly the Minister, Deputy Ryan, is not aware of that.

#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-28 00:00:00	Prelude	384	He is.  He is very keen to advance this agenda and he will leave an impact on this area — of that I have no doubt.  There are pluses and minuses.  We have the strongest per capita subscriber growth in the OECD.  We have added 6.6 subscribers per 100 inhabitants in the past year, which is far ahead of anybody else.  We improved to 21st out of 32 countries as benchmarked by Forfás in June 2007.  While we have moved up, we still have a significant journey to travel.  Broadband access is an important issue for competitiveness.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-28 00:00:00	Prelude	385	I propose to take Questions Nos. 63 and 75 together.The most recent full year merchandise trade figures published by the Central Statistics Office relate to 2006.  Between 2004 and 2005 imports rose from €51.1 billion to €57.5 billion, a rise of €6.4 billion, 12.5%, while between 2005 and 2006 imports rose from €57.5 billion to €60.7 billion, a rise of €3.2 billion, 5.7%.  These figures represent a significant slowing in the rate of increase in the level of imports, despite the fact that it occurred in the face of sharp increases in world energy costs, as Ireland imports all of our oil and a significant proportion of our natural gas requirements.The figures also show that there was continued growth in our exports, rising from €84.4 billion in 2004 to €86.8 billion in 2006, resulting in a significant trade surplus of €26.1 billion last year.The latest merchandise trade figures, released by the Central Statistics Office last week, show that for the first eight months of this year, exports rose from €56.9 billion to €59.7 billion, an increase of 5% compared with the same period in 2006.  This is impressive considering that significant portions of our exports are priced in dollars, which means that the nominal value of exports will inevitably be influenced by movements in the currency markets, such as the steady fall in the value of the dollar against the euro.  This is particularly significant given that the United States is our largest single merchandise export market, accounting for approximately 20% of these exports.In addition to merchandise trade the other element of our external trade is the services sector.  The figures show continued improvement in the level of this trade.  Between 2003 and 2006, while services imports rose from €48.2 billion to €62.5 billion, an increase of 29.6%, it is significant that exports of services rose from €37.1 billion to €55.1 billion, an increase of 48.5%.  These figures represent a narrowing of the deficit between imports and exports during this period by an impressive 33.1%.The Government's policy has, for a number of years, been to exploit our membership of the European Union fully by diversifying into EU export markets, and also to focus on new opportunities in the US and further afield.  From a position of 75% of Irish merchandise exports going to the UK in the 1960s, we have now reached a point where the European Union accounts for 64% of our exports, with only 17% of exports going to the UK.  During 2006, the value of exports going to key markets such as the United States, Germany and Belgium showed solid growth.Since the accession of the new EU member states, new export opportunities have been developed and exports to these countries are increasing.  For example, during 2006, exports to Poland increased in value terms by 36%, to the Czech Republic by 38%, to Slovakia by 28% and to Estonia by 60%.  I have no doubt that over time, Irish exporters will establish a substantial presence in central and eastern Europe.The second phase of the Asia strategy, launched by the Taoiseach in 2005, prioritises eight countries in Asia and sets out targets for increasing our exports to that region up to 2009.  Within the context of this strategy, work is under way to ensure that agencies such as Enterprise Ireland, Bord Bia, Tourism Ireland and organisations engaged in the education sector, will be combining closely to exploit and increase Irish exporting opportunities in this area over the lifetime of the Asia strategy and beyond.  Already there has been significant expansion in our trade with China and India and the level of our services exports to Asia has increased significantly.In addition, both myself, and the Ministers of State in my Department continue to be active in leading trade missions, in conjunction with Enterprise Ireland, to target markets abroad with a view to increasing our share of exports by Irish companies in all markets.  Recently, Enterprise Ireland opened a new office in Brazil, with the objective of expanding our export opportunities with Brazil and other South American countries.I am confident that the strategy of diversifying into export markets abroad, such as the wider European Union, the Americas, Asia and emerging markets, including the Middle East and South America, is a sound one.  Directly related to that strategy is the ongoing process of building on the higher value sectors of the economy, particularly in the knowledge-based areas.  This will ensure that Irish exporters will continue to rise to the challenges posed by the global trading environment and increase the value of their sales incrementally for the future.
#DeirdreClune	unknown-#DeirdreClune-party	unknown-#DeirdreClune-dob	unknown-#DeirdreClune-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-28 00:00:00	Prelude	386	Question No. 63 asked the Minister to comment on the competitiveness of Irish exports.  Energy costs, local authority charges and wage levels, for example, can make it quite expensive to do business here.  Such expenses are ultimately reflected in prices.  Does the Minister agree that those who export are at a disadvantage as a result of these factors?  What can be done to reduce such costs?
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-28 00:00:00	Prelude	387	The key strategy we have adopted involves trying to move to value-added activities which can be more effective in terms of dealing with our cost base.  Our capacity to compete in sectors like low-cost services and low-cost merchandise has been reducing.  As we invest more in research and innovation, small and medium sized enterprises and companies of that nature are in a better position to develop products, services and solutions which are of use to world business.  We want to turn Ireland into a country that offers solutions on a competitive basis to the global marketplace.  I have been impressed by the quality of our software and internationally traded services companies, as well as some of our engineering, high-end manufacturing and life sciences enterprises.Having been on trade missions in the United States and elsewhere with officials from such organisations, I am aware that they are winning good contracts with blue-chip companies throughout the world, which demonstrates the quality of their products.  We are doing certain things well as we try to maximise our competitiveness, although we should be doing better in other respects.  The World Economic Forum ranks Ireland first in terms of the prevalence of foreign ownership, the impact of business rules on foreign direct investment and foreign direct investment and technology transfer.  We are fifth in terms of the quality of primary education and seventh in terms of the quality of overall education.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-28 00:00:00	Prelude	388	Under the Employment Permits Act 2006, the fee for an employment permit may be refunded if an application has been refused or withdrawn prior to the issuing of the permit.  The fee is not normally refunded, however, after the permit has been issued.  Employment permits are processed in accordance with the Employment Permits Acts 2003 and 2006 and SI Nos. 682 and 683 of 2006, which clearly and comprehensively set out in legislation the procedures relating to applications for permits, the granting or refusal of permits and the fees which apply to permits.  Under the 2006 Act, a new permit is not normally considered unless a period of 12 months has elapsed since the foreign national first commenced employment in the State.  This retention measure was included to allay the fears of employers who have spent time and money on trying to source suitable employees.  However, permits may be issued within 12 months if there appears to have been abuse of an employee or there are other exceptional circumstances.
#LeoVaradkar	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-party	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-dob	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-28 00:00:00	Prelude	389	It is fair to say that work permits are not cheap.  I am not sure what the exact cost of a work permit is — I think it is approximately €1,000.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-28 00:00:00	Prelude	390	It costs €1,000 for two years.
#LeoVaradkar	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-party	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-dob	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-28 00:00:00	Prelude	391	Given that approximately €10 million accrued to the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment last year in respect of fees for work permits, it seems reasonable that a portion of the fee should be refunded if the employment terminates within six months, for any reason.  I ask the Minister to consider that suggestion.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-28 00:00:00	Prelude	392	The danger with that proposal is that our approach is vacancy-driven.  When an employment vacancy occurs, that can be the catalyst for an application by an employer or an employee for a work permit.  We do not want a free-for-all to develop, whereby somebody utilises a vacancy to get a work permit and then goes somewhere else within two months.  That would bring the entire system into disarray.  There are no problems in the vast majority of cases in which employers bring people to Ireland, look after them well and retain them as part of their good human resources policy.  I will keep this issue under review.  If Deputy Varadkar is aware of particular cases, and is able to give the employer's side of the story, I will listen to him.  We should be careful not to undermine the entire edifice we have constructed in this respect.Written Answers follow Adjournment Debate.
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-28 00:00:00	Prelude	393	I wish to advise the House of the following matters in respect of which notice has been given under Standing Order 21 and the name of the Member in each case: (1) Deputy Willie Penrose — the delay in commencing work on a number of primary school projects in County Westmeath; (2) Deputy Pat Breen — the need for the Minister for Education and Science to explain why an extension to a school (details supplied) in County Clare has not been progressed and to outline the current position in respect of the school, which was originally built for 175 pupils but now has 300 pupils who are forced to operate in substandard prefabricated accommodation; (3) Deputy Joe Costello — the need to lift the recruitment embargo on staff in the health service; (4) Deputy Caoimhghín Ó Caoláin — the need to restore local democracy, political accountability and community participation in the planning process for major infrastructural projects and accordingly to repeal the Planning and Development (Strategic Infrastructure) Act 2006; (5) Deputy Ulick Burke — the delay in publishing the conditions and guidelines for the implementation of the mid-Shannon tax incentive scheme; (6) Deputy James Bannon — the need for the Minister for Health and Children to reconsider the situation in relation to cancer care in the midlands and to establish a centre of excellence in Longford-Westmeath General Hospital to cover all the midland counties — Longford, Westmeath, Roscommon, Cavan, Laois, Offaly and south Leitrim — in light of the fact that it is logistically untenable for women and men living in those counties to avail of cancer care centres in Dublin or Galway; (7) Deputy Deirdre Clune — the review of the work of a pathologist in Cork University Hospital; and (8) Deputy Joan Burton — the need for the Minister for Education and Science to tell the House when a special unit for children with special needs, including Asperger's syndrome and autism, which has been built with a school (details supplied) in Castleknock, Dublin 15, will be opened and to explain the delay in opening the unit in view of the many children waiting for such a facility.The matters raised by Deputies Ulick Burke, Joe Costello, Deirdre Clune and Willie Penrose have been selected for discussion.
#TerenceFlanagan	unknown-#TerenceFlanagan-party	unknown-#TerenceFlanagan-dob	unknown-#TerenceFlanagan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-28 00:00:00	Prelude	394	I asked the Minister earlier to assure the House that there will be adequate numbers of medical staff on this mission.  On 25 September last, the UN Security Council authorised Resolution 1778, which provides for the deployment of a multidimensional international presence in east Chad and north-east Central African Republic.  Human Rights Watch has called on the EU and the UN to address the needs of the most vulnerable civilians — displaced people who remain outside the large camps and those who are still living in their home communities.  It is imperative that EU forces act to protect the civilians who are at greatest risk, wherever they may be.  The UN resolution I mentioned focuses assistance on areas of east Chad and north-east Central African Republic where continued armed conflict, general lawlessness and chronic instability, partly related to the conflict in the adjoining Darfur region of Sudan, have exacerbated the humanitarian crisis.Reports in the media have suggested that Ireland will be the second-highest contributor, in terms of soldiers, to the EU mission in Chad.  I understand that France is to provide half of the full contingent in the shape of a battalion comprising three companies and support units.  Ireland will provide between 350 and 400 troops, Sweden will provide 200 troops, Austria will provide 160 troops and other countries will provide much smaller numbers of troops.  Countries which are much larger than Ireland are making far fewer troops available for this mission.  I appreciate that Ireland is taking the lead in this high-risk mission.The involvement of France in this deployment is one of the serious problems faced by the mission.  As France is the former colonial power in Chad, it might not be seen as an independent player.  France's tough approach in the past could benefit the Irish troops by causing rebels to become fearful of attacking the EU forces.  It might add to the authority of this mission.  However, France's status as the former colonial power could create the impression that this EU force has been deployed to protect the local government from attempts to overthrow it.  That might make the force a target.Rebels have claimed that in April, France fired warning shots on rebels who were advancing on the Chadian capital.  They argue that France's interest in participating in the EU mission is a tactic that will enable the French authorities to keep the President of Chad, Mr. Déby, who is a French-trained helicopter pilot, in power.  Those rebels who seek to overthrow Mr. Déby have explicitly stated in media reports that if the EU mission gets in their way, they will have no hesitation in attacking it and thereby dragging the mission into combat within Chad.  A representative of one of the Chadian rebel groups stated bluntly in September that if the EU troops come on the pretext of Darfur but then block the rebel advance on the capital, they will receive a very bad welcome.It has been suggested that everything will be okay if the force does not touch the rebels.  The rebels have said that the EU mission will see what they are made of if it gets in the way of an advance on the capital.  Another rebel spokesman said that if the EU force is deployed to secure Darfur the rebels will not get in the way, but there will be clashes if the EU troops get in the way of rebel strikes on government positions.  The situation in Chad is deteriorating.  The rapid pace of development in the security situation is reported in The Irish Times of 8 November 2007.  It reported that people are doubtful that the recent peace agreement signed between the Government and the rebels would last.  Within two weeks of this report, the rebels had declared their ceasefire to be over and fighting had flared up on 26 November in the area in which the EU mission will be based.  The rebels accused the regime of attacking them.Chad has suffered from political instability.  It has faced constant coups, with governments splitting and ministers plotting coups against the existing regime.  One risk for the EU force is to find itself based in a country where the government may be deposed by rebels potentially hostile to the French, who are the main component of the EU force.The lack of physical infrastructure in Chad, the poor quality of airports and the distance between them means that the ability of the mission to offer support to the soldiers on the ground may be severely compromised.Questions arise as to the ability to supply the EU forces with adequate food, water and medical supplies, should major civil disturbances erupt.  With the upsurge in rebel attacks, the EU force might be prevented from receiving necessary reinforcements and air cover and may need to be withdrawn in an extreme case.The geography and weather conditions in Chad must be taken into account.  The temperature rises to 45° Celsius.  The EU force must be guaranteed every necessary protection, full air cover and a guarantee that food, water and medical supplies can be supplied in any circumstance and no matter what civil disturbance might arise.Military planning must cover for every potential development, up to and including the possibility of wholesale civil war; the overthrow of the current regime; a destabilisation of the situation in neighbouring Darfur which may lead to a flood of massive numbers of additional refugees fleeing from Darfur into Chad.I ask the Minister to confirm whether the Government has invested €43 million of Irish taxpayers' money in companies that are propping up the regime in Sudan, which fuels the conflict.  This is reported in one of today's newspapers.

However, it is a mission that is highly risky.  Full protection must be in place for the duration of the mission.  This is the most dangerous mission ever undertaken by the Irish Army.  If proper protections, facilities and support are in place, the risks may be minimised, if not removed.  However, if corners are cut and facilities and back-up supports are not in place and the situation deteriorates, the EU force could find itself in a very dangerous environment, caught between warring rebels, a government with accusations of abuse of human rights levelled against it and masses of refugees from Darfur.  This is certainly an exceptionally risky mission.  I wish Lieutenant General Pat Nash, leader of the mission, and all the troops all the best.  They have served us well and with great distinction in the past.  I hope they will have a safe mission.
#ThomasByrne	unknown-#ThomasByrne-party	unknown-#ThomasByrne-dob	unknown-#ThomasByrne-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-28 00:00:00	Prelude	397	An extremely important humanitarian issue exists in the Chad, Darfur and general region of central Africa.  This mission is in response to a terrible situation with 230,000 refugees from Darfur in Chad.  The international community has been criticised for a lack of action in this regard.  I am glad to see some action in the form of this undertaking.The refugees continue to flee into eastern Chad and the north-east of the Central African Republic.  Sudanese rebels are carrying out attacks on refugees and local people.  The international community and this State have a moral duty to act to relieve the situation.The legal framework to allow Ireland to participate deserves special mention.  This mission is backed by a UN resolution, a decision of the EU Council of Ministers, an Irish Government decision and a decision of the Dáil which represents the Irish people.  These important procedures reflect the dangers inherent in this mission and the precautions that must be taken before our soldiers are sent into this dangerous region.  This is not a decision to be taken lightly.I note the political interests in central Africa and the criticism of the Chinese for their role in the region.  The more we can do to bring the Chinese on board in dealing with this area, the better.The French have a historical connection with Chad and with central Africa in general and they have made a significant contribution to the mission.  It is important that a neutral country such as Ireland plays a significant role in this mission, under the leadership of General Nash.  The mission will then not be regarded as a mission composed solely of the former colonial powers.  Ireland's role is very important even though it has been suggested that this involvement is not compatible with our neutrality.  It is the responsibility of a neutral nation such as Ireland to provide a leading role in maintaining peace and order in the world.I am a new Member of the House and I remember the occasion of my participation in the election of the Taoiseach and the Ceann Comhairle as being a joyful time.  I speak on this issue with a certain nervousness because this is a motion to send troops into a very dangerous part of the world, a fact that has not been underestimated by any Member of the House.  The Government, particularly the Minister for Defence, must carry the burden, but even as a lowly TD I feel a certain burden of responsibility when I speak on this matter and I consider the possibilities of what might happen.  I am confident this operation will not commence until all the problems have been ironed out.  The Minister has stated that troops will not be deployed until the force commander, General Nash, is satisfied that existing problems have been overcome.Many members of the Army are based in my constituency in Gormanston camp.  They have provided a wonderful service to the nation and have enhanced the reputation of our country.  I recall the sacrifices of the loss of life made by the Army.  It may be politically incorrect and somewhat American to say that we think of the soldiers in our prayers. Laborare est orare, to work is to pray. I know the Government will work to ensure the operation is as safe as possible for our troops.  However, if the situation was safe, there would be no need to send such a mission to central Africa.The continent of Africa deserves more attention from this Legislature and should be the subject of debates.  The Irish nation has contributed missionaries to Africa.  I have only visited Africa once when I went to Morocco and I do not think I will return there as a tourist because of the political instability in the area.  Anything we can do to maintain law and order and provide humanitarian assistance is very important.I hope this motion will be supported by the House.  I know that all Members will be thinking of the troops who will go on the mission.  I know the Government will do all in its power to help General Nash, whose appointment is a significant honour for the country.  His appointment enhances our image and reputation abroad.I commend this motion.  I have not heard any voices of opposition to it.  I am pleased we are all united and are aware of the risks and dangers.  The Minister will do all he can to ensure the safety of the Irish troops.
#JackWall	unknown-#JackWall-party	unknown-#JackWall-dob	unknown-#JackWall-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-28 00:00:00	Prelude	398	I wish to share my time with Deputy Joe Costello, and I ask the Acting Chairman to notify me at the appropriate time.During my time as a Deputy, several motions such as this have come before the House.  My concern in this regard is that doubt is always cast as to the safety of the participating troops.  However, everyone knows that being a soldier is about soldiering and that danger is always present.  All things being equal, I have the utmost confidence in the Minister, the Chief of Staff and Lieutenant General Pat Nash to ensure this will be a true and genuine effort to help the people of Chad and Darfur.  Members must be honest in this regard and must highlight that this mission will not happen unless the feedback from Pat Nash to the Chief of Staff and the Minister is completely positive.  The Army is second nature to those who live in the constituency I represent.  They see soldiers training every day and have neighbours who are members of the Defence Forces.  Active units of the FCA operate in the area.  People in my constituency know and understand what it is to be a soldier.  They know that soldiers want to act as soldiers and to be seen in that position.This is what is happening in this instance.  The Government has responded to a request and will put in place a mechanism, through logistics and everything else, to ensure that Irish soldiers again will play a dominant role in providing peace in part of the wider world.  They have done so since 1960 when they served in the Congo and on many subsequent occasions.  They have never let down the country.  Such service has been an ideal for young people who have sought a profession as members of the Defence Forces.  A wonderful standard has been set by the Defence Forces in respect of UN service overseas.  I include Naval Service personnel in this regard, although they have not served in the same numbers.Ireland will provide help by carrying out this mission.  One only needs to look at any television channel to discover what is happening to humanity in these regions.  Were Ireland able to implant a sense of law and order there that made a difference to the people affected, the effort, time and dedication of the Defence Forces personnel being deployed would be worthwhile.Problems have been encountered previously and there have been sad times.  I have witnessed the brunt of such sad occasions in my constituency when those who unfortunately were killed on active service or through accidents etc. when overseas were brought home.  In such circumstances, the entire community joined together with the Defence Forces and the Minister of the day to show their respect and understanding of what had happened.  They tried to be part of the greater family of those unfortunate husbands or wives who had lost a loved one.  With the help of God, this will not happen in this case.I will raise one issue.  Although only a small group will be deployed in the first instance, Christmas, which is important to every family, approaches.  The logistics should be in place to ensure interaction between the soldiers serving overseas and their respective families during that time.  My main request today is to ensure this will happen.

I have visited a number of African countries and have seen devastation arising from hunger and everything associated with it.  In this case however, the Defence Forces personnel will have seen nothing that compares to what they will encounter.  This is the reason it is so important for Members to show unanimity in agreeing to the Minister's request regarding the deployment of the Defence Forces.  In so doing, Members also will give confidence to the members of the Defence Forces to ensure that this mission will be a success, as we all wish.  Such confidence will flow from the Chief of Staff, Dermot Earley, a native of County Roscommon who has lived in County Kildare all his life, and through him to Pat Nash etc.I fully support the motion.  I ask the Minister to provide the logistical service that is so important at Christmas time for the families concerned and am confident he will do so.
#JoeCostelloLAB	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-party	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-dob	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-28 00:00:00	Prelude	401	I thank Deputy Jack Wall for sharing his time with me.  Members should be proud of the Defence Forces who have served so well, bravely and humanely in many theatres of conflict throughout the world.  Only two weeks ago, I attended the annual commemoration at Arbour Hill of the Irish United Nations Veterans Association, IUNVA.  The commemoration was for 89 members of the Defence Forces who had died in service abroad under the UN banner.  Members must be proud of this record and of the soldiers who are going to Chad.  Moreover, they should be proud that although Irish personnel will not comprise a numerical majority of the contingent, an Irishman will lead the force, namely, Lieutenant General Pat Nash.  I refer to the new reform treaty being introduced.  It specifically makes reference to the neutral status of countries such as Ireland that will not look towards a common European army.  Ireland will do the business it has laid out, namely, peacemaking and peacekeeping and this also will form part of our intended future direction.I have received some documentation on this matter from Amnesty International in respect of human rights issues.  In respect of a delay in the arrival in Chad of the main component of the force, it is concerned that were the force to arrive in March or April, that would be too late given the existence of serious issues at present.  Although the rangers will be deployed in December, it would be desirable to have in place a major part of the force well before the date currently expected.  Perhaps the Minister for Defence will comment on this matter because the situation is quite variable and vulnerable at present.  Given its contacts and experience as a non-governmental organisation, Amnesty International is of the opinion that it would be desirable to have the force on the ground much earlier.Amnesty International also is greatly concerned about existing abuses of human rights.  I refer in particular to gender violence directed against women.  Amnesty has expressed concerns that women are being targeted by militias and the Chadian military and considers the present position to be serious.  Consequently, it advocates the deployment of female Garda and Defence Forces personnel, who may be more in tune with the needs of the situation.  Certainly, it suggests that those members of the Defence Forces who are being deployed abroad should be well-briefed on this aspect of the difficulties that are being experienced in Chad at present.As my colleague, Deputy Jack Wall, has already noted, joining the Army entails a degree of danger.  The Defence Forces have served in Lebanon and the Congo and have suffered because of it.  However, they have done their duty and have provided an excellent service.  I expect the same service will be provided this time.  All necessary resources and backup — I refer to the logistics regarding air transport in particular — should be put in place as a matter of urgency and should be available to the highest level when Irish troops go abroad.
#JoeBehan	unknown-#JoeBehan-party	unknown-#JoeBehan-dob	unknown-#JoeBehan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-28 00:00:00	Prelude	402	I welcome the opportunity afforded to Members to express their view on this deployment which, to quote the Minister for Defence, Deputy O'Dea, "is one of the most challenging and ambitious overseas deployments to date."I have not spoken very often since I was elected.  I only spoke once so far and that was on the tragic circumstances of the fire in Bray in which two firefighters lost their lives.  There is a certain similarity between these situations because, in effect, we are making a decision to deploy members of our armed forces into an area of the world which is an extremely dangerous one.  I acknowledge the fact that all sides of the House support this deployment.  It is, as Deputy Thomas Byrne said, a momentous decision to make and one about which, obviously, the families of those who will be sent will have some concerns.  We all hope the mission will be successful.I welcome the fact that since early September 2007 the crisis in Chad has been given greater prominence by the visit of the United Nations Secretary General, who went there to build support for the proposed multidimensional UN mission.  The authorities in Chad and the Central African Republic have welcomed a possible EU military presence in their respective countries.  The signing of the peace deal in Chad in October 2007, although under some strain now, can still provide an opportunity for greater stability in the region and, with the deployment of the UN mission, an improved environment for assisting and protecting refugees and supporting the distribution of humanitarian aid.On 25 September 2007, the UN Security Council unanimously adopted Resolution 1778 establishing a multidimensional United Nations mission in Chad and the Central African Republic that will help strengthen security in the region.  The mission will focus on the security and protection of civilians, especially refugees, internally displaced persons and civilians in danger, and on human rights and the rule of law in eastern Chad and north-eastern Central African Republic.  The United Nations element of the mission is targeted primarily at supporting the civil administrations in Chad and the Central African Republic to protect refugees and refugee camps with the support of a UN police element and liaison officers.I welcome the fact that the EU is intent on launching this operation as a matter of urgency.  We receive media reports on a daily basis about attacks on refugees and their camps.  I am especially concerned about the welfare of children in that scenario.  It is important that we deploy personnel as soon as we safely can.As has been stated previously, Ireland's participation in European Union-led peace support operations is entirely consistent with our foreign policy commitment to collective security which recognises the primary role of the UN Security Council in the maintenance of international peace and security and our tradition of support for the United Nations.  This mission can make a major contribution to peace and security in the region and the creation of a safe and secure area for refugees.I also welcome the fact that the Taoiseach and the Minister for Defence in particular have been positively disposed towards the proposed mission and have supported a positive response from the European Union to the United Nations request for assistance in this mission.  I join Members on all sides of the House in welcoming the appointment of Lieutenant General Pat Nash as operation commander of the EU force, together with up to 11 additional personnel, who will be based at the headquarters of the operation.  He is to be congratulated on his appointment and we wish him well for everybody's sake.While I support the mission and the philosophy behind it, I have concerns, which other Members have expressed, and I urge the Minister to bear these in mind.  Because the troops will be deployed to an area that is land-locked — it is 1,200 miles from the nearest port — the movement of personnel, goods, equipment and materials to the Irish camp will be a difficult task.  I urge the Minister to consider the possibility of ensuring the availability of medium-lift C130 aircraft to support this mission.  This will have a positive effect in terms of the time saved in getting to the region where the camp will be located but it can also act as a transporter which would allow personnel to have a break in service during their four-month deployment, which is currently intended to be without leave.  The Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Dermot Ahern, stated the EU force will be based in stark terrain and temperatures that can reach 45° centigrade.  We know the environment will be difficult.  I urge the Minister to consider sourcing some medium-lift aircraft and not just to rely on helicopters to support the mission.Likewise, I urge the Minister to consider the provision of communication facilities for personnel to contact their families.  I refer in particular to Internet and e-mail access.  At times this facility is supported by the Government but at other times it is not, depending on the location of deployment.  In some missions, personnel have to buy their own telephone call cards and pay for access to communications.  Given the length of the mission in this case, all efforts should be made to support overseas troops' communications with home.While the mission presents challenges, we should be proud as a nation that we have men and women in our armed forces who are willing to serve in a situation where there is great devastation and difficulty and where children are suffering greatly, especially through lack of educational facilities, in a conflict that seems to be ongoing and does not appear to be capable yet of a resolution.  I commend and support the motion before the House and I urge the Minister to address the points that have been raised by me and other speakers.
#MichaelDHiggins	unknown-#MichaelDHiggins-party	unknown-#MichaelDHiggins-dob	unknown-#MichaelDHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-28 00:00:00	Prelude	403	I welcome the opportunity to speak on this proposal.  I join others in wishing those who will represent Ireland safety, health and success in their mission.It is important that we put this decision in context.  It is a very important implementation of a shift in thinking in regard to participation at the United Nations from, for example, humanitarian intervention to humanitarian protection.  Humanitarian intervention has an old and somewhat discredited record going back to Mussolini and North Africa.  The weakness was always that those who invaded countries would sometimes justify their actions on the basis that they had made a humanitarian intervention.  The shift in thinking to humanitarian protection, which I support, has implications for classical constructions of theories of sovereignty.  We are living in a world where it is no longer sustainable to suggest that one should use the veil of sovereignty as an absolute block against the vindication of human rights.This brings me to the second point, namely, the significance of this force being authorised under a chapter VII mandate.  This is correct as it enables the force to defend itself and United Nations personnel.  Therefore, more force is attached to those who wish the participants well because it accepts the higher degree of risk, which the advice to the Minister has described as medium, and it gives one an idea of the difficulty of the situation.  For my part, I would like to think that while our people are there, there will be a better attempt at linking the discourse on human rights with their particular actions of enforcement.  There is an incredible gap in understanding in regard to the difficulties in the general region of Chad, the Central African Republic and the Darfur region of Sudan.  There have been enormous refugee problems, enormous numbers of internally displaced people and a deepening rather than a lessening of ethnic and other divisions.  Perhaps the most significant feature, which is the most tragic in the context of our contemporary history, has been the acceptance of rape and violence against women as a weapon of war and an instrument of oppression in a conflict zone.With regard to the practice of humanitarian protection, I support the new proposals that have been made, and are acquiring some global support, for a United Nations emergency peace service.  We are in a difficult time.  It is a difficulty the Irish forces do not share but there have been difficulties about Sri Lankan forces and Canadian forces, who have a very good record with regard to Somalia and so forth.  There is a need to wed together the human rights, development and peace building discourses to create the context in which forces such as this do not appear as a fire brigade, without having a theory as to how fires might be avoided.There are 40 million people in uniform in the world.  They have not prevented genocide, nor can we require them to do so.  They are, for the most part, responding to genocide and to conditions which are characterised by genocide, including the one we are discussing.  In that sense there is a necessity, with regard to humanitarian protection, to be explicit about the legitimate authority and about the real cause to which one is responding and to have the correct intention, which is the primary difference between human rights intervention and human rights protection.  It is intention that defines the content of genocide as well.It is also important that we be explicit about the human rights that are being threatened.  In 1998, a total of 120 countries committed themselves to the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court.  The task is to turn the principles to which countries have signed up into a durable and operable set of obligations.  We should use this opportunity of making our connection with this region and its difficulties as one to make other connections through our human rights or international legal perspectives and, as it were, use it as an attempt to achieve the globalisation of human rights, including their indivisibility and the universality.One should also remember the context in which our troops are going.  Chad, for example, has ratified virtually every international human rights treaty, and this is reflected in its constitution and laws.  These include the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, the Convention on the Rights of the Child and the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women.  The Minister for Foreign Affairs has met with the representative authorities in Chad and one could claim to an extent that our forces are arriving in a welcoming environment.  However, it is not that easy.  I agree there is a necessity for a Chapter VII resolution.  Chad is also a high contracting party to the Geneva Convention and has ratified all its additional protocols.The regular raids by the different forces across the borders are unacceptable.  The idea that older women must go out to gather firewood or be involved in agricultural tasks to lessen the risks for all women is indicative of the low level to which humanity has sunk.  It is important, therefore, that we recall the context in which our troops are going and not just wish them well but assist the consequences of their good action by making linkages in our human rights and development discourses and in our international politics with what they are doing.I agree with the Members on all sides of the House that it would outrageous if there were insufficient air transport.  In Darfur, for example, it is unforgivable that the African Union force did not have basic means of communication and had to be assisted by NATO.  We must ensure that the provision of logistical assistance by our European Union partners is not such as to either delay or mitigate against the effectiveness of Irish participation.  We should secure the widest possible public awareness of what UN Security Council Resolution 1778 does.  It is aimed at the security and protection of civilians, particularly refugees, internally displaced persons and civilians in danger, and the vindication of their rights.  It might be useful if the Minister explained how the European Union joint action fits with the United Nations mission.  The UN mission has a particular purpose with regard to civil society.  I hope those who would be critical will see that the Irish participation in the European Union joint action is, in fact, in support of the set of principles embodied in the UN mission.I wish the forces and the commanding officer well.  I join the congratulations to Lieutenant General Pat Nash.  It is a tribute to him and to Ireland that he has been given such a serious responsibility.  I wish all the participants every success.
#DarraghOBrien	unknown-#DarraghOBrien-party	unknown-#DarraghOBrien-dob	unknown-#DarraghOBrien-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-28 00:00:00	Prelude	404	It is an honour to speak on this important motion.  As other Deputies have said, it is of the utmost importance to Members of the House, the Irish Defence Forces and the Irish nation.  I support Deputy Behan's call that our troops, when they are abroad on prolonged missions of four months or more such as this, have the requisite means of making contact with their families and loved ones, be it via Internet access or satellite telephones.  That is important for the troops' morale in difficult circumstances.I am proud of the Defence Forces and of the role they continue to play in the protection of vulnerable groups of people throughout the world.  Our record in peacekeeping and humanitarian missions over the past 50 years is second to none.  The Irish Army and, indeed, Irish people generally are in a relatively unique position across the world in that they are seen as genuinely impartial.  Ireland is a neutral country.  This is shown in particular in the relationships our Defence Forces built up with all sides in their various missions in Lebanon.  It is a striking example of the high esteem in which our Defence Forces are held.  It is important, therefore, that we continue to play a positive role in trying to help people in difficult situations and in trying to broker peace and ensure human rights are upheld.Our Defence Forces work tirelessly for peace and justice in many trouble spots across the world.  Currently, over 330 Defence Forces personnel are stationed in 11 different missions.  Of that number, 204 are doing invaluable work in Kosovo which permitted the recent peaceful elections there.  The decision to send 400 troops to Chad was not taken lightly by the Government.  However, Ireland will not be, and never has been, found wanting when asked to assist persecuted civilians.  The situation in the Darfur region of Sudan is intolerable.  What has happened there over the past number of years is nothing short of genocide.  Thousands of people have been persecuted by militia and rebel groups and Ireland must do what it can to protect them.The main purpose of the mission is to afford much needed protection to civilians in danger, particularly the refugees from Darfur who have fled to Chad.  The mission will also facilitate the delivery of much needed humanitarian aid and help aid workers continue their important work by affording them much needed protection.  As I mentioned, Ireland will be sending approximately 400 troops on the mission — a number exceeded only by France.  Included in the 400 are 50 members of the highly trained Army Ranger wing which recently headed up the mission in Liberia.  I compliment members of the Defence Forces and the Army Ranger wing, in particular, on their successful tour in Liberia and the manner in which they conducted themselves in a very dangerous environment.Participation in such missions is only possible due to the ongoing modernisation of the force which followed publication of the White Paper on Defence in February 2000.  The modernisation programme has focused mainly on the creation of additional capacity and capability throughout the Defence Forces in order to meet new challenges such as that presented in Chad.  The programme has been successful in reallocating funds from payroll, due to the reduction in the size of our standing defence force to 10,500, and reinvesting them in equipment.  The Defence Forces have seen many positive changes in the past seven years, with increases in investment in equipment and infrastructure and continual recruitment to maintain numbers at the agreed level of 10,500.  Just as important is the reorganisation of the Reserve Defence Force and improved, enhanced and focused training for all members.  Planning of the mission in Chad is still ongoing under General Nash.  Much of the equipment being brought to Chad such as the 20 Mowag armoured vehicles and the eight special reconnaissance vehicles was purchased during the modernisation programme.  Our forces will be very well equipped.The safety of our personnel must be paramount on this mission.  With this in mind, I add to the comments of a number of other Deputies my concern about certain gaps in the force structure for this mission, particularly in respect of helicopters, tactical aircraft and medical support associated with the launch of this operation.  The Minister raised this issue at recent meetings with EU Defence Ministers and it is one we should pursue.  As Chad is a landlocked country nearly 2,000 km from the nearest port, these aircraft and helicopters are essential to the success of this mission.  As I stated, I am aware the Minister has raised this matter and I wish him well in trying to resolve it.The Government, particularly the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Dermot Ahern, has been using all available avenues to try to resolve the humanitarian and political crisis in the Darfur region of Sudan.  The Government must continue to pursue the three main objectives, one of which is to ensure humanitarian aid gets to those who need it without hindrance.  The establishment of the force in Chad should help.  Another is to put in place a truly international peacekeeping force with a strong mandate for the protection of civilians who need our help.  The long-term plan is to achieve an inclusive Darfur peace agreement that will bring lasting stability and allow refugees to return home and live safely in their own countries.The Minister has visited Darfur and impressed upon the Sudanese Government the importance of a lasting settlement and, more urgently, the need to ensure innocent civilians are no longer persecuted and given the protection they need and deserve.  As we know, the Taoiseach has raised these issues at the highest level with the UN Secretary General, President Bush and President Sarkozy.  The people are very concerned about the ongoing crisis in Darfur and support the stationing of troops in Chad to assist and protect refugees.  I know how proud they are of the important role played by the men and women of the Defence Forces in many humanitarian crises across the world.  I wish Lieutenant General Nash and the Irish contingent the very best in this mission.  They will perform their duties to the highest standard and the people will be justly proud of them.

Is cóir dúinn tacaíocht a thabhairt i gcónaí don eagras sin agus gach is féidir linn a dhéanamh chun a dhéanamh cinnte gurb é an t-eagras is foirfe é.  Mar a dúirt mé sa Teach cheana, ní tharlaíonn sin agus muid ag gabháil le grúpaí cogaíochta mar atáimid sa chás seo le grúpa cogaíochta na hEorpa.  Gearann an coincheap sin trasna ar an bhun prionsabal gur chóir go mbeadh na Náisiúin Aontaithe chun tosaigh ag coimeád síochána in áiteanna sa domhan ina bhfuil raic, cogaíocht nó géarchéim de shórt éigin ar siúl.Aithním go bhfuil géarchéim uafásach sa Sead agus go bhfuil gá le fórsa idirnáisiúnta chun tacaíocht a thabhairt dóibh siúd atá i gcruachás sa tír.  Is cóir freisin go mbeadh fórsa síochána ar an talamh sa tír sin, ach ba cheart go dtiocfadh sin go hiomlan faoi smacht na Náisiúin Aontaithe, seachas aon ghrúpa eile.  Tá an fhadhb agus an cruachás i Sead ag éirí níos measa, agus ní gá dúinn ach féachaint ar na pictiúir a tháinig ón tír sin le tamall anuas chun a fheiscint cé chomh dona agus atá sé.  Is í an fhadhb is mó a bhaineann leis na Náisiúin Aontaithe ná nach féidir cuid de na tíortha san eagras sin a choimeád faoi smacht i dtaobh cá dtéann a gcuid fórsaí.  Déantar moilleadóireacht go minic ar chinneadh tuairimí, mar shampla, cinneadh a dhéanamh gur cóir dúinn cuidiú le leithéid Sead i bhfad níos tapúla.  Is isteach san achar sin atá leithéid NATO nó grúpa cogaíochta na hEorpa tar éis sleamhnú, áit nach cóir go mbeadh siad. Ba chóir go mbeadh athraithe suntasacha déanta ag na Náisiúin Aontaithe, ionas go mbeadh siad in ann freagra níos tapúla a thabhairt ar fhadhbbanna daonra timpeall an domhain, fadhbanna a thagann chun cinn de bharr teipeanna sa chóras poiblí, mar shampla, ba chóir cinneadh a dhéanamh i dtaobh humanitarian support.  Chomh maith le sin, ba cheart dóibh déileáil le fadhbanna a bhaineann le cogaíocht i dtíortha eile.Sa chás seo, is trua liom nach bhfuil go leor eolas againn mar gheall ar an eachtra seo — an mandate atá i gceist, mar shampla, nó conas a íocfaimid as.  Cé chomh fada is a leanfaidh sé?  Cad é an toradh deireanach atá á lorg againn sa chás seo?Dar ndóigh, táimid buartha mar gheall ar an ról lárnach atá ag an bhFrainc san eachtra seo.  Cé go mbeidh Lieutenant General Patrick Nash i gceannas ar an bhfórsa, beidh sé lonnaithe i bPáras.  Beidh formhór na saighdiúrí sa fórsa seo ón bhFrainc, go bhfios dom.  Tá ról lárnach á imirt ag muintir na Fraince san Aontas Eorpach agus leanfaidh sé sin.  Ní chóir dúinn dearmad a dhéanamh go raibh an Sead mar chuid d'Impireacht na Fraince uair amháin.  Tá ceangal mór fós idir an Fhrainc agus regime Idriss Déby.  Tá tacaíocht nach beag á thabhairt ag údaráis na Fraince don regime sin, in ainneoin na ceisteanna móra atá ann maidir le taifead cearta daonna regime Déby agus an leibhéal caimiléireachta atá le sonrú sa tír sin.  Ní gá ach féachaint ar an toghchán uachtaránach a tharla i Sead anuraidh, nuair a sheas an freasúra siar — níor ghlacadar aon pháirt sa toghchán úd — de thairbhe an caimiléireacht a bhí ar siúl, ar nós cinsireacht rialtais agus neamhrialtachtaí éagsúla maidir le clárú na vótalaithe.  An bhfuil an cheart ag muintir na Fraince, chomh maith linn féin, dar ndóigh, bheith gafa chomh mór leis an Sead?  I ndeireadh thiar, is oifigeach na Fraince a bheidh i gceannas ar an dtalamh sa tír sin.Tá an-bhród orainn maidir lenár páirt sna Náisiúin Aontaithe.  Beidh sé deacair orainn an meas atá orainn timpeall an domhain, ó thaobh an seasamh neodrach atá againn sna Náisiúin Aontaithe, a chosaint de thairbhe go bhfuilimid chun ceangal a fhorbairt le grúpa cogaíochta mar seo.  Tá an cuma ann ar fud an domhain go bhfuilimid ag taobhú le iar-fórsa impireachta san Aifric.  Sa chás seo, is trua liom nach bhfuil go leor eolas againn mar gheall ar an eachtra seo — an mandate atá i gceist, mar shampla, nó conas a íocfaimid as.  Cé chomh fada is a leanfaidh sé?  Cad é an toradh deireanach atá á lorg againn sa chás seo?From participation in the EU rapid reaction force to NATO's Partnership for Peace, and now the EU battle group, Ireland is becoming increasingly associated with the fledgling EU army and the military intervention but is also committing increasing amounts of money to acquire weapons of war to facilitate this burgeoning military enterprise within the European Union.  For those reasons and ones I have aspoused here in the past, my party is opposed to Irish participation in this force and I outlined that when the first four soldiers were sent.We have consistently cautioned against the deployment of EU battle groups and we believe the increase in military missions will further boost the militarisation of the EU.  We believe battle groups serve the purpose of the EU's military and economic elites and seek to sideline the United Nation's ability to deliver on peacekeeping missions.  That is true because what we have contributed to this battle group will not be available to the UN in other fields.  There is a deliberate shift in focus from the UN to the EU and it is both dangerous and distructive.  The United Nations must be provided with the resources and political support it requires to undertake peacekeeping tasks, including rapid deployment, and ensure that it is not vying with other regional alliances attempting to duplicate its work.The EU is increasingly involved in seeking solutions to conflicts in Africa by military means and this is reflected by the increasing number of military operations.  In addition, the exploitation and pillaging of natural resources and raw materials on that continent by developed nations endanger rights as well as the political and economic future of Africa and its people, especially concerning the resources in Chad.  Many of the EU states at present involved are the ones which caused much of the underlying problems and tensions in Africa in the first place, and that has continued since the imperialist stage has ended and new imperialism has sought to exploit the natural wealth of the African nations.  That is being carried out by multinational companies based in their former colonial masters' countries such as France and Germany, and in the United States in recent times.Rather than automatically defaulting to the support of militaristic means to resolve the conflict in Darfur, the Irish Government should be demanding a review of the EU strategy for Africa with the full involvement of the African nations.  I reiterate that there is no denying that the position of the people of Chad is dire and requires urgent international peacekeeping and humanitarian support.  However, the former must be provided by the United Nations, not outsourced to the EU military force.
#SeanConnick	unknown-#SeanConnick-party	unknown-#SeanConnick-dob	unknown-#SeanConnick-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-28 00:00:00	Prelude	406	I am delighted to get the opportunity to make a contribution to the debate on the deployment of the Irish peacekeepers to Chad.  I listened to the debate as it developed throughout the day and I support my colleague, Deputy O'Rourke, in her comment that there is no such thing as a safe mission.  I have great confidence in the ability and professionalism of the Irish troops in the role they will play in ensuring that this operation will be a success.Since Ireland joined the United Nations in 1955, our peacekeeping forces have enhanced this country's reputation internationally.  We have gained a standing as a small, neutral country which has always been prepared to play its part to alleviate humanitarian suffering in many troubled parts of the world and we are now known as an honest broker which strives to build peace in a non-partisan manner.  Next year will mark the 50th anniversary of Ireland's first involvement in overseas peace support operations.  Since our soldiers were first sent on overseas duties as part of the United Nations observer group in Lebanon in 1958, we have maintained a continuous involvement in United Nations mandated peacekeeping missions.  Our soldiers have served with distinction in Africa, Asia and the Middle East and closer to home in both Cyprus and the former Yugoslavia.  However, this service to world peace has not been without a cost and, unfortunately, 85 of our servicemen paid the ultimate price to bring peace and stability to many troubled areas of the world.  We must always be mindful of their sacrifices when we are debating issues such as this.I support the Minister for Defence's proposal to continue this fine tradition of peacekeeping by involving Irish peacekeepers in the United Nations mandated peacekeeping mission to Chad.  The border regions of Chad, the Central African Republic and the Darfur area of Sudan are now one of the most volatile areas of Africa.  The United Nations has sanctioned this intervention because it regards this instability as a threat to the peace and security of the entire region.Although Irish people are familiar with the conflict and suffering in Darfur, this conflict has spilt out over international borders and the suffering involved is now seen in a number of countries.  In the eastern region of Chad where the Irish peacekeepers will be based, there are now an estimated 236,000 refugees from Sudan.  In the same region are an estimated 180,000 natives of Chad who have been driven from their homes by the conflicts in their own country.  In addition, 43,000 refugees from the Central African Republic have fled to Chad and another 20,000 to Cameroon.  The conflict in Darfur and the many other regional conflicts on the borders of Chad and the Central African Republic have destroyed the lives of hundreds of thousands and possibly up to a million innocent men, women and children.The refugee camps on the Chad-Darfur border, which are now home to up to half a million people, are rife with malnutrition and disease.  Children, in particular, are suffering serious levels of deprivation in these refugee camps and it would be remiss of us at this stage if we did not acknowledge the important role Irish Aid workers are playing in refugee camps in the region, trying to bring aid to many of those suffering.Adding to the suffering felt in the refugee camps are the ongoing campaigns of violence and harassment towards the refugees.  The camps have suffered in recent years from attacks by rebel groups based in Chad and from cross-border raids launched by the Janjaweed militia from Darfur.  These rebel groups use hit and run tactics to launch quick attacks on refugee camps and then disappear quickly.  They operate opportunistically, targeting weaker groups such as refugees and isolated local populations, but they do not appear to have the strength to engage in any form of prolonged fight with stronger forces.  The Janjaweed militia has also engaged in a scorched earth policy of burning abandoned villages and poisoning water supplies.  Tactics such as these make the resettlement of refugees far more difficult.  The ready availability of weapons has presented the problem of aid workers becoming attractive targets for kidnapping for ransom, which adds to the difficulties already faced in the refugee camps.While a ceasefire has been brokered between the Government of Chad and a number of the main rebel groups, it does not appear to be operating effectively.  The two largest rebel groups appear to be abandoning their ceasefires, with heavy fighting taking place this past weekend just 60 miles from Abéche, the town that will serve as the base for Irish military operations in Chad.The proposed involvement of Irish soldiers in peacekeeping duties in Chad is part of an EU operation under a mandate of the United Nations.  On 25 September, Resolution 1778 to establish the United Nations Mission in Chad and in the Central African Republic received the unanimous support of the UN Security Council.  The EU force is authorised to support the UN mission to carry out its objectives of protecting all civilians in danger in the region, particularly refugees and displaced persons, re-establishing human rights and the rule of law, facilitating the delivery of humanitarian aid and the free movement of aid workers by improving security and protecting UN personnel and equipment in the region.The situation in eastern Chad, Darfur and in neighbouring regions of Africa is one of the most serious humanitarian crises facing the world.  I urge all sides of the House to support this proposal to allow Ireland to continue its fine tradition of peacekeeping and humanitarian aid.  I hope that all sides recognise that the mission to Chad was established with the unanimous support of the Security Council, the first body in the triple lock process required to authorise the deployment of Irish peacekeeping forces.  As the Cabinet has approved this mission, we only require the consent of Dáil Éireann to allow members of the Defence Forces to play their part in alleviating suffering in this most impoverished of regions.If Dáil Éireann supports this proposal to allow the participation of Irish peacekeeping troops in the mission to Chad, Ireland will play a central role in the mission.  We have already been honoured by an Irishman, Lieutenant General Pat Nash, being chosen as the mission's operation commander, which is surely a recognition of the high regard in which the abilities of the men and women of the Defence Forces are held throughout the world.  If approval is given by the Dáil, Ireland will have the second largest complement of troops in the mission after France, comprising 10% of the total force.This mission will be the Defence Forces's most ambitious and demanding overseas assignment to date.  However, the significant investment the Minister has made in military equipment in recent years means this will be the best equipped Irish mission to ever go overseas.  The Irish contingent of the EU mission will be based on a mechanised infantry battalion group comprising manoeuvre elements and combat support elements.  The up-to-date equipment they will bring will include Mowag armoured vehicles, special reconnaissance vehicles and logistical vehicles, a full range of force protection assets and firing capabilities, including mortars and machine guns.  This range of modern, state-of-the-art military equipment shows the progress that has been made by the Defence Forces since our first large peacekeeping assignment in the Congo in the early 1960s.  It will certainly be our most prepared military contingent to go overseas.From a geographical point of view, Chad presents a number of challenges that will make this a logistically difficult operation.  It is several times larger than any country in western Europe and the nearest port is almost 2,000 km away.  Roads and basic infrastructure are almost non-existent and, of the country's two airstrips, only one can handle large aircraft.  This will pose considerable challenges in ensuring that our troops are adequately resourced and that they receive every piece of equipment needed to enable them to complete their mission in a safe manner.There are those who feel that, for these reasons, we should not allow Irish troops to take part in the mission, but I am reassured by the fact that the Taoiseach has already informed the Dáil that the final assigning of troops to Chad will be subject to the force commander being satisfied that these logistical problems are solved.  We should also commend the Minister for Defence for the work he undertook at the recent Council of Defence Ministers meeting to ensure these logistical issues are overcome.While this mission has been assessed as medium risk, the experience the Defence Forces received on their recent successful mission to Liberia will help to minimise the danger to our personnel.  One of the greatest challenges our troops will face will be from the local environment, but the environment in Chad is similar to that in Liberia and our soldiers will have knowledge and first-hand experience of what they will face.  Militarily, our troops will face similar opponents to those in Liberia, where the rebel groups did not have the capability to engage superior, better equipped and better trained soldiers.  Irish peacekeepers in Liberia had little engagement with the rebel groups.  French soldiers already on the ground in Chad are reporting that a similar situation exists there and that their strength and equipment is ensuring that the rebels have been unwilling to engage them to date.I urge all sides of the House to give unanimous support to this proposal.  Allowing our troops to engage in a UN mandated peacekeeping mission to Chad will not only enable us to continue our noble tradition of peacekeeping, but it will also help to bring much needed relief to some of the most deprived refugees in the world.  I wish Lieutenant General Nash and all the men and women of the Defence Forces who will serve on this mission a successful and safe deployment to Chad.
#MichaelMulcahyFF	unknown-#MichaelMulcahyFF-party	unknown-#MichaelMulcahyFF-dob	unknown-#MichaelMulcahyFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-28 00:00:00	Prelude	407	I welcome the opportunity to support this motion and to commend it to the House.  As stated by many speakers, Ireland has a long and noble tradition of foreign service overseas, almost exclusively in the service of the UN.  We have participated twice in EU-led missions in Africa.Given the difficulty and scale of this operation, it merits particular scrutiny.  In Dáil Éireann on 9 October, I had the opportunity to debate the appointment of Lieutenant General Nash to the head of the UN part of the mission, a fact of which Ireland should be proud.  There are three parts to the mission, namely, the UN, the MINURCAT and Chad police elements.  I regret that Deputy Ó Snodaigh is not present, but the tone of his comments was inappropriate.  This is not a military mission.  Rather, it is a humanitarian and security mission, the primary purpose of which is to secure the lives of innocent people, particularly the women and children in refugee camps who are under considerable threat.Chad is in central Africa, has a population of approximately 10 million, is largely desert — certainly in the north — and does not have much water.  For many years it has been riven by internal strife and life expectancy there is 42 years or 45 years depending on whether one is male or female.  The country is commonly referred to as the dead heart of Africa and no place presents more difficulties for an international force in terms of helping refugee camps and other tasks.Given the difficulties, I do not want to downplay the dedication and professionalism of the members of the Defence Forces.  I have no doubt that the operation will be planned in a thoroughly professional manner.  I am confident that Lieutenant General Nash and the Minister would not allow the mission to occur except in circumstances where all eventualities had been considered.   Nevertheless, the Minister would accept that this is by any stretch of the imagination a dangerous mission to an area in central Africa where there are many hostile groups and tribes, no water and major access problems.  I welcome the fact that the Minister addressed the last issue in his speech when he stated: "I can assure the Members of the House that there is no question of the Defence Forces deploying in-theatre without the required enablers being in place."  That is an important statement.  It is our political responsibility to ensure when military personnel are sent into the field, all necessary precautions have been taken with the necessary equipment purchased and provided.  The issue of transport for the mission has been raised.  The Minister for Defence has worked hard with his European colleagues to ensure the necessary transport equipment is procured.The motion must be supported because of the nature and depth of the suffering of so many people in the region.  We can take pride, given the wealth in this country relative to one of the poorest countries on Earth, in ameliorating their condition.  That is the challenge and the opportunity.  When all technical arrangements have been put in place, the Minister should consider going before the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women's Rights to set out in considerable detail, if necessary with the attendance of Lieutenant General Pat Nash, all transport and logistical arrangements that will be put in place before the operation starts.Troops from the Army Ranger wing will soon embark on a reconnaissance mission to Chad, which is welcome.  As the total of the mission will be approximately 4,000 personnel and given the importance of this assignment, it merits detailed scrutiny by the Oireachtas committee on defence matters.  I will write to its chairman to suggest such a meeting and that the committee undertakes a detailed evaluation of these technical points.There was some criticism that this is not a UN mission.  This must be scotched as it is one, acted on an agency basis by the EU.  If, for example, a similar situation arose in south America, some North American and South American countries would be used on an agency basis by the UN.  It is wrong of some Members to suggest this is an EU battle group that takes away from our neutrality.  Any Member who claims this is open to a charge of misleading the House.  This is a UN-sponsored and approved mission.  The only difference is that the Exchequer will foot the bill for this mission whereas under pure UN missions the Army is reimbursed by the UN.Most Members will agree that Ireland will only participate in missions that have UN approval.  It is a cornerstone of our foreign policy.  I see nothing in this mission that deviates one scintilla from that core principle.  The Minister knows that many backbenchers would be reluctant to give approval to any such mission were it not UN approved.Ireland can be proud of its contribution to the developing world.  Our foreign aid budget stands at €800 million.  We will meet the 0.7% target of GDP for foreign aid in 2012, which will amount to €1.3 billion.  While this may seem a large amount, it is the UN target.  I hope there is cross-party support in arriving at and maintaining this target as there is much poverty and suffering in the world.  There is an obligation on the developed world to deepen its commitment to the developing world.It must also be underlined that Irish foreign aid is not tied as it is with many other countries.  Many other countries insist that as part of their aid programmes, their domestic products must be purchased.  The value of those products is also included in the calculation of aid given.  Irish foreign aid is free, unfettered and generously given.I pay tribute to those military personnel who will shortly embark on a reconnaissance mission to Chad.  I pay tribute in advance to those brave men and women of the Defence Forces who will risk their lives by going on this mission.I will only be satisfied about this mission when those important issues raised in the Minister's speech have been signed off.  The best way to achieve this is by addressing the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women's Rights.
#ChrisAndrews	unknown-#ChrisAndrews-party	unknown-#ChrisAndrews-dob	unknown-#ChrisAndrews-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-28 00:00:00	Prelude	408	In October I welcomed the nomination of Lieutenant General Pat Nash to head up the EU-led UN force in Chad and the Central African Republic.  Today, the Dáil will complete approval of the EU force within the special triple lock mechanism, with Cabinet and UN approval already secured.During the debate on the motion in October, the House heard an array of statistics on Chad and its neighbour, the Central African Republic.  Chad suffers from severe economic challenges and low life expectancy rates.  For instance, it is unlikely Deputy Mulcahy or I would be alive if we were in a similar forum in Chad.  It is in an extremely tense geopolitical and security situation.Since the first motion was moved, I was a member of a Council of Europe election observation mission to Kosovo for the parliamentary elections held on 17 November and I witnessed at first hand the incredible work being carried out by the Army.  I met Brigadier General Gerry Hegarty, commander of the KFOR multinational task force centre, a military regional area that includes the capital, Pristina.That the Army was the first to take command of this area indicates the high regard in which Irish troops are held.  They have long experience in peacekeeping missions, a fact recognised by other nations.  I was proud of each Irish soldier in Kosovo, seeing how professional and efficient they are.  They act as ambassadors for our country, contributing directly to improving the lives of many in what is a very difficult political situation on Europe's doorstep.Captain Deirdre O'Rourke of the bomb disposal unit gave the mission a briefing on the dangers of unexploded mortars and landmines.  The mission was impressed with her knowledge and experience.Witnessing the work of an overseas peacekeeping mission highlighted to me the importance of increasing civil and military co-operation.  In many cases, the army is the first point of contact between the local populations and the international community.  Armies have invaluable on-the-ground knowledge of local terrains and cultures.  Often they have higher capabilities and resources than other agencies.While the Army's core competency may not be deemed to be the so-called softer side of peacekeeping, such as institution-building, building schools and working to improve local economies, it is experienced in this kind of work and is well placed to do more of it.It does not want to, nor should it, dramatically increase its humanitarian role in these regions.  The amount of funding it receives for development should be substantially increased.  Will the Minister ask Irish Aid, which does much invaluable work overseas, to strengthen its relationship with the Army?  The Finnish army in Kosovo has much more funding for community development programmes than the Irish Army.  This engenders a certain amount of goodwill for the Army which will be the first point of contact before many of the NGOs so we should consider it seriously and give more money to the Army in Chad.  Irish Aid should identify community projects there on which the Army could work with the NGOs with increased funding.  Irish Aid and the NGOs working on their behalf would benefit from the goodwill created by the Army because this will ensure a better outcome in countries which have not had the advantage of developing as quickly as we have.  The Army operates efficiently in a structured way when it delivers aid and works with communities, ensuring value for money, which is important.The political situation in Kosovo is tense as 10 December looms but I support the despatch of Irish forces working to improve the stability and future of such areas because it stabilises them.  It has worked in Kosovo and will work in Chad.  As a wealthy nation we have a responsibility to be involved in missions such as this one.The mission to Chad is dangerous because heavy fighting was reported last week between the Chadian army and rebel forces.  French participation in this mission is fraught with danger and creates difficulties, of which the Minister is aware but it has benefits too and we should not get bogged down in the difficulties.  Logistical difficulties must be resolved and the Minister has been active in this work.  Chad is bigger than the UK, Spain, France and Germany put together so it is vital that the troops have sufficient resources.  This should not, however, deflect from Irish commitment to the peacekeeping force.  The Irish role includes the establishment of a safe and secure environment that will facilitate the delivery of humanitarian aid and will enable humanitarian staff to carry out their work.  I support the despatch of Irish Defence Forces on this mission and wish them every success under the able leadership of Lieutenant General Pat Nash.
#PeterKellyFF	unknown-#PeterKellyFF-party	unknown-#PeterKellyFF-dob	unknown-#PeterKellyFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-28 00:00:00	Prelude	409	Since 2004 eastern Chad has hosted some 240,000 Sudanese refugees, who have fled the fighting in Darfur, in 12 camps.  In addition, Chad faces a surge in the number of internally displaced persons now totalling more than 170,000.  These people have fled attacks, widespread banditry and criminality, and clashes between rebel and government forces on both sides of the porous Chad-Sudan border.I undertook some research on the region for this debate.  This underlined how diverse the region is and the complexity of its surroundings.  Chad is bordered by Libya to the north, Sudan to the east, the Central African Republic to the south, Cameroon and Nigeria to the south west, and Niger to the west.  Due to its distance from the sea and its largely desert climate, the country is sometimes referred to as the "dead heart of Africa".  Chad is divided into three major geographical regions — a desert zone in the north, an arid Sahelian belt in the centre and a more fertile Sudanese savanna zone in the south.  Lake Chad, after which the country is named, is the largest wetland in Chad and the second largest in Africa.  Chad is home to more than 200 different ethnic and linguistic groups making it a cultural melting pot.  French and Arabic are the official languages.  Islam is the most widely practised religion.At times in our relatively homogeneous society we forget how diverse other countries can be.  Chad is divided into 18 regions.  This system came about in 2003 as part of the decentralisation process, when the government abolished the previous 14 prefectures.  Each region is headed by a presidentially appointed governor.  Prefects administer the 50 departments within the regions.  The departments are divided into 200 sub-prefectures, which are in turn composed of 446 cantons.  The constitution provides for decentralised government to compel local populations to play an active role in their own development.  To this end, the constitution declares that each administrative subdivision be governed by elected local assemblies.In response to the serious situation in Chad, the UN Security Council adopted a resolution authorising the establishment of a multidimensional mission to provide security and protection for refugees and the displaced, allowing for refugee facilities to return and facilitate humanitarian assistance and Chad and the Central African Republic.  The multidimensional presence is mandated to contribute to a more secure environment through monitoring, promotion and protection of human rights and to support efforts to strengthen the capacity of the Central African Republic and the Chadian Governments in meeting international human rights standards.  A specific police training element totalling more than 300 personnel will form part of the mission.Ireland's expected role in the UN mandated EUFORCHAD-RCA mission is welcome.  It reaffirms our commitment to humanitarian concerns as the Government plans to increase support for humanitarian and recovery activity in Chad.  The recent visit of the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Dermot Ahern, to Chad, during which he visited several camps for internally displaced persons and refugees and met local government and UN representatives, gives us an insight into the seriousness of the situation in the region.  We will have an important role to play in this matter because the fragmentation of rebel groups, growing tensions in camps for internally displaced persons and banditry in the countryside are making the tasks facing peace negotiators and humanitarian agencies increasingly difficult.  Nobody in the House should doubt that this is a most dangerous mission for our troops.Since 2002 the stability of Chad has been threatened by armed rebellion arising from clashes between ethnic militia and government forces, incursions by Janjaweed from Sudan and clashes between Arabs and non-Arabs within Chad.  The EU military mission to Chad and the Central African Republic, entitled EUFOR TCHAD/RCA, was authorised by a joint action of the Council of the European Union on 15 October.  In accordance with the mandate set out in United Nations Security Council Resolution 1778 of 25 September, the joint action included the appointment of Lieutenant General Pat Nash of the Defence Forces as operation commander.  I congratulate him on his appointment and wish him well on his mission.Last week the Government authorised the Minister for Defence to arrange, subject to Dáil approval, the despatch of a contingent of up to 14 members of the Defence Forces for services with the EUFOR TCHAD/RCA, making Ireland the second largest contributor to this mission, a fact of which we should be proud.Lieutenant General Nash, as operation commander, has had primary responsibility for the force generation process, which aims to ensure the mission has the capacity to undertake the tasks envisaged for it by the United Nations.  Those tasks are to protect civilians in danger, particularly refugees and displaced persons, to facilitate the delivery of humanitarian aid and to protect UN personnel.  Ireland fully supports the deployment of EUFOR TCHAD/RCA as a means to address the serious security and humanitarian situation in both eastern Chad and north-eastern Central African Republic, in addition to the broader regional dimensions arising from the Darfur crisis.  This will undoubtedly be a challenging matter that should contribute equally to improving overall security and respect for human rights in this fragile region.It is a difficult mission because Chad is an enormous country that is larger than the UK, Spain, France and Germany combined.  Ireland has an established record for providing humanitarian assistance to the people of the Central African Republic and since 2006 Irish Aid has provided over €3.8 million in support of UN agencies.  The missions that our troops undertake should not go unappreciated and we must remember that our troops are partaking in missions all over the world seeking to restore and maintain peace in volatile regions.We celebrated the turning on of the Christmas lights today in Leinster House and at this time of year we should remember our troops serving abroad who will be unable to spend Christmas with their families.  I wish to acknowledge the contribution of the troops from Sean Connolly Barracks, Longford, in my own constituency, in the service of the State and long may it continue.  Sean Connolly Barracks is the heart and soul of Longford and its members, past and present, are involved in all aspects of life in County Longford including charity, sports and culture.  The Army touches everything good in our community.I thank the Minister for Defence, Deputy Willie O'Dea, for his great work in the interest of the nation.  This mission will involve risks but such is the humanitarian crisis in the region that we cannot stand idly by.  I support the mission because it is grounded in basic human values and I wish all taking part in it well.  I trust they will have the support and best wishes of the Irish people.
#FinianMcGrath	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-party	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-dob	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-28 00:00:00	Prelude	410	I thank the Ceann Comhairle for the opportunity to address the House on this important debate, which deals with the despatch of our Defence Forces to Chad.  I wish our troops well and a safe mission.This mission is very important and, as has been clear in the media, Chad is an extremely dangerous place to go.  I am confident that our soldiers will act in an independent and professional manner.  I wish to take this opportunity to commend the work done by our troops, particularly the United Nations forces, in the past 30 or 40 years in places such as Liberia and the Middle East.  Irish soldiers have died on these peacekeeping missions but they served international peace and their country well.  I stress that they gave their lives for peace and always retained their independence and integrity and this is something we should keep in mind during this important debate.We all have concerns relating to this mission but it has a UN mandate and is being commanded by Lieutenant General Pat Nash.  We are sending 400 troops and the total group will consist of 4,000 troops.  It is important that UN peacekeeping missions remain part of Irish foreign policy.  Last week concerns were expressed relating to the availability of aircraft needed to transport troops in the regions and the availability of medical teams for the mission.  These issues are being addressed at the moment and are close to being resolved because it is important that before we send troops into such a situation the necessary preparations have been made and that medical backup is available.  I wish Lieutenant General Pat Nash the best and hope he is satisfied that the proper precautions will be in place for our soldiers.We must understand, however, that the 400 Irish troops and their UN colleagues are being deployed to assist with the delivery of humanitarian aid and the protection of displaced persons and not to take sides in any conflict.  The key to this debate is understanding the purpose of the mission as I outlined because hostilities in Chad are an internal matter.  Ireland is expected to commit approximately €60 million to the year-long mission and, while this is a huge expense of which we must be conscious, it is money spent on a decent cause.  As Members of the Oireachtas we must ensure we account for money spent on these missions because in many other countries money that could often be spent in other areas such as health and education is squandered on military weaponry.  It is important that we are open and honest about this during the debate.When one examines the details of this conflict one learns there are now more than 180,000 people from Chad internally displaced and 236,000 Sudanese refugees in camps in eastern Chad.  Approximatelly 170,000 people have been forced to flee their homes since September 2005 and more than 43,000 refugees from the Central African Republic are in Chad.  Some 20,000 people are believed to have fled to Cameroon.  Malnutrition has reached alarming levels, particularly among children, and the nightmare that is war is evident throughout the region.  Once again families are suffering — men, women and children, the vast majority of whom are innocent victims.Given the massive wealth and resources available to us in the West, it is unacceptable that we cannot feed and care for children in Africa and other areas.  Some 400 of our troops will take part in this humanitarian mission and it is important that we give them our maximum support.  No child should suffer from malnutrition, and that should be the focus for all of us.It is important that we set out our stall in terms of our role in the United Nations and our vision for the future of our foreign policy.  I have a clear vision of the role of Irish troops in UN missions.  It is within the OSCE and a reformed UN, rather than the EU, that Ireland should pursue its security concerns.  We should pursue a policy of positive neutrality and independent foreign policy and avoid joining or forming an association with NATO or any other military alliance.  I am strongly of the view that Ireland should seek to promote European and international security through a policy of disarmament and demilitarisation and should therefore oppose all instances of militarisation, particularly within the EU.  Ireland should refuse to co-operate with or condone decisions, policies or military groupings that maintain nuclear weapons or any weapons of mass destruction.  Irish troops should only serve abroad as peacekeepers under the auspices of the UN.These are the elements of my view on foreign policy and I ask that they be considered as part of today's debate.  Other political parties and individuals have another vision, with which I strongly disagree.  It is important that we focus on the purpose of this discussion, which is peacekeeping in the region and assisting those at risk.  It is a question of protecting people's lives and facilitating humanitarian aid.  I am convinced from listening to Army members, particularly soldiers in my constituency and family members, that they wish to implement a strong, humanitarian and independent foreign policy position on these types of missions.  They have shown this before in areas such as the Middle East, where they were respected by all communities and where some paid with their lives.  Irish troops built relationships with communities in conflict situations.  That is the way forward for the Army and for the UN.  I urge the Government to take these views on board.  This is my clear policy position and these are my political objectives.This mission is dangerous but it is important that there are cool and calm heads.  The Army's experience in Liberia and the Middle East, and even as far back as the Congo, allowed our troops, through difficult circumstances, to gain significant experience of conflict situations.  For a small country, we have made a significant impact on the international stage.  The experience, training and leadership offered by these 400 troops will be significant.Many of us are in favour of radical reform of the UN.  Some of the criticism to which it has been subjected is valid.  We in Ireland must be more proactive, and so must the UN.  There are many good people involved in that organisation and countries like Ireland with sensible foreign policies.  We must, however, bring the larger nations with us.  Some of this work has commenced but it must become a priority.  Like many of my colleagues, I am of the view that the priority must always be peacekeeping and humanitarian endeavour.  We must be more proactive within the UN in regard to conflict resolution.We can learn from our own experiences abroad, whether in the Middle East, Liberia or the Congo.  We can also learn from the experience of some 30 years of conflict on this island, which resulted in more than 3,000 deaths.  We have no need to hide behind the door when it comes to assisting other countries.  I welcome the establishment by the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Dermot Ahern, of the conflict resolution unit.  This is an issue on which I focussed in the talks leading to my agreement with the Taoiseach.  This unit could make a major contribution to the development of sensible foreign policy and to assisting in the resolution of foreign conflicts.  We should not be ashamed to use our own experience of the peace process.On 25 September, the United Nations Security Council unanimously adopted Resolution No. 1778 establishing the UN mission in Chad and the Central African Republic.  This will strengthen security in the region.  Above all, I am hopeful that it will save lives.  Since 2004, eastern Chad has hosted, in 12 different camps, some 240,000 Sudanese refugees who fled the fighting in Darfur.  I wish our troops well in this important mission.  I hope they will all be safe and I commend them on their valuable work.
#BernardJDurkan	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-party	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-dob	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-28 00:00:00	Prelude	411	I am glad to have an opportunity to speak on this issue.  We all extend our good wishes to the Irish troops travelling abroad on the mission to Chad.  They will, as always, serve us in the proud tradition of service they have established since the 1960s.  Irish troops have carved out their own niche as international peacekeepers.  They do not quibble about the service they give, for which we owe them a great debt of gratitude.  They go where they are sent and do so without demur.  They have done us proud over the years.However, I am not certain whether the force being sent to Chad is sufficiently strong.  The small pocket battleship type of force is fine, but in a large territory with major problems, as is the case in Chad, a larger force is preferable.  I have attempted for years to promote the notion of increasing the strength of the Defence Forces to allow for overseas deployment without depleting the force at home.  If I were a member of the Defence Forces, I would like to see strength in numbers as troops are sent further afield.  That would be reassuring for the troops themselves and would also be important in conveying the peacekeeping message in the location to which they are sent.  If an opposing force or army sees that a peacekeeping force is particularly small, it may have a particular attitude to it.  It is important that the force is sufficiently strong.The next important consideration is that the troops be adequately equipped both for the climate and for the types of life-threatening situations that can and will arise.  We have learned much from past experiences and that will stand the troops in good stead.  From what we can glean from the replies to parliamentary questions, I understand the force will be well equipped.I have observed in the past that Irish troops often rely to a great extent on supply and transport to other forces that may be engaged in peacekeeping alongside our particular deployments.  I am not convinced this is a positive arrangement.  It is preferable that our troops be self-sufficient in such circumstances.  In the course of a debate many years ago about how far back Archbishop McHale could trace his lineage, somebody made the cynical suggestion that he must have been in the Ark.  To this the Archbishop responded that the McHales had a boat of their own.   It is essential that in future we develop our supply of transport — helicopters, in particular, for those kinds of missions.  I say this without discussing the matter with the military establishment in my constituency or elsewhere.  We should consider this in future as a major capital investment, given that our Defence Forces are likely to be deployed in these and other similar circumstances.I do not agree with my colleague on the other side, the Government backbencher, Deputy Finian McGrath.

#BernardJDurkan	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-party	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-dob	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-28 00:00:00	Prelude	413	I do not agree with him on the restrictions he seeks to place on our Defence Forces.  Our Defence Forces must be and are prepared to engage in whatever conflict arises.  They have shown strength and determination to do that very effectively in the past, and I have no doubt they will do it in future.The European battle groups, which have been referred to with disdain in some quarters, are an area in which we, as good upright members of the European Union, will be expected to contribute.  I see nothing wrong with that as our Defence Forces are supportive of the notion.  They wish to involve themselves in training and security enforcement which may be necessary in certain circumstances.  We do not always call it peacekeeping and this will emerge to a far greater extent in the future than we have seen in the past.I have listened to the Minister in the past and I know he takes issues as they come.  Sometimes it is very difficult to understand what he has in mind for the future but we are at one on this matter.This in no way infringes on our neutrality as it is a commitment by the Irish Defence Forces, in the context of the European Union and in keeping with the triple lock mechanism, to ensure we are seen to be making a worthwhile contribution to European defence and security.  That is part and parcel of membership of the European Union and we cannot walk away, pretending we have no responsibility in the area.Today we had a delegation before the Joint Committee on European Affairs from the Serbian Parliament, which was led by a senior member.  It is sad to think of the events which occurred within the European Continent in the past 14 or 15 years.  One shudders when visiting the Balkans and seeing that strife was so violent, the cemeteries are full to the gates.  The only difference between the sides is that on one hand the people are Christians and on the other they are Muslim.  It does not make any real difference as they all died.  These people died on our doorstep, as the European Union at that time had the strength but not the will to deal with the matter.  That is something we must consider in future in the context of peace enforcement by the European Union groups.  I have no doubt they will be called upon.As others have stated, the role in Chad could be quite difficult.  It is not any more difficult than some of the tasks which have come the way of the Defence Forces in the past and I have no doubt they will be well capable of handling it.  We must realise it could be a different scenario from some of the other matters we have dealt with in the past.  For that reason I have mentioned the possibility of increasing the strength of the contingent.  Such an option, along with ensuring adequate supply and transport facilities are made available, could ensure the Defence Forces become self-sufficient.  Self-sufficiency is very important in this type of action.Some weeks ago I was watching a television programme late one night which showed that in an African country not so long ago, a protracted outbreak of violence took place as a result of which some 500,000 people were killed.  This occurred mainly because nobody was there to intervene.  An outside authority intervened but to no avail.  No outside body was in a position to intervene to act as a buffer in the conflict taking place.  As time goes on the developed world is expected to contribute to such situations in a positive manner, which this deployment will do.  I have received answers to various parliamentary questions but I believe there is a case to be made for increasing the strength of the Defence Forces, as well as the scale and extent of their commitment and hardware in view of the extra responsibilities thrust upon them.

Tréaslaím leis an Aire Cosanta, an Roinn Cosanta agus an Airm uilig as ucht an seirbhís iontach náisiúnta agus idirnáisiúnta atá curtha ar fáil acu ar feadh na blianta fada.It is a great pleasure for me to support this motion and I commend the Minister for Defence on the leadership he has given in military matters in this country and the key role he plays.  Anybody considering our Constitution would acknowledge the very critical importance of the Minister for Defence in that Constitution, reporting directly to the President of our country, the Supreme Commander of our Defence Forces.This motion coming before us this evening demonstrates the importance of this Parliament, our democracy and our neutrality.  Every decision taken on external military matters is brought before Parliament, including the appointment of General Nash as force commander of the group going to Chad.  The matter was debated in the House and passed unanimously.  We are returning to discuss the motion before us.This motion is the second element of the triple lock mechanism, made up of a Government decision, ratification by the Dáil and the initial UN request.  These are all being fulfilled here on behalf of Parliament through its elected Members by the Minister for Defence.  I salute him and his colleagues for their outstanding work, both in the Department of Defence and in all of our military operations across the country.  They have brought significant success and great honour to this island over the years.I have a very special interest in defence matters, going back to my election to this House in 1982 and subsequent to that my first appointment as a shadow Minister for Defence in 1983, a position I held for four and a half years.  I had a very good relationship with the then Minister for Defence, Mr. Patrick Cooney.  We had a common understanding and he gave me a significant opportunity to partner with him on many occasions in many of the military activities which took place around the country.  I value that experience.My brother-in-law recently retired as an officer of the Irish Army, so I have a personal interest in these matters.  In particular, I remember my primary school days in 1962, when we deployed our first force to the Congo.  We lost a number of great people there, one of whom was a family friend.  Those people gave their lives on behalf of Ireland in the cause of world peace.That has happened on a number of occasions, with different missions throughout the world.  On at least two occasions I have had the opportunity to visit our forces in Cyprus and in Bosnia.  I have also met members of the Garda Síochána, who are partnering with the Army on United Nations duty there.  Like all public servants who serve our country with such distinction, both nationally and internationally, the contribution made by the Garda Síochána and the Army in international fields, dark and difficult places far from home in the cause of world peace, has been absolutely phenomenal.  It has brought great distinction to our country.One can look at the success of the Army in every facet of its activity, be it military or extra-curricular action in equestrian or other sports.  We can see how the Army has been a role model for the people of Ireland and the youth of our country.  Today I salute all members of the Army, past and present, one of whom at least who has had a distinguished career in the Army is here tonight.  I pay tribute to him and all other members of the Defence Forces who have served in Parliament during the years.

#NoelTracey	unknown-#NoelTracey-party	unknown-#NoelTracey-dob	unknown-#NoelTracey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-28 00:00:00	Prelude	416	They have made a major contribution in bringing their expertise and professionalism to Members of the House like me who have not had the privilege of wearing the uniform on behalf of the country, even though that would have been our desire.This force which will be made up of approximately 400 Irish members will equate to approximately 12% of the entire force on this small island.  It is critical that we continually serve international peace and give an opportunity to members of the Defence Forces to serve the country across the world, taking into account the exigencies, risks and challenges to be faced and the criteria to be met in what in most cases are dangerous missions.  They have carried their responsibilities with great distinction, regardless of their location or the challenges facing them.  Anybody who has had an opportunity to visit different parts of the world where members of the Defence Forces have served with such distinction will know at first hand from citizens of those countries of the even-handed, humane and dignified way they have conducted themselves, the integrity they have brought to their job and the respect they have earned, both from those who were part of a conflict and ordinary citizens who wanted to live in peace.In my former position as Minister of State with responsibility for European affairs I had the opportunity to discuss the situation in Chad, Sudan and the surrounding area on a number of occasions in the past three years at various European meetings.  There has been a constant demand that the elected politicians of Europe give leadership and make a positive contribution to bring stability, human rights, dignity, protection and opportunity to these unfortunate peoples.  It is tragic that so many displaced people, particularly women and children, have found themselves in this desperate situation.  It is important that the House give full and unequivocal support to the motion in order that we can be seen as a nation to make a key decision in 2007, again enhancing our reputation as a country that makes such a major contribution to the achievement of peace across the world.Alongside this, we have our contribution to overseas aid.  The overseas development unit of the Department of Foreign Affairs has done great work.  I salute the Minister of State, Deputy Michael Kitt, on the work he is continuing, carrying on from his predecessors, in a very important area.I am delighted that a large part of the composition of the force will come from the Western Command.  I am proud to come from a Gaeltacht county.  While the Western Command headquarters is based in Athlone, the only Gaeltacht operation and Irish language-speaking unit in the force is based at Dún Uí Mhaoilíosa in Renmore in the suburbs of Galway city.  It is named after Liam Mellowes, one of our great patriots.  I salute all those involved in Dún Uí Mhaoilíosa, as well as in Custume Barracks in Athlone and the different parts of the Western Command functional area for their contribution during the years, with their colleagues in all other command areas.This experience which is critical for us as a nation is vital for the development of the Army.  We have some of the best and brightest in the Defence Forces.  In one of my former offices, as Minister of State with responsibility for science and technology, when we did our utmost to drive the science agenda and ensure we would build an economy that would embrace opportunities for our brightest and best, we looked at the resources of State in Departments and agencies.  Among the best supporters we had were the members of the Defence Forces.  At many science weeks and science exhibitions we were able to have outstanding large displays of both——

One of the requests made was for Ireland to play a major role in Chad.  I provided full assurance on behalf of my parliamentary colleagues that the Minister for Defence on behalf of Ireland was doing his utmost to ensure we could expedite our contribution as rapidly as possible.  I salute the Minister and his colleagues.  I am proud to be a Member of this House where democracy prevails and we have the final say on where our military men and women should go in the cause of international peace and justice.

It was very enlightening listening to Deputy Treacy.  In my time in the Army I remember that Tynagh Mines was a black spot for a person serving in the military.  We had to carry out an unthankful duty in that area out beyond Loughrea.  I wish the troops of the Western Command and the Army Ranger Wing in the initial stages the very best of luck on this mission.The motion has been tabled as a result of UN Resolution 1778.  Many have expressed concern that this is a mission to a very remote area with an assessment of medium danger.  I would be concerned that from the international community's point of view there may be a certain degree of appeasement because we cannot do anything in Darfur or Sudan because the Sudanese Government does not want troops other than African Union troops and that this is the next best thing.  While I suppose it is better than doing nothing, we need to consider how the international community is hamstrung from the point of view of assisting in Sudan where many tens of thousands are dying.Many contributors have spoken about the logistical difficulties of the mission which certainly will be difficult.  It will be difficult to identify the various factions on the ground.  People change sides regularly; it is not like here in Ireland where if one had a group of Kerrymen coming at one, one would identify them quickly.

I am a strong opponent of it for the following reason.  In Kosovo we have made a great contribution in a few short years.  Depending on how things go there in next few weeks, it is possible that our role could be made redundant as the UN resolution may become null and void.  I do not know whether the Minister has sought legal advice on the matter.  We could be left with a situation where nothing will have changed on the ground other than the Kosovars might make a unilateral declaration of independence.  Our force could end up being there illegally and we could be forced to withdraw from Kosovo which, in purely pragmatic and practical terms, would be very difficult to explain to the international community and ourselves.I appreciate the work the United Nations does.  However, as I have mentioned in the House before on occasion, we use the concept of the United Nations as a comfort blanket.  We are mature enough as a state to be able to make our own decisions.  If the situation evolves, I would deeply regret having to cease our involvement with KFOR owing to the difficulty regarding the triple lock arrangement which was inserted as the Seville declaration on the Nice treaty.  I am not certain what the substance of that declaration is.I ask the Minister to address the following issue.  Where would we stand if difficulties were to arise and we needed the assistance of NATO to move into or out of the area?  I am not advocating that we join NATO, as people sometimes believe.  It was something of which the former Deputy, Gay Mitchell MEP, was accused on occasion.  While I am not advocating it, I certainly see no difficulty in seeking assistance from it.  What will happen if the only mechanism available to us if we are to ensure the safety of our troops in this region is to avail of NATO resources?Like Deputy Treacy, I got a briefing from the UN on the situation in Chad a couple of weeks ago.  Having listened to a French officer who went to Chad on a reconnaissance mission, my initial doubts about the safety and security of this mission have been assuaged.  I accept that one can never predict what will ultimately happen in a volatile area.  I am satisfied that the mission will have enough resources to protect itself and that it will be secure.  I am not sure about the long-term future of the mission and the ultimate success or otherwise of this endeavour.  Given that there are several hundred refugees in this region, it is important for the EU troops to build good relations with the locals and gain their trust.That Chad was a French colony for a long time is advantageous in the sense that the French authorities know the lie of the land, but disadvantageous in the sense that colonial powers can bring baggage with them.  Can the Minister give us more details about the case of a group of children who were being moved from Chad to France?  This matter received a great deal of publicity a few weeks ago.  I am not sure whether the Minister addressed this subject in his speech, as I did not go through it in detail.  I understand that French diplomats intervened to ensure that many of those involved were allowed to return to France.  What is the current situation in that case?  I understand that it might not have been a once-off occurrence — it might have been happening on a regular basis.  I would like some more information because it is important to have such details if we are to prevent the exploitation of vulnerable communities by people from other countries.  A force that comes to such a society without any baggage can suffer if a difficult environment has been created by the sins of its predecessors.It is important that this mission should have a clear role.  I am sure Lieutenant General Patrick Nash, who is very professional, and his staff will ensure that is the case.  Our troops need to have the ability to deal with the difficulties they will encounter in Chad, such as the physical infrastructure there.  I appreciate the difficulties which will be encountered within families when members of the Defence Forces leave for Africa at the start of December, just before Christmas.  I wish them well.It is easy for societies, nations and international communities to talk about intervention and the provision of assistance.  It can be much more difficult to undertake the practical tasks which are involved in making peace.  Deputies will be aware of the problems associated with trying to resolve local conflicts in our constituencies.  I refer to street fights and tensions between families, for example.  The difficulties associated with making a difference at international level are obvious, therefore.It is important that we acknowledge the role played by peacekeepers in the past.  Many Irish families have lost loved ones on UN missions.  As I have said to the Minister and his predecessor on many occasions, we need to provide for the upkeep of the monuments which have been erected in many countries where Irish people have unfortunately been killed.  Irish troops are no longer present in south Lebanon, for example, but memorabilia commemorating those who died there are still in existence.  We should find a way of ensuring that these memorials are maintained.I will conclude by speaking about the slightly related issue of the many Irish servicemen who fought overseas in the First and Second World Wars.  We are often unaware that people from our own communities died in such conflicts.  While those who went abroad and gave their lives in the world wars for what they saw as the freedom of small nations have been officially recognised in recent times — we have come a long way in the last few years — the time has come to try to remember them in their own communities, where they have been forgotten in many instances.  We should do something to remember such people.I support the motion before the House and I wish the force well.

It was full of excellent information.  Those of us who heard the interview will be aware that just as it was ending, the Minister spoke about the case of Robert Tobin and Michelle Mahon, whose housing difficulties have been the subject of a great deal of publicity over the last couple of days.  I appreciate that this does not pertain to the motion before the House.  I was not aware that Mr. Tobin and Ms Mahon were Army people.  The Minister showed a great deal of care by offering to assist them, as Mr. Tobin said when he spoke on "Morning Ireland" subsequently.  I was glad to read in today's Evening Herald that progress has been made in this case with the co-operation of the Law Society and the Ulster Bank.  In fairness to the Minister, he went out of his way in his handling of the issue this morning.  I applaud his work in this case.  I am glad that some progress has been made.I have listened carefully to the speeches which have been made throughout today's debate.  I cannot claim, as Deputies Kelly and O'Rourke did, that there is an Army barracks in my constituency.  The Minister, Deputy O'Dea, is aware that I have taken an interest in defence matters over recent times.  Many serving Defence Forces personnel come from my constituency.  Like other Deputies, I sincerely applaud the efforts made by the Army and the rest of the Defence Forces over a long period of time.  I wish our troops well as they prepare to go to Chad.Like some previous speakers, I come from a generation that remembers the funeral services in Dublin of our heroes who were killed in the Congo.  I was quite young at the time and had not yet left school.  Members may recall that children were given a day off school.  I went to the funerals, which were very sad.  I am sometimes unable to remember things which happened yesterday, but I often recall clearly details of things which took place a long time ago.  That episode in Irish history — a number of the Irish soldiers who went abroad in 1962 to do a job that needed to be done lost their lives in Africa — left a lasting impression on me.  Some aspects of that sad episode were unresolved for over 40 years.  It was another example of the kind of heroism Irish people have shown on many occasions over the years, including on other missions.  It is important, therefore, to wish the men and women who will represent Ireland on this occasion well.It is important to put this discussion in context.  It is difficult to say something new during a long debate like this, as many Deputies have spoken already today.  In September of this year, the UN Security Council authorised a resolution establishing a multidimensional UN mission in Chad and the Central African Republic.  We have been told that the mission will help to strengthen security in that region.  I understand that the mission's comprehensive mandate focuses, as it should, on the security and protection of civilians who are in danger, particularly internally displaced refugees; human rights; and, the rule of law in east Chad and north-east Central African Republic.  This EU military mission is authorised, under chapter 7 of the UN charter, to support the UN and take all necessary measures within its capabilities and its area of operation to fulfil its mandate.I share an interest in Africa with the Leas-Cheann Comhairle — both of us are members of the Association of European Parliamentarians for Africa.  Since 2004, eastern Chad has hosted approximately 240,000 Sudanese refugees, who have fled the fighting in Darfur, in 12 camps.  I understand that Chad is facing a surge in the number of refugees.  The authorities in Chad and the Central African Republic have welcomed the possible EU military presence in their respective countries.  I understand that the Chad mission will complement the planned United Nations-African Union hybrid mission, which is to be launched by the UN in Darfur and elsewhere in Sudan, by limiting the potential for the Sudanese conflict to spill over into this region.I attended my first meeting of the British-Irish Interparliamentary Body in recent days.  I was happy to get that assignment, as it was something I wanted to do.  They gave me a tie which I decided to wear today since we were discussing the mission to Chad.  I was appointed as a member, with other colleagues on one of the sub-committees dealing with European affairs and European defence issues under the chairmanship of a Conservative MP, Mr. Robert Walker.  We discussed missions of this sort and great interest was expressed in what Ireland was doing.  It is good to see the reputation of this country flying high.  There was a time when there was a different atmosphere between Irish and English politicians.  I am glad to say I am not from that generation.  There is now an understanding between nations.  I have the impression that the reputation of Ireland is gaining and that this mission is welcomed by other countries.The Minister will be interested to know that the British-Irish Interparliamentary Body is proposing to send a delegation to the Paris headquarters to discuss a number of issues with Lieutenant General Pat Nash.  I hope to be given the opportunity to participate in that visit.  It is important to honour the Irish mission and what General Nash hopes to achieve.Lieutenant General Nash comes from Limerick and I am confident he will bring his professionalism to the job.  He follows in a line of other Irish military personnel who have served in similar capacities.  I refer to General Seán McKeown who served in the Congo in the 1960s, General Jim Quinn who was in Cyprus and a man I remember well and General Bill O'Callaghan, the mission commander in the Lebanon.  Lieutenant General Nash is following a tremendous tradition of Irish Army officers who have led important missions abroad.  I wish him well, as will every Member of the House.  The Army has a great reputation and it is being given an opportunity to undertake this important role.  We all look forward to the roll-out of the programme.I listened to contributions from colleagues from across the floor of the House who expressed their concerns.  I have confidence in the Army leadership and that of the Minister for Defence.  However, people are worried about the challenges and difficulties to be faced in Chad.  It is right to be cautious.  Other Members asked the Minister to ensure all resources would be provided for the Irish troops and I have confidence in him.  The public does not wish to send our troops into dangerous situations without being properly equipped and resourced.  I wish our forces well.
#MichaelJWoods	unknown-#MichaelJWoods-party	unknown-#MichaelJWoods-dob	unknown-#MichaelJWoods-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-28 00:00:00	Prelude	433	This motion deals with the security of the Defence Forces personnel and the humanitarian aid being delivered.  Arising from the conflict, more than 180,000 internally displaced Chadians and 236,000 Sudanese refugees live in camps in eastern Chad which is where our troops are going.  They will protect these refugees and displaced persons from starvation, rape and attack, until they can return to their homes.  The EU mission to Chad will complement the planned UN-African Union hybrid mission being launched by the United Nations in Darfur by limiting the spillover potential from the conflict in Sudan.As Chairman of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs, I am very pleased to have this opportunity to speak in support of the motion.  At last Wednesday's meeting of the joint committee, it unanimously welcomed the Government's decision of the previous day to send 400 Irish troops to Chad once they were supported with the resources and equipment they needed.The question of resources has been raised many times during the debate.  The Minister has informed the House that the intention is to have initial operational capability on the ground in December, with the operation fully functional by the end of March 2008.  While troop contributions are broadly in line with the requirements identified by the operational commander, gaps in the force still remain, particularly in vital elements of the structure such as helicopters and tactical aircraft and medical support associated with the launch of the operation.  The Minister is right to highlight these defects and shortfalls which are being actively examined and addressed by EU military staff in consultation with the operational commander.  At the recent meeting of EU Defence Ministers the Minister expressed his concerns and urged his colleagues to re-examine the shortfalls and actively support the mission.Members will wish to ensure the mission is adequately resourced and capable of fulfilling its mandate.  The Minister has given an undertaking to the House that there is no question of the Defence Forces deploying in theatre without the required enabling mechanisms being in place.  I welcome his assurance, as will all Members.  The European Union must not fall short as the situation is too dangerous.  The Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs will monitor the progress of this mission.  We plan to visit the Irish UN force in the field when it is fully established.Ireland has a long and proud tradition of participation in UN peace missions which extends back almost 50 years.  Members may recall two of the more prominent and dangerous missions undertaken by the Defence Forces; its participation in the UN peacekeeping mission in the former Belgian Congo in the 1960s and in the UNIFIL force in southern Lebanon from its establishment in 1978.  Ireland has also provided military personnel for other UN missions such as to Cyprus and Egypt.  In more recent years our forces played a highly valuable and distinctive role in bringing peace to Liberia and have contributed in that mission to new thinking about how conflict resolution should be addressed, with humanitarian aid and follow-up support.In all these missions our forces behaved with great distinction and won many honours.  However, the missions in the Congo and Lebanon were also dangerous and brave Irish soldiers were lost in both missions.  We have learned that UN peacekeeping operations are not without risk.  As a small country, Ireland has punched above its weight in UN peacekeeping missions.  When it comes to the difficult work of peacekeeping, our officers and soldiers are internationally recognised as being second to none when it comes to deploying the necessary skills in the cause of keeping the peace in post-conflict situations.Conflict resolution, security and peace are the foundations on which politics and democracy and economic and social development can flourish.  In this new operation in Chad all the experience and skills which the Defence Forces have developed during the years will be put to the test.  Everyone recognises that this will be one of the most difficult missions undertaken by the Irish Army.  Chad poses immense challenges.The conditions on the ground will not be easy, the terrain is difficult and the hot summer climate will pose a real challenge to the Defence Forces personnel.  For this EU-UN peacekeeping operation to be successful, it must be fully resourced and the force must have all the necessary equipment at its disposal to ensure that the soldiers can carry out their mission in the manner expected, both in Ireland and in the broader international community.  This includes the capability to move quickly and reconfigure when necessary.  It is a matter of great pride for Members that the force commander is Lieutenant General Pat Nash.  His appointment to this important position is a testimony to the high regard in which members of our armed forces are held by the United Nations.  Members wish him well in this difficult undertaking and wish well to all who go with him, as well as a safe return.The function of the force will be to establish a safe and secure environment for the many thousands of refugees who have fled into Chad to escape the horrors that have been inflicted on them in Darfur.  The force also will be required to facilitate the delivery of humanitarian aid to the refugees.  Additionally, the force must protect UN and humanitarian personnel.  These three tasks will require the deployment of all the skills our soldiers have learned from our extensive peacekeeping experience.  I am confident they will carry out their mission in the most professional manner possible and that they will be able to so do in the knowledge that they have the full support of this House and the people as a whole.
#CiaranCuffeGP	unknown-#CiaranCuffeGP-party	unknown-#CiaranCuffeGP-dob	unknown-#CiaranCuffeGP-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-28 00:00:00	Prelude	434	By now, the Minister for Defence and his officials must be experts on the geography of Chad and on the numbers of internally displaced people.  I will do my best not to continue to read those facts into the record.  On a more serious note, this will be an extremely tough assignment and it poses a real challenge to our forces and to all who will accompany them into the heart of Africa.I note that Chad has been a killing field for many generations.  This has been the case since its civil war in the early 1960s and internal conflict continued into the late 1980s.  Many civilians in Chad are under attack by the Janjaweed and others as the conflict to the east spills across the border.  I note that Forbes magazine, not normally a publication to which I pay much attention, has placed Chad at the top of the list of the world’s most corrupt nations for what may turn out to be the single most piggish use of philanthropic funds.  I refer to proceeds from a project funded in part by the World Bank to build an oil pipeline through Chad and Cameroon.  It was supposed to have been ring-fenced by President Déby’s government to assist and feed the desperately poor people of these nations.  Instead, approximately $30 million was diverted to buy arms to keep in power the government of President Idriss Déby.  Corruption and danger certainly are present in Chad and there is a huge amount of death, destruction and conflict.I found it interesting to observe the debate  in recent months on the need to ensure that our troops do not face undue danger in the conduct of their duties.  Achieving this will rely greatly on the resources of the Army and, more importantly, on the resources made available by others in that area.  Were the conflict to escalate and were the simple logistics of feeding, watering and providing logistical back-up not to happen, it could leave our troops exposed.  In common with all other speakers, I wish the members of the Defence Forces a peaceful and successful mission in that country.  The scale of the problems they will face is enormous and they will see at first hand the poverty, malnutrition and difficulties faced by the people of Chad.  Undoubtedly, Pat Nash will be able to face this challenge.  Irish troops have performed in many countries to date and Lieutenant General Pat Nash must be satisfied that his troops will not be in undue danger.  I am sure he will so satisfied.  I note that hundreds of rebels have been killed in the region in recent days in clashes with the Chadian Government and there is no easy end to the problems they will face there.I intend to read into the record some of the concerns that Amnesty International has brought to Members' attention regarding the problems of Chad.  It has pointed out that much of the conflict has spilled over from Sudan and that the Janjaweed has extended its activities into eastern Chad with attacks on communities that began approximately four years ago.  Initially, these consisted of small-scale raids aimed primarily at stealing cattle.  In more recent times, however, the levels of weaponry, violence and destruction have escalated.  There have been many accounts of groups of women being attacked and raped.  There is a particularly awful account regarding the village of Djorlo, in which the Janjaweed raped seven women who had taken refuge in a mosque.  The women were captured, beaten and raped.  It is for these reasons and many more that Ireland will do its best to play its role on the international scene and to demonstrate that it is there for the most disadvantaged on earth.  Ireland has a long record of humanitarian assistance by missionaries throughout the 20th century and through overseas missions of the Defence Forces.  More importantly, this mission shows that in the 21st century, Ireland is providing both assistance through Irish Aid and the humanitarian and peacekeeping back-up that is required for those who are threatened in Chad.Democracy is at great risk in Chad.  Moreover, civil liberties are under threat and hundreds of people have been killed there in recent days.  On behalf of the Green Party, I support this mission in Chad.  The Green Party shares the concern to ensure our troops will be as safe as possible.  It seeks the establishment of a safe and secure environment for refugees and internally displaced people, as well as the protection of United Nations and humanitarian personnel.  The Green Party is satisfied that the triple lock will be in place, that is, the UN, the Government and the Dáil will approve this mission.  On behalf of my Green Party colleagues, I wish the members of the Defence Forces a safe journey and a successful mission.  I am sure they will learn much from the people they encounter there.All too often, Africa is in the news for the wrong reasons.  It is important to acknowledge Africa's enormous cultural importance.  I refer to its rich history and I am sure our troops will learn from its rich musical heritage, of which I am a fan.  Moreover, there have been fantastic successes in Africa in recent years and it is important that Members do not spend all their time considering its trouble spots, dangers, difficulties and problems.  Members should welcome and give thanks for the culture, music and history of Africa.  Undoubtedly this mission will lead the Irish people to learn more in this regard and hopefully it will lead to some of the richness of that culture being brought home.  We will be all the better for it and we will be able to hold our heads slightly higher on the international stage.
#MJNolan	unknown-#MJNolan-party	unknown-#MJNolan-dob	unknown-#MJNolan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-28 00:00:00	Prelude	435	I commend the Minister, his Department and the Defence Forces on agreeing to send members of our Defence Forces to Chad.  Like previous speakers I acknowledge the huge problems they will face when they go to Africa.  The concern of the Government and of the European Union about the situation not just in Chad and its neighbouring countries but on most of the continent of Africa is a source of ongoing concern to the wider public and democracies in general.On a personal note I am hugely disappointed that the countries of Africa, which have come from a background of colonisation but which received their independence, for complex reasons appear unable to embrace the concept of democracy.  We have sham democracies in a number of African states.  Many African countries have great natural resources such as mineral wealth and oil potential but, unfortunately, they have not been able to benefit to the extent they should from their great natural resources.  It is incumbent on the European Union, the United States and other developed countries to assist where possible.  Just sending money and food is not the answer.  We must be able to assist in educating the populations of African states because without education we are going nowhere and throwing good money after bad.This debate relates to the posting of 400 Irish troops to help the situation in Chad.  We have a strong and proud record in peacekeeping going back to the 1960s when we went to the Congo.  That mission was followed by one to Cyprus.  The most successful mission in which we were involved was UNIFIL in southern Lebanon.  From a professional military point of view, all of these missions have been very good for morale and the training of the Defence Forces.  On the completion of every mission the personnel have been commended on the manner in which they carried out their duties.Lieutenant General Pat Nash is the force commander and I wish him every success.  I noticed in some earlier debates he had received promotion to Lieutenant General.  It is a credit to the Defence Forces that the force commander is a member of the Irish Defence Forces.  Based on our record in peacekeeping in previous missions I have no doubt the higher level of military management will be more than capable of dealing with what the soldiers who are posted to Chad will have to face.  The vast majority, if not all, of the senior Army officers have served overseas on various missions.The transfer from tribal rule to democratic rule in Africa has not happened at the pace many of us would like.  The losers in many cases are the local people, especially women and children.  The main purpose of the mission to Chad is to provide some form of protection to this vulnerable part of the population, many of whom are fleeing hostilities in their home areas.  We are still dealing with conflicts in so many areas that the troubles in Chad and the Central African Republic are only two of many that need to be addressed.  Corruption is endemic in African countries and we will not make progress unless we reach a stage where we can educate people and get rid of corruption.I commend the Minister on his statement on Army deafness.  This is an old chestnut of mine.  I especially commend him given his background in the legal profession on having the courage to say what he did in this regard.  I believe the legal profession behaved scandalously in its abuse of that scheme.  Some solicitors did the legal profession a disservice in the manner in which they abused that scheme.  I know this at first hand because former members of the Defence Forces came to me and told me they were actively canvassed to put in a claim which was not the purpose of that scheme.  In some cases when former soldiers did not want to make a claim they were scorned and made to look foolish just because they were principled enough not to make a claim as they genuinely did not have a case to make under the Army deafness scheme.  I wish to put that on record.The activities of the rebel groups will eventually be sorted out in many of the African countries, especially in Chad where we are going, but that will not happen until a political agreement is reached.  A far greater threat to most African states comes from the activities of criminal gangs.  While we can get over the political aspects of many of the problems, the existence of political gangs where there is a great deal of unemployment is something with which these new democracies will have to come to grips.  Unemployment and a lack of sustainable investment are major shortcomings which will have to be addressed.  The European Union and the United States will have to play a very active part in this regard.The mass displacement of local populations is of huge concern, as is the scale of mass migration.  These countries do not have the means to deal with such humanitarian crises.  When one adds natural disasters to the mix, the scale of the problem has to be seen to be believed.  The new force being despatched should not underestimate the task ahead of it.  It is going there to protect some of the most vulnerable people on this planet.  The anecdotal evidence we hear about some of the scandals taking place out there suggests that the challenge facing the Defence Forces is not to be underestimated.  Women who have escaped horrific situations in their own homelands are now facing the problem of being assaulted and raped in refugee camps where they sought shelter and protection.  It is the duty of our Army personnel who will be deployed to Chad to defend these people.  It is important that we do our bit to bring peace and security to the region and that we can give some form of safety and security to the refugees.I wish every member of the Defence Forces who goes to Chad a safe and fruitful mission.  I commend the Minister on his stewardship of the Department to date.

#WillieODea	unknown-#WillieODea-party	unknown-#WillieODea-dob	unknown-#WillieODea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-28 00:00:00	Prelude	438	I wish to deal with the main points that were raised by Members, including Deputies Deenihan, O'Shea, Michael D. Higgins and others.  One question related to the water supply in Chad.  There have been reports that there is a problem with the supply and capacity of water in Chad.  While these reports have been around for some time, accurate reports and surveys are not available to confirm them.  During the reconnaissance carried out by the Irish Defence Forces from 11 to 17 October 2007, there was no indication of a shortage or rationing of supplies by the French contingent already in Chad.  However, it is understood that a significant expansion in demand could have serious repercussions for the capacity of this particular water source and may involve some form of rationing.  The military authorities have advised that this matter is being addressed at the highest level.  An EU-UN water survey is currently ongoing to confirm the sites most favourable for selection from an engineering perspective.  In addition, a reserve 30 days supply of bottled water will be held and stored.  The bottled water will be of EU quality.Another relevant question was raised about the medical facilities.  The Defence Forces adopt a comprehensive approach to managing and protecting the health of all personnel.  As a matter of course all personnel volunteering must have passed their annual medical in the first instance.  They are then subjected to a further detailed overseas medical, where they are assessed for suitability with particular reference to the physical requirements of the mission.  The troops to be deployed to Chad will go through this process.  All troops will be immunised against known disease risks.  With regard to possible water borne parasites or diseases, the Defence Forces will bring their own water purification plant and sewage treatment plant.  On return from the mission all troops are fully tested from a health perspective as a matter of course.  The Defence Forces will deploy, as part of the battalion, a containerised medical facility.  It will be operated by two medical doctors, who will be assisted by a team of 13 Defence Forces personnel and paramedics.We spoke about gaps in the mission.  One of the key gaps is the absence of a level two medical facility in the general area where the Irish Army will be stationed.  That is one of the reasons the force commander has decided not to deploy the force yet.  That facility will have to be in place and negotiations about it are ongoing.Reference was made to France's colonial past and the danger that the United Nations force, including Irish troops, would be seen to be on the side of the government, as it were, against the rebels.  I reiterate that this is a UN mandated mission, organised by the European Union.  It is going there as a neutral force with a humanitarian brief to alleviate the suffering in the camps, ensure the safety of the refugees and internally displaced persons and to provide a measure of protection for the United Nations personnel and installations.  Despite what was said in the debate, France will not contribute more than half the troops.  It will contribute approximately 1,260 troops to a force of between 3,500 and 4,000.  It is a significant contribution but the force is organised by the European Union at the behest of the United Nations.  It will be clear that it has no brief or agenda on behalf of one side or the other and will be seen as such.Deputy Kenny on the Order of Business and other Deputies in the course of this debate asked what would happen if a major civil war breaks out in Sudan and hundreds of thousands of people start to stream across the border.  We are conscious of that danger; it has been factored into the risk assessment.  We will monitor the situation regularly.  I assure the House that nobody, least of all me, takes the safety and the lives of our Defence Forces lightly.  For that reason the force commander, Lieutenant General Nash, is not prepared to deploy the force without sufficient air assets.  This is one of the key enablers.  If there is sufficient air capacity, one can move troops either out of the country, in a desperate situation, or out of a danger zone very quickly.  The force commander will not deploy the force until these assets are in place in sufficient numbers.Deputy O'Shea raised the issue of human trafficking.  That is a matter for the local authorities.  However, the United Nations mandated force can contribute in so far as it can deal with instances of human trafficking that come to its attention.  The force is going there to provide a safer system, to help restore civil authority in these regions and to provide support until such time as it takes root.  That will enable criminal activity such as trafficking to be dealt with more easily than at present.Deputy Wall and Deputy Behan asked if the troops would have contact with home during the deployment.  The Government is conscious of this issue.  Usually a tour of duty is six months, as was the case with Lebanon, Kosovo and other countries.  In Chad it will be four months.  That is due not only to the environment but also because it is not practicable to have a break in the middle of the deployment, which is what happens during normal tours of duty.  It is too far away to haul troops there and back.  The Defence Forces are currently examining a range of support provisions such as postal arrangements and telephone, Internet access and e-mail facilities which can be put in place for the Irish troops.  We are conscious of the matter but I thank the Deputies for reminding us of it.Deputy Costello said that Amnesty International and other organisations claim that March or April might be too late for deployment.  There is some confusion arising from some of the questions asked on the Order of Business this morning.  The Taoiseach referred to late March as the date for deployment.  However, that is the date when all the force will be in place; part of it will be in place before that.  It is hoped that if we can keep to the original timetable, even taking into account a three week delay because of the danger in supplying the various enablers, the troops will be there by late January or early February.One speaker said this would be the most risky or dangerous mission ever engaged in by the Irish Army.  I agree with Deputy O'Rourke that the danger of a mission will only be evident when it is under way.  The risk assessment is that it is medium risk, the same as for Liberia.  I believe it was low to medium risk in Kosovo.  The Congo is so long ago I do not know what the risk assessment was but it turned out to be a dangerous mission, unfortunately.  Liberia was medium risk but due to the equipment and training of the troops, they were well able to manage that risk.Deputy Deenihan asked what the situation will be if this motion is passed.  If it is passed, the three components of the triple lock will be fulfilled and we will have the authority to send our troops out when the force commander deploys them.  However, as I have said on a number of occasions both inside and outside the House, the force commander will not deploy until the necessary enabling provisions are in place.

#WillieODea	unknown-#WillieODea-party	unknown-#WillieODea-dob	unknown-#WillieODea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-28 00:00:00	Prelude	444	We will communicate that request to Lieutenant General Nash.  Deputy Ó Snodaigh indicated that he intended to oppose the motion because he did not agree with battle groups.  This is not a battle group in the classic sense of the word.  We are part of the Nordic battle group.  This is a peace support operation which is being carried out for humanitarian reasons.  Incidentally, of all the missions launched by the EU, only four have been military missions, three of which were carried out as a result of specific resolutions and requests from the UN.  There are so many demands on the UN now that it just does not have the capacity to organise all the missions it is requested to be involved in.  Sometimes it must subcontract the job to an agency, as it were, such as the EU or NATO.  In the case of the mission in Sudan, the African Union is the organising committee.  That is quite normal.  There is nothing sinister or untoward about it and there is no particular agenda.  The arrangement simply enables the UN to establish more UN-supported missions than it would be capable of doing if it was restricted to organising blue helmet-type operations.Deputy Timmins raised an interesting point when he said that the danger on the ground would be increased by the fact that there are so many factions it would be hard to tell one from another.  We are conscious of this and it has been factored into the risk assessment.  Deputy Timmins also spoke about Kosovo and the possibility of a unilateral declaration of independence on 10 December.  That is a question which exercises not just us — it is not just a question of the triple lock — but also many of our partner countries in the Kosovo operation.  I have been speaking to some of their representatives.  The better view is that there will be no need for a new UN resolution.  However, in answer to the question raised by various people, we have referred the matter to the Attorney General for advice and I expect to hear from him on this shortly.  If it turns out that another UN resolution is required but not forthcoming, we will not be the only country that is embarrassed.  I assure the Deputy of that.Deputy Timmins also asked whether we could accept assistance from NATO if difficulties arose and we needed to get out of a country or a certain location quickly.  There is an arrangement between the EU and NATO, the Berlin Plus arrangement, whereby we can have access to NATO assets.  That is how it is dealt with.As Deputies mentioned, this is not a trip to a holiday camp.  There is no doubt this is a risky mission with potential dangers.  However, I wish people would stop saying things such as "very high risk", "imminent danger", and "the dead heart of Africa".  The families of the troops are sufficiently worried already.  We should not add to their worries by using this sort of over-the-top language.  We should keep it calm.

#WillieODea	unknown-#WillieODea-party	unknown-#WillieODea-dob	unknown-#WillieODea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-28 00:00:00	Prelude	456	At a meeting of Defence Ministers in Brussels last Monday week I pleaded with my colleagues to put the key enablers in place.  We have less than 1% of the population of Europe but we are supplying approximately 12% of the troops for this mission.  Someone asked me why we are not supplying air assets.  We would gladly supply them if we had them, but the air assets we have do not have the range or capacity to be any good in Chad.  That is the simple truth.  I accept Deputy Deenihan's point about acquiring strategic airlift capacity.  This is something that will be considered in the context of the next White Paper, although a cost-benefit analysis will have to be done first.Recently, at a Defence Ministers' meeting in Brussels, we approved the Progress Catalogue 2007, which set a headline goal for the EU of being able to put 90,000 troops in the field within three months, sustainable for up to 12 months, with the appropriate backup and logistics.  We are supposed to be able to do this and we have passed the appropriate resolutions to give ourselves the power and right to do that by 2010.  Here, we are putting fewer than 4,000 troops into a classic peacekeeping operation.  If we cannot do that in 2007, I am certain we will not be able to meet the aspiration of 90,000 troops within three months by 2010.

#WillieODea	unknown-#WillieODea-party	unknown-#WillieODea-dob	unknown-#WillieODea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-28 00:00:00	Prelude	462	We do not have sufficient air assets or medical facilities and we need substantial assistance in these areas.  I appeal again to our European partners in this regard.  The whole future of European security and defence is at stake.  The credibility of the EU's involvement in peacekeeping missions is at stake if we cannot launch this mission as soon as possible.  If our partners do not step up to the plate we have a fallback position, but I do not even want to contemplate that at the moment.  I appeal to them again to step up.The goal of the Progress Catalogue 2007 is the ability to deploy 90,000 troops within three months, sustainable for 12 months, by 2010, which is just two years away.  If we cannot deploy 4,000 troops now, how will we achieve that goal?  The first part of an operation always takes a certain period of time, but I hope this matter can be resolved because people are living in appalling circumstances.  Women are being raped and worse, people are being murdered, there is famine, and the average life expectancy is 42 years.  People who are trying to bring humanitarian aid to these unfortunate people cannot do so because of the activities of the rebel groups and bandits.  These people are crying out for help.  Every day that passes, their condition worsens and more people die.  Every day people are brutalised.  The sooner we get this mission in place, the better.  We have done our part.  Now it is up to others to do theirs and I appeal to them to do so.  Once again I commend the motion to the House.

#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-28 00:00:00	Prelude	464	I support the motion that this House has no confidence in the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Mary Harney.  The principal reason she should resign is her failure to oversee in a competent manner a health system that provides proper care for patients.  She has failed to lead our health service, failed to deliver on commitments made by her own Government, and ultimately failed those who use the health service, especially the women of the midlands who, scandalously, have been left waiting for further medical assessment.However, we are used to words from the Minister, Deputy Harney.  Three years ago she promised to solve the accident and emergency department crisis.  Today there are 251 people on trolleys, yesterday there were 257, that is, 50 more each day than the same days three years ago.In January of this year she stated there would be no cutbacks in the health service and that patients would not suffer.  In September, she stated that the cutbacks would not hurt patients but they did.  Operations were cancelled up and down the country.  Home helps were withdrawn.  Home care packages for children with a disability were cancelled and suicide prevention training courses were cancelled also.However, on Thursday last, at the Joint Committee on Health and Children, the killing casualness of the announcement exposed how shallow and hollow the words, promises and rhetoric of the Minister have been.  The news that 97 women needed further medical examination but had not been told, exploded once and for all the myth of Deputy Harney being the tough, effective and caring Minister on top of her job.  The decision to delay informing these women until the HSE had the "cohort" it required and the reference to women "jamming up the lines" revealed the hard cold truth of the Irish health service under this Minister and revealed how concern for the system outweighs concern for the patient.The surge of action on Friday when the Minister's political neck was on the line demonstrated where her priorities lay, the protection of her political career.  Of course, an excuse was rolled out.  Is there not always one?  This time it was "a communications failure", but could the Minister have anticipated this?Last night she referred to reports produced before the HSE was set up.  One of those reports, the 2003 Brennan report, could have forewarned her.  Commenting on the relationship between the Department of Health and Children and the HSE, Professor Brennan stated "it will be essential that the Department be closely in touch with the on-the-ground reality of policy implementation".  In a prophetic piece, Professor Brennan went on to state "if the relationship between the two parties does not work properly, it could substantially compromise the capacity of the health service to deliver its objectives".  How right she was.The Minister, Deputy Harney, had yet another warning about the need to stay on top of her brief in the Travers report of March 2005.  Mr. Travers made clear recommendations.  In future, he stated, she should "probe, in an insightful and effective way, areas of policy implementation, operations and administrative difficulty".  He added that the Minister should "insist on full and periodic briefings on key issues of policy and operational performance".  In the Minister's press release about that matter, Deputy Harney stated "'issues of singular importance' ... should be identified and dealt with in clear language and with a clear purpose and remedy".How did the Minister measure up?  Did she deal with Mr. Naughton's letter of 2005 "with a clear purpose and remedy"?  She did not because she did not even read the letter.  When cancer services in Portlaoise were suspended in August this year, did she deal with this "with a clear purpose and remedy"?  She did not.  She spoke a great deal about how concerned she was for the women involved, how they were her priority, how they would be cared for and how they would get all the treatment.  It sounded like clear purpose and remedy, but the reality was different.  The Minister retreated to her Hawkins House ministerial suite bolstered by a €25,000 increase in salary and ignored the issue until just before she was about to appear before the House to answer parliamentary questions.By her own admission, she and her Department did not know about the ultrasound review, even though it is set out explicitly in the terms of reference.  Did she even read these?  By her own admission, she could not get information on the ultrasound review on Wednesday, 21 November.  This is an appalling admission for any Minister.By her own admission, she was able to instruct her officials to tell the HSE to hold a special clinic in Portlaoise on Saturday last.  When political will was shown, the HSE's plan for clinics in Dublin were also overthrown.  By her own admission, that special clinic only took place because concerned cancer specialists volunteered their services.  That is a new version of a dig-out for the Department of Health and Children — specialists' goodwill instead of the political will of a Minister.  Contrast that with the comment of Professor Keane who stated that the system should be that a cancer suspect would get immediate attention and not be left hanging around with weeks of trauma, pressure and stress, like the Minister allowed happen to those women in Portlaoise and the midlands.The Minister, Deputy Harney, states repeatedly she will not walk off the pitch.  The reality is that she was not on the pitch when she was needed.  To continue that analogy, in any credible and functioning Government she would be dropped from the team by now.  She did walk off the pitch and she abandoned leadership when she was pursued by former Minister, Michael McDowell SC.  She is now, with diminished authority, in a diminished ministry.

It is a symptom of a health system where the Minister and her Department have detached themselves from the delivery of the service.  It is a symptom of a service where the HSE is now a dysfunctional organisation, with senior executives kept in the dark about critical patient reviews.  It is a symptom of a health service which is patently not patient-centred.This Health Service Executive is the creation of this Government and of this Minister.  This is her agency, set up with her legislation, peopled with her senior executives and communicating in a way that she dictates.She and her colleagues have been in office for ten years of wealth and prosperity.  There has been investment, not service.  From the Minister, Deputy Cowen, who could not wait to get out of the brief, to the Minister, Deputy Martin, who did not read the brief, to the Minister, Deputy Harney, who gave the brief away to the HSE, they all have failed.  It was a wasted decade from a bunch of wasters.

She wants every woman and every man to know that she is a caring person, that she is delivering a service for them.  I ask her to go and talk to the person who wrote this letter.  This is a woman who, at the request of her doctor, received notification to attend for her mammogram on Tuesday, 19 May 2009 at 11.33 a.m.  That woman is waiting for a mammogram requested by her general practitioner and she has been told to wait that length of time when she may well be a suspect for what the women in the midlands have.

#KathleenLynch	unknown-#KathleenLynch-party	unknown-#KathleenLynch-dob	unknown-#KathleenLynch-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-28 00:00:00	Prelude	501	And making sure it does not recur.
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-28 00:00:00	Prelude	502	That in turn requires a full understanding of what would represent normal or acceptable performance so that the deviations from it can be judged.  It requires an understanding of the context and the extent and nature of any shortcomings that may arise.  That in turn requires detailed, expert analysis that the Minister and the HSE put in place immediately when concerns were expressed that all was not well.
#DrJamesReilly	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-party	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-dob	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-28 00:00:00	Prelude	503	Two and a half years later.
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-28 00:00:00	Prelude	504	Of course, the public — especially the women directly concerned and their families — and Members of this House have a right to be informed as soon as information becomes available on a matter of this gravity, but I have not been impressed by the rush to judgment, to attribute blame and to call for heads.
#PaulConnaughton	unknown-#PaulConnaughton-party	unknown-#PaulConnaughton-dob	unknown-#PaulConnaughton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-28 00:00:00	Prelude	505	Should we say nothing?
#DrJamesReilly	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-party	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-dob	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-28 00:00:00	Prelude	506	Have a free vote.
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-28 00:00:00	Prelude	507	Despite knowing full well the extent of the careful analysis being undertaken to establish precisely what happened and why and the impossibility of drawing firm conclusions without such evidence, the pressure has been for immediate judgment and the exacting of the highest possible political price to the advantage of the Opposition.  This is little more than playing political games with the tragedy of these women and their families.
#MichaelRing	unknown-#MichaelRing-party	unknown-#MichaelRing-dob	unknown-#MichaelRing-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-28 00:00:00	Prelude	508	The Taoiseach would not know anything about that.
#SeymourCrawford	unknown-#SeymourCrawford-party	unknown-#SeymourCrawford-dob	unknown-#SeymourCrawford-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-28 00:00:00	Prelude	509	The Taoiseach will start crying.
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-28 00:00:00	Prelude	510	It has seen appalling disregard for basic facts and even a misrepresentation of the standard of accuracy that might be expected in various procedures.  Population screening and symptomatic disease investigation have been widely confused.  Ignorance of the subject has been no barrier to the political opportunists baying for the Minister's head.
#CharlesFlanagan	unknown-#CharlesFlanagan-party	unknown-#CharlesFlanagan-dob	unknown-#CharlesFlanagan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-28 00:00:00	Prelude	511	Have an independent inquiry.
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-28 00:00:00	Prelude	512	The truth is that we do not yet know fully what happened and why.  We do not yet know the full consequences in terms of the number of women who were given false negative results when, in all reason, they should not have been, but the relevant experts are compiling their work and we will know the answers to these questions at that point.  Then effective accountability can be applied at all of the levels of the health care system, which I mentioned earlier.We will also know more about how the response to aspects of this crisis were handled by the HSE, including the appropriate briefing of the Minister and her officials in a matter of the utmost public concern.  The board of the HSE is rightly organising an independent, external review of aspects of the handling that, I must confess, are difficult to understand.  However, when it comes to establishing responsibility for what happened——
#BrianHayes	unknown-#BrianHayes-party	unknown-#BrianHayes-dob	unknown-#BrianHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-28 00:00:00	Prelude	513	The Government will blame others.
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-28 00:00:00	Prelude	514	——we will have a basis of fact and expert analysis on which to depend.  It is then that the appropriate accountability relationships can properly apply and, in applying them, the question of culpability — to whom or what should blame be attached — will be clearer.  One person who is not to blame and will not be found to be blameworthy is the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney.
#BrianHayes	unknown-#BrianHayes-party	unknown-#BrianHayes-dob	unknown-#BrianHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-28 00:00:00	Prelude	515	It will be a whitewash.

#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-28 00:00:00	Prelude	517	I do not need to remind this House of the range of her political achievements over many years of public service.
#BrianHayes	unknown-#BrianHayes-party	unknown-#BrianHayes-dob	unknown-#BrianHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-28 00:00:00	Prelude	518	That is telling us.
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-28 00:00:00	Prelude	519	I would simply point to her record in health, a ministerial portfolio that, because of its unique characteristics, contains huge potential for political disaster across every western country.

#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-28 00:00:00	Prelude	521	In driving a reform agenda, she has taken on vested interests of all kinds.  She has taken expert advice to restructure the way in which health services are managed and operated.It is early days in what has been one of the most extensive transformation projects ever attempted in this country.  Already, the potential for much more effective and efficient health care is evident from the creation of a national framework for the planning and direction of the health service.
#DrJamesReilly	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-party	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-dob	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-28 00:00:00	Prelude	522	The disaster is evident.
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-28 00:00:00	Prelude	523	Of course, there are many difficulties in bringing this to completion.  Others must answer as to whether they, as stakeholders in our health care system, have been sufficiently responsible in engaging with the Minister in this challenging agenda.
#SeymourCrawford	unknown-#SeymourCrawford-party	unknown-#SeymourCrawford-dob	unknown-#SeymourCrawford-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-28 00:00:00	Prelude	524	The Government will not meet us.  The Taoiseach is talking rubbish.

#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-28 00:00:00	Prelude	526	At the heart of the Minister's concern has been the needs of the patient.  This is demonstrated by the dramatic improvements that have come about in waiting times for elective treatment——
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-28 00:00:00	Prelude	527	Can we believe that?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-28 00:00:00	Prelude	528	——and in waiting times and conditions for those awaiting admission from accident and emergency departments.
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-28 00:00:00	Prelude	529	It is also evident from the structural changes that have been included in an independent, expert and arm's length overseer of standards and safety.  Now getting into full swing, the Health Information and Quality Authority will have an ongoing, proactive role in ensuring that institutions, services and indeed individuals are up to the clinical and caring tasks they undertake.  In time, this will be seen to be a major protection for patients and their families.However, it is in cancer services, especiallybreast cancer services, that the Minister's qualities and determination are best seen.  I can do no better than to quote extracts from today's letter in The Irish Times from the emeritus professor of surgery in University College Dublin, Professor Niall O’Higgins, who chaired the expert group on how the national service for women with breast cancer should be developed.

#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-28 00:00:00	Prelude	540	Professor O'Higgins stated:She established an expert group to specify quality measures so that the performance of centres could be assessed, compared and judged against the highest prevailing standards.  When launching the report of the expert group in May this year, she expressed her determination to develop and designate the centres, a decision that followed shortly afterwards.  She has supported strongly the extension of BreastCheck, the national breast screening programme, soon to become a nationwide service.  She enlisted the talented and experienced cancer specialist, Professor Tom Keane, from Canada, to guide the development of the national cancer strategy, in which services for breast cancer are a large component.He also stated: "The Minister has taken major decisions to improve breast cancer care.  Her decisions are not only courageous but they are necessary and should be supported."

I oppose the motion of no confidence in my constituency colleague, the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney.  This motion has no political integrity.

Yet some hours later, it was Deputy Jan O'Sullivan and her party which brought forward the motion of no confidence.  The reason she did so was not because of ideology but because she was specifically caught on the hop when Deputy Reilly said he was going to his party leader.  She did not want to lose the opportunity.

She was caught and I make no apologies for saying so.I wish to be associated with comments made by the Minister for Health and Children in the House last night when she apologised to the patients of the former midland health board and those in Portlaoise hospital.

For the past six months I have had the privilege of working beside the Minister in the Department of Health and Children.  Working on a highly complex brief, I have been struck by her courage and determination and absolute commitment to deliver to the Irish people a health service of the highest quality.  As she stated with some conviction last night, everything she has done as Minister for Health and Children has been aimed at putting patients first, and that is what she will continue to do successfully for many years to come.

#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-28 00:00:00	Prelude	662	They accept that the Minister cannot be held accountable for mistakes in the reading of individual mammograms and ultrasounds while at the same time laying the blame for every clinical shortcoming at her door.

#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-28 00:00:00	Prelude	671	The people of this country need, deserve and are entitled to the services that will be delivered in a multi-disciplinary setting.  That will not be achieved without implementation of the transformation programme.  The Minister is presiding over the largest and most fundamental reform of the health service, one that has long been identified as necessary.  Implementation of these reforms will give the people the quality of health service to which they are entitled.  It must be our ambition and resolve to give quality of care to every patient.  Without implementation of such reforms that objective will not be achieved.

#LizMcManus	unknown-#LizMcManus-party	unknown-#LizMcManus-dob	unknown-#LizMcManus-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-28 00:00:00	Prelude	760	It is interesting that the Government is trying to suggest the reason Deputy Harney must remain Minister for Health and Children is nobody else can take up the job.  The obvious answer to this is that many of us on this side of the House would be willing to take up the challenge but the excuse that no one feels he or she could do better than the incumbent also shows the bankruptcy on the Government benches.Let us examine the record on hospital beds, medical cards, the consultant contract, community nursing beds, hygiene standards and accountability.  All of these things were promised but none were delivered and this Minister has actually made matters worse.  The feather-bedding of private hospitals, the ending of local democracy and the promotion of inequality are all part of her record.In November 2004, the Minister, Deputy Harney, bulldozed the Bill that set up the Health Service Executive through this House.  She promised high quality patient care and modern, effective management.  I argued at the time that this hijacking of democracy was the latest in a comedy of errors that had every likelihood of becoming a catalogue of disasters.  I wish I had been wrong but we now have that catalogue of disasters with patients suffering needlessly and dying prematurely.  One such patient was Susie Long, a brave mother who died almost three years after the HSE was set up.  If the person with ministerial power and authority does not accept responsibility for the botched state of our cancer services, which led to the death of Susie Long, then who will?The Minister claimed she would deliver improved, integrated, high-quality care and she must take the blame for not doing so.  She said last night that she does not accept failure but such hubris only sends out the message that whatever one does, whoever one is, one can duck the flack and keep one's job.  Deputy Martin, when he was Minister for Health and Children, cost the State millions when he did not read a brief but he ducked responsibility and got another job.  The Minister, Deputy Harney, is presiding over a catalogue of disasters and cannot get information from the Frankenstein she created called the HSE.  If she does not accept responsibility for these failures why should anyone working inside or outside the health service do so?  Why do Ministers exist if not to take responsibility for what they do and fail to do?

We should not misrepresent the situation because Alan Dukes believed in the policy behind the Tallaght strategy.  The Labour Party and the wider Opposition, which used to include the Green Party, which we can now forget about, oppose this Minister on her policy, her privatisation agenda, and her desire to deepen the divide and cause greater inefficiency in the health service through privatisation.  We disagree with all of that and will continue to oppose it because it will make things worse, rather than better.

In this debate Deputy Grealish and the Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children, Deputy Smith, suggested the Minister's policy was to put patients first.  I would like to believe that but 30 minutes before the Minister commenced her speech in the House yesterday, I received a phone call from the husband of one of the seven people diagnosed with cancer in Portlaoise.  He was very angry because he phoned the Minister's office on three or four occasions and left word with her private secretary that he would like her to call him back.  He phoned the head office of the Progressive Democrats and asked them to pass on a message to the Minister that he would like her to call him.  He phoned Hawkins House and left a message stating that he would like the Minister to call him.  Sadly he is still waiting to hear from the Minister.This individual's wife is receiving chemotherapy and in two weeks she will go to Dublin for six weeks of continuous treatment.  Not one person from the Minister's office thought it worthwhile to make a phone call that could alleviate some of the trauma a family experiences when a loved one is diagnosed with cancer.  The Minister claimed in her contribution to this debate that she sympathises with all involved in this matter but the facts say otherwise.  The Minister knows who I am talking about and I ask her or a member of her staff, even at this late stage, to call the family in question.  This would alleviate some of their suffering.

It is now out of control and it is hard to believe the Minister, the Secretary General of her Department, the head of the HSE and the head of the hospitals sector could not get information from the very body she created.The Minister cannot walk away from responsibility for this matter.  I am not here to check Deputy Harney's credibility because that has been done nine or ten times in her constituency of Dublin Mid-West.  I am here to seek accountability from her regarding something she created and no longer wants to recognise.  She has the audacity to call for a bipartisan approach at this stage.  Given the structure she created, the purpose of which was to shove responsibility as far as possible from the Department so that her own responsibility would be reduced, it is unthinkable that she now seeks to put her arms around the Opposition.  There is no doubt in my mind that the Minister is responsible for what has happened, through the creation of the HSE.  She should resign on that point alone.

#SeanSherlock	Labour	12775	Cork East	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-28 00:00:00	Prelude	778	We have now reached a point where people have lost confidence in the system of delivering cancer care.  That people's confidence in the system has been shaken to its foundations is putting it mildly.  That thousands of women who are at risk of breast cancer face a cloud of uncertainty is a sad indictment of the Government.  That a committee of this House was informed by the HSE that 97 women would have to be recalled for tests before the women themselves were informed speaks volumes.  That these women had not been contacted personally within 24 hours is nothing short of a scandal.When Dr. Peter Naughton told the Minister in 2005 that breast cancer services at Portlaoise were a shambles, did she listen to his concerns?  Yes, she did.  Did she act in a manner that was reflective of her position as Minister for Health and Children?  The answer is "No".
#PadraicMcCormack	unknown-#PadraicMcCormack-party	unknown-#PadraicMcCormack-dob	unknown-#PadraicMcCormack-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-28 00:00:00	Prelude	779	No way.
#SeanSherlock	Labour	12775	Cork East	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-28 00:00:00	Prelude	780	If the answer was "Yes", the Minister would not only have referred the matter to the HSE, she would have followed this issue to its proper conclusion and taken total responsibility.  That conclusion should have been the restoration of confidencein a system upon which thousands of women rely.What is the culture that now pervades the politics of health?  It is one where responsibility is passed from the Executive to the bureaucracy and where political accountability is non-existent.  The Minister was wrong to adopt a hands-off approach.  That is plainly and simply wrong.  A Minister for Health and Children cannot adopt a hands-off approach.  Otherwise, Angola will surely follow.If this motion achieves nothing else, it will have put down a clear marker to the Government that the issue of political accountability must be placed at centre stage in terms of health care facilities and delivery.  That the Minister for Health and Children has been forced to give an account of her actions is a victory for political accountability and for those women who tonight live in fear for their futures and those of their families.  No longer will the people of this country endure a system that leaves no person or organisation accountable for the lack of delivery of cancer care and other services.Our role as public representatives of the people must be respected.  If we seek answers, we must get answers, not carefully worded attempts to dodge the issue.  The Minister should not take us for fools.  Nor should she take the women we represent for fools.  If we deem it necessary to seek answers on behalf of the countless victims of the current health care regime, the Minister must respect that and must respond in kind.  We can no longer accept a lack of political accountability.  The question tonight is whether the Minister acted with due diligence.  She did not.

#WilliamPenrose	unknown-#WilliamPenrose-party	unknown-#WilliamPenrose-dob	unknown-#WilliamPenrose-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-28 00:00:00	Prelude	782	This motion focuses on the principle of political accountability whereby someone must account for the significant failures that seem to be systemic within the health service.  Nobody can accuse the Minister for Health and Children of being personally responsible for misdiagnoses or for the oversight of each mammo-gram and the reading and assessment of same.  We in the Labour Party support the concept of centres of excellence.  However, my colleague, Deputy Jan O'Sullivan, raised  significant concerns last night.  We are all aware of the significant trauma and angst caused to those women who had to be recalled for further tests and assessment and to the nine women who suffered a failure of diagnosis in the first place.The Minister cannot deny that it was she and her Cabinet colleagues who put in place the HSE, which has turned out to be a labyrinth of bureaucracy and non-accountability.  For example, I wrote to the Minister on 15 November about the closure of cancer services at Midland Regional Hospital, Mullingar, which were successfully overseen by Peter Magill, consultant surgeon, Hugh Logan, consultant radiologist, and Kevin Cunnane, consultant pathologist.  I stated in this letter that it was my understanding that patients normally catered for in Mullingar would now be transferred to the Mater Hospital.  I asked the Minister:Is there adequate capacity available at the Mater Hospital to cater for the number of patients who availed of this important service for women at Mullingar over the years?I went on to ask:Will the HSE provide transport for people who do not have same, in order to enable them get to their appointments at the Mater Hospital?  For example, patients who have to travel from Moyne or Aughnacliffe in north Longford, Lanesboro in south Longford or other rural areas may well have to travel in excess of 100 miles and, in many instances, there is no element of public transport available.  I am requesting that appropriate transport facilities be provided for any patients who finds themselves in such a position.In a lovely letter I received in response from the Minister earlier this week, she stated:Responsibility for the provision of hospital services rests with the executive.  A copy of your correspondence has been referred to the chief executive officer of the HSE, who will arrange for the matters raised to be investigated and a reply issued directly to you.I had already written to Professor Drumm to alert him to my concerns.  He responded by thanking me for my letter and reassuring me that the parliamentary affairs division would investigate the matter and that a reply would be sent to me in due course.What type of whirligig is this?  The health board system at least provided some accountability and transparency because membership of the boards included political representatives and professionals.  There is nobody at the end of the telephone in the HSE.  The Minister expects us to join some type of Tallaght strategy where she advocates the United States model of health care, where it is all about profit and 40 million people have no medical cover.  When Alan Dukes agreed the Tallaght strategy with Ray MacSharry, there was a unanimity of approach to economic policy.  We could not be further apart on health policy.  I would resign from the Labour Party if there was any suggestion that we go along the route advocated by the Minister of private, for-profit medicine.  A universal right to access and equality of treatment are the basis of the Labour Party's philosophy in regard to the provision of health care.Nothing less becomes the HSE than its cold, clinical way of dealing with patients, as typified by the peremptory and unforgivable manner in which it announced the decision to close thebreast cancer service at Mullingar.  There were no complaints about the service and the women attending there under Peter Magill, Hugh Logan and Kevin Cunnane regarded it as first class.  In a letter published in today's Westmeath Examiner, these doctors state their belief that the breast clinic service at Midland Regional Hospital, Mullingar was of a high quality.  They go on to state:We reject the notion that the breast service in Mullingar deserved to be withdrawn because of unsafe standards and believe that the manner of the HSE's precipitous move to do same (given that plans to close the service were already well advanced) did a grave disservice to those clinicians who have worked hard over the years to provide a quality service only to hear that the "plug was being pulled" on turning on "Six-one" on RTE 1.What way is this to run a health service?

He advocated the provision of 12 such centres, but that number has been reduced to eight.  Why is there no centre in place for the midlands?  Asking people to travel 140 miles at a time of great trauma, angst and emotional suffering is unacceptable.  I urge the Minister to establish a centre of excellence in the midlands, whatever the precise location.  Moreover, everybody suffering from cancer should be given a medical card to ensure they receive the service to which they are entitled.

#CiaranLynch	unknown-#CiaranLynch-party	unknown-#CiaranLynch-dob	unknown-#CiaranLynch-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-28 00:00:00	Prelude	790	"I beheld the wretch — the miserable monster whom I had created."  That is a quote from Mary Shelley's Frankenstein which goes to the centre of this debate and asks who is the villain of the piece, the entity created or the creator of the entity?  The HSE is the creation of the Minister and like Shelley’s Frankenstein it has grown completely and utterly beyond her control.The Minister told us her reason for creating the HSE was to allow a health service that would be free of political interference.  Instead, she gave us a health service free of political accountability and a health system hamstrung by ideological interference, which sees the improvement of public health care through the development of private hospitals in order to profit from sick people.If one were to have reservation or concern about tonight's motion, it could relate to who will be the Minister's replacement.  Would it be Deputy Martin Cullen of electronic voting fame, provisionally licensed Deputy Noel Dempsey or Deputy Harney's predecessor and serial announcer, Deputy Micheál Martin?  However, any concern about the Minister for Health and Children's replacement can only be seen in the context of the idea that making mistakes, no matter how great or regular, will not be a deterrent to being a Minister in this Government.Accountability and delivery are at the centre of this debate, and I make this point with reference to the Minister's reply to this motion last night.  When the Minister speaks on health matters, she does so with conviction and a sincerity that may well be genuine.  Underpinning that sincerity is a clear ideological position which sees a solution to our public health care service in privatisation.  It is that contradiction which "has us now where we are", as the Minister herself stated.We can all acknowledge that there are many good parts to the health service.  Thousands of people are successfully treated for serious and complex issues every day.  Those successes are not attributable to the Minister but she is accountable for them.  The Minister sets the direction for the health service, disburses money, approves health care systems and appoints, implements and manages them.She may not be directly responsible for these systems but she is ultimately accountable for them.  She is not responsible for the day-to-day operation of the HSE but she is accountable for it.  It is simply unacceptable for the Minister to state, as she did last Friday, that there are communications issues to account for her lack of knowledge.It is unacceptable that she could go into a meeting ignorant of the fact that 97 women were to be given the most appalling news on that evening's news bulletins.  It is unacceptable that the Minister for Health and Children feels entitled to be one remove from health care issues.For example, when a Deputy tables a parliamentary question to the Minister, it is invariably kicked over to the HSE, which will reply not in a matter of days but perhaps weeks or months.  That reply is not entered into the public record of this House and may never come to the attention of the Minister or her officials.

#CiaranLynch	unknown-#CiaranLynch-party	unknown-#CiaranLynch-dob	unknown-#CiaranLynch-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-28 00:00:00	Prelude	792	It is seven years since the Government set out a plan to establish eight specialised centres of excellence to treat cancer.  In that time of unprecedented prosperity, the Government has failed to provide the funding or leadership necessary to put these in place.I will give an example by quoting a letter which straddles that seven-year period.  It states:Dear Patient.  As a major research programme, the National Breast Cancer Research Institute is conducting a large genetic study of the west of Ireland population.This letter was sent on 31 October 2007 to somebody who died in March 2000.This cumulative failure to put the strategy in place is shambolic and reflective of the events in recent weeks.  It is because of these events and the failure of the Minister to take responsibility for them, and despite her apology, that she finds herself facing a vote of no confidence.  The Minister created the monster which has gone on to frustrate and impede the development of decent health care services.  She has used it to distance herself from accountability to this House and the public.Confusion, frustration and outrage are the legacy of this Minister and her Government.  In Shelley's famous book, the creator of the monster ultimately saw the madness of his ways, took responsibility for the mayhem which ensued and fell upon his sword.  It is time for the Minister to do the same.
#JoeCostelloLAB	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-party	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-dob	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-28 00:00:00	Prelude	793	Misdiagnosis, misinformation and miscommunication have categorised the cancer screening and treatment services at the Midland General Hospital in Portlaoise.  This extraordinary level of dysfunctionalism occurred long after and despite Mr. Naughton, a surgeon in Portlaoise, writing to the Minister, Deputy Harney, in 2005.  He described the diagnostic services there as "a shambles".  No meaningful action was taken by the Minister to remedy this problem.Yesterday we learned of the appalling case of a woman diagnosed with a breast tumour in March 2005 but who was not informed until nine months later, when she returned to the same hospital in pain for further diagnosis.  Only then did she discover the chilling news of the diagnosis which had been known nine months earlier.  Through gross negligence and unprofessional conduct, this was never communicated to her.  The tumour was left untreated, the woman's life was put at risk and she died six months later.The structures in Portlaoise are clearly not functioning and have not done so for a considerable period of time.  The Minister knew all about it.  We learn today about major new concerns in Cork and Galway university hospitals.  This is enough reason for any responsible Minister to act honourably and resign.The Minister, Deputy Harney, entered the Department of Health and Children with a flourish over three years ago.  She was going to do the devil and all.  She announced plans and promised great strides of progress within six months, then 12 months, then two years.  At that stage she indicated Rome could not be built in a day.  In the run up to the general election she argued that she needed a second term to make real progress, which she passionately told us last night she would see through.What will the Minister see through and at what cost to the patient?  Is it the withdrawal, due to the current staffing embargo, of essential physiotherapy services to a former postman on Sheriff Street who is suffering from Parkinson's disease, hypertension, back pain, ulcerated legs, depression, vertigo, an inoperable hernia in his chest, and who is on 20 tablets a day?  His essential and necessary physiotherapy has now been withdrawn completely and indefinitely because there is no staff to deal with him in the Mater Hospital.  That has been put in writing from the services section to me.Are we to have more of the misleading HSE daily statistics, which do not include busy weekends and omit the time patients spend in the accident and emergency department prior to diagnosis?  These statistics state that patients have left the accident and emergency department when they are simply transferred to an annex, a sort of limbo euphemistically described as an admissions lounge.Accident and emergency department statistics are now deftly massaged for public consumption but patients are no closer to a bed in a hospital ward.  Is it to continue to be the Minister's assertion that the 3,000 beds taken out of the hospital system are not needed, although our population is growing and ageing?  At the same time the Minister is brazenly replacing those beds with beds in co-located private hospitals on public hospital grounds.Is it to be the so-called fair deal proposals due to be implemented in January that will cost residents of nursing homes 80% of their disposable income during their life and up to 15% of the value of their estate after their death?  Is it to be the refusal of a centre of excellence for the entire population of the north west?If these are the plans, policies and practices that the Minister, Deputy Harney, wants more time to implement, it is definitely time for her to go.

We have allowed the narrative about health to be dictated in the political culture of this country on the basis of the presumption that we have a perfect system, and if a problem arises, the person with ministerial responsibility should resign on every occasion.  We need to bring into our debate that reform is the buzzword of every political progressive and yet when people are involved in trying to implement reforms, too much of the adversarial system in this House enables oppositions of all types, depending on when they are in those benches to take up the views of the vested interests.  That often happens because there are many resisters to change and no more so than in the health service.  I have heard discussions in the background today about ideological positions, with talk about privatisation and all the rest, which is not relevant to this debate.

I was aware and people like the rest of us from the midlands who know about it have been able to show that the development of acute hospital services was possible.

#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-28 00:00:00	Prelude	825	I wish to share time with Deputy Gilmore.I have listened with great care to all that has been said on all sides of the House in the debate tonight and last night.  I agree with the Tánaiste that we need considerably more focus and debate on the health services in this House, which I would welcome.  I am one of the few Members of this House — the Tánaiste is another — who can truly empathise with the Minister, Deputy Harney.  I know the job.  The Minister is not accountable or responsible for the actions or failures of each and every employee of the health service, nor do we ask her to be, but she is politically accountable to this House and through us to the people for her political decisions, promises and commitments.  The Minister's big project, her big idea, was and is the HSE, and that is not working.  Worse than that, it is making patient care worse, not better.  That is my honest assessment.Over 20 years I have dealt with constituency queries on health issues.  Even in the poorest of times I never felt less able to address the frustrations of my electorate in dealing with health issues than I do now.  Health workers, general practitioners and nurses are contacting my office to express their frustration and exasperation at what is going on.  I will give two brief examples from the dozens I could have picked from my clinics in the past few weeks.  A three year old child in my constituency has been suffering from severe tonsillitis since November 2006, 12 months ago.  He is so bad that antibiotics are no longer effective.  The child is constantly distressed, cannot take solids and has been living for months on infant formula at three years of age.  He is awaiting an appointment with an ENT consultant.I contacted the PAD, parliamentary affairs division, of the HSE and the reply I received stated:I wish to advise you that two referral letters from [the child's] GP, in addition to a referral letter from [a] Consultant Paediatrician was received on behalf of [this child]...All of the above has been clinically assessed by the Consultant ENT Surgeon who has placed [the child] on the routine list, for an appointment.I asked further whether that meant the child was on a waiting list for a tonsillectomy or whether having waited for a year he might qualify for the treatment purchase scheme and I received a reply last week staring that the child is on a waiting list to be seen by a consultant.  He is on the waiting list to get on the waiting list.  He does not qualify for the treatment purchase scheme because he needs to be on the waiting list for three months before qualifying for that scheme.I will give another example — I said I could pick dozens.  A man was in full-time employment until he suffered a painful back injury in September 2006.  He attended his GP, but when medication failed to relieve his symptoms his doctor recommended he see an orthopaedic surgeon.  He attended an accident and emergency unit in severe pain and was referred to an orthopaedic surgeon.  However, he never received an appointment.  On being informed that he would wait two years, he decided to see a consultant privately.  Not having health insurance he ended up paying €6,700, money he needed to borrow.  He has now been told that because he went privately he is not entitled to be treated for pain management in the public service even though the man has a medical card.So much more could be said.  The bottom line is as follows.  Every Member of the House has similar tales to tell.  Some will argue that Deputies should not be involved in such matters.  However, when the doctors are sending their patients directly to our offices, what else do we do?

The Minister, Deputy Harney, made a very eloquent speech last night.  She set out what she wanted to do and called on us all to rally in support.  It would have been a credible speech if she had made it as she started her term as Minister for Health and Children.  The Minister and her colleagues have been in government — responsible for the management of the health service — for 3,782 days.  While I accept that the Minister, Deputy Harney, was not Minister for Health and Children for all that time, she was the Tánaiste when she had other responsibilities.  The Government has been in power for so long that young doctors who are beginning to work in hospitals throughout the country had only started secondary school when it took office.  The amount of time it has been in office should be long enough for any Government to sort out the problems in the health service.

One can only have genuine bipartisanship when one has an agreement on policy.  It is quite rich of the Minister to ask the Opposition to support her policy when the Minister of State who was sitting beside her when she made that call yesterday, Deputy Devins, was outside the gates of this House last week protesting against the very policy on which the Minister wants a bipartisan approach.

Despite what some people are saying, this is not about politics.  Deputy O'Sullivan has stated publicly, as Deputy McManus did when she was our health spokesperson, that the Labour Party supports the cancer strategy and the centres of excellence.  The provision of an additional centre in the north west should be debated and discussed.  The problem we have with the cancer strategy is that it is not being implemented.  There is no budget or timetable for it.  The approach being adopted involves the closure of local facilities before centres of excellence are put in place.  In the script circulated by Deputy Ned O'Keeffe, which I understand he was not allowed to deliver here tonight——

The Minister, Deputy Harney, who is experienced and able, said when she established the HSE that it would help to solve the crisis in the health system, but she was unable to get answers from that body when she needed them.  Nothing makes the case more eloquently that the Minister is no longer in control of the health service, or even in charge of her Department.  The Minister has responsibility for these officials.  She is able, in her own words, to direct the Health Service Executive.  She can order it to provide the information she seeks.  She can appoint and sack the members of the HSE.

She is the ultimate authority for the health service under the Ministers and Secretaries Acts.  The people with whom she was struggling are well-paid officers of the State for whom she approved bonuses in addition to the salaries they are already paid, presumably on the basis that they were doing a good job.  However, she was unable to get basic answers from them when they were needed.  The clinic which 97 women were told to attend last Saturday was arranged at short notice, after the Labour Party had tabled this motion for debate in the Dáil.  It was organised in such a hurry that the women could not be guaranteed the privacy they deserved as they turned up.  Although three months have passed since the Portlaoise crisis arose, we have not yet seen a report into what happened there.  We have not yet received an explanation.  The Minister, Deputy Gormley, has admitted that there was incompetence in Portlaoise.

The Minister's attention was drawn to the problems in Portlaoise in this regard when Dr. Peter Naughton wrote a letter to the Department two years ago.  The Minister passed the letter on for answer by the HSE as if it were a routine parliamentary question.  We are not talking about accountability for administrative issues.  In the past, we have debated missing files in the Office of the Attorney General.  Officials have resigned in Britain because CDs containing personal information have gone missing.  We are talking about a life-threatening disease that kills hundreds of women, including young women who leave behind young children, every year.  This disease thrives on delay, but all we are getting in response to this issue is delay.  Two years after the Minister first heard there was a problem in Portlaoise, and three months after the misdiagnosis came to public attention, we still have no explanation for what has happened.I agree with Deputy Howlin that we should not expect the Minister, Deputy Harney, to take the blame for every wrong clinical decision that is made by individual doctors.  When things go wrong, however, I expect the Minister to produce an explanation of what happened.  After ten years in office, the Government should have put in place a health system in which things like this do not happen and in which there is a proper flow of information and communication.  This motion is not about giving the Minister clinical blame — it is about how she has discharged her duties, for which she has legal responsibility under the Health Act 2004 and the Ministers and Secretaries Acts.  Some idea of the Minister for Health and Children's ministerial style can be gleaned from a reply she gave to a parliamentary question some time ago:I do not attend management meetings, nor did I do so in the previous Department.  I believe that is the role of the management in the Department, although we have policy meetings with officials and so on.If the Minister takes this kind of a hands-off approach to the running of her Department, if she acts like some kind of semi-detached non-executive director, then she can only expect to have got what she got last Wednesday; a Department under her control which is out of control; an agency which she set up which does not appear to be under anybody's control and patients who are not getting the quality of health service which they deserve and for which the taxpayers are paying.I move that this House vote no confidence in the Minister for Health and Children.

#UlickBurke	unknown-#UlickBurke-party	unknown-#UlickBurke-dob	unknown-#UlickBurke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-28 00:00:00	Prelude	859	I thank the Ceann Comhairle for allowing me to raise this matter.  Just 12 months ago, the Minister for Finance, in his Budget Statement, announced the mid-Shannon tax incentive scheme to support tourism in the area.  The announcement was welcomed.  Over previous years I and many other public representatives from the mid-Shannon area had asked the previous Minister for Finance, Charlie McCreevy, to extend the pilot scheme for the upper Shannon region to the mid-Shannon region.  The pilot scheme was a major benefit for the upper Shannon and we hope the proposed new scheme will benefit tourism interests in the mid-Shannon area, particularly around Lough Derg.Despite the fact that the scheme was announced 12 months ago and was included in the Finance Act 2007, nothing tangible has been done to indicate that it can get going.  Many people are waiting to invest in the development of the tourism industry in the area.  Over the years it was neglected for development by what was then known as Bord Fáilte.  All the resources went to the west, south and south west.  There was little provision for the development of the tourism industry in the midland area, which borders the Minister for Finance's constituency.The scheme can be commenced by ministerial order so there should be no delay as further legislation is not necessary.  However, it cannot be commenced until the relevant guidelines have been drawn up and agreed.  We have been told for the last six months that the guidelines are in the final stages of preparation.  The scheme must be approved by the European Commission but we do not know if it has been sent to Europe for approval.  Will the Minister of State indicate if it has?  Will the Minister of State also let the people who are interested in the scheme know if the certification board has been established?  Who will be on the board?  What interest groups will be represented on it?Areas in the vicinity of Lough Derg and the mid-Shannon region are covered by the scheme.  The broadest possible range of projects should be included in it.  Marinas and other water-based facilities are to benefit from it as well as land-based projects such as horse riding and other tourist attractions.  These have not been developed to a great extent in the mid-Shannon area.  There are many other major projects possible in the area.  There are, for example, no interpretative centres in the entire Shannon basin but there is a proposal with State agencies involving Portumna Forest Park.  It was due to be developed with the help of Coillte and Tourism Ireland but there is a lack of funding.  I hope that project will get immediate approval.Portumna Castle should also be completed.  For three years not a penny has been spent on the completion of Portumna Castle, aside from on obvious maintenance.  It is a major attraction in Portumna.  The Office of Public Works spent €237,000 on it in the three years 2000-03 but nothing since then, despite the availability of resources.  I hope that project will be included in the scheme.Will the Minister of State indicate whether a board has been established, if the scheme has been sent to the European Commission for approval and if the guidelines and application forms are available?  We were told last year that it was a three-year scheme.  We do not know if the three years date from its inclusion in the Finance Act or if the clock has yet to start ticking.  I hope the Minister of State will clearly outline the position in his reply.
#NoelAhern	unknown-#NoelAhern-party	unknown-#NoelAhern-dob	unknown-#NoelAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-28 00:00:00	Prelude	860	The Deputy has the gist of the situation and I do not think it has developed any further.  I have a rather lengthy reply but I will summarise parts of it.The Deputy knows the background to the scheme.  It is a tax incentive scheme aimed at encouraging the development of tourism infrastructure in the mid-Shannon area.  Legislative provision for the scheme was made in this year's Finance Act.  In the lead-up to budget 2006 a submission proposing a scheme such as this was received from Shannon Development.  This was followed by various other reports and, based on the contents of these reports, the Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism considered that Ireland's inner core appeared to be relatively underdeveloped in terms of tourism but did have sound tourism potential.The designated areas involved in the scheme are in a corridor of about 12 kilometres on either side of the river stretching from roughly the bottom of Lough Derg to Lough Ree.  The scheme is limited to a period of three years, within which qualifying capital expenditure may be incurred.  Projects wishing to avail of relief must get approval in advance and must also obtain formal certification after completion.  As the Deputy mentioned, the approval and certification will be given by a special board established for the purposes of the scheme and will be carried out in accordance with guidelines to be issued by the Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism.  The nature of the tourism infrastructure buildings and structures which may qualify under the scheme will be also set out in these guidelines.Generally, it is proposed that the scheme should concentrate on non-accommodation tourist infrastructure and facilities of a capital nature such as marinas and mooring or docking facilities, leisure centres, sports facilities such as equestrian centres, adventure sport facilities or sailing schools, sports facilities such as golf clubs — but not golf courses, as no capital allowance applies to land — eco-tourism facilities, education and cultural tourism facilities including interpretative centres, health farms and spas, or heritage houses and gardens.  Certain buildings, such as those that facilitate gaming or gambling, are specifically excluded from the scheme, as are licensed premises, but not restaurants.  Tourism facilities that already qualify for capital allowances, such as hotels, guesthouses and holiday hostels, are also excluded.  Accommodation facilities provided as part of a qualifying tourism project may qualify for relief, but expenditure on such accommodation facilities cannot be more than 50% of the overall expenditure on the project or cannot be more than the expenditure on non-accommodation facilities in the project.Relief will be available over seven years for construction and refurbishment expenditure incurred in the qualifying period at the rate of 15% per annum in years one to six and 10% in year seven.  In the case of refurbishment, the qualifying expenditure must exceed 20% of the market value of the property before work commences.  In order to comply with the relevant State aid rules, only 80% of the construction and refurbishment expenditure will qualify for relief in areas which are not in the BMW region.As the Deputy said, the scheme will be commenced by Ministerial order.  However, certain steps must be taken before the order can be signed.  The relevant guidelines must be drawn up and agreed, the scheme must be approved by the European Commission and the certification board must be established.  The development of guidelines has been the subject of ongoing consultations between the Department of Arts, Sports and Tourism and the Department of Finance.  These guidelines and accompanying application forms are now at an advanced stage and will be completed shortly.  I am hopeful that EU Commission approval will follow on foot of notification of the scheme with the completed guidelines.I appreciate the Deputy's point about Portumna Castle, which is not part of the scheme, and the money that was spent over a three-year period.  I could make inquiries within the Department about this.  The Deputy would wish this building to qualify for the scheme.  Negotiations are continuing, although they have been slower than expected.  It is expected that things will be wrapped up fairly soon.

It concerns a former postman who has lived and worked all his life in Sherriff Street and who is now in considerable ill-health.  The only relief he had was a couple of sessions every week with a physiotherapist.  However, due to the recruitment embargo on the health services these sessions have been taken away.  The man, as I said, has multiple and serious ailments such as Parkinson's disease, hypertension, back pain, ulcerated legs, depression, vertigo and an inoperable hernia.  He is on 20 tablets a day.  He is in pain most of the time and can scarcely walk.  He relied heavily on the physiotherapy sessions he received in the Mater Hospital.  Some weeks ago he received notice from the patient services department of the hospital to the effect that the service was being discontinued indefinitely.  I took up the case on his behalf and spoke to the patient services department.  The reply I received was asfollows:I refer to our telephone conversation on 20th November regarding the above named patient and his enquiry as to why his Physiotherapy sessions have been put on hold.I have contacted the Physiotherapy Manager who has advised that unfortunately due to the HSE recruitment embargo on staff we have had to redeploy physiotherapist staff assigned to the provision of out patient services to cover for the care of the older person in patient service.We regret that this has resulted in patients such as [X] being unable to receive out patient rehabilitation at this time.All patients impacted by this decision have been personally contacted by the therapist responsible for their care and the situation with regard to the recruitment embargo and need to redeploy this therapist explained to them.I trust this is in order.This is just the tip of the iceberg in terms of people who are suffering because of the recruitment embargo.  Essentially, the HSE has failed to manage its budget and, running out of money towards the end of the year, placed an embargo on recruitment to various front-line services.  The Minister for Health and Children is responsible for ensuring that her policy on the HSE is implemented.  She should have some sort of monitoring mechanism in place to ensure that patients do not have to suffer towards the end of the year before the following year's budget is put in place.  Large-scale recruitment of management and middle-management has created a bloated bureaucracy in the HSE, and now front-line staff can no longer be recruited in the areas in which they are required.In conclusion, this is a case in which the patient has clearly not been put first.  I would like to see the Minister address this.  Obviously, the Minister also needs to address a number of other cases, but in this case the person is in dire need of the services which he has been refused indefinitely.
#MarieHoctorFF	unknown-#MarieHoctorFF-party	unknown-#MarieHoctorFF-dob	unknown-#MarieHoctorFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-28 00:00:00	Prelude	862	I will take this Adjournment matter on behalf of my colleague, the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Mary Harney.  I begin by thanking the Deputy for raising this issue and for giving me the opportunity to outline the current position on recruitment in the public health service.I stress that the HSE must manage within the resources made available to it by Government and voted by this House.  Managing the budget in the health sector means managing staff and making the best use of the available resources.  Staff costs make up almost 70% of the HSE's overall budget.  In a service of this scale, with an employee cohort of this size, it cannot be the case that every vacancy which arises must be filled immediately.To live within its budget, the HSE must carefully manage the recruitment and deployment of staff.  The board of the HSE is committed to ensuring that staff costs are controlled and managed to best effect, that an appropriate balance is achieved between clinical and non-clinical posts, that there is a better skill mix within the clinical areas and that staffing levels provide cost-effective, safe and high-quality care to patients.The current recruitment pause is a temporary measure initiated as part of the HSE's financial break-even plan and it continues to be monitored by the HSE.  In any instance where a critical or essential vacancy arises, it may be filled through redeployment of existing staff by the relevant line manager or re-assignment of responsibilities based on assessment of priority need.Notwithstanding this, it has been recognised that during the period of this temporary recruitment pause, there are some circumstances where appointment of staff may be necessary in frontline services.  Accordingly, the HSE has put a process in place to evaluate, monitor and approve requests for derogation from the general recruitment pause.  A small group has been established, including a representative of the HSE's national employment monitoring unit, the National Hospitals Office, PCCC and other directorates, and this group meets regularly to consider such applications.  Of the applications received to date, derogations to the value of 520.8 whole-time equivalents have been approved, where posts have been identified as critical to service delivery.There are close to 130,000 people employed in the delivery of our public health and personal social services, the vast majority of whom provide direct service to patients and clients.  The current pause in recruitment must be viewed in this context.  As I have previously stated, it is a temporary measure put in place by the HSE to live within its budget.Since the establishment of the HSE, the number of medical and dental personnel has increased by 1,087 whole-time equivalents, which equates to 15.5%.  The number of nursing personnel has increased by 4,652, or 13.6%, to 38,965.  The number of health and social care professionals has increased by 2,932, or 22.9%, to 15,762.  I draw Deputy Costello's particular attention to the number of physiotherapists, which has increased by 301, or 26.5%, since the establishment of the HSE.  In addition, the number of training places for physiotherapists has increased by 81, from 64 in 1997 to 145 in 2007.  This represents an increase of over 126% in the past ten years.  The House will agree that these changes clearly demonstrate the commitment of my colleague, the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Mary Harney, the Government and the Health Service Executive to ensuring focus on patient care and the recruitment of frontline personnel.

Media reports refer to a locum pathologist who was in place in the Cork University Hospital from July to August of this year, a term of approximately six weeks.  Since then a number of cases have been sent to a laboratory in London for review.  We are not sure how many cases are involved.  There was mention in a newspaper yesterday of 1,000 cases.  There are also reports that 15 patients out of 166 have been recalled and sent for further examination.Yesterday, Deputy Kenny raised this matter with the Taoiseach on Leaders' Questions and the Taoiseach confirmed that there was a review going on in Cork University Hospital related to a pathologist.  He did not give details of exactly how many cases were involved.  When asked when the Minister was made aware of it, the Taoiseach stated she was informed on 23 November, despite the fact that the review is ongoing since September.  That was five days ago, the day after the information came out in the Joint Committee on Health and Children.  Was it a case of this having to come out too and of informing the Minister now, or would she have been informed at all were it not for the publicity last Thursday?There are serious questions and much information which is not coming out and which people have not got.  That is leading to much concern about the pathology services in Cork University Hospital.  I have read reports that this pathologist was previously employed in Galway and left there due to uncertainty and difficulty surrounding the work that was being carried out in the pathology department.  Did this person come directly from Galway to Cork or was there a gap in between?  If there were concerns about the work that was being carried on, how come they were not relayed to Cork University Hospital?  If this person was working in Galway, are there concerns about the work that was being done there by this pathologist?There are many questions that I want answered.  I do not have the information to make a five-minute speech, but I am glad that the Minister of State is here and I hope we will get some resolution to the uncertainty surrounding this situation.
#MarieHoctorFF	unknown-#MarieHoctorFF-party	unknown-#MarieHoctorFF-dob	unknown-#MarieHoctorFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-28 00:00:00	Prelude	870	I thank Deputy Clune for raising this matter.The current position on the review of pathology services in Cork University Hospital is as follows.  Since September last, hospital management at CUH has been carrying out a review of pathology services at the hospital as a result of concerns about the work of a single pathologist who worked in that hospital on a locum basis for a short period in recent months.  Hospital management commissioned an accredited UK laboratory to undertake an independent review of the temporary pathologist's work.The Minister for Health and Children and her Department were informed of this review on 23 November.  The Minister understands that in the course of this review so far, several patients have already been recalled for review and appropriate care by their doctor.  The Minister understands that any further patients who need review will be contacted and offered appropriate care as soon as they are identified.  The HSE has informed departmental officials that it will conclude this review shortly.The pathologist concerned resigned from his position at the request of hospital management at CUH, when information relating to his work became known.  The HSE has informed the Minister that this pathologist no longer works in any of its hospitals.  Steps have been taken to ensure that the regulatory authorities in the jurisdiction where it is believed this person resides have been informed so that they can take appropriate action.The immediate priorities in any review of clinical services are to establish whether the care of any patient has been compromised and, if so, to inform those patients and ensure they receive, as a matter of priority, any necessary clinical assessment and other services and supports.  The Department is working closely with the HSE to ensure that these protocols are applied in the case of the Cork review. The HSE has also indicated that it will publish the results of the review in Cork when it is completed.The events of recent weeks underscore the absolute need for the HSE National Cancer Control Programme to be implemented as soon as possible.  Professor Tom Keane took up his position as director of the cancer control programme last week.  The HSE is putting arrangements in place to enable Professor Keane to take control of all new cancer developments from 1 January 2008 and, progressively, all existing cancer services and related funding and staffing.The delivery of cancer services on a programmatic basis will serve to ensure equity of access to services and equality of patient outcome irrespective of geography.  The recent decisions of the HSE in four managed cancer control networks and eight cancer centres will be implemented on a managed and phased basis.  The designated centres for the HSE southern region are Cork University Hospital and Waterford Regional Hospital.The Government is committed to continuing to make the full range of cancer services available and accessible to cancer patients throughout Ireland in accordance with best international standards, including in the southern region.
#WilliamPenrose	unknown-#WilliamPenrose-party	unknown-#WilliamPenrose-dob	unknown-#WilliamPenrose-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-28 00:00:00	Prelude	871	I sincerely thank the Leas-Cheann Comhairle for allowing me to raise this important matter concerning the delay in — the long-fingering of  — or the placing of additional obstacles or burdens before a number of school projects in County Westmeath which have already commenced.In the case of Clonmellon national school in north Westmeath, on the October bank holiday weekend last a digger was ready to come on site.  The locals, board of management, parents, students and residents of the general Clonmellon area were beside themselves with excitement.  The next minute they got word that the project was put on hold.  I raised this issue in respect of a number of schools by way of parliamentary questions, the replies to which stated that tender reports were under examination and that a report was being awaited regarding Gainstown.The handbrake has been put down on a number of projects in which all necessary steps were taken.  What has occurred in respect of Ballynacarriga national school, my old school, is disgraceful.  It is in a CLÁR area, is part of the DEIS programme and has 96 pupils, but no accommodation has been provided.  Four additional rooms to implement the various policies are required.  The parents council, the board of management and the teachers are disappointed and hurt.  It is similar in Louighahar, an area with an expanding population that needs a new school.  The parents, teachers and principal worked hard, but were let down by the Government.  People are asking where the money has gone or, to use an agricultural term, where is the beef.In 1998, on the advice of the Department's inspector, Clonmellon national school applied for two new classrooms to replace substandard rooms in a 1936 building.  In 1999, it was given permission for the new classrooms and the conversion of the 1936 building into a remedial room, library and computer room and a design team was appointed.  In 2000 following the Department's advice, the brief was changed due to increasing enrolments to build three extra classrooms, a general purpose room and ancillary rooms.  In February 2001, plans were approved by the Department and, in November 2001, the school was advised to proceed to seek planning permission, as it was to be fast-tracked.  Permission for an extension was granted in May 2002.In May 2004, the school received word from the Department to the effect that the latter wanted changes made to the plans before applying for planning permission.  When the Department was told the school already had planning permission, the former claimed that the latter had not been given permission to do so.  In 2006 following a meeting with the Department's chief architect and a revision of the cost plan for the extension, the Department decided it was more economically viable to demolish the school and to build a new generic repeat design building.  The school was assured it would be fast-tracked, as it should be given that eight years had passed.In 2007, the plans had been finalised, planning permission had been granted and the project had gone to tender when the blow came, namely, the Department informed the school that it must wait until budget day to see if there will be funds to continue.  If insufficient funds are available, the Minister will make the final selection as to which projects will proceed.The situation is the same in Gainstown, an area on the fringes of Mullingar with a large population base and an excellent school.  In November 2007, the initial application for a building was made and all 15 stages of background work were completed as required.  Expenses had been paid, the project was under budget and a letter had been received from the Department's architect stating it was allowing the project to proceed to construction without any further approval.  Why is capital spending being taken from Gainstown when the Minister for Finance, Deputy Cowen, stated on 19 November that capital spending is to be increased in this year's budget?The school received a letter dated 7 November which stated that, if the school wanted to invite tenders for the project, it must seek written approval from the Department to commence the process and that, if the school had already initiated the tender project, which was the case, the school must obtain the Department's written approval to award a contract.  It is a delaying process.The letter of 7 November was addressed to the chairman and not Fr. Kilmartin, the chairman of the board of management.  What is occurring?  The project is under budget and has been on time with each phase.  To stop the Gainstown building project now is not sound financial practice.  Gainstown's submission is a model submission and has been from the outset.  The school made contact and was told that all schools got the letter, it was a countrywide issue, everything, including expenditure, is to be monitored and re-examined and the school is up the line.  Why is the school up the line?  It is eight years down the road.  A snail could get to Dublin from Mullingar in that time.In recent days, another handbrake has been placed on the development of Athlone community college.  In November 2006, the CEO and others were informed that the second phase of schools with applications submitted for major development work, a total of 18, were invited to enter into the architectural design process.  The college, which was one of the schools selected, was invited to an information meeting with others.  The college went and was thrilled to be informed by the Department that there would be no delays, but there has been a lack of progress.  The Westmeath VEC is unhappy with the lack of progress in this project and the manner in which the timescale given by the Department has not been adhered to.  Last week, it met officials and was assured it would be given approval to appoint a project supervisor for the design phase before moving on to a full design team.  Unfortunately, the project has stalled.There are similar concerns in Kinnegad, where a new school was promised in school accommodation reports.  The Department will not confirm which bodies will be involved therein, whether it will be the VEC, the college etc.  Mullingar's new school is off the radar for the time being.  What signal is the Department's radar reading?  This is a critical matter for a number of County Westmeath's schools.  I ask that the handbrake be released and funding be allowed to flow to the Clonmellon, Louighahar, Gainstown and Ballynacarriga national schools and Athlone community college.  I want the green light to be given to schools in Kinnegad and Mullingar because their burgeoning populations must be accommodated.

The proposed projects involve the construction of new schools at Clonmellon and Louighahar and the provision of an extension at Gainstown.  Planning permission and a fire certificate have been obtained and the tender reports for all three projects are being examined by the Department's building unit.Under the national development plan, €4.5 billion has been assigned to the capital requirements of the primary and post-primary sectors.  More than €540 million will be spent this year on school buildings.  The level of construction alone in the primary and post-primary sectors in 2007 is such that it will deliver more than 700 classrooms to provide permanent accommodation for approximately 17,500 pupils.The progression of all largescale building projects from initial design stage through to construction phase is considered on an ongoing basis in the context of the Department's multiannual school building and modernisation programme in which the main focus is to deliver school places within rapidly developing areas.  The progression of the schools referred to by the Deputy, as is the case with all largescale projects, will be considered in this context.I assure the Deputy that the Minister for Education and Science is committed to providing suitable high quality accommodation for Clonmellon, Louighahar and Gainstown national schools at the earliest possible date.

#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-28 00:00:00	Prelude	876	Community Employment (CE) is an active labour market programme designed to provide eligible long term unemployed people and other disadvantaged persons (including those with a disability) with an opportunity to engage in useful work within their communities on a fixed term basis. CE helps unemployed people to re-enter the active workforce by breaking their experience of unemployment through a return to a work routine and to assist them to enhance and develop both their technical and personal skills.In April 2000 participation on CE by an individual was capped at 3 years.  The 3 year-cap was amended in August 2001 to allow particularly disadvantaged persons to remain on the programme for a further period.  These participation limits were introduced to facilitate the movement of participants through the programme, allowing new participants who may not otherwise have such an opportunity to avail of the programme.However, to cater for older workers in particular, in November 2004 I revised the 3 year CE participation limit to allow those of 55 years of age and over to avail of a 6-year period on CE.  Subsequently, the participation limit for persons eligible for CE based on a Social Welfare disability linked payment (including those under 55 years) was increased by 1 year.  These measures were introduced in recognition of the fact that older participants and participants with a disability may find it more difficult to progress into the open labour market.In the majority of cases where an individual exits the programme they are replaced by another eligible participant within the overall approved level.  This supports the continued delivery of service provision by sponsor groups.  As regards difficulties faced by Community groups, I am informed by FÁS that participation limits will continue to be operated flexibly at local level.CE remains as an active labour market programme with the emphasis on progression into employment.  The programme is managed within this context, with consideration given to the availability of resources and the needs of participants and the community.  The overall operation of the scheme is therefore kept under constant review.For those exiting CE and those not meeting the standard eligibility criteria for the programme, FÁS/Local Employment Service Offices provide information on other available employment and training opportunities.In addition to FÁS employment programmes, a range of initiatives are in place to assist the reintegration of long-term unemployed persons and disadvantaged groups into the open labour market. These include:the National Employment Action Plan preventative process which entails the systematic engagement and referral by the Department of Social and Family Affairs of persons six months on the Live Register, to FÁS , for interview. In the period 1st January-31st October 2007 39,913 clients have been referred under this process.The Customised Training Fund and the High Support Process (HSP), have been integrated and renamed the Technical Employment Support Grant (TESG).  It allows employment services officers to implement a range of responses for clients who are experiencing major barriers in progressing from unemployment to the workforce. A budget of up to €2,500 per person is available for this purpose.the Pathways programme is a two-week group guidance programme for disadvantaged FÁS clients identified under the preventative process. The aim of the programme is to identify the most appropriate development pathway for each participant that will assist him or her to obtain and maintain employment. In 2006, 168 clients attended 14 pathways programmes nationally.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-28 00:00:00	Prelude	877	The Government has approved the drafting by the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel of the Companies Consolidation and Reform Bill along the lines of the General Scheme prepared by the Company Law Review Group.The General Scheme was designed to provide an appropriate framework for the formation and operation of companies and is framed primarily with private, commercially operating, companies in mind. The underlying philosophy behind the proposals in the General Scheme is to simplify company law for the benefit of business operators and company law practitioners.Recognising the role that company law could play in relation to property management companies, the Company Law Review Group consulted widely on its proposals and gave specific consideration to that aspect. As a result, the General Scheme contains a number of provisions with the express intention of facilitating the use of the company structure by multi-unit developments. For example, the membership limit of 99 which will ordinarily apply to the most common company type, the private company limited by shares, will not apply in the case of a residential management company. Also, the membership of a residential management company will be deemed to transfer from the vendor to the purchaser upon the sale of the underlying property to which the membership relates. These proposals represent very specific carve-outs from the general provisions concerning the standard private company limited by shares.Finally, I should point out that the regulation of specific sectors, or the specific activities that companies engage in, can be treated by way of provisions in the company ‘constitution' (currently known as the Memorandum and Articles of Association), as provided for in the General Scheme.
#BillyKelleher	unknown-#BillyKelleher-party	unknown-#BillyKelleher-dob	unknown-#BillyKelleher-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-28 00:00:00	Prelude	878	The number of inspections/visits undertaken by Inspection Services in 2006 and to date in 2007 to check compliance with the Protection of Young Persons Act (Employment), Act, 1996 are as follows:in 2006; 3,347 inspections/visits were undertaken, 1,766 of which were conducted at night-time; andto date in 2007; 1,123 inspections/visits were undertaken, 284 of which were conducted at night-time.The National Employment Rights Authority, NERA, will shortly embark on its annual campaign to ensure compliance with the legislation. This campaign will target in particular the licensed/catering and retail trade, where many of these young workers will be employed. It is expected that by year end the number of inspections under this legislation will be similar to last year.The Protection of Young Persons (Employment) Act, 1996 is designed to protect the health of young workers and to ensure that work during the school years does not put a young person's education at risk. The provisions of the Act encompass arrangements that are differentiated by reference to the age of young persons concerned, their school going status and whether school holidays are in effect.It is an increasing reality that many young people are taking on jobs, be it part time or full time during holiday periods. While many enjoy a very positive experience there is a risk that others may be exploited. It is important therefore that young people are aware of their rights and what steps they can take should they find those being breached.I would encourage employers to make themselves aware of their obligations under the Protection of Young Persons Act by contacting the National Employment Rights Authority's Information Services on 1890 80 80 90. I would also urge young workers who consider themselves to be victims of exploitation or others who may be aware of breaches of the legislation to contact the Authority.
#BillyKelleher	unknown-#BillyKelleher-party	unknown-#BillyKelleher-dob	unknown-#BillyKelleher-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-28 00:00:00	Prelude	879	The Government is committed to delivering the key package of measures agreed under the chapter dealing with Employment Rights and Compliance in Towards 2016.In this regard the National Employment Rights Authority (NERA) has been established on an interim basis since February 2007. NERA has Department of Finance sanction for 141 staff, including an increased complement of 90 Labour Inspectors. An allocation of €8.553 million was provided under Vote 34 for the year 2007.Three units which were formerly part of the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, have been subsumed into NERA – the Employment Rights Information Unit, the Labour Inspectorate and the Prosecution / Enforcement Unit.The Director of NERA was appointed and took up duty on 12 February 2007. The Director is supported in his role by a management team including legal and accounting expertise and an administrative staff which are now fully in place.Recruitment of the additional Inspectors is also progressing. The number of Inspectors has increased from 31 to 51. Final interviews for a further 10 Inspectors with language skills took place on 5th November. Interviews for the remaining 29 Inspectors were completed on the 23rd November.I am pleased with the progress made to date and I am confident that, subject to all the successful candidates accepting appointments offered, all 90 appointments will be made by end of 2007, in accordance with the commitment under Towards 2016.As part of the Government decentralisation programme, NERA established its headquarters in Carlow at the end of July 2007. The Social Partnership Agreement "Towards 2016" also provided that the Labour Inspectorate, now part of NERA, would be established on a regional basis and in this regard, the new regional structure of NERA Inspectorate is being progressed.In addition to Inspectors located in NERA headquarters in Carlow, regional offices of the Inspectorate will be located in Dublin, Cork, Shannon and Sligo. At this time, inspectors are operating out of the NERA headquarters in Carlow, Dublin and temporary accommodation in Cork. In consultation with OPW, permanent premises have been leased in Cork and will be occupied once furnished with the assistance of OPW. In relation to Sligo, a permanent premises has been identified and is the subject of lease negotiations. In relation to Shannon, temporary accommodation has been secured while the permanent premises is under construction. The projected completion date for the permanent premises is March 2008.In line with the commitment under Towards 2016, joint investigation activity and exchange of information activity has commenced with Inspectors from NERA, the Revenue Commissioners and the Department of Social and Family Affairs. The necessary legislative provisions to enable the exchange of information between the three bodies came into effect on 30th March with the enactment of the Social Welfare and Pensions Act 2007.An information provision and public awareness campaign is being actively planned and a series of meetings with stakeholders have been undertaken to initiate structured dialogue between NERA and stakeholders.The necessary legislation to give statutory authority to NERA is being progressed through the preparation of the Employment Law Compliance Bill which will be published this year.  I am pleased with the progress made to date.

However, Inspection Services reserves the right to initiate prosecutions in respect of breaches of certain employment legislation. Decisions in relation to prosecutions are made in the light of, among other matters, the particular circumstances of the case and the willingness of employees to give evidence in court proceedings.The Deputy should be aware that Rights Commissioners of the Labour Relations Commission, a body independent of my Department, also hear complaints concerning breaches of the National Minimum Wage Act 2000.As outlined above, a focused employment rights compliance inspection campaign took place recently in sectors covered by the National Minimum Wage. Such targeted campaigns, accompanied by awareness and promotional activities, will be a significant feature of NERA's future employment rights compliance and information strategy.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-28 00:00:00	Prelude	881	The number of companies located in the Shannon Free Zone in the years 2004, 2005 and 2006 was 112, 109 and 101 respectively.  Employment in these companies for these years was 7472, 7207 and 7188.  The number of companies was unchanged for the first half of this year but employment figures for 2007, which are compiled on a full year basis, will not be available until early in 2008.The Zone has performed well against a very difficult global business background and whilst job losses are always regrettable, an overall reduction of 284 or 3.8% over a three year period to 2006 for over 100 Free Zone companies is understandable in the context of the severe competitive pressures facing industry today.  While the overall employment trend for the Zone in recent years has been marginally downward, significant gains have also been made with 573 new jobs created in 2004, 450 in 2005 and 549 in 2006. Latest available figures show companies located in the Free Zone spend in excess of €610 million on wages and Irish sourced materials and generate sales of €3.3billion, with over 70% of these sales accounted for by the international services sector.Shannon Development is committed to facilitating the Free Zone's manufacturing base move up the value chain through capability enhancement programmes with a strong emphasis being placed on R&D supports.  Substantial investment in next generation office space such as the 1million sq ft Westpark Campus development at Shannon represents a serious vote of confidence in the Zone's ability to continue to attract world leaders in the international services and other sectors.As part of its three year Corporate Plan drawn up to give effect to its new mandate, Shannon Development is at an advanced stage in overseeing a comprehensive masterplan to regenerate the Shannon Free Zone and adjoining areas. The masterplan is being prepared by external consultants in close cooperation with all key stakeholders, including IDA Ireland and Shannon Airport, and will serve as the basis for regeneration and development of the Zone in the coming years.This multi-million investment implementation will result in large scale development of offices, laboratories, factories and warehouses, which will provide accommodation for businesses in key growth sectors and maintain the Shannon Free Zone's leading position in the international market into the future.  IDA Ireland, in cooperation with Shannon Development, is continuing to market the Zone as a centre for FDI through its network of overseas offices.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-28 00:00:00	Prelude	882	The legally binding agreements covering the payment of industrial grants by IDA to its client companies provide, among other things, that companies are obliged to repay grants in their entirety in the event of the project not proceeding. I am satisfied that the company concerned is fully aware if its obligation to repay the grant in its entirety.Where a contractual entitlement to recover a grant arises, it is entirely a matter for the agency that is party to the contract to effect the recovery.  I understand that the IDA has not yet sought recovery of the monies in this case.As I said in the House on 24th October last the decision by Amgen to postpone indefinitely their proposed development at the Carrigtwohill site was based purely on developments related to the company's global business and is not in any way a reflection on the business environment in this Country.  It is expected that the company, which has spent $100million on site acquisition, conceptual design and site clearance preparation, will retain ownership of the site.  IDA Ireland will continue to maintain contact with Amgen as the company works through its restructuring phase.While I am very disappointed at this turn of events, it must be noted that the Cork Gateway is still vibrant in what it can offer potential investors, particularly in sectors such as pharmaceuticals, medical technologies and internationally traded services.There are currently 133 IDA assisted companies in County Cork employing almost 20,000 people.  Cork City and County have benefited greatly from a number of important investment announcements this year which demonstrates the attractiveness of the greater Cork area as a location for investment, by both existing companies already located there as well as new overseas client companies choosing Cork as their location of choice.  A total of nine Foreign Direct Investment projects have been announced for Cork City and County since the start of 2007, with an estimated 1,000 jobs to be created at full operation.  In fact, IDA Ireland has, over the last 3 years, approved new projects for the Cork area with a job potential of over 3,100 people at full operation.  I am confident that the policies being pursued for Cork City and County by the development agencies will continue pay dividends in terms of investment and jobs for the region.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-28 00:00:00	Prelude	883	Under the Employment Permits Acts 2003 and 2006 it is illegal for a national from outside the European Economic Area to be in employment without an employment permit, except in specific circumstances.  It is not possible to establish the precise number of people from other countries working illegally in Ireland. However, measures are being taken to restrict illegal working in Ireland.Under the 2006 Act, data may be exchanged between my Department and the Department of Social and Family Affairs, the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform and the Revenue Commissioners. This has significantly enhanced the enforcement capacity of these Departments and agencies.In addition, a major package of measures has been agreed by the parties to Towards 2016, the new Social Partnership Agreement, to provide for enhanced public confidence in the system of compliance. New legislation, to be brought before the Oireachtas shortly, will empower the Labour Inspectorate of the National Employment Rights Authority to join with the Department of Social and Family Affairs and the Revenue Commissioners to work together in Joint Investigation Units. Such units will have a particular focus on the employment status of workers. The National Employment Rights Authority is currently working with the Department of Social and Family Affairs and the Revenue Commissioners with a view to the early establishment and operation of Joint Investigation Units within existing legal and administrative frameworks.Towards 2016 also includes a number of other specific commitments in relation to employment status and in relation to the "Hidden Economy".  The Government and social partners have agreed under Towards 2016 to review the application of the existing Code of Practice on employee status with a view to more effective implementation.  My Department will be actively involved in that review.  In addition, the Government and the social partners agreed under Towards 2016 to continue and expand the work of the Hidden Economy Working Group, which will make an important contribution in this area. This group comprises representatives of my own Department and the National Employment Rights Authority as well as the Office of the Revenue Commissioners, the Department of Social and Family Affairs, the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, the Irish Business and Employers Confederation, the Small Firms Association and the Construction Industry Federation.

I understand that, in response to a public consultation in relation to a draft toll scheme for the M50, the Agency recently made a formal submission to the National Roads Authority.  I would advise the Deputy that I do not have any direct responsibility in relation to the National Roads Authority.I wish to point out that the process as laid down in the Roads Act 1993 provides parties who are concerned in relation to Draft Toll Schemes with the opportunity to express their concerns and to have those concerns considered prior to any decision being taken in relation to any Scheme. I am confident that the views of the National Consumer Agency will be considered before any final decision is made in relation to proposed Toll Scheme for the M50
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-28 00:00:00	Prelude	886	Price display law is covered by Orders made under Section 19 of the Prices Acts 1958 to 1972 and under the European Communities (Requirements to Indicate Product Prices) Regulations 2002, Statutory Instrument No. 639 of 2002.  The various Price Display Orders made under the Prices Acts 1958 to 1972 cover Drinks Display in Licensed Premises, Hairdressing Services, Petrol and Diesel and Restaurants.  The European Communities (Requirements to Indicate Product Prices) Regulations 2002 require retailers to display the selling and, where appropriate, the unit price (the price per litre or kilo) for all products covered by the scope of the Regulations.The National Consumer Agency whose function it is to enforce consumer laws, regularly undertakes surveillance with a view to securing voluntary compliance on the part of traders.  In July 2007, my Department published a consultation paper on the Consumer Information (Advertisements for Concert or Theatre Performances) Order 1997 which contained proposals designed to broaden the scope and enhance the transparency of the price information provided to consumers about concerts, theatrical performances and other events.   Follow-up meetings have been held with a wide range of interested parties and I hope to be in a position to introduce new Regulations in this area in 2008.
#BillyKelleher	unknown-#BillyKelleher-party	unknown-#BillyKelleher-dob	unknown-#BillyKelleher-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-28 00:00:00	Prelude	887	Figures published by the Health and Safety Authority show that in 2006 there were 50 recorded fatalities in Ireland as a result of work related accidents, compared to 74 work-related deaths in 2005, 50 in 2004 and 68 in 2003.As regards construction, there were 12 fatalities in 2006 and 23, 16, and 20 for the years 2005, 2004 and 2003 respectively.  Of the 12 fatalities in 2006, 11 were workers and 1 was a member of the public.  Last year saw the introduction of significant legislative change in the construction sector with the introduction of the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work (Construction) Regulations 2006 (S.I. No. 504 of 2006) from 1 November.The Construction Regulations 2006 build on design and management requirements introduced in earlier Regulations and also on the duties related to construction work set out in section 17 of the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act 2005.To improve health and safety standards on construction sites, the Health and Safety Authority has to date in 2007:carried out a focused programme of 6,024 construction site inspections covering appointment of competent designers, project supervisors and contractors, safety and health plans and safety statements, work at heights, traffic management and vehicle-reversing safety, welfare arrangements, and slips, trips and falls on a level,carried out 91 inspections of designers concentrating on design risk assessments for work at a height and the provision of slip resistant floor surfaces,held 2 Construction Campaigns focusing on work at heights, safe use of ladders, working platforms, vehicle safety, traffic management, health surveillance and Safe System of Work Plans awareness,produced information notes and guidance on Work at Height Regulations and in particular the Safe use of Ladders and Working Platforms,developed a Code of Practice on Safety Statements for employers of three or less in construction,developed a Code of Practice for Scaffolding,developed a Code of Practice for Overhead Power Lines,updated Guidance to reflect the 2006 Construction Regulations,developed in conjunction with the Local Authorities a Safe System of Work Plan (SSWP) for Road Maintenance.In addition, there is a considerable emphasis on safety in the high risk sectors, including construction, in the Health and Safety Authority's Work Programme for 2008.
#BillyKelleher	unknown-#BillyKelleher-party	unknown-#BillyKelleher-dob	unknown-#BillyKelleher-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-28 00:00:00	Prelude	888	I propose to take Questions Nos. 78, 80, 84 to 87, inclusive, and 112 together.As part of the Government's commitment under the partnership agreement — Towards 2016 — I am currently considering the final elements of proposals for the draft Scheme of a Bill to regulate the employment agency sector. I intend to submit a Memorandum to Government very shortly seeking approval to have the Bill drafted by the Parliamentary Counsel to the Government.The Bill as drafted will reflect the commitment, in Towards 2016, to a licensing system where, to be licensed, employment agencies will be required to comply with the terms of a Statutory Code of Practice which will set out the practices and standards which employment agencies would be expected to follow. A Monitoring and Advisory Committee will advise me on the Code of Practice and on other matters related to this sector of our economy. This Committee will include representatives of the Social Partners and of the Agency sector. Other elements in the Bill are aimed at further strengthening and enhancing the effective enforcement of the employment rights of agency workers.In the course of consultations on the proposed Bill some parties have raised matters not included in the current partnership agreement, including pay parity from the commencement of employment. This demand is outside the scope of measures agreed in Towards 2016 and, in any case, does not have due regard to the arrangements in other Member States.My Department has engaged with ICTU regarding assertions that agency workers are being used increasingly to undermine basic labour standards and are precipitating a so-called "drive to the bottom". However, the Department has not been supplied with specific evidence supporting this thesis and the argument to date has hinged on anecdotal evidence. We would be interested in seeing any hard evidence in this area.I am aware of suggestions that Ireland is one of only three EU Member States which has failed to legislate for equal treatment for agency workers in terms of pay and conditions of employment. However practice in relation to agency working in other EU Member States is not always what it might appear at first glance. The situation is far more complex than that portrayed. Thus, for example, in Member States where legislation is complemented by collective agreements, deviation from the equal wage clause in legislation may be permitted. There is also wide variation in the nature and extent of wider employment rights and working conditions attained by agency workers in collective agreements such as, in the case of statutory sick pay and pension rights. In addition, in some Member States various restrictions and prohibitions are in place in which agency working is excluded from whole sectors of economic activity.In the context of the European Union negotiations on the proposed EU Directive on Temporary Agency Work, Ireland will continue to adopt a constructive approach in these discussions. However, Ireland considers that the proposal for consideration, as currently drafted, is somewhat imbalanced. We have concerns about exemptions, or derogations, which would be to the benefit or advantage of some Member States and not others. In this regard, Ireland has, with other Member States, indicated that if permanent derogations through collective agreements are to be allowed then other means providing for derogations should also be allowed in those Member States without collective agreements.Thus, Ireland considers that the derogation from equal treatment provided for in Article 5.4 of the proposed Directive, in respect of short-duration temporary agency assignments of a maximum of six weeks, is far too short. This is particularly so in comparison to the derogation available to those Member States, with collective agreements which can and do deviate from equal treatment in pay levels and in the areas of wider working and employment conditions, under the terms of Article 5.3 of the proposed Directive. In some cases these derogations can be for six months, or longer.A longer time period than that currently on offer in respect of short-duration assignments — than the maximum six weeks now being proposed under Article 5.4 — would represent a more balanced approach. The shorter time period currently on offer could damage future job creation prospects and could deter the use of temporary agency working which would be to the detriment of our economy. This is particularly the case as agency work can provide, in certain circumstances, a useful stepping- stone for some persons to enter the labour market. The opportunities available to agency workers should not be reduced as a result of any new arrangements. Overall, the longer period being sought would provide the best balance between employment creation and flexibility, on the one hand, with employment protection and security on the other.Ireland will continue to adopt a constructive approach to these discussions. In principle we support the thrust of the Directive but we are still participants in a wider negotiation on the details.In Ireland, agency workers, as with other employees, who comply with the requirements of the Redundancy Acts 1967 to 2007, attain rights following a continuous period of service of two years. In the case of redundancies of agency workers in Seagate, in Derry, in October 2007, the company in question is outside the State and matters in that regard fall to be considered by legislation that applies in a separate jurisdiction.Finally, despite frequent assertions to the contrary, Ireland's comprehensive body of employment rights legislation provides that employee protection applies to migrant workers in Ireland and also to agency and posted workers who have entered into a contract of employment that provides for him or her being employed in the State or who works in the State under a contract of employment. Enforcement is through the Labour Inspectorate, or, before dispute resolution bodies such as the Rights Commissioner Service, Labour Court and Employment Appeals Tribunal. I urge anyone who has evidence of the mistreatment of agency workers to furnish all the relevant details and any related materials to the Inspectorate with a view to pursuing the matter.

In addition, Shannon Development is the regional economic development agency for the mid-west region, and has specific responsibility for Foreign Direct Investment in the Shannon Free Zone. My Department has put in place a range of strategies, programmes and financial incentives to promote economic and enterprise development that will support sustainable employment throughout the country.Enterprise Ireland (EI) recently launched their new strategy, ‘Transforming Irish Industry 2008-2010', which focuses on facilitating entrepreneurship and the enterprise environment in local and rural communities; driving the creation of innovation based start-ups, actively engaging in the Community Enterprise Scheme and proactively developing existing clients in all regions.Enterprise Ireland works with almost 490 client companies in the West Region employing 11,578 people. In the Midlands, EI works with over 300 companies employing over 8,700 people (Forfás — Annual Employment Survey 2006).EI has approved support for Community owned/led Enterprise Centres in 30 locations approximately in the West & Midlands Regions, which is helping to provide much needed workspace for the creation of new projects/businesses. In addition, I am informed that two community enterprise centres in the West & Midlands Regions were successful in their bid for funding under the Community Enterprise Scheme, as follows:€300,000 for Roscommon IT & Knowledge Centre Ltd, and€532,500 for OAK Partnership, Edenderry,Support is available for both capital infrastructure and management support.The County and City Enterprise Boards (CEBs) in the midland and western regions provide a source of support to small businesses with 10 employees or fewer.  Subject to certain eligibility criteria new and developing enterprises may qualify for financial and non-financial support. During 2006 the Midland Region CEB's, composed of Longford, Westmeath, Laois and Offaly paid out over €1.04m in grant assistance to 120 clients.  This intervention has assisted in the creation of 73 jobs in the region. The CEBs in the Western Region, comprising of Galway, Mayo and Roscommon have paid out over €1.28m in grant assistance to 114 clients, which in turn, has enabled the creation of 228 jobs in the area.A central goal for IDA Ireland is the achievement of balanced regional development. The National Spatial Strategy provides a framework for achievement of this goal through the prioritisation of development and investment in the gateway and hub locations such as Galway, Limerick, Shannon, Athlone, Tuam and Mullingar. On this basis, IDA Ireland seeks to attract Foreign Direct Investment into the gateways and hubs as well as a small number of additional locations in these regions. In the West, IDA is working with key overseas companies such as Medtronics, Boston Scientific and Baxter Healthcare. In the Midlands, some of the agencies clients include Tyco Healthcare, Elan and Abbot Laboratories.  Both the Midlands and the Western regions will also benefit from the ongoing investment in transport, energy and utilities set out in the new National Development Plan.IDA Ireland is also working closely with educational institutions in the Region, in developing the skill sets necessary to attract high value added employment. The agency also works with FÁS to provide guidance in developing the skill sets needed by those already in the workforce who are interested in upskilling.

The total number of people recorded on the live register for October is 157,449.  This equals the average numbers recorded on the live register for the year in both 2005 and 2006 and is less than that recorded in the previous four months of 2007.The Department of Social and Family Affairs maintains the Live Register.  The Live Register is not designed to measure unemployment.  It includes part-time, seasonal and casual workers entitled to unemployment benefit.Unemployment is measured by the Quarterly National Household Survey, collated and published by the Central Statistics Office.  The most recent Quarterly National Household Survey, Quarter 3, 2007 indicates that employment has increased by 67,600 in the year.  The unemployment rate is currently at 4.7%, down from 4.8% in the same period last year.Employment growth has occurred in practically all sectors over the past year with a drop showing in two sectors in the most recent quarter — (i) agriculture, forestry and fishing and (ii) transport, storage and communication.

Twenty of these Inspectors were recruited in 2007 and have already undergone the core modules of the NERA Inspector training course.  All fifty-one Inspectors are involved in carrying out inspections and other associated enquiries at places of work with a view to determining compliance with certain employment rights legislation.The Public Appointments Service's recruitment and selection process for 10 Inspectors with specific language skills has now been completed while my Department's competitions for the remaining Inspector positions were completed yesterday (27th November 2007).

None of these Directives is overdue.  One Directive is due for transposition by the end of 2007 and eleven further Directives are scheduled to be transposed in 2008 and subsequent years.  My Department has received 24 Reasoned Opinions from the European Commission related to Directives since 2002. The outstanding issues concerning all but two of these Directives have been resolved satisfactorily.Corrective measures are currently being taken in the context of legislation to introduce a public lending right to address a European Court of Justice ruling against Ireland for incorrect transposition of Directive 92/100/EC related to rental rights and lending rights in the field of intellectual property. In that regard, I would hope that the Copyright and Related Rights (Amendment) Bill 2007 will be enacted before the end of 2007.On 23 October 2007, twelve Member States, including Ireland, received a Reasoned Opinion concerning the implementation of Council Directive 96/82/EC on the control of major accident hazards involving dangerous substances as amended by Directive 2003/105/EC (known as the Seveso Directive).

#BillyKelleher	unknown-#BillyKelleher-party	unknown-#BillyKelleher-dob	unknown-#BillyKelleher-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-28 00:00:00	Prelude	895	The provisions regarding private sector pay in the social partnership agreement, Towards 2016, were agreed by negotiation between the parties to the agreement. The agreed pay terms will begin to expire at the end of March 2008 and it is envisaged that the Social Partners will commence the next round of pay negotiations early in 2008.It is the Government's firm view that a wage inflationary spiral is in nobody's interest.  Indeed, that would be to everyone's detriment — with the low-paid and the vulnerable suffering most.  I think that position is shared by all the parties to the pay terms of Towards 2016.Wage moderation can be a powerful counter-inflationary tool, while excessive wage growth can be a strong driver of rising prices.  Above all, what we must not do is embed inflation more deeply and price ourselves out of jobs and growth through an unworkable formula of wage demands chasing inflation.
#BillyKelleher	unknown-#BillyKelleher-party	unknown-#BillyKelleher-dob	unknown-#BillyKelleher-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-28 00:00:00	Prelude	896	Data from the CSO quarterly industrial survey show that average industrial earnings per hour for male industrial workers on adult rates in June 2007 was €16.62. For female industrial workers the average rate was €12.73.From the CSO National Employment Survey, March 2003, average hourly earnings were €17.74 for males and €14.93 for females. These latter figures cover the entire economy (excluding employees in agriculture, forestry and fishing).The gender pay gap has fallen consistently and is now below the EU average of 15%.  The most recent official figures from Eurostat  (2005) put the gender pay gap at 9%, placing Ireland fourth lowest among the EU27.  This compares with a rate of 14% in 2003, showing a drop of 5% in two years.Primary responsibility for policy in relation to the gender pay gap is a matter for my colleague the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform.  Addressing the factors behind the gender pay gap is, however, a multi faceted task involving a number of Government Departments and agencies as outlined in the National Women's Strategy, 2007-2016.  The Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment undertakes the following actions.I am responsible for the National Minimum Wage legislation.  The national minimum wage was introduced in Ireland in April 2000.  Since its introduction there have been six increases to the minimum rate.  The most recent increase saw the minimum wage increase to €8.65 per hour, which is the second highest in the EU. The introduction of the national minimum wage in 2000 has had a positive impact on women who previously were more likely to have received very low wages in sectors which were predominantly female.  Prior to the introduction of the minimum wage, the gender pay gap was at 22%.My Department is responsible for chairing and providing the secretariat for the National Framework Committee on Work/life Balance Policies. This Committee, which was established under the social partnership process, comprises representatives from IBEC, ICTU, the Equality Authority and a number of Government Departments.  The Committee has undertaken and continues to undertake a range of activities to raise awareness and encourage the provision of work/life balance at the level of the enterprise, including the provision of financial assistance to organisations, information dissemination activities, seminars, research etc.  "Expanding the Workforce", which is run by FÁS, is aimed at proactively encouraging women to return to work. The initiative facilitates women returnees by ensuring that training is provided in a flexible manner and is tailored to meet business requirements and skills needs of employers.

Enforcement authorities from 15 member states and Norway examined 447 airline websites to identify whether legal requirements were being met in relation to price information, limitations on ticket availability and fair contract terms.  The investigation found that 226 of the airline websites showed irregularities in respect of the consumer law requirements under examination.The next phase of the enforcement action comprises the further investigation of websites found to have irregularities.  The airlines concerned will be asked to clarify their practices and, where necessary, to correct them.  Those who fail to take corrective action could face legal action by national enforcement authorities acting on their own behalf or, under the Consumer Protection Co-Operation Regulation, on behalf of enforcement authorities in other member states. European Union consumer legislation is enforced at national level and penalties for breaches of that legislation are set by member states and, as a consequence, take different forms in different member states.I understand that the National Consumer Agency has been examining various aspects of the airline industry in recent months, including the issues covered by the Commission ‘sweep'.  It plans to engage directly with the airlines concerned in the period ahead with a view to securing voluntary compliance.  If this is not forthcoming, enforcement action will be taken by the Agency where warranted.

The Employment Equality Acts 1998 and 2004, among other things, protects against discrimination on the ground of age in relation to access to employment.  However, they also permit an employer to decide on a retirement age in a particular employment to give flexibility to employers and employees, having due regard to the nature of the work being performed.There is therefore no single fixed retirement age for employees in Ireland, though the usual retirement age is 65.  Retirement age is set out in a persons contract of employment, some of which do have a mandatory retirement age.  However, it is open to the employee and employer to negotiate another contract.  Many employment contracts have provisions for early retirement from age 60 or in some cases from age 55 and most have provision for early retirement on health grounds.  Where an employee is subject to a mandatory retirement age in their job, there is nothing to prevent them taking up a different job when they retire or taking up self-employment.With effect from 1 April, 2004, it is not compulsory for new entrants to the public service to retire at a particular age if they are fit and willing to remain in employment.  The existing retirement conditions, in agreement with the relevant unions, been retained for existing employees.  To do otherwise would be a breach of the terms and conditions of employment of employees.  To encourage longer working and to improve income support for older people, the new enhanced State pension (non-contributory) for those over 66 years featured an employment earnings disregard incentive amounting to €200 per week in 2007.The National Pensions Review, published last year, made a number of recommendations to encourage people to continue working after normal retirement age.  This included allowing people to defer receiving their social welfare pension at normal pension age and to grant them an actuarially enhanced payment when they claim.  The Government has recently published a Green Paper on pensions as part of the social partnership agreement, Towards 2016, with a view to developing a framework for future pensions policy.  This includes an examination of the issues surrounding pensions and retirement age.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-28 00:00:00	Prelude	899	There are four recommendations in the ICTU document ‘A Fair Way In', two of which directly relate to my Department.  The first recommendation states that undocumented workers must be guaranteed, in law, access to, and protection under, all employment rights law, including their trade union rights.Ireland's body of employment rights legislation protects all workers employed on an employer-employee basis in Ireland. The second recommendation states that demand for undocumented labour be reduced by increased labour inspection and focusing sanctions on employers.The Social Partnership Agreement "Towards 2016" provides that the number of Labour Inspectors (now known as NERA Inspection Services which is encompassed within the National Employment Rights Authority) would be progressively increased from 31 to 90 by end-2007. Recruitment of the additional Inspectors is progressing and will be completed, in line with the commitment under Towards 2016, by the end of 2007.The primary role of the Inspection Services, in the case of breaches of employment rights legislation is to seek compliance from the employer and rectification of any breaches identified. Where breaches have not been rectified or in certain other circumstances, the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment uses his statutory power to prosecute employers who breach certain provisions of protective employment legislation.  These prosecutions against employers may be taken regardless of the status of the employees.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-28 00:00:00	Prelude	900	The price of a range of foods has increased in the last number of months. In this regard, the October 2007 Consumer Price Index as published by the Central Statistics Office shows that the price of food and non alcoholic beverages increased by 1.4% in the month and this was one of the main factors contributing to the increase in the annual rate of inflation to 4.8%.As I advised the House in my reply of 24th October 2007 to a previous question on the same matter (PQ 25386/07 refers), rising food prices are being experienced right across the world due mainly to a number of emerging and growing trends. For example surging demand for meat and dairy produce in significant developing markets such as India and China, a rising global population, more frequent floods and droughts caused by climate change, the increasing loss of potential food-producing land to biofuel production have all impacted on the global rising cost of food.  Unfortunately, these trends will most likely continue and will have an impact on the price of food into the future. Indeed as I previously advised the House, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development and the United Nations' Food and Agriculture Organisation in a recent report expressed the view that because of factors such as those already referred to, the price of agricultural commodities will remain high over the next decade.In terms of the price of food in Ireland, it is important that consumers keep themselves informed in relation to the level of prices in order that they can make an informed choice before deciding whether to buy from a particular retailer or whether to go elsewhere.   To this end there is legislation in place which ensures that consumers are provided with clear price information prior to making a decision to purchase goods. The main piece of legislation in this area is the European Communities (Requirement to Indicate Product Prices) Regulations 2002, which requires that the selling price and the unit price for all products covered by the Regulations must be indicated.As previously advised, the Competition Authority has been requested to review and monitor developments in the grocery sector and to assess, over time, the impact of the new regulatory environment. I understand that the Authority will present its first report, which will include an analysis of developments in the sector focusing on pricing trends, market structures and barriers to entry, shortly.In addition to the work being undertaken by the Competition Authority, the National Consumer Agency also conducted a survey in relation to the price of common branded grocery products, the results of which it published in July of this year.  The Agency will undertake a more extensive survey in the coming weeks, which will include branded and own branded groceries, fresh meat and fresh fruit and vegetables. I understand that the Agency will publish the results of this further survey in January 2008. I very much welcome this price awareness initiative by the National Consumer Agency which undoubtedly will greatly assist consumers in making price comparisons on a basket of common food products thereby helping them to achieve the best value for money.I am satisfied that the measures put in place to allow consumers to make informed choices about the grocery items that they buy together with the ongoing work of the Competition Authority and the National Consumer Agency will help to ensure that consumers do not suffer from unwarranted price increases when doing their grocery shopping.
#JohnMcGuinness	unknown-#JohnMcGuinness-party	unknown-#JohnMcGuinness-dob	unknown-#JohnMcGuinness-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-28 00:00:00	Prelude	901	Section 120 of the Companies Act, 1990 imposed a reporting obligation on every recognised stock exchange in relation to the exercise of functions under Part V (Insider Dealing) of the Act. The scope of that reporting obligation, as applying to the Irish Stock Exchange, was reduced significantly on the coming into operation on 6 July 2005 of the Market Abuse (Directive 2003/6/EC) Regulations 2005 (S.I. No. 342/2005). As a result of those Regulations, the Stock Exchange's supervisory functions and related reporting obligation, under Part V of the Act, now apply only to trading in Irish securities other than securities admitted to trading on a regulated market.The Stock Exchange Report to which the Question refers is that for the year ended 31 December 2006, the first full year under the new regulatory arrangements. The Report meets the statutory requirements prescribed in Section 120 of the Companies Act, 1990 and has been noted.Among the many significant changes introduced by the 2005 Regulations (S.I. No. 342/2005) was the appointment of the Financial Regulator (then described as the Central Bank and Financial Services Authority of Ireland) as the single administrative competent authority for the purposes of the EU Directive being transposed by those Regulations viz. Directive 2003/6/EC on insider dealing and market manipulation (Market Abuse Directive). The effect of this change is that the Financial Regulator is now the relevant supervisory authority in this country for the purposes of ensuring compliance with the new regulatory regime by issuers whose securities are admitted to trading on a regulated market. In practice, the companies involved here would be those attached to the Stock Exchange's so called official list and would include all the larger companies. The new system also includes strengthened provisions and arrangements for preventing, investigating and sanctioning insider dealing and market manipulation.While the new regulatory arrangements are of relatively recent origin, I am confident that these Community-wide arrangements will prove to be adequate to deal with insider dealing/market manipulation behaviour found to be in breach of the new rules. I am also considering whether to extend the application of the new arrangements in this country to those markets which are not currently covered by them.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-28 00:00:00	Prelude	902	The Personal Injuries Assessment Board was established in April 2004 as part of the Government's insurance reform programme, with the aim of allowing certain classes of personal injury claim, where liability is uncontested, to be settled without the need for the costs associated with litigation.  The threat of rising insurance costs at the time posed serious risks to Irish business and the economy generally.Since its establishment the PIAB has successfully fulfilled its legal obligations: the PIAB is now assessing many claims three times faster and four times cheaper than under the old litigation system.  To the end of Q3 2007, the PIAB had made actual savings to date of €61 million on awards totalling €270 million, when compared with the old, unwieldy, adversarial and litigation-based system.  This is quite an achievement in such a short space of time, and can only be good news for accident victims, for business and for consumers generally who have seen, and should see further, reductions in their insurance premiums.  The PIAB has pared down the personal injury claims process in a wholly positive way.  In 2003 it is estimated that the number of personal injury cases going through the Irish Courts system was in the region of 32,000 cases whereas the estimated figure for 2006 is 15,900 cases.  The effects are felt throughout the Court system where valuable time has now been freed up to deal with cases that should more properly reside there.At the end of September 2007 there were 4,815 cases with the PIAB in the 90-day "consent to process" period i.e. PIAB has received a claim and has issued formal notice to the responding party and is awaiting consent to process from that party.  There were a further 6,325 cases in the nine-month statutory assessment process, where the responding party has indicated that liability is not contested and damages are being assessed.  Approximately 13,300 assessments have been made to October 2007, 6,500 of these having been issued by the end of 2006.  Of the assessments issued 7,533 have been accepted, 4,707 have been rejected and authorised to proceed to litigation, and responses are awaited on the balance.Delivery costs are 4 times cheaper than old system.  Average delivery costs at approximately €1,407 flat fee equating to approximately 7% as against old system of 46%, e.g. a €15,000 award in the old system would have attracted costs of an additional €7,500 approximately.  Under the Personal Injuries Assessment Board these costs would be €1,350.  Some of the rejected assessments will have been resolved since PIAB involvement and others will proceed to the Courts.  The PIAB would not be aware of the number of these cases which actually proceed to litigation, although it is believed that a significant proportion are settled outside of the Courts once an authorisation issues from the PIAB.The Board currently employs 74 staff members (up from 53 in May 2006) and is in the process of recruiting to bring numbers towards the staffing level of 85 agreed with my Department.  There are no plans at this time to further review staffing levels in the PIAB.

This remains the case. The staff referred to by the Deputy work in the FÁS Services to Business Section (STB) and had moved some years ago from Baggot Street to temporary accommodation in Kilmainham.  The back section of FÁS' building in Baggot Street has been sub-let but the tenant no longer requires the first floor of this section and it has reverted to FÁS.  This has facilitated the return of the STB section to Baggot Street.
#BillyKelleher	unknown-#BillyKelleher-party	unknown-#BillyKelleher-dob	unknown-#BillyKelleher-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-28 00:00:00	Prelude	904	The number of employment rights inspections/visits undertaken to 23rd November, 2007 by the Inspection Services of the National Employment Rights Authority, or NERA, amounted to 12,002.  In the full year 2006, some 15,855 inspections/visits were undertaken.  Insofar as comparisons with the same period in 2006 are concerned I am advised by NERA that some 10,600 employment rights inspections/visits were undertaken in the period 1st January to 31st October, 2007. This represents a reduction of 28% in comparison to the 14,600 inspections/visits undertaken in the same period in 2006.There are three main reasons for the reduction in the number of inspections to date in 2007 compared to 2006.  Firstly, NERA Inspection Services undertook a comprehensive and extensive employment rights compliance campaign in the construction sector during June and July this year. The nature of the Construction Sector in terms of mobility, places of employment (headquarters and sites) and numbers of employees dictated a specific approach from NERA Inspection Services in order to optimise effectiveness. This approach was resource intensive in terms of inspector numbers, planning, intelligence gathering and liaison with the Revenue Commissioners and the Department of Social and Family Affairs in relation to joint investigations and the exchange of data. This campaign necessarily resulted in the diversion of resources for a considerable period from inspection activity in sectors that would be less demanding in terms of inspection planning, liaison and duration. However, the approach adopted for the Construction Campaign was extremely successful. Some €1.3 million has to date in 2007 been secured by NERA Inspection Services for employees arising from breaches detected in the construction sector.Secondly, the 12,002 employment rights inspections/visits undertaken to date in 2007 exclude a significant number of inspections which will arise from a protection of young persons employment rights campaign to be undertaken during December.  Thirdly, some 59 new inspectors will, by the end of 2007, have been recruited in line with the commitment given under Towards 2016, the Social Partnership Agreement. This large influx of new inspectors within such a short timeframe requires a huge commitment from existing inspectors in terms of training, mentoring and other supports and must necessarily divert some resources from inspection activity.Notwithstanding the reduction to date in the number of employment rights inspections/visits compared to the same period in 2006, it should be noted that the outcomes in a number of respects are extremely positive. Firstly, over €2.2 million in arrears due to employees has to date in 2007 been recovered by NERA Inspection Services compared to €1.4 million for the full year in 2006. Secondly, 2,198 breaches have to date in 2007 been detected by Inspection Services compared to 2,108 for the full year in 2006. Thirdly, 25 prosecutions have been initiated by Inspection Services to date in 2007 compared to 8 for the full year in 2006. These outcomes point to the value of the more focussed and targeted activities being undertaken by NERA in relation to employment rights promotion and compliance.

In his introduction to this years Global Competitiveness Report, Mr. Schwab the Executive Chairman of the World Economic Forum (WEF) says the report comes amid a time of uncertainty for the global economy. Ireland has maintained its position since last year despite the challenging world trading conditions.Within the areas measured we are in 5th place for financial market sophistication and 4th for "goods market efficiency".  This is important because included in this category we are ranked 1st for the positive impact of business rules on foreign direct investment. This again underlines our solid reputation as a flexible and competitive economy in which to invest. And of course what holds for foreign investors is equally true for the environment in which indigenous firms are encouraged to start and grow. These are clearly identified in the report as a competitive advantage for our economy.Furthermore, underpinning our ambitions as a knowledge economy we also scored well on the quality of our education system and the quality of our management schools. The quality of our education, the depth of our human resources and the capabilities of our mangers will determine our competitiveness. In these areas we are particularly strong.  The report reconfirms the wide understanding that our economy is conducive of the general business environment for enterprise and entrepreneurship. Together with the investment we are putting into the economy under the National Development Plan prioritising infrastructure, R&D and education, I am confident that we are successfully putting in place the conditions for future competitiveness and productivity growth.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-28 00:00:00	Prelude	906	I propose to take Questions Nos. 101 and 104 together.IDA Ireland is the agency with statutory responsibility for the attraction of foreign direct investment (FDI) to Ireland and its regions.  The marketing of individual areas for new or expansion FDI investments and jobs is a day-to-day operational matter for the Agency.  While I may give general policy directives to the Agency, I am precluded under the Industrial Development Acts from giving directives regarding individual undertakings or from giving preference to one area over others.Counties Longford and Westmeath form part of the IDA Midland region along with Counties Offaly, Laois and Roscommon.  In line with the National Spatial Strategy the locations of emphasis for IDA Ireland in these counties are the Gateway towns of Athlone, Tullamore and Mullingar.  In addition IDA actively promotes the county towns of Portlaoise, Longford and Roscommon.  IDA Ireland is committed to encouraging the establishment of foreign direct investment in the Midlands Region.  However, Ireland now has to compete for more high value and skill-intensive investments than in the past.  These investments tend to favour the larger urban centres, close to Universities and Institutes of Technology.  Combining the strengths of the Midlands Gateway is essential to boosting the Region's overall economic strength.  The region will also benefit from the ongoing investment in transport, energy and utilities set out in the new National Development Plan.In addition, IDA Ireland is working closely with educational institutions in the Region, in developing the skill sets necessary to attract high value added employment.  The agency also works with FAS to provide guidance in developing the skill sets needed by those already in the workforce who are interested in upskilling.At present there are five IDA assisted companies in Mullingar and its environs employing approximately 655 people.  Through its range of overseas offices, IDA Ireland actively markets Mullingar as part of the Midlands Region as a location for foreign direct investment in particular the Marlinstown / Ardmore site of 70 acres.  The establishment of Abbott Ireland in Longford Town, has been a great boost to the Region with approximately 380 already employed in that plant. In addition, Cameron Ireland now has over 200 employed in its plant and that number continues to grow.According to the Forfás Annual Survey there were, at the end of 2006, twenty six IDA supported companies employing a total of 3,320 people in the combined counties Westmeath and Longford.  Figures for 2007 will not be available until early 2008.  I am satisfied that the co-operation of the development agencies together with the roll out of the National Development Plan will continue to encourage investment and bring benefits the peoples of Counties Longford and Westmeath and indeed the region as a whole.

The Regulations provide that a prosecution for an alleged offence under these enactments will not be instituted if, during the period of 28 days from the issue of the fixed payment notice, the person alleged to have committed the offence makes a payment of €300 to the National Consumer Agency.  By simplifying the enforcement procedure for relatively minor breaches of consumer legislation, the new Regulations will permit the National Consumer Agency to devote greater resources to tackling more serious breaches of the law.

Responsibility for indigenous enterprise transferred from Shannon Development to Enterprise Ireland in Jan 2007. Data provided by the latter agency indicates that the number of companies in County Clare that transferred from Shannon Development consists of 126 in total (all of which are external to the Shannon Free Zone). The attached table sets out the position in relation to companies and employment in enterprise agency assisted firms in Co. Clare excluding the Shannon Free Zone for the past 3 yearsThe Government is committed to achieving balanced regional development and a key regional objective included in the NDP is to support the creation of conditions necessary to extend the process of employment and productivity growth in higher value added functions to all regions. The State Development agencies, in partnership with other key players, actively seek to provide high value employment opportunities in County Clare. Clearly the strategies set out in the National Development Plan will play a crucial role in maintaining the attractiveness of the regions as investment locations.As part of an integrated mid-West strategy, IDA Ireland is actively promoting County Clare for foreign direct investment in line with its objective to pursue balanced regional development. Clare has a strong base of foreign direct investment jobs, with the pharmaceutical and medical technology sectors representing 85% of IDA supported employment in the county. The agency's strategy for the region involves a transition to the knowledge economy by winning new foreign direct investment in innovation driven, high value sectors and working with its existing company base to expand their presence in Ireland by the addition of increased functions of scale and increased strategic functions.Ennis is designated as a hub town in the National Spatial Strategy (NSS) and is a priority location for IDA with 6 of the 9 companies supported by the agency in the county based in Ennis. Towards that end the development of Ennis Information Age Park has become an integral part of the Agency's international marketing programme and will be pivotal in attracting new investors.Vital for any shift to a more knowledge based economy, is the development of the skill sets necessary to attract such high value added employment particularly, R&D, corporate services, shared services, supply chain management treasury management etc. The enterprise agencies' partnership with educational institutions in the region, in particular UL, LIT, NUIG and GMIT, is therefore a key part of their strategy for the region.In terms of job creation, Enterprise Ireland activity is focussed on the creation of new jobs through supporting entrepreneurs in manufacturing and internationally traded services companies who are setting up new High Potential Start-Up Companies, the retention and creation of new jobs in existing companies and in enhancing the innovation capability of Ireland at a national and regional levels through supporting research in companies and third level institutions.Among the firms supported by Enterprise Ireland in the County are Data Display in Ennistymon — one of the largest indigenous employers in the County employing 140 people. Other significant employers include Vitolograph, based in Ennis and employing 72 people, the company develops and manufactures products for the health care sector mainly for export markets. Shannon Showcase also based in Ennis is a relatively young company first established in 2000, employing 56 people which operates as an International relationship marketing company and AJ Precision a plastic injection moulding operation based in Tuamgraney employing 41 people. Smithstown Industrial Estate near Shannon Airport is the location of a significant cluster of Irish owned manufacturing companies.Enterprise Ireland supports Community Enterprise Centres in Ennistymon and Kilkee and is currently in discussion with a group from Kilrush. This is a unique partnership between local communities and Enterprise Ireland that provides essential support for entrepreneurship in urban and rural areas. Earlier this year I announced a new Community Enterprise Centre scheme to be managed by Enterprise Ireland. Funding will be targeted at those communities where job losses have been most acute and there is an evident need for this type of initiative.200420052006CompaniesPermanent JobsCompaniesPermanent JobsCompaniesPermanent JobsIDA Ireland992991,02491,004Enterprise Ireland718561897197EI (formerly Shannon Development)1261,6211211,6121261,674Totals1422,7351362,8251422,678

There are 35 Boards located throughout the 26 counties and their local base means that the projects and related job opportunities they support are specifically tailored to the particular needs of the local economic environment of the regions, urban and rural.The CEBs can provide both financial and non-financial assistance to a project promoter. The forms of financial assistance which are available, subject to certain restrictions, include Capital Grants, Employment Grants and Feasibility Study Grants.  The total number of grants paid out by the County and City Enterprise Boards (CEBs) from 2004 to end September, 2007 stands at €39.3m.  3,392 businesses were in receipt of CEB assistance during this period.

#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-28 00:00:00	Prelude	911	My Department has been making good progress in the relocation of the required 250 posts to Carlow under the Government's Decentralisation Programme.  The following business units/Offices of my Department have been selected as part of the Decentralisation Programme and will be relocated in the new decentralised office: Companies Registration Office/Registry of Friendly Societies; National Employment Rights Authority (NERA); Work Permits; Redundancy Payments Section; Insolvency Payments Section.With regard to the property side of the Department's move, the OPW completed the purchase of a site in Carlow town centre late in 2005.  On the 31st May 2006, the OPW commenced the tendering process by seeking expressions of interest from developers in relation to the Design/Build/Finance/Maintenance of new office accommodation and car parking for the Department in Carlow.  This is part of a major PPP project, which also involves the provision of office accommodation for the Department of Agriculture and Food in Portlaoise and the Department of Education and Science in Mullingar. The project will be procured on a Design/Build/Finance/Maintain basis and a single contract will be placed covering the three buildings. Financial advice is being provided to the OPW by the National Development Finance Agency.The OPW has advised my Department that the tender process is at tender evaluation stage and it is envisaged that the successful tenderer will be selected shortly and the award of the project agreement will be in December 2007. The OPW anticipate that construction start on site, subject to no planning issues arising, will commence in June 2008 and completion of construction of the permanent office is expected by December 2009.In order to accommodate staff who wish to move earlier than the projected building completion date of late 2009, officials of my Department, in consultation with the Department of Finance and the OPW, opened an advance office in Carlow on July 30th 2007.  The number of posts in this decentralised advance office is 98.Under the current Government Decentralisation Programme, four of the Agencies under the aegis of my Department are due to decentralise as follows: FAS is to move 383 posts to Birr, Co. Offaly; Enterprise Ireland (EI) is to move 300 posts to Shannon; The Health and Safety Authority is to move 110 posts to Thomastown, Co. Kilkenny, and The National Standards Authority of Ireland is to move 132 posts to Arklow, Co. Wicklow.My Department continues to provide advice and support to each of the four Agencies in progressing their decentralisation programmes and there is a dedicated Agency Decentralisation Committee to drive the process forward.  In addition, I am satisfied that each Agency is fully engaged in the process and taking all of the relevant steps to advance their decentralisation plans.Under the Government's decentralisation programme, FÁS is due to transfer its head office including some 383 posts to Birr, County Offaly.  FÁS currently has 21 staff members based in Birr who are working out of offices located within the Birr Technology Centre. It is anticipated that some 25 staff will be located in Birr by the end of the year. The offices in the Technology Centre have been rented on a 5-year lease from May this year.  FÁS has recently completed the purchase of a site in Birr, Co Offaly in connection with the decentralisation of its Headquarters. An application for planning permission is currently being prepared and will be submitted in due course.Latest figures show that one Enterprise Ireland staff member has applied for decentralisation to Enterprise Ireland in Shannon.  I understand that the number of applications received from within the civil and public service, including my Department, amounts to 25, thus giving a total overall of 26 persons.  Progress on the full transfer of EI's HQ to Shannon, within the Government decentralisation programme, will be influenced by factors such as the level of interest in the Shannon location expressed by CAF applicants and by progress made discussions at a central level on various issues central to Agency decentralisation (and resolving potential internal HR/IR issues)As the Deputy will be aware, the functions hitherto carried out by Shannon Development in relation to the development of indigenous industry in the Mid-West Region were transferred to EI with effect from 1 January 2007.  This transfer of function also involved the transfer of posts from Shannon Development to EI.  The necessary arrangements to give effect to these changes are well advanced and a number of staff have already formally transferred to EI.In addition, Enterprise Ireland has also established its new National Regional Development Headquarters in Shannon and has established the County Enterprise Support Unit in Shannon.  A senior manager has been appointed as Head of Regions and Entrepreneurship to oversee the establishment of the EI presence in the Mid-West Region. EI managers with responsibility for the County Enterprise Coordination Unit and EI Regional Development strategy as well as the Regional Director with responsibility for the Mid West Regional are now in place in its Shannon office.  EI has leased high-spec office space in Westpark, Shannon, to accommodate this new Regional HQ.  Currently there are 40 staff recruited to posts in Shannon and it is expected that this will rise to approximately 65 EI staff over the coming months.The Health and Safety Authority is to move 110 posts to Thomastown, Co. Kilkenny. To date a total of 62 people (11 HSA staff, 41 Civil Servants, 10 Public Servants) have expressed an interest through the CAF process in transferring to Thomastown.  The Authority has been advised by OPW that, as the site procurement is in the final stages, the current estimated timeline for availability for occupancy is 2009.  In anticipation of the move to Thomastown, the Authority established an interim office in Kilkenny city in August 2006.  To date, 27 staff have re-located to that office.  That office is now fully occupied and discussions are currently on-going  with a view to securing larger office space in the area.   All staff that move to the Kilkenny office will transfer to Thomastown when those premises are completed and all newly recruited Dublin based staff are ultimately contracted to move to Thomastown.Under the Government's decentralisation programme the National Standards Authority of Ireland (NSAI) is due to relocate to Arklow, Co. Wicklow.  The current NSAI implementation plan anticipates a target date of April 2009 as the completion date for its decentralisation programme; however, this is highly dependent on the resolution of matters at central level concerning the transfer of staff within the public service and other staffing related issues. The accommodation requirements for the NSAI in Arklow are being addressed by the OPW but to date there has been no progress in identifying and securing suitable office accommodation in the Arklow area.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-28 00:00:00	Prelude	912	The Government recognises that an environment conducive to entrepreneurial activity that harnesses the abundant creativity of Irish entrepreneurs is critical to Ireland's economic future and national prosperity.  The Global Entrepreneurship Monitor (GEM), benchmarks Ireland as one of the most entrepreneurial economies in Europe, ranking 3rd highest in the EU. The 2006 GEM report found that over 70% of those surveyed see entrepreneurship to be a good career choice with 44% of Irish adults perceiving good opportunities to establish a new business at present and 50% believing they have the necessary skills to successfully establish and run a new business. Entrepreneurs drive innovation, competitiveness and growth and are at the heart of economic activity and development in local communities and regional economies.The transformation in Ireland's economic fortunes over the past decade has been little short of remarkable, including the creation of more than 700,000 new jobs. A significant factor in the improvement of Ireland's economic performance is the emergence of a genuine culture of entrepreneurship in Ireland — one which had never really existed before.  All the economic signals from our major trading partners suggest the next period will be more testing than the conditions that we have experienced over the past number of years. However, Irish entrepreneurs and small business owners have faced difficult periods in the past and continually prove their resilience and determination. We aim to help entrepreneurs and start-ups by ensuring there is a comprehensive range of financial and non-financial supports provided by the State for entrepreneurs and start-up companies.Insofar as 2008 is concerned, the Pre-Budget Outlook (PBO), published in October 2007, projected an increase of over €6m for Enterprise Ireland activities which focus on supporting High Potential Start Up companies (HPSUs) with the potential to export, comprehensive funding for R&D, driving growth and innovation capabilities and assisting major projects.  In addition, CEB funding will be €32.2m. The funding will enable the CEBs to continue to deliver a wide-range of support programmes to the micro-enterprise sector with considerable success. It should be noted, however, that PBO projections are subject to revision.Earlier this year, on foot of the recommendations contained in the Enterprise Strategy Group report Ahead of the Curve, Enterprise Ireland established a County Enterprise Board Coordination Unit in Shannon. The objective of this CEBCU is to provide a range of supports to the CEBs, which will ultimately impact on the future development of micro-enterprise. The supports to be provided include strategic, administrative, technical and financial support. Enterprise Ireland is also investigating ways to provide relevant CEB client companies with access to Enterprise Ireland programs designed to help them achieve export sales in new markets.Last month, Forfás published its report "Towards developing an Entrepreneurship Policy for Ireland".  The report sets out a profile of Ireland's entrepreneurial culture and a blueprint to drive increased entrepreneurial activity in Ireland.  The Department of Community Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs is the national authority responsible for the administration of LEADER activity in Ireland and I have no function in the matter.

This Directive is a Framework Directive which specifies the framework within which detailed measures (referred to as implementing measures) setting ecodesign requirements for specific energy-using products will be brought forward by the Commission.  It also provides that three existing Directives, which had already been implemented in national law, are to be implementing measures for the purposes of the Energy-using Products Directive.NoA screening RIA conducted on the proposed draft Regulations concluded that there was no need to undertake a full RIA as the purpose of the new legislation was to consolidate three existing Regulations and to establish a national framework for future implementing measures proposed by the EU Commission.

#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-28 00:00:00	Prelude	914	The latest employment data published by the Central Statistics Office indicates that the numbers in employment grew by almost 68,000 in the year to Quarter 3 2007 bringing the total number in employment to 2,140,900 (Quarterly National Household Survey 15 November 2007). The seasonally adjusted data indicates that the unemployment rate decreased from 4.5% to 4.4% in the 12-month period and a similar decrease was recorded between the second and third quarters of 2007 when unemployment fell by 3,000.  In terms of manufacturing, the latest CSO release on Industrial Employment (31 October 2007) indicates a small decline of 500 in the numbers employed in manufacturing industry in Quarter 2 2007 relative to the same period in 2006.Job losses are always regrettable, and neither the Government nor I ever dismiss the singularity of the impact at a personal and community level, of factory closures and their attendant job losses. As the figures indicate though, such losses as occur, do so in the midst of an historically phenomenal period of job creation; with nearly 6 hundred thousand more people in employment than 10 years ago. Many of the job losses incurred in the period were situated in low value added manufacturing and these losses have been more than offset by jobs created in higher value added manufacturing and the financial and international services sectors.Ireland is no longer a low cost economy and manufacturers in particular are facing increased competition from producers in lower cost economies.  It is the case that manufacturing firms in the more traditional sectors have, in recent years, operated against a backdrop of significantly declining external demand, downward price pressure, and an increasingly competitive international environment together with upward pressure on costs and the strengthening of the Euro against our key trading partner currencies.The model of manufacturing in developed countries is changing and Irish enterprises are adapting to those changes and engaging in higher value added activities in order to compete in the global marketplace. This has been achieved as a result of increased productivity, technology levels and sophisticated skills of Irish employees. Irish manufacturing has performed quite strongly in recent years and manufacturing production by volume has increased by 35% overall between 2000 and 2006 which is significantly above the performance of many of our European counterparts.One of our main tasks is to ensure that Ireland remains an attractive place to do business, and to support the development of economic competencies higher up the value chain. In that regard, the Programme for Government contains a range of commitments focussed on maintaining and enhancing our framework competitive conditions, and promoting new areas of competitive advantage, including the development of our R&D base, investment in physical and communications infrastructures, and promoting tertiary education and lifelong learning. Likewise the National Development Plan also commits the Government to provide investment specifically to support the development of the indigenous and FDI enterprise base in addition to NDP investment in infrastructure and skills.

The number of redundancies over the period in question have fluctuated year on year. The final figure for 2007 will be available early in the New Year.  The number of people in employment has increased significantly since 2002. Redundancy is a risk associated with employment and the risk has increased from an average annual risk prior to 2002 of 0.787% to 1.34% for the period 2002 to 2006.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-28 00:00:00	Prelude	916	As I advised the House in my reply of 24th October 2007 to a previous question on the same matter (PQ 25387/07 refers), the National Consumer Agency, which was established on a statutory basis on the commencement of the Consumer Protection Act in May 2007, is empowered as part of its mandate to publish Guidelines applicable to traders in relation to matters of consumer welfare and protection. The Agency is also empowered to approve Codes of Practice submitted to it by traders or their trade associations.The Agency is keen to establish a strong relationship with business to develop the highest standards of consumer protection and compliance by traders with consumer protection law. To this end the Agency has held discussions with a number of business and representative bodies in relation to possible Codes of Practice. The Agency is also preparing to issue Guidelines to business in two specific areas namely the Retail Sector and the Health and Fitness Sector. In this regard the Agency has issued consultation documents in relation to particular practices in both these sectors. These documents can be accessed on the Agency's website www.consumerconnect.ie.  I very much welcome the Agency's stated intention to work with business in the development of a strong consumer culture. I am confident that initiatives such as Agency Guidelines and Consumer Codes of Practice can play a significant part in achieving such a culture.
#BillyKelleher	unknown-#BillyKelleher-party	unknown-#BillyKelleher-dob	unknown-#BillyKelleher-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-28 00:00:00	Prelude	917	The Governing Body of the International Labour Office (ILO) has identified eight conventions as "fundamental", covering subjects that are considered as fundamental principles and rights at work: freedom of association of and the effective recognition of the right to collective bargaining; the elimination of all forms of forced or compulsory labour; the effective abolition of child labour; and the elimination of discrimination in respect of employment and occupation. These principles are also covered in the ILOs Declaration of on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work (1998). The Deputy in his question refers to six of the eight core Conventions.Ireland fully supported the adoption of the ILOs Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work, at the International Labour Conference, in June 1998. This commits all of the ILO's more than 180 member states to respect the principles inherent in the eight core labour standards and to respect, promote and realise their universal application. Ireland has also ratified all the eight core standards.Ireland only ratifies those ILO Conventions, which are in conformity with our existing national law and practice. To that extent, in ratification, we are fully adhering to the core objectives established in each of the ILO Conventions which is reflected in national practice.  Specifically, the enactment of legislation by the Oireachtas across the full range of fundamental labour and social rights underpins the realisation of the standards set in the core ILO Conventions. These core values are also being realised through the delivery of commitments entered into, for example, in National Partnership Agreements.Ireland has consistently supported the International Labour Organisation in its efforts to realise and implement core labour standards and will continue to do so.  Ireland's continuing progress in the achievement of these goals is subject to ongoing review and evaluation by the ILO itself, in consultation with the Social Partners.

In the Irish context, these derogations allowed for reduced rates to apply to fuel used for public transport services which includes school transport services.  While these derogations expired on 31 December 2006, Ireland, along with other Member States, sought retention of its derogations beyond that date.  However the European Commission, who are the deciding authority, have to date refused all such requests.  The Commission maintain that, in keeping with the EU Energy Tax Directive, Member States must apply at least the EU minimum rates of excise on fuels in such circumstances and that any further favourable excise treatment is not allowable. In this regard the Commission's decision was published on its website in March 2007.  At the Commission's behest my officials have indicated that Ireland will avail of the forthcoming Finance Bill to make the necessary legislative changes to conform with the Directive.  In the circumstances, the relevant line Departments who have primary responsibility in this regard are, in conjunction with my Department, exploring alternative non-tax support mechanisms that could be put in place where appropriate to maintain the assistance currently being provided, subject of course to compatibility with EU State Aid requirements.  In the interim the reduced rates applicable to fuel used will be maintained.

The development of GP out-of-hours co-operatives is in line with the overall health service policy of strengthening primary care services and ensuring that to the greatest extent possible, people's care needs are met in the primary care setting.  Out-of-hours co-operatives are now in place in all Health Service Executive (HSE) areas, providing coverage in all or in part of all counties.  In 2007, almost €37 million is available to the HSE to fund the operation of GP out of hours services.  This figure does not include the fees of the participating doctors.  As the Health Service Executive has the operational and funding responsibility for this service, it is the appropriate body to provide the information sought by the Deputy.

#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-28 00:00:00	Prelude	932	I propose to take Questions Nos. 132, 133 and 168 together.I have previously outlined in detail to the Oireachtas the legal provisions under competition law which prevent the Health Service Executive (HSE) from negotiating with the Irish Pharmaceutical Union (IPU) on fees, prices or margins for their members. When it became clear that the HSE could not negotiate with pharmacists or wholesalers on fees or margins, a detailed, fair and transparent consultation process, including independent economic analysis and public consultation, was carried out to inform the final determination of the new reimbursement pricing arrangements for drugs and medicines under the GMS and community drugs schemes. These new arrangements were announced by the HSE on 17th September 2007. The independent economic analysis was carried out by Indecon Economic Consultants and was published by the HSE on 13 November 2007. All aspects of the Indecon analysis were considered by the HSE in making its determination.In regard to the new reimbursement prices, the main wholesaler companies have confirmed to the HSE that they will charge community pharmacists the same price for these drugs and medicines as pharmacists will be reimbursed by the HSE for these products. Furthermore, there are no changes planned by the HSE to the operation of the GMS medical card and community drugs schemes, and all patients continue to receive their entitlements in the normal way.  My Department understands that the HSE has not received formal notification from any community pharmacist regarding cessation of services under the GMS or the various community drugs schemes. They will be required to give three months notice in writing of any intention to cease providing this service.To address concerns expressed by the IPU, on behalf of community pharmacists, about the implications of the legal advice on competition law on their right to negotiate fees through the Union, a process of dialogue was established, chaired by Bill Shipsey SC, to explore ways in which concerns raised by the IPU about the implications of this legal advice might be addressed. I am also exploring, in consultation with the Attorney General, the other relevant Government Departments and the HSE, the best way of progressing the development of a new contract with pharmacists. There is ongoing engagement between the Irish Pharmaceutical Union and the HSE under the auspices of Mr. Shipsey and, in view of the progress in this regard, the HSE has decided to defer the implementation of the new reimbursement rates planned to take effect for community pharmacists on 1st December 2007 to a later date.

#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-28 00:00:00	Prelude	937	I propose to take Questions Nos. 138 to 150, inclusive, together.As the Deputy will be aware, I have responsibility for the Equal Opportunities Childcare Programme 2000-2006 (EOCP) and the National Childcare Investment Programme 2006-2010 (NCIP), which are being implemented by the Office of the Minister for Children.Under the Equal Opportunities Childcare Programme 2000-2006 (EOCP), which is co-funded under the EU Social Fund (ESF), targeted support was provided through the staffing support grant scheme whereby community based not-for-profit childcare providers with a strong focus on disadvantage were awarded grant aid towards their staffing costs to allow them to operate reduced fees to disadvantaged parents.  Funding under this scheme was originally awarded for a limited period during which services were expected to move towards sustainability.  This funding was subsequently continued to the end of 2007, where it was considered necessary to enable services to continue to make their services accessible to disadvantaged parents.  This continuation funding was subject to the condition that tiered fee structures were implemented by the services in question.With the closure of the EOCP in December 2007, to continue to support community childcare services to provide affordable childcare to disadvantaged parents, the Community Childcare Subvention Scheme (CCSS) is being introduced from January 2008 under the Exchequer funded National Childcare Investment Programme 2006-2010 (NCIP), the successor programme to the EOCP.  The CCSS has been allocated €153 million over the next 3 years, representing a 16% increase in funding over the EOCP staffing scheme, and will continue to support community childcare services to provide reduced childcare fees for disadvantaged parents, complementing the universal supports in place for all parents.  Under the new scheme, it will be possible to ensure that the level of grant aid which individual services qualify for will reflect the actual level of service they provide and the profile of the parents benefiting from their service.  As part of their application for funding under the new scheme, services are required to ask parents using their services to complete a simple declaration form which will be included in a return to my Office and on which basis the level of subvention for each service will be determined.  The subvention received by services will, in turn, be reflected in the reduced fees for parents who qualify as disadvantaged under the scheme.In practice, this will mean that parents with children in such services and in receipt of most social welfare payments (or participating in a scheme such as Community Employment which demonstrates an underlying entitlement to same) or parents in receipt of Family Income Supplement (FIS), will see a weekly subvention in respect of their child.  A higher subvention will be paid where the subvented child is a baby, in recognition of the higher costs associated with the care of children aged under 1 year.  Parents who do not qualify for subvention will be charged the cost price for their childcare service, however, as community not-for-profit services will, generally, have availed of capital grant aid under the EOCP or NCIP removing the requirement to cover rent or a mortgage, and as the services are run on a not-for-profit basis, this should still be significantly below the market price.It is considered that the new scheme will provide an effective framework for the continued targeting of additional resources towards disadvantaged parents and their children while continuing to support community childcare services generally.  The scheme has been informed by and takes account of a number of enhancements recommended by the report of the Value for Money Review of the EOCP.  These include the fact that the subvention to services will be more responsive to the level of service provided as well as the degree of parental disadvantage supported and the ceiling for funding, which existed under the previous scheme, is being removed.  Account will also be taken of all of the operational costs of the service rather than staffing costs alone.  Services, including full-time, part-time and sessional ones, which at present are, in some cases, inaccessibly priced for disadvantaged parents, will be available to them at more appropriate rates under the new scheme.  The new scheme has clear advantages over its predecessor.  There is an increase in the level of funding available under it, and a majority of services will benefit from the changes it introduces.  Existing EOCP staffing grant recipients who enter the new scheme will continue to be funded at their current levels until July 2008.  My Office has engaged in a series of meetings with existing grant recipients to outline to them the details of the new scheme and to gather feedback from the services themselves.  A meeting with representatives of the City and County Childcare Committees has also taken place.Transitional arrangements have been made under which existing grant recipients will continue to be funded at their current levels until 1st July 2008.  This is to ensure that existing childcare services are facilitated to adjust to the new scheme, including making any adjustments necessary to their fee structures.  As signalled when I announced the new scheme in July this year, the transitional period between now and 1 July 2008 is being used to monitor and review the impact it will have on individual groups, on the basis of the more detailed and comprehensive data received this month.  Where appropriate, any adjustments necessary to the scheme to secure the best outcomes for childcare services and for disadvantaged parents and their children will be considered on the basis of this data and well in advance of the commencement of the new funding levels in July 2008.Applications from Groups entering the new scheme are currently being processed and when validated, these Groups are issued with letters from the Childcare Directorate of my Office approving transitional funding under the NCIP Community Childcare Subvention Scheme (CCSS).  To date ten of the Groups named by the Deputy have been approved transitional funding.  This funding will, for the first six months of 2008, be based on the level of funding currently being provided to the Group under the EOCP staffing support grant scheme and subject to the necessary contractual arrangement with Pobal, who manage the day to day operation of the EOCP and NCIP.

The HSE has discretion, in cases of exceptional need, to provide assistance to individuals where undue hardship would otherwise be caused.Medical cards are made available to persons and their dependants who would otherwise experience undue hardship in meeting the cost of General Practitioner (GP) services.  In 2005 the GP visit card was introduced as a graduated benefit so that people on lower incomes who do not qualify for a medical card would not be deterred on cost grounds from visiting their GP.  In June 2006 I agreed with the HSE to raise the assessment guidelines for GP visit cards and these are now 50% higher than those in respect of medical cards.  For Medical Card and GP Visit Card applications, the HSE now considers an applicant's income after tax and PRSI are deducted, rather than total income.  Allowances are also made for expenses on childcare, rent and mortgage costs and the cost of travel to work.I have no plans to provide for the granting of medical cards to any particular group as a whole.  However, my Department is currently reviewing all legislation relating to eligibility for health and personal social services with a view to making the system as fair and transparent as possible.

In December 2006, a revised employment ceiling for the health service of 108,000 expressed in whole time equivalents was sanctioned, representing an increase of 10,450 over the previous approved ceiling.  The ceiling was further increased to 108,285 in October 2007.There has also been a substantial expansion of training places available at undergraduate level across a range of healthcare professions in order to ensure an ongoing supply of personnel in sufficient numbers for our health services into the future.Subject to overall parameters set by Government, the Health Service Executive has the responsibility for determining the composition of its staffing complement.  In that regard, it is a matter for the Executive to manage and deploy its human resources to best meet the requirements of its Annual Service Plan for the delivery of health and personal social services to the public.  The Executive is the appropriate body to consider the matter raised by the Deputy.

#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-28 00:00:00	Prelude	956	There is no statutory obligation on the Health Service Executive (HSE) to provide chiropody services to GMS patients; however in practice arrangements have been made in several regions to provide these services.  Before the establishment of the HSE the nature of any arrangements for community chiropody services and the level of service provided were a matter for individual health boards and so a degree of variation in practice developed over time.  I understand that priority is usually given to certain groups of people, including people who are medical card holders aged 65 years and over.  In several regions the service is provided by private chiropodists by arrangement with the HSE.I consider that it is inappropriate for private chiropodists who are providing services on behalf of the HSE to charge patients a top-up fee, and I have conveyed this view formally to the HSE.   My Department requested the HSE to review the fee arrangements in place for the provision of chiropody services, with a view to ensuring that such additional fees will no longer be levied on persons in receipt of this service.  While considerable work has taken place to develop arrangements which would ensure that no top-up charges are applied, it is necessary to ensure that any such arrangements and the process by which they are arrived at comply with the terms of the Competition Act 2002.   In this context consideration is being given at present to the most appropriate way in which to put in place contractual arrangements for the provision of services by self-employed health professionals.My Department is currently preparing legislation to clarify and update existing legislation on eligibility for health and personal social services.  The Bill will define specific health and personal services more clearly; define who should be eligible for what services; set out clear criteria for eligibility; establish when and in what circumstances charges may be made and provide for an appeals framework.

In 2007, Mayo County Council was allocated a total of €31,625,821 in non-national road grants.Following the issue of road grants for 2007, Mayo County Council sought additional funding for the upgrading of the R312 Castlebar – Belmullet Road. The Council was informed on 5 March 2007, that the 2007 non-national road grant allocations had already been notified to local authorities, and that accordingly there were no funds available from which further grants could be provided for the proposed project. The Council was also informed that the design stage of the proposed project would be considered for funding in 2008, having regard, inter alia, to the overall funding available for non-national roads and competing demands from other local authorities.In order to facilitate future consideration of the proposal, the Council was requested to submit details of the proposed scheme, including confirmation of the proposed works, a draft expenditure profile and details of the Council's proposed own resources expenditure on the scheme and possible funding from other sources. A reply has now been received from the Council and is under examination in the Department.  The 2008 non-national road grant allocations to local authorities will be announced early next year.

The statutory power to levy tolls on national roads, to make toll bye-laws and to enter into toll agreements with private investors in respect of national roads, including the M50, is vested in the National Roads Authority under Part V of the Roads Act 1993 (as amended by the Planning and Development Act 2000 and the Roads Act 2007).

The NRA assesses applications for grant assistance under the non-national roads scheme on behalf of the Department.  The criteria for grant approval are based on accident data, inspection of sites, locations showing demonstrable hazard and discussions between the local authority and the NRA.Earlier this year, local authorities were invited to submit applications for consideration for funding in 2008 under the Low Cost Safety Improvement Works scheme of grants for non-national roads. Kildare County Council submitted a number of schemes but these do not include an application for works at Firmount Crossroads, Clane.  The 2008 non-national road grant allocations to local authorities will be announced early next year.

Our concerns in relation to this matter have been made clear to the highest levels of the US Government, including by the Taoiseach to President Bush. The Government received specific assurances from the US authorities, confirmed by Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice to myself, that such prisoners have not been transferred through Irish territory, nor would they be, without our permission.Over the past two years, my Department, at my request, has had detailed exchanges with Dr Maurice Manning, the President of the Irish Human Rights Commission, on a range of issues related to extraordinary rendition and has set out the Government's view that we are fully in compliance with our international obligations. My officials have also met with the Commission for a very full discussion on issues of concern in this area.  On the matter of a Parliamentary inquiry, the call in the Report of the European Parliament for the Government "to agree to launch a parliamentary inquiry into the use of Irish territory as part of the CIA rendition circuit" ignores the fact that it is for the Oireachtas to decide its own work schedule. It also ignores the fact that Seanad Éireann has on three separate occasions voted not to institute a specific enquiry. The issues surrounding extraordinary rendition have been extensively debated in both Houses of the Oireachtas, and both have passed motions supporting the Government's policy in this area.

The information requested by the Deputy is set out in the following tables.I am very conscious of the need to achieve value for money on consultancy expenditure. The Department commissions consultancies only where specialised knowledge and/or skills are not available within the Department and, particularly in the case of Irish Aid (Ireland's official development assistance programme), where an independent evaluation of programmes and projects is required. Given the overall scale of the Irish Aid Programme, this level of monitoring, review and evaluation is both prudent and proportionate.With regard to agencies under the aegis of my Department, only the Irish Aid Advisory Board commissioned consultancies in 2007 and the relevant figures are included in a separate table.

I regard any punishment by flogging as abhorrent, no matter where it takes place. I am shocked by the sentences in this case in Saudi Arabia and by the context in which they have been imposed.As soon as I became aware of the case, I asked our Embassy in Riyadh to ascertain the facts and to consult with our EU partners on the most effective possible intervention in the interests of the victims. We also joined with our EU partners in agreeing an immediate approach to the Saudi authorities, expressing our strong concerns.  On behalf of the EU, the Portuguese Presidency raised the case with the Saudi Foreign Ministry on Sunday, 25 November, stressing our shock at the severity of the sentence, and the imperative need in such cases for physical and psychological support for the victims. The Presidency also emphasised the huge public concern about this case across the EU and the negative image of Saudi Arabia which it has presented internationally.It is important to note that the verdict of the court in this case has been the subject of widespread discussion and publicly expressed disquiet within Saudi Arabia. This would have been highly unlikely a few years ago and in itself represents something of a positive development in relation to the human rights situation.The judicial process in the case is continuing. We are following developments closely, in cooperation with our EU partners, and will ensure that our concerns continue to be understood clearly. Our overriding objective will be to ensure that the sentence imposed is not carried out.
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-28 00:00:00	Prelude	967	The human rights situation in Uganda has shown gradual improvement over the last two decades. The first multi-party elections following the return to a democratic system took place in 2006, and were described by the EU Election Observation Mission as "generally well administered, transparent, competitive ... demonstrating some significant improvements...".  Encouragingly also, a ceasefire with the Lord's Resistance Army (LRA) in Northern Uganda has generally held since August 2006, and the peace process aimed at resolving that conflict is ongoing. A sustainable and just end to that appalling conflict, which was notorious for the abduction by the LRA of children for use as child soldiers and sex slaves, will be an important step forward in advancing the human rights of the people of Uganda.However, issues of concern remain. In April 2007, EU Heads of Mission drew attention to the continued existence of so-called "safe houses" which act as extra-judicial places of detention. EU Heads of Mission and UN representatives in Uganda have also expressed concerns about the forced disarmament programme being carried out by the Ugandan army in the Karamoja region, following unrest which led to the deaths of 48 civilians and 22 Ugandan soldiers there in October 2006. It is feared that excessive force may have been used, accompanied by human rights violations, in the course of this effort.The initial refusal of the Ugandan Government in March of this year to carry out court orders to release on bail members of the People's Resistance Army (PRA) gave rise to serious concerns. In response to a request from my officials, the Ugandan Ambassador in London travelled to Dublin for discussions with them on this matter.EU Heads of Mission in Kampala have regular discussions with the Ugandan authorities on a wide variety of issues, including human rights and governance. The Partners for Democracy and Governance (PDG) group, which Ireland co-chaired in 2006-07, has regular meetings with President Museveni and other key government leaders, at which all issues are on the table.On 18 June 2007, the General Affairs and External Relations Council expressed its strong support for the northern Uganda peace process, and urged the Government of Uganda to shoulder its responsibilities as regards long-term reconstruction in northern Uganda. Ministers also underlined the importance of the Government of Uganda continuing to strengthen respect for human rights and the rule of law and, in this regard, referred to concerns regarding the Karamoja region.Support for human rights is a key element in the Government's efforts to help eradicate poverty and promote development. Through Irish Aid, the Government is committed to strengthening good governance in our partner countries through support for democratic systems of government, public sector reform, strengthening the rule of law and enhancing respect for human rights. In 2006, Irish Aid provided over €32 million in funding to Uganda and has programmed €34 million for 2007. Support for governance is a central element of the Irish Aid programme.In making future assessments of, and decisions about, Ireland's cooperation with Uganda and the human rights situation there, I will be guided by the situation on the ground, as advised by our Embassy in Kampala, and by close contact and liaison with our EU and like-minded development partners.

Rather, it provided clarification on the circumstances in which the Courts will consider granting orders to creditors under the relevant Section.  In this case, it would appear that the applicant company was unsuccessful in convincing the Court that it met the requirements to entitle it to the particular Order sought under the relevant section. In particular the judgement stated that the company failed to demonstrate that a benefit would accrue to it by the granting of the Order. In these circumstances, it would not appear that the case has adverse implications for business generally.Similarly, I do not believe that the judgement has any substantive implications for the work of the Director of Corporate Enforcement.  Under the Companies Acts, the Director has a wide range of investigative and enforcement powers available to him, including recourse to Section 251 where appropriate.  It is a matter for the Director to determine how to exercise these powers in any particular case that comes to his attention.  In this regard, the Director continues to actively pursue breaches of the Companies Acts, including a number of successful actions for the disqualification of the directors of insolvent companies.

Some 55%, or €1.28 million, of the arrears recovered to date in 2007 arises from breaches detected in the construction industry. The Inspection Services, which operates as part of the National Employment Rights Authority, undertook a targeted employment rights compliance campaign in this sector during the summer of 2007. Some €381,000 and €227,000 of the arrears to date in 2007 relate to the Hotels and Catering sectors, respectively, while almost €130,000 of the 2007 arrears arose from the Inspection Services mushroom sector campaign.

Having examined the appeal the Appeals Officer has upheld the original decision in this case.
#BillyKelleher	unknown-#BillyKelleher-party	unknown-#BillyKelleher-dob	unknown-#BillyKelleher-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-28 00:00:00	Prelude	971	The Government is committed to a two-pronged approach to achieving the goal of making workplaces more family friendly — the provision of statutory entitlements through legislative measures, and promoting a partnership approach at the level of the enterprise. Legislative measures which provide for statutory entitlements include maternity leave, adoptive leave, carer's leave and parental leave, along with all the other employment rights legislation. There is no general statutory entitlement to bereavement leave. Whether an employee is entitled to take time off in such circumstances depends on whether any provision exists in the employee's terms and conditions of employment providing for such leave.Legislation is clearly important in terms of protecting workers and providing a base level of protection. However, in general, conditions of employment in excess of statutory entitlements are determined by negotiation and agreement between employers and employees or trade union acting on their behalf.The challenge to achieving work life balance in individual enterprises is to establish policies that reflect the reality of the workplace and meet the many diverse needs of employees.  It is considered that a partnership approach is the best method of addressing work life balance policies at this level in order to achieve tailor made solutions to the benefit of the workforce and the employer.  Accordingly, I have no plans to introduce legislation to compel employers to grant bereavement leave to workers.

I understand from the Department of Social and Family Affairs that since January 2007, 13130 PPS numbers have been issued in respect of Romanian nationals and 886 in respect of Bulgarian nationals.The CSO Quarterly National Household Survey for the third quarter of 2007 indicates that there are 7,000 Bulgarians and Romanians in employment.  The CSO 2006 census indicated that there were 8,492 nationals of Romania and 969 nationals of Bulgaria living in Ireland.  The number of nationals of Romania and Bulgaria recruited through agencies is not known.

#JohnMcGuinness	unknown-#JohnMcGuinness-party	unknown-#JohnMcGuinness-dob	unknown-#JohnMcGuinness-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-28 00:00:00	Prelude	974	The current round of trade liberalisation talks in the World Trade Organisation (WTO), the Doha Development Agenda Round (DDA), covers all aspects of international trade, including agriculture, industrialised goods, services, rules and trade facilitation.  As a small open economy, Ireland has much to gain from a well-ordered rules-based world trading system.  Accordingly, we are working for a balanced and ambitious outcome across all the core areas, where the vital interests of all countries, in particular the developing countries, are taken into account and where the WTO continues to provide a stable and consistent framework for the regulation of world trade.The WTO has had a subtle but profound effect on Irish industrial development.  As the body that sets the rules of international trade, the WTO has regulated and progressively liberalised trade relations between Ireland and nearly all countries outside the EU, including the USA and most of Latin America and Asia.  This has been an important factor behind Ireland's economic transformation over the last four decades. I believe, therefore, that we must continue to work within the WTO to open new markets and develop existing ones.  Ireland's manufacturing and services sectors depend to a large extent on exports.  For them well regulated trade with fair and transparent rules and improved customs procedures is, therefore, of the utmost importance to the development of their industries.Under the EU's Common Commercial Policy, it is the European Commission that has the competence to conduct trade negotiations on behalf of the EU.  These negotiations are conducted on the basis of a mandate agreed by the Council.  My role as Minister for Trade is to ensure that Ireland's interests are reflected to the fullest extent possible in the Common Commercial Policy, and, therefore, in the WTO negotiations.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-28 00:00:00	Prelude	975	My Department, in conjunction with the Enterprise Development Agencies, has taken a number of steps in recent years to identify and address issues affecting the manufacturing and services sectors particularly through implementation of the enterprise action plan arising from the Enterprise Strategy Group report and implementation of recommendations from the Small Business Forum.The 2006 Forfás report on Manufacturing and Services indicated that, despite the manufacturing sector in Ireland experiencing a decline in employment in line with most developed OECD economies, it had achieved very significant increases in output, reflecting growing productivity in the sector. Simultaneously the decline in manufacturing employment has been offset by rapid jobs growth in the services sector.  The report also found that competitiveness challenges in the manufacturing sector need to be addressed if it is to continue to play a major role in the economy.As part of the commitments included under the partnership agreement ‘Towards 2016', I established a high-level manufacturing group, to review the challenges facing the manufacturing sector and to identify further measures to meet those challenges.  This Group, comprised of Industry, Employee, Government and Enterprise Agency representatives, is currently in the process of finalising a report outlining their views and recommendations to ensure that manufacturing continues to play a major role in our economy and will report back to Partnership early 2008.To compliment the work ongoing in the High Level Group on Manufacturing, Forfás have established a group to look at the challenges and opportunities faced by the services sector.  From this group we hope to prepare and position Irish enterprise to adapt to the globalisation of services with the aim of achieving sustainable and competitive services enterprise in Ireland based on three strategic imperatives:Growing a cadre of Irish services companies that can expand into international markets (Overseas Direct Investment); andDeveloping productive and competitive locally traded services including their globalisation potential.The group have met on four occasions and a report outlining how to maximise the future returns to Ireland from services activities in all enterprises, both current and potential, is due at the end of March 2008.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-28 00:00:00	Prelude	976	In 2004 the Enterprise Strategy Group report outlined the sectors where Ireland has considerable potential for future growth, building on existing expertise and capitalising on new opportunities in internationally-traded services, high-value manufacturing in a number of sectors and locally-trading businesses.  A number of service sectors and activities were considered to offer opportunities for exploitation by indigenous enterprises and for increased inward investment and these are set out in Appendix 1.The manufacturing sector in Ireland has evolved noticeably since 2000, in terms of the composition of industry and the nature of activities, and is likely to continue to do so.  Manufacturing continues to be a significant employer accounting directly for 11% of total employment and a significant amount of associated services employment. In order to sustain and grow the sector, the Irish based manufacturing enterprises will have to continue the progression to high value added sectors and activities, and continue to increase productivity through investments in human capital, technology and innovation.Irish manufacturers who engage in specialised, sophisticated, high technology and value added activities can continue to compete successfully on international markets. These sectors often require specialised skilled staff, specialised technologies and flexible operations, and other factors which are not readily available in many low cost economies, such as modern IP protection laws, a business friendly regulatory environment, etc.Many companies in Ireland have built world-class high value added manufacturing and services capabilities, particularly in food, information and communications technology, software development,  pharmaceuticals and medical technologies.  Ireland's existing expertise provides a base for continued wealth creation over the next decade and we envisage that Ireland's manufacturing base will continue to move up the value chain.As part of the commitments included under the partnership agreement ‘Towards 2016', I established a high-level manufacturing group, to review the challenges facing the manufacturing sector and to identify further measures to meet those challenges.  This Group is currently in the process of finalising a report outlining their views and recommendations to ensure that manufacturing continues to play a major role in our economy and will report back to Partnership early 2008.The increasing importance of services is a phenomenon of most developed economies and Ireland is following this trend. Almost 70 percent of the Irish workforce is currently employed in services.  More than one-third of Ireland's exports are in services and Ireland is now the 12th highest exporter of services in the world.  The future performance in services activities will therefore be increasingly important to overall growth in the economy.  To compliment the ongoing work of the High Level Group on Manufacturing, Forfás have established a group to examine the challenges and opportunities faced by the services sector.  From this group we hope to prepare and position Irish enterprise to adapt to the globalisation of services with the aim of achieving sustainable and competitive services enterprise, part of the group's work will be to identify potential growth sectors for the future.  The group have met on four occasions and a report outlining how to maximise the future returns to Ireland from services activities in all enterprises, both current and potential, is due at the end of March 2008.Appendix 1The following service sectors and activities are considered to offer opportunities for exploitation by indigenous enterprises and for increased inward investment:Service SectorsEducation services,Financial services,Healthcare services,Tourism,Creative services,Maritime services,Aviation services,Construction, Engineering and Environmental services,Professional and Consultancy services,Agricultural and Bloodstock services,[Activities]European Headquarters,Franchising, Intellectual property,Sales and Marketing,Shared and Outsourced business processes,Services delivered electronically i.e. eRetailing of Consumer Goods, eServices, Data Management,Supply Chain Management
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-28 00:00:00	Prelude	977	There are a number of competitiveness benchmarks against which Ireland is measured.  For example, the World Bank ranks Ireland as 8th out of 178 economies globally for "ease of doing business".  This puts us in the top 5% of world economies in their survey. In its recently published report on global competitiveness rankings, the World Economic Forum (WEF) positioned Ireland, in 22nd position out of 131 countries.  This puts us in the top 20% of its list of competitive economies.  Within the areas measured we are in 5th place for financial market sophistication and 4th for "goods market efficiency".  This is important because included in this category we are ranked 1st for the positive impact of business rules on foreign direct investment.  We are also ranked in 1st place for the impact of foreign direct investment as an important source of new technology.These issues are important because they underline our solid reputation as a flexible, competitive and technologically orientated economy in which it is worthwhile to invest. And of course what holds for foreign investors is equally true for the environment in which indigenous firms are encouraged to start and grow.  These are clear and unambiguous competitive advantages for our economy.Nevertheless, the broad enterprise sector and exporters in particular are facing some immediate challenges.  For the most part these are driven by external events in currency, financial and commodity markets.  The external value of the euro, flexibility and availability of credit and the unique and unprecedented cost of oil/energy are important cost components over which companies in Ireland have no control.However, I am confident that the adaptability of our enterprise sector will overcome these challenges.  Our forward looking enterprise policy has helped reposition the economy and influenced a structural change in what our economy produces.  Our economy has moved into higher value added, technology based and more innovative products and services.  This is reflected in another WEF competitive indicator based on business managers' belief that Ireland's competitiveness in international markets is founded more on unique products and processes, than low cost.  We scored equal with the U.S. on this indicator of competitiveness and are well inside the top 15% of the economies looked at by the World Economic Forum.This also reflects the strategic emphasis that my Department places on providing resources to enable enterprise in Ireland engage more successfully and profitably with the more complex yet higher yielding research, development and innovation process.This will continue, at a strategic level through the National Development Plan and the Strategy for Science, Technology and Innovation. At firm level this will continue through closer engagement with individual companies by the enterprise development agencies.  In respect of the very important indigenous sector, the early ground-work for this is already in place through Enterprise Ireland's new strategic direction to 2010, that I launched last month.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-28 00:00:00	Prelude	978	Employment data in enterprise agency assisted firms is collated by Forfás on an annual basis only. Accordingly data on jobs created and jobs lost in 2007 will not be available until early 2008 and in annual format only.The latest employment data published by the Central Statistics Office indicates that the numbers in employment grew by almost 68,000 in the year to Quarter 3 2007 bringing the total number in employment to 2,140,900 (Quarterly National Household Survey 15 November 2007).  The seasonally adjusted data indicate that the unemployment rate decreased from 4.5% to 4.4% in the 12-month period and a similar decrease was recorded between the second and third quarters of 2007 when unemployment fell by 3,000.Overall, Ireland has performed very strongly over the last few years, however as the country's economy moves to higher value added activities, providing quality sustainable jobs, some traditional lower-cost industries throughout the country are under pressure. Ireland is no longer a low cost economy and manufacturers in particular are facing increased competition from producers in lower cost economies.  The model of manufacturing in developed countries is changing and Irish enterprises are adapting to those changes and engaging in higher value added activities in order to compete in the global marketplace.  This has been achieved as a result of increased productivity, technology levels and sophisticated skills of Irish employees. Competition for foreign direct investment (FDI) is also relentless but Ireland continues to punch above its weight when it comes to attracting overseas investment.  While costs are higher, we have responded by positioning ourselves as a location for more advanced activities, with more qualified and better paying jobs.For the Government's part we will continue to pursue policies to promote lifelong learning and up-skilling to improve labour market flexibility and, where necessary, ensure that appropriate training supports are provided for workers in sectors that are no longer competitive, should they need to find alternative employment.The performance of the enterprise sector has been pivotal to the huge success of the Irish economy in recent years and Ireland's long term economic success will depend on the continued strength of our enterprise base.  There are almost six hundred thousand more people at work now than 10 years ago and while overall economic performance remains strong the Government is committed to increasing the number of high-paid jobs and knowledge intensive investment needed to sustain our performance into the future.The new Programme for Government contains a range of commitments focused on maintaining and enhancing our framework competitive conditions, and promoting new areas of competitive advantage, including by developing our R&D base, investing in critical physical and communications infrastructures, and promoting tertiary education and lifelong learning.  Over the period of the new National Development Plan the Government will provide €3.3bn investment specifically to support the development of the indigenous and FDI enterprise base.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-28 00:00:00	Prelude	979	Ministerial-led Trade Missions are an integral part of our work to develop and expand Ireland's exports to existing and new markets abroad. It has been the experience of my Department and of the companies participating in such missions that the presence of a Minister enhances the opportunities for the companies involved and achieves a higher level of recognition and access to the various markets.  During my term as Minister for Enterprise Trade and Employment since 2004, missions led either by myself or by the Minister for Trade and Commerce, have proven very successful and significant opportunities have resulted for the companies involved in expanding our trade.As Trade Missions, the primary purpose of these visits is not primarily the attraction of Foreign Direct Investment.  A separate and distinct series of Ministerial-led visits, organised in association with IDA Ireland, specifically pursues the attraction of such investment to Ireland.  However, where possible and appropriate, I avail of the opportunity presented by my presence abroad on Trade Missions to meet with existing and prospective IDA company clients, to pursue investment opportunities in Ireland.  There is an important incremental effect in pursuing such contacts at every opportunity and this is a significant factor in building up the level of Foreign Direct Investment in Ireland, which has resulted in over 1,000 foreign companies locating here, who currently employ over 135,000 staff.Our success in developing our foreign trade markets and also in attracting Foreign Direct Investment is the result of a combination of the ongoing work of the relevant agencies and also of the Ministerial missions abroad.  It is obviously not possible to disaggregate and measure the impact of specific Ministerial meetings, but the different elements all combine to achieve our present very satisfactory position, both in relation to our attraction of FDI and the expansion of our export markets.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-28 00:00:00	Prelude	980	Since the beginning of 2007 IDA Ireland has made 37 new project announcements with a potential job creation figure of in excess of 3,000.It is necessary to distinguish between jobs announced and actual jobs created. There is always a timelag, often stretching over many years, between the announcement of jobs and their creation.  The actual number of new jobs created in IDA supported companies in the calendar year 2007 will not be available until the Forfás Annual survey is published in early 2008.  The actual number of new jobs created in IDA supported companies in each of the years from 1997 to 2006 is set out in the attached tabular statement.The level of foreign direct investment (FDI) in Ireland, relative to the size of the economy, is one of the highest in the world, with many of the world's leading overseas companies having substantial international operations here.  Some of these companies may have started with a manufacturing or basic services remit but have since taken on strategic activities such as next generation shared services, R&D, value-chain and supply-chain optimisation and EMEA headquarters.At the end of 2006 there were over 135,000 people employed in over 1,000 IDA assisted companies.  It should be noted that, in addition to the actual jobs created in IDA supported companies, FDI has significant multiplier effects throughout the economy.  Additional jobs are created in indigenous industry, for example in companies that are engaged in sub supply as well as service jobs in the local economy.  In addition to these direct benefits, FDI creates demand for high skills, advanced management and business processes, and guides beneficial national developments in education, science, telecommunications and other infrastructure.The measures of progress in a globalised, high-value and knowledge-intensive economy, as we have in Ireland, are different to those that we used in the past.  The number of jobs created was the key criterion of success in the 1990's, whereas now it is the quality and value of the activities undertaken here that matters, specifically in areas such as more skill-intensive manufacturing, financial services, headquarters functions for European and wider markets, and in research and innovation.I am satisfied that the good work already being done by the Agency in winning important new investment for the country will continue into the years ahead.Table showing the number of new jobs created in IDA supported companies in each of the years 1997 to 2006Year1997199819992000200120022003200420052006Number of Jobs Created14,58215,81217,73822,80212,84710,5019,39910,97212,03211,846

Figures for the first 8 months of this year show that merchandise exports to the US were actually up slightly on the same period in 2006, despite this pressure.  Earlier this year I led a Trade Mission of 34 Irish companies to New York, Boston and Washington.  The outcome was very satisfactory and the companies announced over $40 million in new business sales and partnership deals with US customers, during that mission.Enterprise Ireland (EI) have five offices in the United States and their primary focus is to increase sales and partnership deals for EI client companies in the US market.  There are over 200 EI client companies in 1,300 locations across the US.  These companies employ over 80,000 people in 50 States.  EI's work is facilitated through client-buyer introductions, market intelligence support in market entry/validation and an extensive range of focused group projects, targeted at specific industries or regional areas.  In the coming years, EI will work intensively with its client companies to grow their business. In 2006, exports by Irish owned companies to the US reached $1.7 billion, which is an 8% increase on 2005. To date in 2007, Enterprise Ireland clients have opened 24 new offices in the US.  I am therefore satisfied that significant progress is being made in this market.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-28 00:00:00	Prelude	982	The position in relation to imports and exports of Merchandise goods over the last five years is given in the following table.Data for the first eight months of 2007 show Merchandise Exports have increased by 5% over the same period in 2006 and Merchandise Imports for the same period have increased at a slower rate, i.e. 3%.For the period 2004-2006 Merchandise Imports have been rising somewhat faster than Merchandise Exports, but there a number of pertinent factors involved. An inevitable consequence of increased production of goods for export, especially in the specialised sectors of the economy, is that component and raw materials for those sectors will be required to drive the increased manufacture of additional goods. While these are sourced in Ireland wherever feasible, inevitably a proportion of input items, including petroleum and its products, can only be sourced overseas.Despite this, Ireland still has a very significant surplus in our merchandise trade, amounting to over €26 bn last year.Services trade data for the first six months of 2007 show Exports of €30.136 bn and Imports of €32.136 bn.  This means that the trend of significant growth in Services Exports is continuing and, also, that the deficit is continuing to close.This combined data shows a very healthy trade position. Inevitably there will be fluctuations in relation to the various elements which impact on the ongoing position.I would like to assure the Deputy that Enterprise Ireland, the agency with responsibility for the development of manufacturing and internationally traded services of indigenous companies, is acutely aware of the significant challenges and opportunities that have emerged as a result of globalisation and increased global competition.  The agency does and will continue to work very closely with its client companies to help them grow and develop both here in Ireland and on world markets.YearImportsExportsTrade Surplus€m€m€m200255,62893,67538,047200347,86582,07633,211200451,10584,40933,304200557,46586,73229,267200660,76986,84326,074The following table show the position in relation Services Trade—YearImportsExportsDeficit€bn€bn€bn200243.11928.731-14.388200348.22337.133-11.090200452.62542.424-10.201200557.52148.219-9.302200662.47155.051-7.420
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-28 00:00:00	Prelude	983	Economy wide employment data are officially collected by the Central Statistics Office through, for example its Quarterly National Household Survey and Live Register analysis. Collection of these data does not however include a module on the context in which employment changes take place.The latest QNHS shows that employment grew by almost 68,000 or 3.3% in the year to the third quarter of 2007. This means that employment in the economy has reached an historic high of 2,140,900. One feature of a competitive economy is the growth and flexibility it shows in creating new employment to replace jobs that are lost. The economy is dynamic and jobs will inevitably be lost as sectors decline, new products replace older ones and competition changes how business is done. Ireland clearly is meeting this aspect of competitiveness.Some more extensive employment data is available from Forfás. This agency compiles an Annual Employment Survey that provides an analysis of employment levels in manufacturing and internationally traded services companies under the remit of IDA Ireland, Enterprise Ireland, Shannon Development and Údarás na Gaeltachta. The latest findings are for the 2006 survey and they reflect the robust employment growth that has been taking place in the enterprise sector that are clients of my Department's enterprise agencies.Total permanent full-time employment in agency-assisted companies operating in the manufacturing or internationally traded services sectors amounted to 305,062 in 2006, an increase of 5,927 jobs on the previous year. This was the highest level of net job creation since 2000. Total full-time employment among Irish-owned companies amounted to 151,710 in 2006, an increase of 3,014 on the previous year. This was the second year running that the Irish-owned enterprise base has experienced an increase in employment levels. At the end of 2006, employment among Irish-owned companies was 20,558 or 15.7 per cent higher than it was in 1997. For the second year running there was an increase in the number employed in Irish-owned manufacturing companies and permanent full-time employment within Irish-owned manufacturing companies was marginally higher at the end of 2006 than it was in 1997.Nevertheless the international operating environment for business is not as benign as it has been over the past few years. This increases the importance of driving productivity growth to counteract the numerous external pressures that are emerging in important areas such as financial and commodity markets. With their range of carefully designed support programmes, my Department's enterprise agencies will continue to hold open their doors to clients who ask for help in strengthening their firms' competitiveness.

#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-28 00:00:00	Prelude	985	Job losses occur for a wide variety of reasons and therefore it is not possible to quantify the actual numbers of jobs, that have been lost to more competitive economies.  There are a variety of factors involved in a firm's decision to move all or part of their operations offshore.  In addition to relative wage rates and other cost factors, these may include business takeovers, consolidations and changes in product or market focus.  The relocation of businesses, within particular types of industry, is a reality of modern global manufacturing for a highly developed economy such as ours.Ireland is no longer a low cost economy and manufacturers in particular are facing increased competition from producers in lower cost economies.  The model of manufacturing in developed countries is changing and Irish enterprises are adapting to those changes and engaging in higher value added activities in order to compete in the global marketplace.  This has been achieved as a result of increased productivity, technology levels and sophisticated skills of Irish employees.  Competition for foreign direct investment (FDI) is also relentless but Ireland continues to punch above its weight when it comes to attracting overseas investment.  While costs are higher, we have responded by positioning ourselves as a location for more advanced activities, with more qualified and better paying jobs.The following table sets out the number of full time manufacturing job gains and losses in Enterprise Ireland and IDA Ireland assisted firms in Co. Kildare for each of the years between 2002 and 2006.  Overall in the period in question 4,031 new manufacturing jobs were created while job losses amounted to 3,048.  In addition Kildare County Enterprise Board assisted in the creation of 136 net new Manufacturing jobs over the period, giving an overall net increase in manufacturing employment in Kildare of 1,389 in the period.The enterprise development agencies are committed to promoting Kildare as a location for investment as part of an integrated East Region, with access to a population base of 1.5 million people, as well as supporting and developing businesses already present in the county.Kildare has in recent years attracted some world class manufacturing companies such as Intel, Braun Oral-B and Hewlett Packard.  These companies continue to invest in the area as evidenced by Hewlett-Packard Financial Services proposed expansion of their EMEA headquarters in Leixlip and Intel's plans to establish the Technology Research for Independent Living (TRIL) Centre in Ireland.  Approximately $30 million invested in the TRIL Centre over a period of three years and Intel will collaborate with several leading Irish universities, including UCD, TCD and NUI Galway to create one of the largest research efforts of this type in the world.  IDA Ireland is also working to attract the International Services, Software, Financial Services and Pharmaceuticals sectors.Enterprise Ireland activity is focussed on the creation of new jobs through supporting entrepreneurs in manufacturing and internationally traded services companies who are setting up new High Potential Start-Up Companies.  Since the beginning of 2003, EI has approved over €12m in support to companies in Kildare to help them grow their sales and exports and improve innovation and new product development in order that they can compete on world markets.  The consumer foods sector in particular, has shown rapid growth in recent years.  Over the last two years we have seen significant investment by Green Isle Foods and Dawn Farm Foods Ltd, both supported by Enterprise Ireland, leading to significant employment increases in both of these state of the art facilities.20022003200420052006Change over PeriodJob Gains8828431,0207737834,301Job Losses-499-747-733-382-687-3,048Net change38396287391961,253

After that date the current trading arrangements under the Cotonou Agreement must end if the EU and our ACP partners are to meet our international obligations in the World Trade Organisation.However, some of the ACP regions, including Central Africa, have since indicated that it will be difficult for them to agree the terms of a full EPA by that deadline.  For those cases, the Commission has issued, in October last, a Communication setting out its proposals for a two-step approach.  This approach is to put in place new arrangements to deal with trade in goods after the 31st of December and to continue with negotiations for all other aspects of a full EPA into next year.At the EU General Affairs Council of the 21st of November last, the Development Ministers considered the current state of the negotiations for EPAs and the Commission's proposals for this two-step approach.  In its Conclusions, the Council described the Commission's proposals as pragmatic and endorsed the approach as an interim solution.  On the issue of continuing negotiations for full EPAs into 2008, the Council called for a flexible and phased approach.Ireland agrees that the negotiations must be conducted in a spirit of goodwill, flexibility and understanding.  We have always said that any resulting agreements must be supportive of ACP countries' development needs and their poverty reduction strategies.The current trading arrangements under the Cotonou Agreement are not compatible with the rules of the World Trade Organisation.  In order to allow time for the EU and its ACP partners to negotiate new agreements, the WTO granted a waiver until the end of this year.  Once that waiver expires, developing countries that are not in the ACP regions will have the opportunity to challenge any trading regime that does not meet the requirements of the WTO.  Trading arrangements that are legally vulnerable would not be in interests of the ACP countries, or its traders.  For this reason, it is not feasible to look to continue the preference system under the Cotonou regime.

#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-28 00:00:00	Prelude	1006	The information requested by the Deputy is not readily available. With effect from the 1st January 2005, the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) through its network of local Special Educational Needs Organisers (SENOs), is responsible for allocating resource teachers and special needs assistants to schools to support children with special needs. The SENOs operate within my Department's policy parameters in considering these applications and convey decisions directly to the schools.  My Department's policy parameters include resource levels which are considered appropriate to meet the needs of children with different categories of special need. While a professional report may from time to time make a particular recommendation for resource levels the SENO also needs to take account of the resource levels already available to a particular school. In addition full consideration is given to any exceptional cases.

The scheme is not designed to facilitate parents who choose to send their children to a post-primary centre outside of the catchment area in which they reside. However, children who are fully eligible for transport to the post-primary centre in the catchment area in which they reside, may apply for transport on a concessionary basis to a post-primary centre outside of their own catchment area — otherwise known as catchment boundary transport. These children can only be facilitated if spare seats are available on the bus after all other eligible children travelling to their local post-primary centre have been catered for. Such children have to make their own way to the nearest pick up point within that catchment area.The Transport Liaison Officer for Co. Kildare and Bus Éireann have advised that the transport service under the school transport scheme is operating to capacity. The family in question should continue to liaise with Bus Éireann regarding the availability of catchment boundary seats in the future.

#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-28 00:00:00	Prelude	1018	The school to which the Deputy refers recently received a new school building with capacity for 600 pupils.  In September 2007, the total enrolment in the school was 320 pupils.  Its first year intake was 71 pupils.Details of enrolments from individual feeder schools in 2007 are not yet available however, in 2006, 68 pupils from a total of 218 6th class pupils from 8 gaelscoileanna in Kildare, Meath and Co. Dublin enrolled in the school.This represents 31% of the potential intake — consistent with this year's pattern.While there are plans to increase capacity at 2 of the 8 gaelscoileanna feeding into this gaelcholáiste, an increase in the amount of 6th class pupils emerging from this development is not expected for at least six years.Pre-enrolment lists at not held by the Department but, as matters stand, there are some 30 first year places available each year over and above the actual enrolment.  This also means that over a six year cycle, enrolment in the school is likely to be in the region of c. 420 pupils, again leaving vacant capacity of some 180 pupil places.Given the extent of current vacant capacity and the pattern of enrolments, my Department is satisfied that additional places are not required for the area at this time.  It has agreed, however, to keep the situation under review.

A Planning and briefing meeting was recently held with the successful design team in order to allow this project commence architectural planning.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-28 00:00:00	Prelude	1020	The Board of Management of the school referred to by the Deputy is the Client/Contracting Authority for their proposed building project. As client, the Board is currently overseeing the appointment of an architectural Design Team and I understand that this process is at an advanced stage.Progression of all projects to tender and construction will be considered in the context of my Department's multi-annual School Building and Modernisation Programme.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-28 00:00:00	Prelude	1021	As the Deputy will be aware, all schools have access to assessments for their pupils either directly through NEPS or through the Scheme for Commissioning Private Assessments. Through this scheme, schools that are not yet served directly by NEPS or Dublin VEC psychologists can commission assessments from any one of 140 private psychologists and NEPS will pay for them.During the last academic year some 4,400 assessments were funded under the SCPA, at a total cost of nearly €1.5 million.Almost 5,800 assessments were carried out by NEPS psychologists in the same period. In total over 10,000 assessments were paid for by my Department in the last school year.The number of schools served directly by NEPS is, therefore, only half the picture. Nonetheless, the Government is committed to expanding the number of NEPS psychologists, so that more schools can receive a direct service. As part of this expansion, funding was made available earlier this year for 31 extra psychologists to be appointed to NEPS in 2007. The number of NEPS psychologists has increased from a total of 128 in April to a current level of 134. In all 9 psychologists have been recruited in this period but due to the normal effect of resignations and retirement the net increase is 6. While recruitment for the remaining positions has taken longer than expected, it is under way.Six psychologists have been recruited since September and these undergo an induction and work shadowing process before being assigned a full quota of schools. The full effect of this intake which will not therefore become apparent in coverage terms for a number of weeks/months. In addition my Department has recently contracted a further 5 psychologists with 4 due to take up duty later in November/December this year. A further psychologist will take up duty in early January 2008.The panel concerned is now exhausted and the Public Appointments Service has recently announced the commencement of a competition from which a new panel will be drawn to continue the recruitment process. The competition has been focused on the appointment of psychologists outside the Dublin region. The deadline for receipt of applications in this regard has now passed and work is proceeding on the short-listing of candidates for interview. It is envisaged that the process will be completed and panels formed early in the new year allowing recruitment to re-commence soon after. In this regard the assignment of psychologists to particular counties or regions will be predicated upon (1) the current levels of staffing in each NEPS region and (2) the availability of panellists to serve in those regions as a result of the new competition. The latter will not be known until the interviews are completed and the panels formed.

#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-28 00:00:00	Prelude	1024	As the Deputy is aware,  the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) was required by the Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs (EPSEN) Act, 2004 to provide a report on the Implementation of the Act.  This report is, essentially, advice to the Minister for Education and Science, regarding the steps the Council considers necessary to implement EPSEN, within a period not greater than five years from the starting date of the Council.  The Council's report also signalled the broad range of issues, and areas where discussion needs to take place in advance of implementation.My Department has completed its examination of the report and steps have been taken by in regard to many of the issues raised in the report.  A series of consultations have been held with the education partners, including school management bodies, teachers' unions and parent representative bodies, at which a range of issues were explored in the context of delivering the provisions of the Act.  Arising from this process, my Department is developing proposals for the implementation of the Act and it is hoped to complete this work shortly.

Ireland achieved a relatively high compliance rating in respect of the revised 40 Recommendations which had been adopted by FATF in 2003.  These recommendations have largely been embodied in the Third EU Money Laundering Directive (on the prevention of the use of the financial system for the purpose of money laundering and terrorist financing), which is now in the process of being transposed into Irish law.As the Deputy is aware, Ireland already has extensive legislation in place to tackle money laundering and the financing of terrorism as set out in the Criminal Justice Act 1994 (as amended) and the Criminal Justice (Terrorist Offences) Act 2005. With regard to operational matters, in the context of combating these activities, there is ongoing cooperation and exchange of information between the relevant supervisory and police authorities within the EU.I will soon be submitting to Government for approval, a General Scheme of a Bill which will further strengthen our existing legal framework in this area.  This Scheme will give effect in Irish law to the EU Third Money Laundering Directive and will take into account the relevant recommendations contained in the FATF Report, which come within the remit of my Department. The Scheme will also give legislative effect to the provisions of the 2005 Council of Europe Convention on Laundering, Search, Seizure and Confiscation of the Proceeds from Crime and on the Financing of Terrorism.In line with standard FATF procedures, Ireland will be making a report to the FATF Plenary in February 2008 outlining the progress made on the implementation of the specific recommendations contained in the FATF Report on Ireland.

This is due to the fact that the Dublin Metropolitan District Courts are located in this Garda Division and issued bench warrants remain in this Division until such time that they are required.The Deputy will appreciate that it is in the nature of any criminal justice system that at any point in time a significant number of warrants are outstanding pending execution.The number of Bench Warrants, Penal Warrants and Committal Warrants which were recorded on the PULSE system as being on hand on 25 November, 2007:RegionBench WarrantPenal WarrantCommittal WarrantCarlow/Kildare1,0483,920261Cavan/Monaghan9651,968158Clare5411,52183Cork City1,7414,151393Cork North3891,450206Cork West3261,16850Donegal1,5902,33657DMR Eastern9042,144121DMR North Central15,4933,452274DMR North1,0315,581258DMR South Central4131,546158DMR South1,6207,899207DMR West8158,168275Galway West1,7682,881109Kerry3801,34671Laois/Offaly6141,383198Limerick1,2943,47198Longford/Westmeath7261,701143Louth/Meath1,6206,849222Mayo3261,17974Roscommon/Galway East38581335Sligo/Leitrim34976621Tipperary5951,730109Waterford/Kilkenny5582,277127Wexford/Wicklow8231,627104

A refusal or failure to provide the special treatment or facilities shall not be deemed reasonable unless such provision would give rise to a cost, other than a nominal cost, to the provider of the service in question.The practical support provided for in the Act of 2000, if there is a failure to provide reasonable accommodation, is that the person who has been discriminated against may seek redress by referring the case to the Equality Tribunal and/or seek advice from the Equality Authority. My Department has no funds out of which moneys are made available for services of the kind referred to by the Deputy.
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-28 00:00:00	Prelude	1044	It is important to note that there is a wide range of circumstances where a person with a mental health issue can interact with the criminal justice system.  It is a complex issue and there is not one simple solution that addresses all the issues involved.  There are persons who commit criminal offences and have or have subsequently developed mental health problems unrelated to their criminal behaviour.  While these persons need treatment, it may not always be appropriate that they be diverted away from the criminal justice system.There are other persons who commit very serious criminal acts but their mental health is such that they are either not fit to be tried or if fit to be tried are found not to be criminally accountable for their actions because of mental disorder.  As is appropriate, such persons do come before the criminal courts but are diverted away from the possibility of imprisonment by virtue of the provisions of the Criminal Law (Insanity) Act, 2006.  The Act makes provision for the diversion of persons, in certain circumstances, appearing before the courts on criminal charges who are suffering from a mental disorder as defined, away from prison to either a designated centre (i.e. a psychiatric centre) where they may receive any necessary in-patient care or treatment or, where appropriate, outpatient care or treatment.  This applies in circumstances where the court determines that an accused person is unfit to be tried having heard evidence from an approved medical officer that the person is suffering from a mental disorder.In addition, section 5 of the Act provides that, following a verdict of not guilty by reason of insanity, if the court is satisfied, having considered a report from an approved medical officer, that the person concerned is suffering from a mental disorder as defined and is in need of in-patient care or treatment, the court must commit the person to a specified designated centre.Having said that my Department and the Irish Prison Service are only too well aware that there are other individuals suffering from mental illnesses who continue to find themselves before the courts arising from behaviour which can be attributed to that illness in circumstances where it would be in everyone's interest to have the issue addressed as a health issue rather than a criminal justice issue.  In that regard my Department and the relevant criminal justice agencies are cooperating with the Department of Heath and Children in seeking to identify ways in which this issue can be resolved.The Report of the Expert Group on Mental Health Policy, "A Vision for Change" acknowledges gaps in the current provision for forensic mental health services and recognises that such services should be available in all areas where law enforcement agents are likely to encounter individuals with severe mental health problems.  The Government has accepted the Report as the basis for the future development of mental health services in this state.Implementation of the individual recommendations of "A Vision for Change" is a matter primarily for the HSE.  In July 2006, the HSE established an implementation group to ensure that mental health services develop in a synchronised and consistent manner across the country.  I understand that the HSE intend to publish an implementation plan shortly which is to include a timed and prioritised set of short, medium and longer-term goals.The Forensic Mental Health Service functions mainly as an in reach service to prisons, providing clinics and consultations on request, and where necessary, advising on the transfer of persons to the Central Mental Hospital.  Staffing in the Forensic Mental Health Service has now been increased to seven consultant psychiatrists and six fully staffed, multidisciplinary teams.  This has enabled the HSE to further strengthen forensic mental health services in 2007, with the assignment of one consultant psychiatrist and appropriate staff, on a full time basis, to the remand prisons.

#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-28 00:00:00	Prelude	1047	Current Policing Plans are designed, inter alia, to address the prevention of anti-social and public order offences, the prevention of crime including crimes against persons and property and the maintenance of an environment conducive to the improvement of quality of life of the residents. This strategy is, and will continue to be, central to the delivery of a policing service to the area in question. The Carlow/Kildare Divisional Policing Plan for 2008 currently being prepared will contain measures to prevent and detect crime.Over the lifetime of this and the last Government the strength of An Garda Síochána has been significantly increased. The current Programme for Government re-affirms the commitment to a Garda strength of 15,000, with a target date of 2010, and commits us to increasing the strength of the Force further to 16,000 by 2012.The personnel strength of the Carlow/Kildare Division at the end of the third quarter of 2007 was 398 compared to a personnel strength of 362 at the end of the third quarter of 2006. This represents an increase of 10%.It is the responsibility of the Garda Commissioner to allocate personnel taking all aspects of policing into account. Garda personnel assigned throughout the country, together with overall policing arrangements and operational strategy, are continually monitored and reviewed.  Such monitoring ensures that optimum use is made of Garda resources, and the best possible Garda service is provided to the general public. The situation will be kept under review by the Commissioner and when additional personnel next become available the needs of the Carlow/Kildare Division will be fully considered by him within the overall context of the needs of Garda Districts/Divisions throughout the country.

In that context they may also apply to be exempt from employment permit requirements.  The dependants of the aforementioned, who have been legally resident in the State for over five years may also apply for long term residency.  This particular long-term permission does not grant an exemption from employment permit requirements to any such dependants.  Time spent in the State on student conditions cannot be counted towards long term residency.  While applications for long term residency are under consideration, the person concerned should ensure that their permission to remain in the State is kept up to date.  An application for long-term residence from the person referred to by the Deputy was received in April 2006.  A refusal letter was issued in September 2006 as he did not meet the criteria.  A second application was received in February 2007.  I understand that applications received in July 2006 are currently being dealt with.  As soon as a decision is made on the case, the person concerned will be notified.

On 18 July 2007, my Department issued approval to Athy Town Council to proceed with the works and set a revised budget of €2,790,749.  It is now a matter for the Council to progress this project.  I understand that while the project has not yet commenced, the contract is expected to be signed shortly.  Recoupment of expenditure to the authority does not arise until the contract has been signed.

South Tipperary County Council is advancing the scheme jointly with Stage 2 of the Fethard Water Supply Scheme which is also approved for funding under the Rural Towns and Villages Initiative.

#BattOKeeffe	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-party	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-28 00:00:00	Prelude	1062	Mortgage finance for affordable housing has traditionally been provided by local authorities through funding by Housing Finance Agency borrowings and this continues to be the case.  However, in recent times my Department has facilitated a number of the main financial institutions in also introducing mortgage finance for persons wishing to access affordable housing.  It is, therefore, not obligatory for a purchaser of an affordable home to source their mortgage loan from a local authority.Interest rates on local authority loans are determined by the Housing Finance Agency by reference to prevailing rates in the financial market. The current variable rate is 5%, which is approximately 0.15% below an average variable rate of the five largest mortgage lenders.  Alternatively, a person may opt for a fixed rate for a period of five years from the date of the loan advance: the current fixed rate is 5.25%.  At the end of the fixed rate period, a borrower may fix for a further five years or change to a variable rate.  In addition, a mortgage protection charge of 0.598% is applied to all local authority loans.  I am satisfied that local authorities offer competitive mortgage finance to those who require it.

#JohnGormley	unknown-#JohnGormley-party	unknown-#JohnGormley-dob	unknown-#JohnGormley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-28 00:00:00	Prelude	1064	I propose to take Questions Nos. 285, 288 and 290 together.The principle of producer responsibility requires waste producers to contribute to the waste management costs of products which they have placed on the market at end-of-life. In support of this approach, a producer responsibility initiative operates in Ireland in relation to packaging waste, underpinned by the Waste Management (Packaging) Regulations 2003, as amended, which replaced earlier regulations introduced in 1997. Under the regulations, producers who place substantial amounts of packaging on the market – major producers — are required to take steps to recover packaging waste or alternatively to contribute to, and participate in, compliance schemes set up to recover packaging waste.Repak Ltd – established by Irish industry in 1997 to promote, co-ordinate and finance the collection and recovery of packaging waste with a view to achieving Ireland's packaging waste recovery and recycling targets under European Parliament and Council Directive 1994/62/EC on packaging and packaging waste — is the only such approved compliance scheme.Ireland has a successful track record in packaging waste recycling.  Under the Directive, Ireland was required to achieve a 25% recovery rate of packaging waste by 1 July 2001, increasing to a 50% recovery rate by 31 December 2005.  The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has reported in its National Waste Report 2005 — published in January 2007 — that packaging waste recovery increased to 59.9% in that year, indicating that Ireland continues to exceed the current target recovery rate of 50% set by the Packaging Directive.I will shortly be making new consolidated packaging regulations that will further enhance the packaging waste recovery regime.  The improvements I will make are based largely on recommendations of stakeholders and include proposed revisions to increase the number of producers who will incur major producer obligations, to better share the burden of compliance.I fully recognise that despite progress on recycling we need to continue to improve our performance on packaging waste. The Programme for Government provides for a comprehensive review of waste management planning, which I have directed my Department to initiate. This review will, inter alia, look at the desirability of other producer responsibility schemes, including deposit and refund for beverage containers.In the interim, I have recently challenged industry to develop appropriate measures to address packaging waste litter, in particular in relation to beverage containers, and to examine voluntary measures to promote packaging waste prevention and minimisation.  My Department is committed to continuing discussions on these issues in the context of finalising a four-year strategy for the packaging waste sector, this is currently being developed under the aegis of the National Strategy Group on Packaging Waste Recycling which is representative of the relevant public and private sector stakeholders, including Repak.
#JohnGormley	unknown-#JohnGormley-party	unknown-#JohnGormley-dob	unknown-#JohnGormley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-28 00:00:00	Prelude	1065	Newsprint does not come within the definition of packaging and hence is not covered by waste packaging legislation. It is however a major waste stream accounting for about two-thirds by weight of the contents of kerbside dry recyclables.Ireland has to meet challenging targets under the Landfill Directive, specifically diversion rates of 59.3% for 2010, 72.8% by 2013 and 80.1% by 2016 of biodegradable waste from landfill. Paper and cardboard makes up a significant element of biodegradable waste. Under the National Strategy on Biodegradable Waste, paper and cardboard (which includes newsprint) recycling must increase from 49.5% in 2004 to 55% by 2010, 65% by 2013, and 67% by 2016. These are the imperatives that are driving our efforts to persuade the newsprint industry to take responsibility for the waste their products generate, in the same way as other sectors of industry such as packaging, electrical, farm plastics and tyre producers already have.Discussions are continuing with the newsprint industry with a view to developing a producer responsibility initiative (PRI) for the recovery and recycling of newspapers and magazines. Discussions have focused on waste prevention and minimisation issues in the newsprint industry, specifically the practice of "boxing out" i.e. oversupply of magazines, recovery and recycling of unsold newspapers and magazines and post–consumer newsprint waste. A Joint Industry Taskforce, comprising the Regional Newspapers Association of Ireland (RNAI), Newspread and Eason Wholesale Ltd, and co-ordinated by National Newspapers of Ireland (NNI) is leading the negotiations with my Department.Since the establishment of the Taskforce, progress has been made by the industry in increasing the use of recycled paper in newsprint.  My Department has asked the Taskforce to develop an industry code of practice with a view to preventing and minimising waste in this sector. At the suggestion of the Department the National Newspapers of Ireland (NNI) representing the newsprint publishers have now appointed an Environment Officer to co-ordinate the development and management of a PRI and  examine the issues referred to above. I understand that when this review is complete following consultations with the other stakeholders in the industry, with a view to developing a consensus on the key issues —  "boxing out", recovery and recycling of unsold newspapers and magazines and post–consumer newsprint waste — new proposals will be submitted to my Department.My Department will continue to engage with the Joint Taskforce on developing a stable and sustainable industry initiative for the management of this important waste stream. I regard the achievement of progress on this as a priority.

While there has been recent progress in the provision of more infrastructure within Ireland to process materials recovered for recycling, for example in the development of new facilities to process waste electrical and electronic equipment, the Government recognizes the value of developing further markets for recyclates in Ireland.The Market Development Programme for Waste Resources 2007-2011 was published in April 2007. The purpose of the Programme is to promote stable demand for recovered materials and to support the achievement of economies of scale in the production of products made from recycled materials, as well as the need for more recycling infrastructure in Ireland to reduce the reliance on overseas markets. The Programme also seeks to identify new applications and markets for recyclable material and secondary recycled products. Implementation arrangements for the Programme will be put in place shortly.

The Directive provides for periodic review and, if necessary, a revision of this list and in these regards the Commission is to be assisted by a technical committee comprising representatives of the Member States.The Directive is currently being revised and a common position was adopted by the Council of Ministers in June 2007 on the revision proposal. The new Directive will, inter alia, clarify the distinction between waste and non-waste, by-products that are not waste, when waste ceases to be waste and the determination of waste which is considered hazardous. The power to establish criteria on these issues will again be vested in the European Commission, assisted by a Committee.

We now know with a high level of confidence that global greenhouse gas concentrations have increased markedly since 1750 and far exceed pre-industrial values spanning many thousand of years.The globally averaged net effect of human activities since 1750 has been one of warming, and most of the observed increase in globally averaged temperatures since the mid-20th century is very likely due to the observed increase in anthropogenic greenhouse gas concentrations. According to the assessment report, attribution to human activities is now possible for all major continents.Ireland is playing its part in the international effort to combat climate change.  As confirmed in the report "Greenhouse gas emission trends and projections in Europe 2007" published yesterday by the European Environmental Agency, Ireland is on course to meet its target under the Kyoto Protocol.  Furthermore, a fundamental objective of the National Climate Change Strategy is to prepare for the deeper emission reductions to which we are committed, which we must meet in the period to 2020 and beyond.Ireland has consistently supported the strongly proactive position adopted by the EU on mobilising an effective international response climate change.  At the upcoming meetings of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change and the Kyoto Protocol, the EU will be seeking agreement to commence a formal round of negotiations over two years with the aim of adopting a comprehensive global post-2012 agreement by 2009.

A considerable proportion of fisheries boards' resources and the time of personnel is devoted to protection of fish stocks.Last year my Department introduced, on the advice of the fisheries boards, the Conservation of and Prohibition on Sale of Coarse Fish By-Law No. 806, 2006, and the Conservation of Pike By-Law No. 809, 2006, which control fishing for coarse fish referred to by the Deputy.  These By-Laws provide for a number of conservation measures including that of limiting the number of fish that may be taken by anglers.Details of these instruments were advertised as stipulated in the statute and the fisheries boards have undertaken a number of initiatives to publicise their content within the regions.  I am not aware of any recent increase in illegal poaching and no such incidents have been reported to me.

The Science, Technology and Innovation Strategy and the National Development Plan both reflect the vital importance of energy research and innovation to underpin the energy sector and the imperative to deliver sustainable, competitive and secure energy supplies for the economy and society.  Our ambitious renewable energy and energy efficiency targets in particular require a significant ramping up of research and innovation.The Strategy for Science Technology and Innovation published in 2006 noted that approximately 130 energy Research Development and Demonstration projects were underway in Ireland with a total funded value of approximately €25million.  This assessment was based on an inventory compiled by my Department and Sustainable Energy Ireland (SEI) of energy research projects under way in 2004 comprising publicly and privately funded energy research activity.  Under the National Development Plan the Exchequer envelope for energy research over the period is €149 million.  The Irish Energy Council is finalising its Energy Research Strategy 2008-2013, which will advise on key areas of priority for energy research.  Our commitment to building energy research capacity has already been reflected in the provision of €20m for over 200 researchers in Irish third level institutions over 7 years of which €7.9m was paid in 2006.  It is a key priority for the Government to accelerate Research and Development into renewable energy technologies notably ocean energy in order to realise Ireland's undoubted potential and to deliver on the national targets for renewable energy.The Energy Research Council is a non-statutory advisory and coordination forum which will advise on, and generally oversee, the roll out of the forthcoming Strategy.  The Council does not have direct expenditure responsibilities for energy research.  Expenditure under the Energy RTDI subhead of my Department's Vote and the research related programme expenditure of SEI will be reported on annually in terms of outputs and outcomes.
