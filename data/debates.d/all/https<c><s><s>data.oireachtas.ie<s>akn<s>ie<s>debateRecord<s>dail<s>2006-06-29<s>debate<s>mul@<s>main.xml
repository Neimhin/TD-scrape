This may be in action before the Dáil resumes meaning that critical care will have been removed from Monaghan, Cavan, Navan and Dundalk on the word of an outside body which did not even consult the stakeholders. The House must not wash its hands of this issue and we must have the opportunity to hold the Tánaiste and Minister for Health and Children responsible.</p>

What has transpired here is a massive political own goal of gargantuan proportions which shows absolute insensitivity by the Government in respect of approximately 100 women in whose cases the virus may have been cleared but in whom the impact and effect of hepatitis may now just be becoming evident. These women were given to understand that the issue of compensation for medical care and insurance would be dealt with in their interests and that, specifically in the area of insurance, they would not lose benefits while this matter was being dealt with.</p>

          <p eId="para_28">I oppose the taking of this Bill. I seek that the Government withdraws the Bill and comes back having excised the offending sections. This is a betrayal of a small, blighted minority who suffer sickness and stigma as a result of being poisoned by the State through contaminated blood products. That is what we are talking about here. It is a dishonest Bill because consultation took place with the four organisations which are affected and the understanding all the way along that process was that this Bill would be about insurance, because these people cannot get insurance except at a very high rate. That is what this Bill was supposed to be about.</p>

          <p eId="para_30">It is also discriminatory against young people who have suffered from the conditions that were caused by negligence on the part of the State. What the Tánaiste is doing is adding to that betrayal and bringing shame to this House by introducing legislation that will take away rights and entitlements from a tiny group of approximately 100 people who are vulnerable. The Finlay report indicated that 74 people are involved. There is no excuse for what the Tánaiste is doing.</p>

The Government should take the opportunity today to reflect on the unwise way in which it is approaching this issue, given that it has been in discussions for nine years but has received clear information stating that there will be a number of people, whether it be 40 on a database or 100, who will certainly be effectively discriminated against because of the proposed legislation.</p>
          <p eId="para_45">Given that we are under pressure in terms of legislation in many areas I urge the Government not to proceed with the Bill and to go back to the original understanding that this would be stand-alone legislation dealing with the medical care and insurance issues, not a Bill to set up a compensation tribunal. As the Tánaiste is also Minister for Health and Children, I ask her to reflect on what is being said by all parties, as it is being put to us clearly by the women involved that this is a retrograde step and——</p>

          <p eId="para_49">After years of campaigning and lobbying by the Irish Haemophilia Society, the Irish Kidney Association, Positive Action and Transfusion Positive, we find that representatives of these organisations had to come here yesterday, on the eve of the introduction of this Bill, to make representations and to appeal to Members of all parties to seek the withdrawal of this proposal. After all the years of hard work and co-operation by these groups we find a proposal coming before this House today and tomorrow, to be guillotined tomorrow evening, that will impose conditions on them with such a deleterious effect on their interests. Albeit a small number, where there is one, it is one too many.</p>
          <p eId="para_50">The reality is that it is in the gift of the Tánaiste to withdraw the offending sections to ensure this Bill lives up to the rightful expectation of those who have campaigned so long and so hard. I join with colleagues in appealing to the Tánaiste to withdraw this Bill now and to guarantee to this House that she will present a Bill that is truly reflective of the needs of all who should be encompassed within its measures. I ask the Tánaiste to take the opportunity to do so now and not to follow in the footsteps of a former Minister for Health——</p>

          <p eId="para_53">What the Opposition has said is totally and utterly untrue. As Deputy Kenny well knows, there is no question whatever of withdrawing anything from the 70 or 100 women. It is a fact that Positive Action and the liver consultants, as part of the expert group on hepatitis C, agreed that the basis on which a health card should be given should be the ELISA test. That was agreed by the representatives of Positive Action and the liver experts in this country. That has been accepted for some time. That is the basis on which we are going to proceed with the insurance and with the compensation. We will have a single, internationally accepted scientific test.</p>
          <p eId="para_54">When a Bill was proposed on behalf of the groups ten years ago, the senior counsel who drafted that Bill, Mr. John Rogers, proposed at that time that the ELISA test should be used and it was not accepted then because it was not as developed as it is today. I do not want the Opposition playing politics with something.</p>

There is still no sign of the report although journalists have it in part.</p>

          <p eId="para_208">The shooting of Mr. John Carthy happened in 2000, the Barr tribunal hearings in 2004 and still the report has not been published. It was due to go to the printers, according to the tribunal, five weeks ago. In any event, it is not credible in 2006 that a delay with the printer is the reason the report has not been laid before the House. The O'Sullivan report into the statutory rape affair and what went wrong in the Office of the Attorney General was promised within weeks but again the Government will contrive to publish it as soon as the House rises. There will be no opportunity to debate it, although we now know that a note was sent for the attention of the Attorney General. Whether he ever set eyes upon it, we do not know. However, we know that it exists and that it went up the line to him. Similarly, three reports have been held up in the case of the Morris tribunal. Regarding the Tánaiste's remit as Minister for Health and Children, last October she promised to publish the report on the Pat Joe Walsh case within eight weeks. It is now June.</p>
          <p eId="para_209">I am afraid it suggests a deliberate Government plan to keep such reports under covers until the House has risen. It shows disrespect to the House and to democracy and fails to indicate the due regard in which such publications ought to be held.</p>

        <speech by="#MaryHarney" as="#Tánaiste" eId="spk_81">
          <from>The Tánaiste</from>
          <p eId="para_210">The fact is that, due to the principle of natural justice, any report drawing adverse conclusions regarding individuals who can be identified, even if not named, must be issued to them to allow them an opportunity to respond. That is the opinion of the Attorney General and has been the relevant legal advice for many years. In that context, the Dalton report has not yet been published, but I understand the Minister intends to bring it to the Cabinet next Tuesday. The Barr report is not yet with the Government, but we expect it tomorrow. The intention is to publish it as quickly as possible. I do not know when the O'Sullivan report is expected, but it will be within a matter of weeks.</p>
          <p eId="para_211">I had hoped we might have had the report on the late Pat Joe Walsh in eight weeks. However, in the first instance, we had to go outside this jurisdiction to find people to carry out the inquiry. They have now completed their work and the draft conclusions have been sent to those in respect of whom the findings were adverse for a response. I very much regret that parts of the report appear to have been leaked today, since it has never been submitted to the Department of Health and Children and I have not seen it. It appears to have been leaked to a journalist in a prominent newspaper this morning, and I know it has caused great upset to the family of the deceased to whom we spoke last night. They have been kept fully informed at each stage of writing the report. We certainly hope the legal process can be concluded quickly.</p>
          <p eId="para_212">I do not know the position on the Morris tribunal. As the Deputy is aware, several tribunals are ongoing in the State, and much as we would wish to see them conclude more quickly, the process sometimes takes longer than anticipated. However, that is a matter for the tribunal and not something the Government or Oireachtas can influence.</p>

          <p eId="para_213">On the subject of legislation that has been promised but not published, with one week remaining, will the Government reconsider the priority given to the various Bills it proposes to enact before the recess? The Building Societies (Amendment) Bill 2006, for example, strikes me as not being as urgent as the citizens' information legislation the Minister must pass to address advocacy for those with disabilities. Is the Government reflecting on priorities and can it state why it would choose the Building Societies (Amendment) Bill 2006 over that dealing with disabilities and citizens' information? I view the Building Societies (Amendment) Bill 2006 as benefitting one building society and several very high-up people in it.</p>

          <p eId="para_347">A number of institutes have requested that the title of president be used because the title of director abroad, especially in the United States, is usually that of a head of a department, normally a research department, rather than the overall head of the institute.

          <p eId="para_348">It may be important to have a degree of flexibility because there may be institutes that wish to retain the title of director, but it would be preferable for all institutes to operate on a similar basis and with similar titles.

In fact, the amendment tabled by the Minister gives greater flexibility to institutes than the Deputy's amendment. Under the former, an institute could seek approval not only to have a president but also a dean, provost, seneschal or many other types of description, subject to the approval of the Minister. On that basis, I do not propose to accept the amendments tabled by Deputy Enright.</p>

I welcome flexibility, but there should not be too much of it within the system, that is, Carlow IT with a dean, Tralee IT with a provost and another institute with something else. Such would not be a good idea. While a change of title is subject to ministerial approval and, therefore, may be unlikely to happen, it would be better to have consistency across the institutes. This situation does not often occur in the university sector, but it does to a greater extent in the institute of technology sector.</p>

          <p eId="para_354">I welcome that the Minister of State will table an amendment broadly similar to mine. Last year, a head of an institute published a report on participation in services for students with disabilities in institutes of technology. The study was conducted in 14 of the 15 institutes between 2004 and 2005. Unfortunately, its results leave much to be desired in terms of the number of students with disabilities in institutes of technology. In the 14 institutes, only 1,366 graduates had disabilities. In total, this figure represented 2.76% of the undergraduate population.</p>
          <p eId="para_355">There was a quite a degree of variation. At the Institute of Technology Tralee, the figure was 5.5%, but in Cork IT the figure was only 0.5%. The institutes need to place a greater emphasis on persons with disabilities. Likewise, only three institutes employed a disability officer, which was a part-time position in one of those institutes. Six institutes carried out access audits while a seventh was beginning that process. Regarding accessibility to buildings, only in five institutes were all buildings accessible to students with disabilities. This shows the need for a greater emphasis on this matter.</p>
          <p eId="para_356">As universities have been under the Higher Education Authority, they have had a natural advantage in that they were, on average, getting between €500,000 and €1 million in funding ring-fenced for disability initiatives whereas the institutes' average was approximately €50,000. Hopefully, putting the institutes under the HEA will address that issue.</p>

          <p eId="para_367">This amendment concerns security of tenure for staff in institutes of technology. By the introduction of this Bill the rights of lecturers and academic staff in institutes of technology will be inferior to those of similar staff in universities.

          <p eId="para_368">There is also a concern that it could erode academic freedom because it will make it easier to sideline somebody who speaks out in disagreement with the ruling authorities in their institutions, leading to the loss of their position. I acknowledge that there is a commitment to academic freedom in the legislation but it will not have any teeth if somebody can be moved aside in this way. A number of Members spoke on Committee Stage on this issue. It was highlighted that with the growing trend toward private funding for third level institutions there was a danger, as has happened in other jurisdictions, that somebody might be muzzled for speaking out against a product made by a funder of a particular institution.</p>
          <p eId="para_369">There is a fear that this would curtail the ability of academics to speak out. We rely on academics who have a great level of expertise in certain areas. It is important not to dilute their ability to publicly express opinions that might run contrary to the general opinion, either in their own institution or in society. When the Minister spoke on Committee Stage I acknowledged that there might well be people not doing what they should be doing in their jobs and there must be ways to address that, but this Bill has a wider scope and has the potential to create problems. It creates a particularly difficulty in that it abolishes the former sworn inquiry system and replaces it with a system which does not exists in universities. As both will be under the Higher Education Authority both should operate under similar conditions.</p>

        <speech by="#BrianLenihan" eId="spk_212" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Education_and_Science">
          <from>Mr. B. Lenihan</from>
          <p eId="para_370">Deputy O'Sullivan raises interesting questions on tenure and academic freedom. The issues relating to tenure which are the subject of the amendments tabled by the Deputy were discussed on Committee Stage. It is not entirely clear what is meant by the expression "tenure" in this particular context. I will declare an interest in that I was once a lecturer in a university and my understanding is that tenure relates to the degree of permanence a person has in his or her position, and to the famous chair on which members of staff can prop themselves up on occasion. The amendments tabled by Deputy O'Sullivan relate to rights of appeal and those on tenure relate to academic freedom. However, section 7 of the Bill inserts a new section 5A(1) which specifically deals with the question of academic freedom, providing as it does that a college, in performing its functions, shall have the right and responsibility to preserve and promote the traditional principles of academic freedom in the conduct of its internal and external affairs. That has been formulated not just as a right of a college but as a responsibility.</p>
          <p eId="para_371">Section 5A provides that a member of the academic staff of a college, irrespective of what tenure they have, be it occasional or permanent, shall have the freedom, within the law, in his or her teaching, research and other activities either in or outside the college, to question and test received wisdom, to put forward new ideas and to state controversial or unpopular opinions and shall not be disadvantaged or subject to less favourable treatment by the college for the exercise of that freedom. That is an attempt to translate the principle of academic freedom into a legislative statement.</p>
          <p eId="para_372">The founding charters of many of our universities did not contain these principles but a similar provision exists in the universities legislation and they are an attempt to express in legislation the spirit of academic freedom. However, this spirit can only be built up over generations and through good practice and cannot necessarily be legislated for. There are many parts of the world where such expressions are put into charters and legislation relating to higher institutes of education but where the virtue of academic freedom does not obtain in the institutions themselves. The attempt to translate the principle into legislative form accords the same rights to college academic staff as those enjoyed by university academic staff, under section 14(2) of the Universities Act 1997.</p>
          <p eId="para_373">The other aspect of tenure is the degree of permanence, or impermanence, of a particular staff member. Ireland has among the most progressive employment protection legislation in the world so security of employment is not the same issue as it can be in other jurisdictions where tenure, as a concept of isolated existence in the context of university or higher education, is considered very important. For that reason the Minister does not regard these amendments as necessary or desirable. However, I will go through some of the amendments Deputy O'Sullivan tabled in detail.</p>
          <p eId="para_374">Amendments Nos. 19 and 58 relate to the right of appeal. However, the Bill provides that an institute of technology will have power to draw up procedures for suspension and dismissal of new members of staff. The institutes must act in accordance with these procedures, which can only be made following consultation with the relevant stakeholders, and these procedures can provide for a right of appeal. Given that these matters relate very much to the internal workings of an institute, the Minister is of the view that it is better to leave this discretion to each body. She does not propose to accept these amendments.</p>
          <p eId="para_375">Deputy O'Sullivan has also tabled an amendment on normal industrial relations structures. That phrase was examined at the time the Bill was drafted. There is a precedent in the universities legislation along the lines suggested by the Deputy and the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel was consulted. The view it took was that the reference in the Bill to the recognition of staff associations and trade unions is a clearer and more definitive expression than the reference to normal industrial relations structures. Recognised staff associations exist in the institutes so the Minister does not propose to change the reference as proposed by the Deputy.</p>
          <p eId="para_376">Deputy O'Sullivan also tabled amendments Nos. 21 and 60 to remove the power to delegate to the director the ability to suspend or dismiss staff, which is based on a provision of the Universities Act 1997. It is appropriate that this power be vested in the director as the monitoring and supervision of staff is an executive function. The director must take responsibility in such matters. Sometimes an institute will have to act very quickly in response to a given circumstance. Requiring the governing body to convene to make such a decision will not make this possible. It should also be remembered that the normal employment protection mechanisms will be available to new members of staff. In addition, as the Minister stated on Committee Stage, the Department is committed to developing a protocol between it and the relevant unions on disciplinary matters. Once finalised, it has been agreed with the teachers' unions that it will be registered with the Labour Court.</p>
          <p eId="para_377">Amendment No. 22 again relates to the presidency issue.</p>

          <p eId="para_378">I accept the Minister of State's point on amendment No. 20 on industrial relations structures, which I will withdraw. What he said in that regard makes some sense. In regard to amendment No. 18, all I seek is equality of tenure among people in institutes of technology which already exists under the Universities Act and I will press the amendment.</p>
          <p eId="para_379">I am also concerned that the right of appeal, referred to in amendment No. 19 and a subsequent one, is up to the powers that be in the institutes of technology, which does not seem to be of any great help to the staff concerned. It would be much better if they had a right of appeal as opposed to it being at the discretion of their college. Inevitably in those circumstances, people would feel much more secure if there were an independent right of appeal as opposed to it being at the discretion of the college. I will also press amendment No. 19.</p>

          <p eId="para_396">While I appreciate the spirit in which Deputy O'Sullivan tabled this amendment, one must think through the implications of it. The legislation is modelled on the traditional system, with which we are all familiar in the county councils, where distinction is drawn between executive and reserve functions. As Deputy O'Sullivan indicated, the reserve functions are matters for the governing body.</p>
          <p eId="para_397">There is a multiplicity of institutes and, for the sake of consistency, we must have a clear definition of what are reserve and executive functions. As Members who have experience of vocational educational committees and county councils are well aware, these matters often end up being tested in the courts and clear guidelines will have to be prepared and protocols drawn up about the respective functions of governing bodies and directors. Clearly a template will have to be devised following the enactment of this legislation to guide governing bodies and directors on their respective competences and roles.</p>
          <p eId="para_398">If we were not to hold the line and insist on a consistent national standard in this regard, we would face a great deal of local anomaly and difficulty and it would not assist in the effective operation of these institutes. For the sake of consistency, we must have a person who is designated to decide what are reserve functions in the case of a dispute. The person vested with this power under the legislation is the Minister. That is the responsibility the Minister will have to take. On that basis, the Minister does not propose to accept Deputy O'Sullivan's amendments.</p>

Perhaps I overstated the position somewhat in explaining her position. It is only in the case of a dispute that the Minister has power. The delineation of the functions is set out in the Bill and would require legislative change. It may be that a particular dispute could lead to an issue about what are the appropriate functions, which I accept. However, the House would have to address it with amending legislation because the principles of this matter must be set out in the primary legislation.

          <p eId="para_404">I welcome the fact that within 12 months, the director of an institute would have to provide a statement of the policies of the college on access to education, equality, people with disabilities etc. However, we should have a timescale for implementation. I argued this point with the Minister on Committee Stage, but she felt it was broad in the way it is worded. While it is broad, it is certainly not definite. By specifying a timescale, we are asking the institutes to live up to their commitments.</p>
          <p eId="para_405">While an institute might have to address access to education for socially disadvantaged people, the legislation does not specify a timescale within which it must do so. If an institute were able to set aims and targets to be achieved within a specified timescale, for example, to reach a goal by 2010, it would be much better. The governing body could see what had been a success and what areas needed to be addressed. If a timescale is not specified, there is no pressure on the governing body to try to improve particular areas because there is no target to reach.</p>

          <p eId="para_406">I regret to advise Deputy Enright that the Minister remains unpersuaded. The Minister maintains that these amendments are not necessary because section 21D provides that a governing body must prepare a statement of the institute's policies on access to education by economically or socially disadvantaged people, people with disabilities and people who are significantly under-represented in the student body. The policy must also provide for equality in all activities of the institute. The third subsection requires each institute to implement these policies. Once a policy is included in the statement, it must be implemented. It is not a question of a timeframe. Once the body commits itself to a policy, it must be implemented.</p>

          <p eId="para_411">On a technical point, amendment No. 52 on the list of amendments concerns the director and the president. It might be printed wrongly.</p>
          <p eId="para_412">The amendments grouped in my name and that of Deputy Enright relate to appearances before the Committee of Public Accounts by representatives of institutes of technology, universities and other bodies. The Bill states: "A Director, if required under paragraph 8 to give evidence, shall not question or express an opinion on the merits of any policy of the Government or a Minister of the Government or on the merits of the objectives of such a policy." I understand this is standard practice with regard to Secretaries General of Departments and certain other bodies, and I agree it is appropriate with regard to Secretaries General. However, an institute of technology, a university or the Higher Education Authority should not be put into the category. They should be free to discuss budgetary issues and the spending of public money, which is the function for which they are attending the Committee of Public Accounts. This section should not be included in the Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_413">We provided some examples in this regard on Committee Stage. For example, when the programme for funding research at third level, PRTLI, was stalled and funding was stopped for a period, it had an effect on the capacity of third level institutions to carry out their functions and do what they wanted to do and what they felt was right. As it was part of Government policy at the time — fortunately, it is not so any longer — it is an example of how, in giving evidence to the Committee of Public Accounts, a bar on criticising Government policy would inevitably curtail directors in explaining their situation with regard to a Government decision. That is one example but there are others.</p>
          <p eId="para_414">This appears to be an attempt to muzzle representatives of academic institutions, who are not supposed to be instruments of Government policy and who are supposed to have freedom to exercise their judgment, ethos, aims and objectives. That is why we have tabled this series of amendments.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#OlwynEnrightFG" eId="spk_231">
          <from>Ms Enright</from>
          <p eId="para_415">This is an important series of amendments concerning the institutes of technology and the universities. As Deputy O'Sullivan stated, the Committee of Public Accounts deals with matters from a budgetary perspective. However, as our third level institutions are becoming more research oriented, as they need to be, the budgetary issue and the public accounts process will become more important.</p>
          <p eId="para_416">The role of the institutes and universities has evolved greatly, whether in terms of attracting industry or trying to achieve balanced regional development. They are very much part of what is happening in the broader locality around them in the context of attracting industries and trying to ensure the proper skill sets are available to those industries. Obviously, this becomes a budgetary issue if they want to introduce new courses, which may well be an issue that comes before the Committee of Public Accounts. If the directors cannot comment at the committee on Government policy, especially with regard to matters like balanced regional development or PRTLI, referred to by Deputy O'Sullivan, they are effectively muzzled.</p>
          <p eId="para_417">I cannot see any reason for this approach. What the directors say will not always be a criticism. Perhaps they will comment positively on Government policy. Either way, it is vital they are in a position to express themselves.</p>
          <p eId="para_418">In discussing other amendments on Committee Stage, the Minister outlined how the background of the chairpersons of the governing bodies has changed in that we now attract people from companies like Dell and Intel to these positions. These are highly qualified people with much to offer. It is a shame that, as directors of the institutes, they cannot offer their valuable opinions to the Committee of Public Accounts because these opinions would often differ from those of politicians, who come from a different perspective. The inclusion of this section means the country will lose the benefits of involving this type of person. Likewise, academics in the institutions have a valuable contribution to make and those who represent them at the Committee of Public Accounts should be in a position to comment on policy issues.</p>

          <from>Mr. Gogarty</from>
          <p eId="para_419">I am especially concerned about this issue, which is why I tabled amendments Nos. 69 and 71. When a chief executive officer is asked to come before the Committee of Public Accounts, given the visible nature of the committee in terms of the media reportage and the public eye, it is important it is seen to be as transparent as possible. The acceptance of amendments Nos. 69 and 71 would allow for a specific question of a relevant nature to be asked by a member of the committee. The witness would not be asked to give a general opinion but, as Deputy Enright noted, we increasingly need to know the circumstances surrounding specific information, and we might need to understand the opinion itself.</p>
          <p eId="para_420">As members of the Committee of Public Accounts, we should be able to ask for and receive a response which may be an opinion but which would shed light. In that context, the Minister should take into consideration that members of the committee have a certain responsibility and would not ask spurious questions or score political points above and beyond the normal day-to-day points scoring that takes place in these Houses.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#BrianLenihan" eId="spk_233" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Education_and_Science">
          <from>Mr. B. Lenihan</from>
          <p eId="para_421">First, the prohibition on the director questioning or expressing an opinion on the merits of Government or ministerial policy is limited to the circumstances of giving evidence to the Committee of Public Accounts. That constraint does not apply in any other forum. Therefore, the director can leave the Committee of Public Accounts and make a statement criticising Government policy ten minutes afterwards. There is nothing to stop that under this legislation.</p>
          <p eId="para_422">This provision is a standard provision found in many other items of legislation, for example, the Ombudsman for Children Act 2002, the Houses of the Oireachtas Commission Act 2003 and the National Tourism Development Authority Act 2003. It is in line with the Standing Orders of the House, which provide that the Committee of Public Accounts must refrain from inquiring into the merits of a policy or policies of the Government or a member of the Government or the merits of the objectives of such policies. The reason is that the purpose of the committee is not to interrogate Government policy but to check the accounts which have been submitted in respect of the receipts of expenditure by the relevant Department. The Accounting Officer, who appears before the Committee of Public Accounts, may not inquire into the merits of a policy or policies of the Government because that is not the function of the committee.</p>
          <p eId="para_423">The key point is that the subject of the amendments is not the universities or institutes of technology but the Committee of Public Accounts. The purpose of the provision is simply to place the directors in the same position as everyone else who appears before the committee. While the directors are not Accounting Officers, they can be accountable persons in certain contexts and can, therefore, appear before committees. It is in this context that the specific statutory reference is made.</p>
          <p eId="para_424">There is no restriction on a director appearing before the Committee of Public Accounts alluding to the fact that an action taken or not taken was in accordance with or a consequence of a Government or ministerial policy, nor is a director appearing in front of another Oireachtas committee precluded from questioning the merits of Government policy. To continue my earlier example, there is nothing to stop a director appearing before the Committee of Public Accounts and being constrained, in accordance with the Standing Orders and long-term practice of this House, from questioning the merits of Government policy and thereafter appearing before the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Education and Science and criticising Government policy. For these reasons, the Minister does not propose to accept these amendments.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#JanOSullivan" eId="spk_234">
          <from>Ms O’Sullivan</from>
          <p eId="para_425">The Opposition parties are concerned that the provision imposes, in the context of this Bill which also applies to institutes of technology, a new restriction on the universities, National Qualifications Authority and Higher Education Authority. This constraint would create a difficulty in the context of the example I cited of a representative of a university or institute of technology trying to explain in detail the problems encountered in his or her  institution as a result of a decision to pause funding. Other problems could also arise. For this reason, Deputy Enright and I do not propose to withdraw the amendment.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#OlwynEnrightFG" eId="spk_235">
          <from>Ms Enright</from>
          <p eId="para_426">I return to my example of the programme for research in third level institutions, PRTLI. The decision to pause funding for this programme jeopardised research projects already in train in universities. If the head of one of the institutions affected by this pause in funding appeared before the Committee of Public Accounts as part of an examination of the relevant college's finances for the year in question, he would have to state, by way of explaining the reason a particular research project led nowhere, suddenly ceased or lost money, that the change in Government policy and its decision to pause funding had a negative affect on the university. This would require him to comment on Government policy because it directly impacted on the specific research programme. These circumstances arose at the time and although the issue did not come before the Committee of Public Accounts, it may yet be discussed in the committee in future.</p>
          <p eId="para_427">The Committee of Public Accounts is the proper forum established by the House. While the Minister of State may argue that the directors can go before the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Education and Science or speak to the media, which is true, the proper investigating forum for budgetary matters is the Committee of Public Accounts. For this reason, the directors of the institutions need to be able to make their case before the committee. The provision places institutes of technology in an unfair position because their representatives justify themselves before a committee of the House but are not given a fair opportunity to do so because the areas on which they must comment, namely, Government policy, are constrained, as in the example I outlined.</p>

          <from>Mr. B. Lenihan</from>
          <p eId="para_428">Deputy Enright obviously participates in discussions by her party's Front Bench on many issues. I have noted the use to which her party has applied the Committee of Public Accounts in recent months. The job of the committee is not to interrogate public policy but to check State accounts. This is not an accidental matter referred to in Standing Orders but a fundamental practice in Departments. The Accounting Officer takes responsibility for these matters within the Department and has authority superior to the Minister in that connection and cannot be directed by the Minister.</p>
          <p eId="para_429">Were the Deputy to become Minister for Education and Science, there are certain functions the Secretary General of the Department, as the Accounting Officer, would not allow her to carry out. The Accounting Officer, in turn, is accountable to an Oireachtas committee in respect of these matters. That is the system and the provision simply makes the practices in regard to the colleges consistent with this system. It is not the function of the Committee of Public Accounts to criticise or evaluate Government policy. This can be done elsewhere. Its function is to examine the accounts of expenditure of Departments.</p>

No particular solution to these difficulties was readily apparent. While it was relatively easy to find precedents for monetary compensation schemes, nowhere in the world was there a scheme to address the insurance difficulties of this nature. As far as I am aware this remains the position.</p>

          <from>Ms Harney</from>
          <p eId="para_704">The introduction in the Bill of an insurance support scheme on a statutory basis shows the continued commitment of the Government to working with the victims of infection to provide all possible supports to them. This scheme brings to three the key forms of recompense which the State has put in place for this cohort. There are already two forms of recompense in place for persons with hepatitis C and HIV.</p>
          <p eId="para_705">The first is the compensation scheme, administered through the Hepatitis C and HIV Compensation Tribunal. To date the tribunal has incurred expenditure of more than €660 million and made awards to around 2,200 people. This figure includes most of the 1,700 persons infected with hepatitis C or HIV and a significant proportion of their spouses, partners or dependants. The second form of recompense is the provision of a range of health care services under the Health (Amendment) Act 1996. The cost of the health care scheme is approximately €15 million per annum.</p>
          <p eId="para_706">After enactment of the Bill, and to ensure consistency and fairness, every person who receives a compensation award at the tribunal, under the existing or new legislation, will also receive the special health card. I will shortly be in contact with the Health Service Executive in this regard. There will be a third form of recompense in the form of an insurance scheme. This will cost an estimated €90 million over the lifetime of the scheme, estimated to be at least 30 or more years.</p>
          <p eId="para_707">To ensure a consistent approach to all three supports, the Government agreed that a hepatitis C diagnosis should be defined by scientific test, the ELISA test, for chronic infection and certain defined symptoms of acute infection acquired within 16 weeks of the administration of the anti-D product. The symptoms linked with hepatitis C include fatigue, aches and pains, depression, dry skin, rashes and so on. Many of these symptoms are common to several viral and other conditions not associated with hepatitis C and form a significant part of the caseload of most general practitioners. To ensure the support schemes operate in a fair and equitable manner and that those determining eligibility under the schemes use clear consistent criteria, diagnosis will be determined by means of an internationally accepted test. A similar scientific test definition of hepatitis C diagnosis is used in other jurisdictions, such as the UK and Canada, where compensation schemes operate.</p>
          <p eId="para_708">More importantly, the ELISA test is accepted internationally as the standard method for diagnosing hepatitis C for the purposes of health care services. In practice, the test is used as the first-line indicator that any hepatitis C sufferer has been exposed to the hepatitis C infection at some time in the past and should be further investigated for evidence of current infection. The expert group on hepatitis C, chaired by the chief medical officer of the Department and Health and Children and including representation from leading liver consultants and a member of Positive Action, agreed in 1998 that eligibility for the Health (Amendment) Act card should be on the basis of a positive diagnostic test for hepatitis C. The Health (Amendment) Act card is given to eligible persons by the HSE to facilitate them in accessing the range of health services to which they are entitled.</p>
          <p eId="para_709">In 1995, support groups pressed for a statutory compensation tribunal. A Bill was drafted with the assistance of John Rogers SC and Ivor Fitzpatrick &amp; Company Solicitors and submitted to the then Minister. The Bill included the ELISA test as the basis for a diagnosis of hepatitis C, as is now provided.</p>
          <p eId="para_710">Since 1997, infected people's inability to obtain life assurance or mortgage protection cover has added further problems to the damage they have already suffered. This was one issue highlighted by the consultative council on hepatitis C from its first meeting in March 1997. The Department of Health and Children retained Mercer Human Resource Consulting Limited to examine the insurance difficulties facing persons with hepatitis C and to suggest ways in which these difficulties might be resolved. A second phase of the project led to the development of detailed proposals for an appropriate scheme. Following representations from the Irish Haemophilia Society it was agreed the small number of persons infected with HIV would also become eligible under the scheme. Departmental officials have worked in close co-operation with the representative groups — Positive Action, Transfusion Positive, the Irish Haemophilia Society and the Irish Kidney Association — to agree the scheme's parameters and have taken nearly all the groups' recommendations made on board in the scheme's development.</p>
          <p eId="para_711">Persons to whom the scheme will apply come under two categories with regard to insurance matters, those who can get insurance but only with increased premiums and those who are deemed by the insurance industry to be uninsurable. The Bill's objective is to provide reasonable access to the insurance market for those for whom the cost of insurance to date has been rendered prohibitive or for whom cover is unavailable. The introduction of the scheme will provide for life assurance and mortgage protection cover. Under the scheme the State will pay the additional risk premium where the life assurer is willing to provide cover subject to an additional premium. The State will assume the risk on the life cover where the assurer is not willing to provide this cover. It will also allow as a matter for priority for the development of a travel insurance scheme. The scheme will be administered under the aegis of the HSE. Specific details on its administration will be set out in regulations and an administrator will be recruited as soon as possible after the Bill's enactment.</p>
          <p eId="para_712">Section 1(<i>a</i>) adds definitions for the terms “relevant claimant” and “relevant insurance scheme”. Section 1(<i>b</i>) amends the definition of diagnosis for the purposes of the existing compensation scheme and the new insurance scheme. It provides that a diagnosis must be based on a positive ELISA test, the internationally used scientific test to diagnose persons chronically infected with hepatitis C. The definition also clarifies the eligibility of persons who displayed symptoms of acute infection within 16 weeks after the administration of the anti-D product. These requirements will not apply to claims for compensation made to the tribunal before 20 June 2006.</p>
          <p eId="para_713">In section 2, eligibility for compensation in respect of loss of consortium, is clarified as applying to persons who were married before the diagnosis of hepatitis C and HIV or who were living together for three or more years before the diagnosis. This provision will come into effect on the enactment of the Bill. Consortium can be defined as "the living together as husband and wife with all that flows from that relationship including companionship, the rendering of services, sexual intercourse and affectionate relationship between spouses". Persons who were directly infected with hepatitis C or HIV are compensated as part of their general damages for all the effects of the virus on their lives and relationships. Loss of consortium is intended to compensate the spouses and partners of infected persons who entered into marriage or long-term relationships without the spectre of hepatitis C or HIV hanging over them and then found their expectations of a normal family life were severely affected by their partner's condition.</p>
          <p eId="para_714">A relationship which was formed in the knowledge of the hepatitis C or HIV diagnosis is excluded from this particular head of claim on the basis that, for a loss of consortium to exist, there must have been a committed relationship already in existence and the legitimate expectation that this would continue without the imposition of a viral illness acquired through the use of State-provided health services. However, it is important to note that eligible partners in relationships formed after diagnosis will remain entitled to all the other relevant heads of claim under the compensation scheme, such as compensation for any actual losses incurred in looking after their partner, loss of services, loss of society, post-traumatic stress disorder, mental distress and dependency losses.</p>
          <p eId="para_715">Sections 3, 4 and 5 of the Bill contain the provisions establishing the insurance scheme. Section 3 amends section 7 of the Hepatitis C Compensation Tribunal Act 1997 to allow the Minister to make regulations providing for the establishment, operation, administration and supervision of an insurance scheme. The insurance scheme will provide certain types of insurance to claimants who fall into the following categories: hepatitis C-infected anti-D recipients, hepatitis C-infected transfusion recipients, HIV-infected recipients of relevant products, the children or spouses of eligible persons with hepatitis C or HIV, who have themselves been diagnosed positive for the virus, a parent, brother or sister of an infected person who is himself or herself diagnosed with hepatitis C or HIV infection, and certain other claimants, and who are refused the relevant insurance on the grounds that they have been diagnosed positive for hepatitis C or HIV, or who the administrator reasonably believes would be refused if they applied for insurance, who are refused unless they pay a higher premium than persons of similar age and gender who have not been diagnosed positive for hepatitis C or HIV.</p>
          <p eId="para_716">Under this section, the Minister may also make regulations to specify the administrator of the scheme and the functions of the administrator, and specify the conditions subject to which a benefit will be provided under the scheme, specify the conditions subject to which benefits will not be provided, or stop being provided, based on the time when the claimant makes an application to the administrator for benefit, and the claimant's age at the time of making the application.</p>
          <p eId="para_717">The scheme will provide life insurance of €400,000, or seven times the annual earned income, up to a maximum of €500,000, of the claimant, or the claimant's spouse or the claimant's partner of three years standing at the time the application is made, or the joint income of the claimant and spouse or partner. All the amounts mentioned above will be index-linked to the consumer price index compiled by the Central Statistics Office, or its successor.</p>
          <p eId="para_718">The scheme will provide mortgage protection insurance for the purchase, change or improvement of the claimant's home, primary residence, to a maximum of either €375,000, index-linked to the Permanent TSB-ESRI Dublin house price index, or its successor, or the average Dublin house price, determined by the Permanent TSB-ESRI Dublin house price index, plus 25%, whichever is greater. For the first year after the scheme comes into effect, eligible claimants will be allowed to remortgage any property he or she owns up to a total of €100,000.</p>
          <p eId="para_719">Under section 3, the Minister is empowered to make regulations to provide for annual travel insurance. I am committed to establishing a travel insurance scheme as soon as possible and I intend that travel insurance benefits will be covered by the scheme within six months of the establishment of the life and mortgage protection elements of the scheme.</p>
          <p eId="para_720">Claimants who want to avail of the full benefits of the scheme without restriction must make an application to the administrator within a year of the scheme coming into effect, or within three years of the date on which the claimant has been diagnosed positive for hepatitis C or HIV, whichever is later.</p>
          <p eId="para_721">The exceptions are applications for annual travel insurance and applications for life and mortgage cover by claimants who are under 30. In respect of the travel insurance element of the scheme, once this is up and running a claimant can apply for full benefits under the scheme at any time.</p>
          <p eId="para_722">In regard to young claimants, the Irish Haemophilia Society made a compelling case that persons with haemophilia who were infected with hepatitis C in their early years of life may still not have reached the stage in life where they are ready to take out a mortgage or life assurance policy. Accordingly, the Government agreed that the full benefits of the scheme would apply without restriction to eligible claimants up to the age of 30, rather than be confined to the first year of the scheme. Except for this group, claimants who make an application after the first year that the scheme is in operation and who would be deemed "uninsurable" will still be able to avail of insurance but the benefits will have a phasing-in period. In the case of claimants who are under 50 it is intended by regulation to specify a two-year phasing-in period, and for persons over 50 the relevant period will be three years.</p>
          <p eId="para_723">For the first year of the scheme, applications will be accepted by persons who are 75 years of age or younger, but after the first year, applications will only be accepted from persons who are 65 or under. No applications will be accepted from claimants who are over 75, even during the first year of the scheme, and cover will cease for every claimant who reaches 75.</p>
          <p eId="para_724">The Bill provides that the Minister may make regulations setting out the basis for calculating the insurance premiums, if any, to be paid by a claimant, but it is proposed to amend the Bill on Committee Stage to remove this provision.</p>
          <p eId="para_725">An important element of the insurance scheme is that eligible claimants with other medical conditions as well as hepatitis C or HIV will have all these conditions disregarded for the purposes of the insurance scheme. Under the scheme, the claimant will be entitled to benefits by payment of a premium that will be generally the same as the premium paid by a person of similar age and gender who is not infected with hepatitis C or HIV.</p>
          <p eId="para_726">Where an eligible person makes a joint application with a person who is not covered by the scheme and the application benefits both parties jointly, the other person will pay the same premium in respect of his or her benefit as any other person of similar age, gender and health status and he or she will not pay a higher joint premium in respect of the joint benefit than the joint premium that would be charged for a joint application from two persons, neither of whom had been diagnosed positive for hepatitis C or HIV.</p>
          <p eId="para_727">The administrator may determine the procedures to be adopted in the operation, administration and supervision of the scheme, subject to the provisions of the Act and any regulations made under the Act. The scheme administrator may refuse an application if it is not presented in the specified format or if information which is deemed to be reasonably required is not provided.</p>
          <p eId="para_728">If an eligible person, or the eligible person and his or her partner, has two or more policies under the scheme, the maximum sum assured applies to the policies collectively. If a person has an existing policy or takes out new policies, which are not taken out under the scheme, those policies will not be taken into account in calculating the maximum sum assured.</p>
          <p eId="para_729">With regard to the administration of the scheme, the administrator will be obliged to submit a report and accounts to the Minister as directed. The Minister will lay the report before the Houses of the Oireachtas, and the report will not identify any claimant. Wherever the term "relevant date" is used in regard to the insurance scheme, it means the date on which the scheme commenced.</p>
          <p eId="para_730">I now turn to section 4, which outlines the appeals procedures that will apply. Under section 4, a person may appeal a relevant decision of the scheme administrator within 28 days of being notified of the decision in writing. An appeal will be in the format decided by the administrator and will state the reasons for the appeal. The Minister will appoint one or more people who are solicitors or barristers of at least five years standing to consider appeals.</p>
          <p eId="para_731">The appeals officer will be independent but will comply with any guidelines on procedure issued by the Minister. He or she will consider any oral or written submissions made by the appellant and the scheme administrator, make a decision in writing, giving reasons, and send the written decision to the appellant and the administrator. The appeals officer may also pay reasonable costs in respect of an appeal which has been upheld.</p>
          <p eId="para_732">A person affected by a decision of the appeals officer may appeal to the High Court on a point of law within 28 days of receipt of the written decision. A decision of the High Court will specify where appropriate the period within which the decision must be carried out. The High Court's decision will be final. If the appeals officer's decision is not appealed to the High Court, the administrator will carry out the decision as soon as is practicable. Where the High Court has given a decision the administrator will carry out that decision within the specified time period or as soon as possible thereafter.</p>
          <p eId="para_733">An appeals officer will be paid a salary and expenses and will be provided with whatever permanent or temporary staff the Minister deems necessary, and with the consent of the Minister for Finance, to carry out his or her functions, including medical or other experts. He or she may resign by giving notice in writing. The Minister can revoke the appointment for stated reasons. Each appeals officer will report to the Minister in writing at intervals to be decided by the Minister. The Minister will lay copies of the report before the Oireachtas. The appeals officer's report will not identify any claimant.</p>
          <p eId="para_734">The following decisions of the administrator can be appealed: a refusal to consider an application, a decision that a claimant is not eligible, that a benefit cannot be provided or must cease to be provided, or is partially or incrementally provided, or the amount of the sum assured under the scheme. Section 4 also provides for the establishment of a special account to pay costs arising from the scheme, including the cost of administration and payment of benefits. This account can only be used to pay costs associated with the insurance scheme, and only on the direction of the Minister for Finance. Any money in the special account, or interest on the money, can be paid into, or disposed of, for the benefit of the Exchequer at the direction of the Minister for Finance. The special account will be with the Paymaster General, will be subject to whatever terms and conditions the Minister for Finance, in consultation with the Minister for Health and Children, decides, and will be subject to audit by the Comptroller and Auditor General.</p>
          <p eId="para_735">The scheme administrator may specify any forms which he thinks fit and the documents which are required to be submitted with the forms. These forms must be completed in full by an applicant and accompanied by the necessary documents. The scheme administrator may require a statutory declaration to be made that the particulars contained in the forms are true. Multiple copies of forms or documents may be required, or alterative documents in particular circumstances.</p>
          <p eId="para_736">Confidentiality is a prime consideration to persons infected with hepatitis C and HIV through the administration of blood and blood products within the State and I take their concerns on this matter seriously. As a result, section 4 of the Bill stipulates that everyone connected with the process, including the administrator, the appeals officer or officers and the insurers must maintain confidentiality in respect of all relevant matters and will not allow unauthorised access to any relevant documents. A person who contravenes this provision and is convicted of a summary offence will be liable to a fine of up to €3,000 or up to six months' imprisonment or both. A person found guilty of an indictable offence will be liable to a maximum fine of €25,000 or two years' imprisonment or both.</p>
          <p eId="para_737">Section 5 is a technical amendment to distinguish between the special account already set up to pay the costs of the compensation scheme and the separate account to be established to pay for the insurance scheme. This is the final provision relating to the insurance scheme.</p>
          <p eId="para_738">I will now continue with section 6. I have already referred to section 1(<i>b</i>) which clarifies the definition of hepatitis C for the purposes of entitlement to compensation. Section 6 mirrors this provision by inserting a similar requirement into the Health (Amendment) Act 1996 which entitles eligible persons with hepatitis C to a range of health care services without charge.</p>
          <p eId="para_739">The seventh and final section gives the Short Title of the Bill and the amended name of the three compensation schemes. In addition, the Health Acts 1947 to 2006 will include section 4 of this Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_740">The establishment date for the insurance scheme will be set by regulation, and I intend to enact the necessary regulations as soon as possible after the enactment of the Bill. Sections 1 and 6 will take effect from 20 June 2006, while section 2 will take effect from the date of enactment.</p>
          <p eId="para_741">I acknowledge the input of the four hepatitis C and HIV support groups, the Irish Haemophilia Society, the Irish Kidney Association, Positive Action and Transfusion Positive, into the negotiations which preceded this Bill and thank them for their co-operation. My officials have discussed the Bill in great detail with the four groups in recent days. While there is a significant difference of opinion on sections 1, 2 and 6, there is almost unanimity on the sections establishing the insurance scheme.</p>
          <p eId="para_742">A small number of amendments to the insurance elements of the Bill have been suggested by the support groups and have been actively examined by my officials. I hope to take these amendments into account on Committee Stage. I am confident at the end of this process there will be a statutory framework in place for a viable insurance scheme which at long last will enable the 1,700 persons with hepatitis C or HIV to avail of insurance products in a fair and equitable manner.</p>
          <p eId="para_743">My officials have agreed with the support groups that they will engage immediately with them to agree the text of the regulations for the scheme once the Bill is enacted. A large amount of groundwork has been done on this, and the outline rules on how the scheme will operate have already been drafted and agreed. I have instructed my officials that the completion of this process and the appointment of an administrator for the scheme should be given priority and completed within a three to six-month timeframe. I also acknowledge the importance which the support groups attach to the travel insurance element of the scheme and it is my intention that discussions on the parameters of this scheme will proceed as soon as possible.</p>
          <p eId="para_744">I commend the Bill to the House and I urge its support in ensuring that this substantial initiative for persons infected by the State is established on a statutory footing, so that the necessary arrangements can be made to make the scheme available to those who need mortgage, travel insurance and life assurance as quickly as possible.</p>

          <p eId="para_747">Much of what will be said by Members of this House today and tomorrow will be on behalf of members of the Irish Haemophilia Society, the Irish Kidney Association, Positive Action and Transfusion Positive because the Tánaiste and Minister for Health and Children did not negotiate fully with those organisations before this legislation was brought through. In some respects we represent their views and those of people affected or who may be affected by State health services.</p>
          <p eId="para_748">The Tánaiste and Minister for Health and Children's statement to the press yesterday mentioned that she is anxious to have this Bill enacted so that the many people deprived access to the insurance market can now avail of it. If she had stuck to the issue of insurance products, this legislation would have received the full support of this House and would be passed quickly today without the animosity we have witnessed.</p>
          <p eId="para_749">Patients were infected with HIV and hepatitis C by the State's health service and the Tánaiste and her Government should not lose sight of that pertinent fact. We are obliged to do our absolute best for these people because of it. Groups representing the victims of this public health disaster were quietly confident that, after months of negotiations with the Tánaiste and Minister for Health and Children and her Department, this Bill would finally help them come closer to closure on their dealings with the State on this terrible disaster. I acknowledge that these dealings were often more confrontational than they should have been in the spirit of correcting the wrongs done to this group of people by the State that we serve.</p>
          <p eId="para_750">This has been a medical, social and psychological disaster in the lives of those men, women and children involved — citizens of this country. We can all remember the raw emotion in the mid-1990s when this public health disaster first came to light and it continues to have a terrible effect on people's lives to this day. The way this legislation has been put through the House by the Tánaiste and the Government is wrong. In the past ten years the State has responded to this issue with two Acts, the Hepatitis C Compensation Tribunal Act 1997 and the Hepatitis C Compensation Tribunal (Amendment) Act 2002. They looked at two of the three strands referred to by the Tánaiste and Minister for Health and Children, namely, giving compensation to people affected and providing health care to them. The third strand was the provision of insurance. After months of discussion, those affected believed this Bill would build on protections achieved so far. We should acknowledge that those achievements were initially difficult to gain, but as time passed we recognised what needed to be done.</p>
          <p eId="para_751">Having spoken to the people affected by this, it is amazing how they were treated all those years ago, not only politically but also by the medical profession. Assumptions were made as to how they might have contracted this awful illness. Assumptions were made regarding their private lives which, undoubtedly, had an effect at the time. We need to be much more humane in the approach we take to the issue. Let us not revert to those days. Let us be more proactive and try to help these people. It is important that we deal with this as an insurance issue. The way the Tánaiste and Minister for Health and Children has dealt with this issue so far has been a slap in the face for victims. In some respects, the Government has been deceitful in the way this legislation has been advanced so far. It was only supposed to relate to the issue of insurance and the Tánaiste and Minister for Health and Children's changes have been brought forward in a deceitful way.</p>
          <p eId="para_752">All the organisations that represent the victims of this terrible tragedy are unanimous in their objections to sections 1, 2 and 6. I do not like the way the Tánaiste and the Government launched a pre-emptive strike against the victims. The Government's press release states: "the Expert Group on Hepatitis C which is chaired by the Department's Chief Medical Officer and includes representation from leading liver consultants and a member of Positive Action, agreed in 1998 that eligibility for the Health Amendment Act Card should be on the basis of a positive diagnostic test for Hepatitis C". That statement is an attempt to downgrade the victim's argument by saying they agreed with the Department on the ELISA test for Hepatitis C. The Government should have been far more honest in its negotiations with this group of victims.</p>
          <p eId="para_753">The way the issue of compensation is dealt with in the press release is sinister. Reference is made to "... compensation, through the Hepatitis C and HIV Compensation Tribunal, which to date has awarded over €660 million to around 2,000 people". The assumption that any reader of that statement would make is that €660 million has been given to 2,000 patients who have been infected by hepatitis C or HIV. The sum of €660 million covers everything, including legal, administrative and organisational costs, as well as compensation to the victims. The Government should have made that very clear instead of trying to give the impression that this group of people have already been well compensated by the State and that what the Government is doing today is redressing an imbalance on behalf of the State. That is an extremely negative approach and the Government should not attempt to do anything similar in future, especially in the context of dealing with victims of a terrible tragedy. The Tánaiste and Minister for Health and Children needs to clarify that point immediately.</p>
          <p eId="para_754">The victims and their representative organisations have behaved admirably with the Tánaiste and Minister for Health and Children and all Governments over the past nine years. They have entered the negotiation process to try to build on their entitlements, the compensation fund for people who may come after them, the health care services they, and others who cannot speak for themselves, will need and insurance provisions. They have been extremely good in the way they have dealt with the Department of Health and Children and the Government. They have been involved in the negotiations on this legislation for 18 months. They attended numerous meetings and had countless discussions. They set targets that are referred to throughout the Bill and with which no one in this House will disagree. The Tánaiste and Minister for Health and Children will have no problems in that regard because the negotiations were two-way.</p>
          <p eId="para_755">However, when the victims read the Green Paper they were shocked and horrified by sections 1, 2 and 6. That is why they approached the Opposition and asked us to request that those sections be withdrawn. They were not negotiated on with anybody and were purely unilateral, coming from the Government side. Those sections represent a Government decision to restrict some of the entitlements of these patients.</p>
          <p eId="para_756">Withdrawal of entitlements is heavily dependent on medical evidence. Two laboratory tests will decide whether the State will look after infected patients or deny them service. The Government is setting enormous store by the ELISA test, arguing that it is extremely accurate and has improved greatly in recent years. The ELISA test, an Enzyme Linked Immuno Sorbent Assay, is a test for antibodies and not for the virus itself. Is this the only test proposed or are there other immunoelectrophoresic procedures being planned also? Is it intended to use other assay type tests that work like the ELISA test? Has the Government any plans to measure the viral antigen? Has any advice been given to the Tánaiste and Minister for Health and Children on this issue? There is no mention of alternatives in the legislation. The Bill clearly refers to one test, which is a test for the antibodies to hepatitis C, upon which a claim will fall if the result is negative. There is no indication as to whether it is intended to measure viral load or viral antigens.</p>
          <p eId="para_757">I ask the Tánaiste and Minister for Health and Children to verify that the ELISA test is the only one that the Government will rely upon. I further ask how many ELISA tests will be allowed. Is one positive test at some stage in one's life sufficient? If patients get a negative result at some stage, will things get a little tricky in terms of their entitlements? The situation is not clear but the Government has put enormous store by a single test.</p>
          <p eId="para_758">One thing I have learned from my 20 years in medicine is that it is not an exact science, although we might like to think it is. Medical discourse concerning laboratory tests is littered with terms such as "false positive", "false negative" and so forth. The Tánaiste and Minister for Health and Children knows this. In that context, people can be denied services and justice on the basis of blood tests that may not be 100% accurate. Many factors can affect the results of a blood test, including chemotherapy treatment or transplants. This fact is not covered anywhere in the legislation. The Government is giving all the credit to one test and one wonders if one had a discussion with medical experts whether they would agree that this is the right approach to take. In the interests of fairness, the Tánaiste and Minister for Health and Children should release the expert advice she received, when drawing up this legislation, to show that this test is so accurate that justice can be denied to people on the basis of it. What has gone wrong in the past nine years that the Government is now taking this approach?</p>
          <p eId="para_759">The Government is also relying on another test, the approach to which is even more ridiculous than to the ELISA test. The Alanine Aminotransferase Test looks at raised ALT levels in the presence of jaundice, no later than 16 weeks after the person has received anti-D. This may seem reasonable in a medical sense, but is not so in a real-world sense. Anti-D is given to women after delivery. Will the Department recall those women at 16 weeks and check their ALT levels, in the presence or absence of jaundice? Medical advisers will point out that it is quite possible, after 16 weeks, that there would be no visible signs of jaundice in patients that would lead them to seek medical attention. Statistics indicate that fewer than 20% of patients might have jaundice when they have this acute infection. Therefore, reference to raised ALT levels is meaningless because the only way a patient will know if his or her ALT levels are raised is in the presence of jaundice. Many patients with a 16 week old child would not be surprised to find they are tired, lethargic and sleeping a lot. The Government is relying on one thing, namely, jaundice. It is saying to patients that they must have jaundice after 16 weeks or they are out of the loop. The Government cannot do that to patients.</p>
          <p eId="para_760">If the Government is saying that anti-D is still a problem, however small, everybody who receives it should be tested, 16 weeks later, for raised ALT levels. Perhaps people should also be tested after six months and again after 12 months, to be absolutely certain the Government is not denying people their rights or missing something. There are two ways to approach this. The Government is asserting in the legislation that if a person is one of the fortunate four out of five patients who does not contract jaundice, he or she is out of the loop. At the same time, if a person contracts jaundice, he or she should seek medical attention immediately or will receive nothing from the State. That is what the commencement order in the Bill means.</p>
          <p eId="para_761">The issue of transfusions is also important. People who receive blood transfusions often get jaundice because red blood cells may break down in their bodies for many reasons. One can see this when one conducts routine blood tests on transfusion patients. Often people who receive transfusions have other illnesses which cause them to be anaemic. Some blood tests may indicate raised ALT levels but doctors might not always consider the possibility of hepatitis infection and carry out further tests for hepatitis C.</p>
          <p eId="para_762">Again, the Government is denying those patients the opportunity to secure the compensation that the State must pay people if its health services have been negligent. The compensation, medical care and insurance schemes that we are giving them are only to be expected. There is nothing great in this, and we must be far more open and easy with people regarding those issues.</p>
          <p eId="para_763">Recently we had a hepatitis B scare in two hospitals in the south east. When the laboratory there was looking through the different types of hepatitis B that it had, it noticed that there was a cluster in two hospitals. It started a massive campaign, which is still under way, to test another 1,000 patients who were in the hospital at the same time to see if there are other cases of hepatitis in that population.</p>
          <p eId="para_764">From my medical experience and discussions with doctors in both hospitals, I cannot see how those patients might have contracted hepatitis from each other. They did not have a surgical or investigative procedure carried out, which are the most obvious possible sources of infection in hospitals. Public health investigators could not find any connection between the individuals at a community level. A large-scale public health exercise is being carried out to take blood from 1,000 patients who may only have been in the same ward as the others and had no physical or verbal contact with them. However, the testing is happening because we do not know how the hepatitis cluster arose.</p>
          <p eId="para_765">The Minister for Health and Children has introduced legislation and is incredibly positive regarding health outcomes. If it is black and white as far as she is concerned and she can deny a service to future patients on that basis, she should present her evidence to the Select Committee on Health and Children on Committee Stage and state why she came down so strongly in this regard. I am focusing a great deal on medical issues, but I am sure other Members will raise alternative points regarding the legislation. These are important, since the Minister for Health and Children is basing so much on them. She must come back and inform us what is going on.</p>
          <p eId="para_766">I would also like to know what concerns were raised within the Department that criteria used for nine years were unacceptable. What has changed that has resulted in such concerns being raised? This morning we heard that, if there are patients of whom we are unaware, their number is approximately 100. I do not know why the Minister for Health and Children is making such major changes to legislation. Whom is she attempting to block out? Has the Department identified a cohort of people abusing this? Why is it marking people in this manner? If something has worked so well for nine years, why are we taking this route? Nothing in the Minister for Health and Children's press statement yesterday or any other statement that she has made thus far gives any indication of why she is taking this course of action.</p>
          <p eId="para_767">If anything, this debacle was handled extremely well after enactment of the initial legislation. People have become more aware of what went wrong, and we have seen great changes to the Irish Blood Transfusion Service. Everyone has invested a great deal of time and effort in this, and I would like the Minister for Health and Children to tell us what she feels is so wrong that she must introduce what in some respects is extremely restrictive legislation, allowing no element of doubt regarding those who might be affected. Everything is black and white for the Minister, and I would like to know where she is coming from in this regard. She spoke of having received expert medical advice, and that is vital to every Member when she is coming down so hard on people regarding the shape the legislation is taking.</p>
          <p eId="para_768">Why did she spring this legislation on organisations that have co-operated so fully with the Department of Health and Children in recent years? They have put their anger to one side and done their utmost to secure the best compensation, medical care and now insurance protection. That protection is for themselves and their families. I am surprised that it has taken so long and that they have been so patient when awaiting this legislation.</p>
          <p eId="para_769">There is no doubt that there have been adverse events for some of the victims, who were first diagnosed as far back as 1995 or 1997. In the meantime, they might well have benefitted if the third strand of this legislation had been delivered within the last nine years of the current Government. It was an unbelievably topical issue and very emotional for everyone involved rather than simply for the victims, who were directly and adversely affected. Many people shared their pain regarding what happened at that time. I am surprised it has taken so long for us to reach this point.</p>
          <p eId="para_770">Regarding the consortium, the Minister tried to throw this in. Someone once said of her party colleague, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy McDowell, that he likes to build up straw men so that he can pull them down, throwing irrelevant things into an argument and then trying to argue against what he has essentially created himself.</p>
          <p eId="para_771">The Minister for Health and Children mentioned the issue regarding second and third partners as the reason for bringing forward the more restrictive legislation on section 2. Minors affected by hepatitis C and HIV, who are now reaching an age when they will form stable relationships, may already have become part of the system, but they may not be able, old or mature enough or have such a relationship.</p>
          <p eId="para_772">If they have a first relationship after that date, the Minister will now deny any compensation to their partners. They were infected as minors but will suffer from hepatitis C and any other ailments later in life. They will also suffer emotionally and psychologically, since they will not be able to form the same sorts of physical relationships that all of us in this House are lucky enough to enjoy. This legislation, and especially the fact the Minister is attaching a limit, will restrict those people. This morning she threw in a red herring, and she should revise that part of the legislation.</p>
          <p eId="para_773">Those are the big issues. In my speech today, I have focused on sections 1, 2 and 6. I have not raised insurance since, as I pointed out, the organisations involved negotiated a deal in a cool and collected manner and a spirit of partnership. That spirit and trust has now been broken by the Minister, and she and especially the Government must attempt to rebuild it rather than taking us back to the bad old days. This is her opportunity to do so. I am delighted Deputy McManus has put forward an opportunity for her and the 16 apostles on the Government backbenches who will now dictate Fianna Fáil policy to bare their teeth and stop this nonsense from going any further.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#OlwynEnrightFG" eId="spk_266">
          <from>Ms Enright</from>
          <p eId="para_774">In recent months, various Deputies have asked in the House when this legislation would be introduced. At that time, we all anticipated we would be able to welcome it. Unfortunately, we now find ourselves unable to do so. While there are worthwhile elements, the changes introduced are so fundamental that they cause serious difficulties for us regarding the Bill as a whole.</p>
          <p eId="para_775">This issue has run for over nine years, and people have waited for a long time to achieve finality. I know negotiations on this element have been ongoing for the last 18 months. However, if we are to try to put this in place, we should at the very least ensure that now, after nine years, we do it properly in a manner that addresses the real needs of those infected hitherto. It seems strange that, after negotiations, these changes should be introduced. My understanding of negotiation is that the parties concerned, in this case, the four parties representing those who were infected, would come together and meet the Minister to discuss what would be included in the Bill. It appears clear from the statement released by the Irish Haemophilia Society, the Irish Kidney Association, Positive Action and Transfusion Positive that these groups were unaware of the changes the Minister was about to bring forward until 20 June 2006. This does not constitute genuine negotiation because these groups did not get the opportunity to discuss these changes.</p>
          <p eId="para_776">In her speech, the Minister acknowledged that a significant difference of opinion exists but these groups did not get the opportunity to address this difference of opinion. Deputy Twomey dealt with the medical aspects of the case in a way I would be unable to do. I support his call for the Minister to publish all the advice she has received, particularly that relating to the ELISA test. Deputy Twomey pointed out that there appear to be no safeguards and no checks and balances in the system to ensure this is accurate. Regardless of whether safeguards exist in respect in of the test, it must be asked whether those infected have endured enough at this point. It is wrong to require all new applicants to undergo these stringent tests when up to now, the word of a specialist in hepatitis C was sufficient.</p>
          <p eId="para_777">In her speech, the Minister accepted that the State has an enormous responsibility in this area. It has complete responsibility. In light of this, it is all the more important that we pass legislation that fully addresses the needs of all those who suffered at the hands of the State, which is what effectively took place. The changes introduced by the Minister do not fully address the needs of these people.</p>
          <p eId="para_778">Could the Minister in her closing remarks explain why it is necessary to wait until the life insurance and mortgage protection elements of this are completed before the travel insurance elements are dealt with? Can they not run in tandem the way the mortgage protection and life insurance elements do?</p>
          <p eId="para_779">Under the scheme, the question of mortgage protection and life insurance for an infected person will be related to those of a person of the same age who is not infected. The term used in the legislation is "general person". Many infected people have been unable to obtain mortgage protection or life insurance up to now so to compare them to people of the same age who are not infected is unfair. It would be better to effectively bring it back because the longer a person has mortgage protection or life insurance, the cheaper and more beneficial it is but infected people have not been able to avail of this to date. We are not comparing like with like because of the way mortgage protection and life insurance policies work.</p>
          <p eId="para_780">I also echo the point made by Deputy Twomey about certain people who have been infected with hepatitis C but whose tests have proved negative so far. These people have very genuine and legitimate concerns as to whether they will lose out under the proposals introduced by the Minister.</p>
          <p eId="para_781">In recent years, public confidence in the Irish Blood Transfusion Service has improved, an important development which we all welcome. However, issues remain in terms of the adequacy of blood supply and shortages that have been experienced at different periods of time, particularly during the summer. If we are to instill full public confidence in the Irish Blood Transfusion Service, it is important that the overall issues we are raising today, particularly those relating to sections 1, 2 and 6, are dealt with. While the service is receiving the media coverage it needs to sort out its problems, the affair still raises queries and concerns in people's minds about the service as a whole, which is a pity. The inclusion of these points causes difficulties.</p>
          <p eId="para_782">I am sorry that I do not have the opportunity to speak further on this Bill but Deputy Twomey outlined Fine Gael's position very clearly. I ask the Minister to give serious consideration to the points we have raised; re-examine sections 1, 2 and 6; conduct genuine negotiations with the relevant groups; and give us the advice she has received.</p>

          <p eId="para_783">I move amendment No. 1:<entity refersTo="#bill.2006.35.dail.2.amd_1" name="amendment"/>
                    </p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_784">To delete all words after "That" and substitute the following:</p>
          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_785">"Having regard to the fact that the Bill contains matters unrelated to the issues that were the subject of extensive discussions with interest groups representing affected persons and the additional matter adversely affects the interests of those persons and having regard also to the failure of the Minister for Health and Children to publish an explanatory memorandum outlining her reasons for including the additional matter, Dáil Éireann declines to give a second reading to the Bill.".</p>
          <p eId="para_786">I will explain why the Labour Party is tabling this amendment. This Bill is a betrayal of a small blighted minority of men and women who suffer sickness and stigma as a direct result of negligence by the State. Instead of providing protection, the State, in the case of the contaminated blood scandal, poisoned vulnerable people. In some cases, the effects were so terrible that people died. Other people have had to deal with serious ill health. When this scandal was exposed, the Irish people rightly demanded a compassionate and honourable response by the State to the heartbreaking plight of innocent people so cruelly afflicted. All the Labour Party is asking is for today is for the same approach to be maintained in this legislation.</p>
          <p eId="para_787">In their long struggle for justice, the survivors achieved certain rights and entitlements. These are statutory rights and entitlements that were enshrined in law in the hepatitis C compensation scheme because the then Minister for Health, Deputy Michael Noonan, did the right thing by these people. He endured vicious attack at times, particularly from Fianna Fail, in connection with his record. In light of that record, the treachery of Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats in steamrolling through a Bill which dismantles some of those entitlements which were so hard and painfully fought for is striking. It is striking to witness how hypocritical and mean-spirited this Government attack on those who have suffered already and who are about to be marginalised and disempowered in this Bill is. We all understand that this is a Government which has lost touch with the people, but it is a new experience to realise that it has also lost touch with basic humanity.</p>
          <p eId="para_788">In addition to being treacherous, this Bill is also dishonest. It was always meant to be a stand-alone Bill to provide a scheme of insurance cover for people who could not access insurance. The Bill was intended to provide for nothing else. It was a simple provision but it took a long time to evolve. We support that original provision. A person would want to be out of his or her mind to object to it. It is an important piece of the jigsaw which is long overdue. Insurance has been a long-standing problem for these unfortunate people, some of whom have died without it because there was no legislative framework to ensure they could access it. Others suffered losses connected to, for example, the cost of holidays, because insurance was denied them.</p>
          <p eId="para_789">However, we should be clear that this Bill does not deal solely with insurance. It should be solely concerned with insurance but it is not. As far back as June 1994, Positive Action raised the issue of insurance with the Department of Health. Since then, the four organisations representing the people affected — the Irish Haemophilia Society, the Irish Kidney Association, Positive Action and Transfusion Positive — have been engaged in protracted negotiations.</p>
          <p eId="para_790">In December 2004, the Tánaiste gave a guarantee that the insurance proposal would be presented to the Government in early January of this year. What followed was extensive correspondence from the organisations in their attempt to get the Government to live up to its commitments. The process was so slow and painful, it resembled tooth extraction, but these organisations were present to assist that process at all times.</p>
          <p eId="para_791">Let us remember the commitment required. On the one hand, there is a Government with the resources of the Parliamentary Counsel, Ministers, Ministers of State, civil servants and expert groups and, on the other, there are small organisations that are to a great extent dependent on <i>pro bono</i> efforts and whatever resources they can acquire. That the organisations commissioned legislation, which I have with me, displays how committed they are to ensuring that this issue is resolved. To this day, they make the point that they are willing to sit down with departmental officials to resolve issues that have arisen. The generous and proactive approach they have adopted is in stark contrast to the defensiveness and lack of information and accountability marking the approach of the Tánaiste and her Department.</p>
          <p eId="para_792">These people were treated disgracefully. On 20 June 2006, the organisations were given a copy of the Bill for the first time. Following their perusal, they issued a statement as follows:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_793">The Tánaiste and Minister for Health and Children published the above Bill on 20 June 2006. The Department of Health had been in negotiations with the above groups to provide a scheme to provide insurance for persons affected with Hepatitis C and HIV so that they could obtain insurance on the same basis as healthy persons.</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_794">Regrettably, the Tánaiste proposes in the Bill which is to come before the Dáil on Thursday, to make fundamental amendments to the Hepatitis C Compensation Act 1997 which will significantly limit the categories of persons entitled to make claims for compensation and for provision under the health code. Our groups were not informed until 20 June of these radical proposals which are unacceptable and should be opposed.</p>
          <p eId="para_795">The organisations wholeheartedly engaged in a lengthy, drawn out process in the interests of their members and the people they represent. I can only imagine the disappointment they felt when they read the Bill because it was supposed to be a cause of triumph and celebration. The Tánaiste should be getting plaudits for what she did, as that would have been the context in which any right-minded person would have expected the Bill to be published. When the Tánaiste announced she was publishing the Bill, she did not mention these fundamental amendments which are opposed by the organisations representing those severely affected. It was to the astonishment of those groups that the legislation was not an insurance Bill. It was about——</p>

          <p eId="para_799">If the Bill is passed, young people will be excluded in terms of the loss of consortium, which I will address shortly. The Bill was about an insurance scheme, but it is also about more than just insurance. It is telling that so far removed from the original intent is it, the Title does not mention the word "insurance". The Bill is the Hepatitis C Compensation Tribunal (Amendment) Bill 2006.</p>
          <p eId="para_800">I have just received a copy of the Government's amendments, which will change the Title. I do not know if such is common practice, but I have never witnessed it previously. The first amendment, with which we will deal tomorrow, displays the Government's opinion, namely, that the Bill is supposed to be about insurance, but it forgot to include the word "insurance" in the Title. The amendment to the Long Title in page 3, line 8 is to insert a provision for the establishment of an insurance scheme to enable certain persons diagnosed positive for hepatitis C or HIV to be provided with certain classes of insurance that would otherwise be unavailable to them or available only upon the payment of higher premia.</p>
          <p eId="para_801">This amendment reveals more than anything else that there is an agenda. I do not know whether it comes from the Attorney General's office or elsewhere. Frankly, that is immaterial. The agenda is meant to contain, control, restrict and limit. Those limits and restrictions are being placed on people who have suffered and continued to suffer, but I do not know what the purpose of doing such is. If we were discussing large numbers of people, we could refer to political priorities and whether money could be allocated. We all understand that a certain rationing must take place in terms of resourcing, especially in the health service, but we are not discussing large numbers. Rather, we are discussing a tiny number within a tiny portion of the population.</p>
          <p eId="para_802">At the most, passing the Bill would provide only a small gain to the Exchequer. In no way could that gain be commensurate with the pain endured by people or their anxiety now that we are considering a Bill made in bad faith. Promises have not been honoured because a sneaky set of amendments were inserted at the last minute by some sharp lawyer. Those amendments have altered the nature of the Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_803">I have the highest regard for the Tánaiste and do not wish to attack her unduly. However, that she could argue in the House that this Bill is about insurance while ignoring that it is about much more than that is not to her credit. We must remember that this Bill is about denying sick people their rights to compensation, including for loss of consortium, and their rights to medical cards.</p>
          <p eId="para_804">From her comments on the Order of Business, it is shocking that the Tánaiste was not aware of the provisions in her own Bill and how penal they would be to certain categories of hepatitis C and HIV sufferers. Her negligence is due to her ignorance, but this in no way absolves her from responsibility. She appears to be ignorant of the fact that not only is the Bill dishonest, in terms of consortium it specifically discriminates against minors who are infected. Children who were infected, passed the ELISA test and may have gone through the tribunal process are entitled to compensation for loss of consortium for their future spouses, but this Bill will strip them of that entitlement. After the harrowing history, they are losing rather than gaining ground and are being told to move back. That is not acceptable.</p>
          <p eId="para_805">Before preparing for this debate, I was not aware what consortium meant. The Tánaiste helpfully defined it as "the living together as husband and wife with all that flows from that relationship including companionship, the rendering of services, sexual intercourse and affectionate relationship between spouses". What is life all about if not that? This issue relates not only to individuals' health but also to the effects of their loss of health on those who love them. The ability to claim for the loss of consortium is a statutory right. If everything were right with this story, nobody would ever be able to claim that right because there would not have been any loss.</p>
          <p eId="para_806">This is a story about the terrible loss suffered by individuals and their loved ones. Anybody who has read the Lindsay report is aware of the agony endured by those people whose loved ones were ill or dying in a situation where people did not understand what was happening to them and where there were all types of prejudices and stigmas. Some of that stigma persists to this day. That is why it is so important that this Bill should be referred back to the Department and returned for our consideration only when it has been cleansed of all these negatives. If that is done, we can then support the legislation, grateful to the Minister for providing the necessary assurances to those who have suffered.</p>
          <p eId="para_807">That is what we are here to do. Parliaments are supposed to do the right thing; they are not supposed to do wrong. Although we may sometimes unwittingly make mistakes, the victims' groups have pointed out those mistakes in this particular case. They are asking us to put this right and it is up to us to do so. If the Minister is willing to excise the offensive sections, there is no question that she will have unstinting praise. Even at this late stage, I hope there is some recognition of what must be done.</p>
          <p eId="para_808">One can look for hidden agendas and for clues as to what may be going on. It is significant that the information was not given to the groups prior to 20 June. The absence of an explanatory memorandum is a further indication that all is not as it should be. None of us is a parliamentary draftsman and we all require clarity in regard to legislation. For media persons, whose job it is to transmit accurate information to the public, explanatory memoranda are just as important. That is how the process of translation works. Without it, we are at a grave disadvantage. In this case, where other elements were slipped in sneakily under the guise of an insurance scheme, there was no explanatory memorandum to alert us to this fact. I confess I did not appreciate what was being done in this regard until quite late. As an Opposition Member and Labour Party spokesperson on health, I am grateful to all the organisations for providing the valuable information that has guided us in what must be done.</p>
          <p eId="para_809">I do not have the medical expertise of Deputy Twomey but I broadly understand the points he made. No test is 100% accurate. Reference is made in the Bill to the ELISA test. I am unaware of another instance in which a specific medical test is mentioned in legislation. What I am more sure of than anything else in the area of health is that technological advances are taking place so quickly that within six months of this Bill being passed, there will be a better test that will identify those persons whose condition will not be detected by the ELISA test.</p>

          <p eId="para_813">I ask the Tánaiste to listen to what I am saying because I have received legal advice on this. This advice states:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_814">You have no doubt noticed that not only does the amendment in the Bill narrow the definition of a positive diagnosis to the presence of markers but the only alternative provided is a record of jaundice, and you will recall that it is possible to have subacute hepatitis without any apparent jaundice.</p>
          <p eId="para_815">I am neither a lawyer nor a doctor but I know enough to be aware that what is happening here is wrong. As long ago as the publication of the Finlay report we knew there were people who did not fit neatly into a particular categorisation and were not easily tested. In such cases, there was no scientific test that would allow a specialist to say definitively that the person had hepatitis C and that the source was evidently a contaminated blood product.</p>
          <p eId="para_816">Page 176 of the Finlay report states: "However, we now have evidence that it is also possible, although apparently rare, for a person to be infected and subsequently lose both detectable virus and indeed detectable antibodies." Deputy Twomey has pointed out the limits of the ELISA test in this regard. This is what happened in the case of the person identified as "Donor Y". The Finlay report goes on to state: "While we have no laboratory means of identifying these persons, we have, however, taken a history of symptoms or signs for those who received BTSB anti-D." In other words, people were listed on the basis of their symptoms. That is how the matter was determined by Finlay.</p>
          <p eId="para_817">I welcome the establishment of the insurance scheme. Although we have tabled some amendments, there is no great difficulty with it and I am pleased the HSE is to manage it. This represents a long awaited vote of confidence in the executive. It is entirely unnecessary that the nursing home repayment scheme, for example, is being contracted out to a private company. However, I remind the Minister that problems remain in regard to accountability. I sent a letter to the HSE last August and received a reply only last week, which reply came from the Department rather than the executive. We have not yet reached a satisfactory situation in regard to speedy responses. If the HSE is to process this scheme — as it should — it must ensure efficient methods are in place for providing information, dealing with claims and so on. It is well able for the task.</p>
          <p eId="para_818">To return to the issue of the loss of consortium, the Tánaiste spoke this morning on the Order of Business about second and third relationships. This is something of a canard. We are talking about young people who are growing up in the shadow of this condition. This shadow will linger over their future whether they marry, have a same-sex relationship or whatever. That shadow will always be there. They are the people who are being excluded in this Bill from access——</p>

          <from>Ms McManus</from>
          <p eId="para_828">I am not arguing about the people who are within the remit of the Bill but about the people who are outside it. It is interesting the Minister does not appear to be able to take on board the fact that it is the people outside the provisions of this Bill who concern us. We are delighted for the ones included in it. Good luck to them. However, our concern is for the people who have been marginalised, or will be if this Bill is passed, and who should not be.</p>
          <p eId="para_829">This is not just a case of me being political, although I do not see the point of complaining about politicians being political. This is about organisations who are by now experts on this issue, such as Positive Action, the Irish Haemophilia Society and the Irish Kidney Association.</p>
          <p eId="para_830">The Irish Haemophilia Society has stated that during the course of the long negotiations and discussions between the representative groups and the Department of Health and Children there was never any indication that the Government intended to draft legislation which was not stand alone and which would, in fact, attempt to change the parameters for the existing 1997 and 2002 compensation Acts. The society points out that if these sections are not deleted it will mean some individuals will be disentitled to enter the hepatitis C compensation scheme. The numbers are not large but they are significant and the groups cannot disenfranchise any group no matter how small their number may be. Among those who would suffer would be persons who had hepatitis C but never had a positive ELISA test. Minors who were affected with hepatitis C at a very young age would be discriminated against with regard to the ability of their future spouse or partner to claim a loss of consortium.</p>
          <p eId="para_831">I thought I would not require half an hour for my contribution but, in fact, I will have to limit my comments. Judge Finlay, in the introduction to his report of March 1997, said a few words that are worth recalling:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_832">The examination of the individual human suffering and hurt occasioned by the infections of Anti-D and other blood products with hepatitis C has been for all of us who have been engaged in the work of this Tribunal, a deeply distressing and very emotive experience.</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_833">Our task however has been to ascertain the facts which have been referred to us and reach the conclusions requested in an entirely detached and unemotive manner leaving aside great sympathy felt for the victims.</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_834">That task has been eased by the courage and indeed moderation with which the victims have given their evidence and by the wholehearted cooperation which has been afforded to the Tribunal by all parties involved in it and by their legal representatives.</p>
          <p eId="para_835">That is quite striking. That is the record of the organisations that are asking us to rectify this Bill. Let us remember where we are coming from. The people who suffered so much showed moderation and a willingness to co-operate. They are still willing to co-operate but they seek the deletion of the sections of the Bill that offend them and members of this tiny community. That is all they, and we, seek. They are happy to negotiate.</p>
          <p eId="para_836">Let us get on with the business of providing insurance and we can return to the matter if there are issues that can be dealt with in a compassionate way. The Finlay report was accepted by the Oireachtas. The legislation that flowed from that report was accepted and passed by the Oireachtas. Why is the Minister trying to row back on a few basic rights and entitlements that mean a great deal to the people concerned? We who are healthy do not have to worry about these matters. We can only use our imagination. I ask the Minister to accept our motion. She should refer the Bill back to the parliamentary draftsman and excise the parts that are offensive and will have a negative impact on the entitlements people have under the law. That is all we ask and we will applaud the Minister for doing that.</p>

          <p eId="para_839">Yesterday, representatives of the Irish Haemophilia Society, the Irish Kidney Association, Positive Action and Transfusion Position had to come to the House and spend long hours lobbying against the passage of this Bill, as presented by the Tánaiste, Deputy Harney. They should have been here today to witness the fruits of many years of hard work and campaigning on their part. Instead, the experience they are now going through must be compounding the many years of hurt for them and their loved ones.</p>
          <p eId="para_840">These groups represent the people who were infected by contaminated blood and blood products — blood transfused into their bodies by an agency backed by the State, an agency people had every right to trust. That trust was cruelly betrayed. People have died as a result. Many more have suffered and continue to suffer. Their lives have been blighted and their life expectancy has been dramatically curtailed. They and their families have gone through and are still going through what can only be described as a living hell.</p>
          <p eId="para_841">It is disgraceful that these people have had to lobby and negotiate for the past nine years, since 1997 and throughout the terms of office of this Government, to obtain legislation to provide a scheme of assistance with insurance. Such a scheme would allow people infected with hepatitis C and HIV to obtain insurance on the same basis as healthy members of society. With other Deputies, I have repeatedly raised the need for such legislation in the Dáil. When the Government's legislative programme was published on 24 April this year we welcomed the fact the Bill was finally on the way.</p>
          <p eId="para_842">In that programme, the Bill is described as a Bill "to amend the Hepatitis C Compensation Tribunal Acts 1997 and 2002 in order to provide for the establishment of an insurance scheme for persons who have been infected with Hepatitis C or HIV from the administration within the State of blood or blood products". However, the Long Title of the published Bill describes the Bill as an Act "to amend the Hepatitis C Compensation Tribunal Acts 1997 and 2002 and to make a related amendment to the Health (Amendment) Act 1996". There is a significant difference between the two. I note also that while the title of the new Act is to be the Hepatitis C and HIV Compensation Tribunal (Amendment) Act 2006 as described in the explanatory note circulated to Members of the House after the commencement of the Minister's contribution to this Second Stage debate this morning, at the Order of Business this morning the Minister was of the opinion that we had already received the explanatory memorandum with the text of the legislation. It is a shambolic way to go forward with legislation of such import.</p>
          <p eId="para_843">The Title of the Bill presented does not refer to HIV. Section 7 genuflects to this very important focus of the legislation, stating "This Act may be cited as the Hepatitis C and HIV Compensation Tribunal (Amendment) Act 2006." The reference to HIV should not be optional. It is an integral focus of the Bill and should be boldly referred to in the Title at all times. Who seeks to shroud the full purpose of this legislation? Deputy McManus has already pointed out the failure to even acknowledge its key purpose and has rightly drawn the House's attention to the first amendment presented by the Minister for tomorrow's Committee Stage debate.</p>
          <p eId="para_844">When the groups read the detail of the Bill they were shocked to find they had become the victims of what can only be described as a legislative ambush by the Minister. Instead of providing the insurance scheme as promised and leaving it at that, the Minister has used the opportunity to make other far-reaching amendments to existing legislation. The effects of these amendments will be discriminatory and, if enacted, will represent yet another betrayal of people affected by contaminated blood products.</p>
          <p eId="para_845">The four groups have stated the case very well. Like other speakers, I am grateful to them for highlighting the totally unacceptable sections of this Bill which must not be enacted. The Bill makes fundamental amendments to the Hepatitis C Compensation Tribunal Act 1997 which will significantly limit the categories of persons entitled to make claims for compensation and for provision under the health code. The groups were not informed until 20 June of these radical proposals which are unacceptable and should be opposed. The Minister proposes that persons infected with hepatitis C are to be identified solely by scientific tests, whereas currently a clinical diagnosis of hepatitis C is accepted by the tribunal and the High Court and for all other purposes such as entitlement to health provision. What the Minister proposes now is that although a person has had an identified infected batch of blood or blood product such as anti-D and such person has symptoms compatible with HIV infection that person will no longer be able to establish entitlement to compensation and to special health provision. In 2002 the then Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Martin, brought in an entitlement for the spouses and partners of hepatitis C and HIV sufferers to make claims for compensation for loss of consortium, in other words, for the damage caused to their relationship with their partner as a result of his or her infection with either of these communicable diseases. The Minister now proposes to exclude certain categories of person from such entitlement. The spouse or partner of a young person infected at birth with hepatitis C was entitled to claim compensation up to now. Such partners and spouses will now be excluded and, no matter what protest the Minister makes, that is the truth.</p>
          <p eId="para_846">The groups have described this as a grossly insensitive and retrograde proposal. They have described the proposed changes as surprising and restrictive amendments to the existing code for which there is no rational basis or public demand. They have asked for the support of all Deputies from all political parties and all Dáil groups for their position. I hope the Members on the Government side will heed that call and use their influence to get these obnoxious sections struck out. In regard to the major party, which now has a new arrangement for policy decision making, will those who were so vocal recently ensure that their party in Government will respond to the call of these affected groups and victims?</p>
          <p eId="para_847">Sections 1(b), 2 and 6 of this Bill represent a legislative ambush. These are totally unacceptable provisions, piggy-backing on the central and long overdue provisions for insurance. These people want the insurance scheme set up as soon as possible. It is literally a matter of life and death for them and for their families. I call on the Minister not to go ahead with the Committee and Report Stages of this Bill tomorrow, to take out the offending sections, bring the Bill back next week without those sections, go ahead with the insurance provisions and fulfil her obligations to these people. Anything else will be nothing other than an act of gross bad faith.</p>

        <speech by="#JohnGormley" eId="spk_289">
          <from>Mr. Gormley</from>
          <p eId="para_848">Like other speakers, I spoke yesterday to a number of the lobby groups who came to this House to speak directly to us because of their concerns about this legislation. I was struck by their common sense, their intelligence and their remarkable good humour in the face of adversity. I asked myself afterwards if I could be so good-humoured in the face of so many difficulties. I do not think I could. I would be angry at the cold-hearted, penny-pinching bureaucracy. I would be angry at the insensitivity of this Government. I would be angry at the incompetence of the State's health service and the lack of accountability. However, these people have had many years to be angry and at this stage what they are trying to do is rebuild their shattered lives. The Minister is not making this rebuilding process easy. She is making it extremely difficult.</p>
          <p eId="para_849">Throughout our lives we sometimes bring things upon ourselves when we make specific choices. In this instance the tragedy of these people's lives was not brought about by them but by the State and I am struck by the total lack of compassion on the part of this Government. These people are seeking justice. What we have here is a very peculiar inversion. The victims, in this case, are the guilty ones, and they are the prisoners of their own illness. I appeal to the Minister to set these people free if she believes in justice, and if there is a compassionate bone in any of the bodies on the Government side of the House.</p>
          <p eId="para_850">I think back to the very early days of hearing about this issue. I think particularly of the days of Charles J. Haughey when an election was forced upon us. It was the first time the Minister of State's party was in Government. I think about the recklessness of the pharmaceutical companies and the hard heart of the State. There was also a lack of accountability.</p>
          <p eId="para_851">There are Ministers who have the courage to stand up to their officials. Deputy McManus asked earlier who was driving this issue and what the motivation was. The officials in the Department drive the agenda. However, a good and courageous Minister will stand up to the officials, recognising that there is a deep injustice. I do not see the Minister, Deputy Harney, doing so. We have heard that she previously stood up to vested interests and that she is a politician of conviction. I do not see that conviction here.</p>
          <p eId="para_852">She has left the Chamber now, but perhaps it is not too late and the Minister of State, Deputy Tim O'Malley, can speak to her. I hope the Minister will not adopt a Margaret Thatcher type of attitude of not caring and that it does not matter what these people say. I hope there will be a dialogue and the Minister will listen to the sound arguments.</p>
          <p eId="para_853">I took grave exception to the Tánaiste accusing those of us expressing concerns of playing politics. We are not playing politics. We are politicians representing the views of those of us who spoke to us yesterday. These people have genuine concerns.</p>
          <p eId="para_854">I support the Labour Party motion. Like some previous speakers, I am not a medical expert or an expert on this issue. I am happy to listen to experts and those people who have been infected and whose lives have been radically changed. I spoke to Mr. Brian O'Mahoney and it is interesting to read from his memo on this legislation. It indicates clearly that this issue was always meant to produce a stand-alone Bill. The memo states:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_855">During the nine years of discussion and communication in relation to this, there was never any mention of linking this to the hepatitis C compensation scheme. Despite this, when the Bill is published we now see that it is linked to the hepatitis C compensation scheme, and the insurance Bill is being used to retrospectively change some of the provisions of the Hepatitis C Compensation Tribunal Acts of 1997 and 2002. This will mean that some of our members and some members of other groups — Positive Action, Transfusion Positive and the Irish Kidney Association — will be disenfranchised and prevented from taking part in the compensation scheme.</p>
          <p eId="para_856">We have heard from previous speakers and it is very clear at this stage what these various groups want. They want a stand-alone Bill. I have put down amendments to the effect that sections 1(<i>a</i>) and 1(<i>b</i>) must be deleted, along with section 2 and section 6. That is clear.</p>
          <p eId="para_857">I have stated that I am not an expert, but I wish to discuss the ELISA test. I did not know what the test was, and although I knew what a consortium was, it was a different type. The information we have is that this test is not conclusive. There have been many instances where people were diagnosed and later found not to test positively.</p>
          <p eId="para_858">A letter was sent to the Tánaiste by DettaWarnock of Positive Action, dated 15 February 2006. It was in response to a letter from the Tánaiste. A relevant section of it states:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_859">Following a targeted look-back programme by the IBTS informing all women who received an infectious batch but who had tested negative on the original screening or maybe were not screened in 1994, we have had a number of new members in the category "women who received a contaminated batch but are currently testing negative to hepatitis C". The maximum number this could be is 3,358 relating to 1977 and 17,429 relating to 1991-94.</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_860">However, we have only a very small number on our database, approximately 40. These women are suffering from severe bad health which has been continuously documented over the years, following receipt of contaminated anti-D. We are only requesting that you consider those who have a retrospective diagnosis from their consultant hepatologist.</p>
          <p eId="para_861">That is the request, and there is room here for reasonable compromise. I do not understand why the legislation is being rushed through in the second to last week of the session. There are clear issues here, where the people directly affected have major concerns. It seems the Government will simply ignore them.</p>
          <p eId="para_862">I stated earlier that this reminds me a little of the time of Mr. Haughey, who has passed away, and his attitude. It seems that the same attitude is prevailing here. At the time, Mr. Haughey did not refer to people with haemophilia but spoke in terms of the Government's fiscal policy being undermined. He stated that "the Government would not tolerate any attempt to undermine its authority in financial matters." It seems that we have not learned anything. What we are discussing here are financial matters when we ought to be speaking on people's health.</p>

        <speech by="#CatherineMurphy" eId="spk_290">
          <from>Ms C. Murphy</from>
          <p eId="para_863">I do not take it lightly when groups such as Positive Action, Transfusion Positive, the Irish Haemophilia Society or the Irish Kidney Association contact me on an issue such as that which we face today. As far as I am concerned, those groups are experts because they are connected to people living with the problem. There is nobody with more expertise than those who live with this problem. While the broad thrust of this Bill is important to victims of contaminated blood, there is no doubt there are problems in it.</p>
          <p eId="para_864">I had good reason to pay close attention to this scandal when it emerged in the 1990s, as I had received some anti-D injections. Like other women, I was happy to receive the product to prevent problems occurring with subsequent pregnancies. A decade or two earlier, such a remedy was unavailable to women. Some women would have lost full-term babies as a consequence. The last thing a woman who had given birth and received an anti-D injection would have contemplated was that they, their partner or subsequent children would be infected.</p>
          <p eId="para_865">After I received the anti-D injection in the years between the mid 1970s and the 1990s, I was tested. I was one of the fortunate women who had no negative implications. However, I was tested at the same time as women with whom I was friendly or acquainted. Some of them have experienced the most profound consequences. In some cases lifestyles have been modified and social lives drastically changed. This has had an impact on relationships and some have not survived the additional problems facing those families. This is not an insignificant difficulty and it is important that it is included in the consideration of this Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_866">Some women have suffered severe consequences as a result of the illness and also of the medication. They may have feelings of guilt when one of their children is contaminated. The four groups stated yesterday that victims do not wish to be excluded. Their statements highlighted the core of the problem, which was that they were not listened to. The official mindset of that time might still have an impact today.</p>
          <p eId="para_867">The year 1997 seems to be significant in terms of Dáil debates on the subject. I refer to contributions made by Deputies Cowen and O'Donnell in 1997. Deputy Cowen subsequently became Minister for Health. He referred in his contribution to Deputy Noonan, then Minister for Health, and stated:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_868">At the time he made that announcement, he never mentioned health care which was and remains a primary consideration of victims. The Minister continues to believe that this was all about money and lawyers. It was a flawed belief on his part and explains much of his mishandling of the affair.</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_869">The compensation scheme continues to fail a fairness test on many counts but the Minister has resisted, despite numerous Dáil debates and calls from victims to make any substantive changes. This Bill at last delivers on the promise in the programme for Government to pay fair compensation, but it is only happening now, over two years and four months on, in the dying days of this Administration.</p>
          <p eId="para_870">In the same contribution Deputy Cowen stated:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_871">It has also been a concern of transfusees, where their medical records are destroyed or where donors have not returned since 1 October 1991 when testing was introduced, that they are not in a position to prove in the normal fashion that they positively received an infected blood product or an infected transfusion. This is something about which Transfusion Positive lobbied extensively before the <i>ad hoc</i> tribunal began its hearings. The <i>ad hoc</i> tribunal has worked in a satisfactory manner to date for transfusion victims in relation to the manner in which the standard of proof is applied, that is, the balance of probability.</p>
          <p eId="para_872">It is ironic that the groups in question only had sight of the Bill in the past week on 20 June 2006. I agree with Deputy Cowen that there was a failure to understand and a failure to listen and this failure is being repeated.</p>
          <p eId="para_873">Deputy O'Donnell stated in 1997:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_874">Sadly, it has been a feature of this Administration's handling of the matter that all concessions have been wrung from it and we have not seen a generosity which derived from the Government's own sense of moral or legal responsibility to the victims . . . . .</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_875">It is no thanks to the BTSB that there are not 60,000 women infected with hepatitis C. Sixty thousand women were screened, but many have not been screened. Some infections may be dormant, or transient, or may have cleared. We know that 1,600 women are infected.</p>
          <p eId="para_876">Deputy O'Donnell further stated, "It appears some women have liver disease but are not testing positive for hepatitis C." This was acknowledged in 1997 by a member of the Progressive Democrats and a colleague of the current Minister for Health and Children.</p>
          <p eId="para_877">The experts who say there are problems associated with this Bill must be heeded. We are unsure of the amendments which the Tánaiste proposes and the House needs to be informed before the end of this debate tomorrow so that Members can make a judgment call on the changes in the Bill.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#PeterKellyFF" eId="spk_291">
          <from>Mr. Kelly</from>
          <p eId="para_878">There is no doubt that what happened regarding hepatitis C is the greatest public health tragedy since the foundation of the State. Large numbers of persons were infected with an incurable disease which has changed their lives and prospects as well as their family and work relationships. No monetary support or compensation can ever undo the damage. However, we as legislators must do what we can to make life easier for the victims. I offer my sincere sympathies to the families affected. It was an absolute disaster.</p>
          <p eId="para_879">This House has already enacted two Acts to deal with this tragedy, the Hepatitis C Compensation Tribunal Acts 1997 and 2002. This Bill seeks to establish a statutory scheme to address insurance difficulties experienced by persons infected with hepatitis C and HIV through the administration within the State of blood and blood products. It is a vital measure designed to give further support to people diagnosed with hepatitis C and HIV as a result of the administration of contaminated blood products.</p>
          <p eId="para_880">The consultative council on hepatitis C is the statutory body established to advise the Minister on all aspects of hepatitis C. Millions of people all over the world have this virus infection and most people with hepatitis C live as long as anyone else. Many never develop serious problems but some will need active treatment at some stage of the illness. A small number of people with hepatitis C have progressive liver disease that does not respond to existing treatments. However, doctors are making real progress in finding better treatments. Nonetheless, since 1997 it has been obvious that the inability of those infected to buy life assurance or mortgage protection policies is further compounding the damage they had already suffered. These people have suffered enough. On the enactment of the Bill, three types of recompense will operate. To date, the Hepatitis C and HIV Compensation Tribunal awarded more than €660 million to approximately 2,000 people. Of these, approximately 1,000 were anti-D recipients and approximately 700 were transfusion recipients, renal patients or persons with haemophilia. The remainder were secondary claimants or dependants entitled to claim under a range of headings including "loss of consortium", "loss of society" and "carer's expenses".</p>
          <p eId="para_881">Those who contracted hepatitis C through the administration within the State of blood or blood products are entitled to a special card under the Health (Amendment) Act 1996. This is termed the "HAA card". HAA cardholders are entitled to avail of a range of services and products without charge including general practitioner services, prescribed drugs, medicines and appliances, dental services, ophthalmic services, home support, home nursing, counselling services, physiotherapy, chiropody and podiatry. The Bill adds life assurance support to the entitlements of cardholders which will cost an estimated €90 million to provide over the life of the scheme. I applaud the Government on the introduction of a life assurance scheme which no other country has put in place. The Bill demonstrates the State's commitment to working with the victims of infection to provide every possible support. The scheme will cover the insurance risk of more than 1,700 people who are entitled to avail of assurance products, irrespective of any other medical condition, on payment of the standard premium paid by an uninfected person of the same age and gender.</p>
          <p eId="para_882">To ensure a consistent approach to all three supports, Government agreed to define hepatitis C diagnosis in the Hepatitis C Compensation Tribunal Acts 1997 and 2002 and the Health (Amendment) Act 1996 in accordance with the scientific ELISA test. Alternatively, if a person has displayed symptoms of acute infection with jaundice up to 16 weeks after the administration of an infective agent, the resultant infection also comes under the terms of the Act. While the ELISA test has had its doubters, the Tánaiste pointed out this morning that there has been significant progress in its development. A similar scientific test definition for hepatitis C diagnosis is used in other jurisdictions where compensation schemes operate including the United Kingdom and Canada. The sections of the Bill setting out the definition of a diagnosis will not affect claims already made to the compensation tribunal. Symptoms linked with hepatitis C include tiredness, aches, pains and depression, some of which are common to a number of conditions not associated with the disease. To ensure the support schemes operate in a fair and equitable manner and that those determining eligibility use clear consistent criteria, it has been decided that diagnosis will be determined by means of an internationally accepted test. We should remember that the expert group on hepatitis C, chaired by the Department's chief medical officer and including leading liver consultants and a member of Positive Action, agreed in 1998 that eligibility for the Health (Amendment) Act card should be based on a positive diagnostic test for hepatitis C.</p>
          <p eId="para_883">The objective of the scheme set out in the Bill is to provide reasonable access to the insurance market, within certain limitations, to those for whom the cost is prohibitive or cover is unavailable. From its inception, the consultative council on hepatitis C highlighted the obstacles people encountered in obtaining insurance cover. The Department of Health and Children sought advice from life assurance experts on the feasibility of developing an insurance scheme, the parameters of which were established in a subsequent phase of work. In devising the draft scheme, officials worked closely with the representative groups to agree its provisions. On foot of representations by the Irish Haemophilia Society, it was agreed that the small number of persons infected with HIV only would also be eligible for support under the scheme. Most persons with haemophilia who are infected with HIV also have hepatitis C.</p>
          <p eId="para_884">For insurance purposes, persons with hepatitis C and, or, HIV fall into two categories. While those in the first category can obtain insurance, it is only on payment of increased premiums. Those in the second category are deemed by the insurance industry to be uninsurable. The Bill provides that the State will pay the additional risk premium where a life assurer is willing to provide cover subject to an additional premium or assume the risk of the life cover where an assurer is unwilling to provide cover to an applicant. In each case, the person requiring insurance will pay the average basic premium an uninfected person of the same age or gender would pay. The scheme will be administered by the Health Service Executive and made available in respect of all standard life assurance policies offered by those life companies authorised to transact life assurance business in Ireland that choose to take part. The scheme, which will be administered under the aegis of the Health Service Executive, will be available in respect of all standard life assurance policies offered by life companies which are authorised to transact life assurance business in Ireland and who choose to take part in it. Life assurers who wish to take part in the scheme will enter into an agreement to abide by the rules of the scheme, which will also provide for appeal in the event of a dispute.</p>
          <p eId="para_885">The parameters of the scheme mean life assurance with maximum cover of €400,000, or seven times the earned income of the eligible participant or his or her partner, or both, in respect of the tax year in which the proposal is submitted and up to a maximum of €500,000, will be available to the age of 75. These sums will be indexed to keep pace with the consumer price index.</p>
          <p eId="para_886">Also being provided up to the age of 75 is mortgage protection cover on purchasing, changing or improving a primary residence, up to an overall maximum of the average house price in Dublin plus 25% or €375,000, indexed in accordance with the TSB/ESRI Dublin house price index.</p>
          <p eId="para_887">For an initial period of 12 months from the commencement date or, if later, three years from the date hepatitis C or HIV is diagnosed, all persons with hepatitis C or HIV will be entitled to apply for cover under the scheme. After that, a waiting period will apply, during which full cover may be phased in over two years for the under-50s and three years for over-50s.</p>
          <p eId="para_888">In order to ensure equity there will be an open period for young people, who are not ready to avail of insurance or mortgage protection at this time, until the date of their 30th birthday.</p>
          <p eId="para_889">The maximum age of entry into the scheme will be 65 and the age at which cover will cease will be 75. However, persons aged up to 75 will be able to take out insurance cover in the first year of operation of the scheme.</p>
          <p eId="para_890">On the question of consortium, the Bill proposes to clarify that compensation will be awarded to spouses and partners of persons where the relationship had commenced before diagnosis of hepatitis C or HIV. New partners or spouses of infected persons who knowingly entered relationships after the diagnosis of hepatitis C will be unable to claim damages for loss of consortium. However, other headings of claim for compensation by persons in this category, suchas loss of earnings, loss of society and post-traumatic stress, will not be affected by the amendment.</p>
          <p eId="para_891">We must acknowledge in the strongest possible terms that the infection of people with contaminated blood products was catastrophic for them. No monetary support or compensation can ever repair the damage done. However, Ireland is doing more for victims than other countries in similar circumstances.</p>

          <from>Mr. Durkan</from>
          <p eId="para_895">I propose to share time with Deputy Hayes. I have considerable concerns about this Bill. Despite what the Tánaiste said in the House this morning, and her protestations to the effect that it represented an improvement on existing legislation, I am not so certain, nor are many women around the country. Because of the history of hepatitis C over the past ten years in this country we must be careful not to exclude or impede any person who received contaminated blood treatment, notwithstanding they may have since tested negative because that does not necessarily mean they will remain unaffected.</p>
          <p eId="para_896">There now exists a group of women who have experienced consistently poor health over a long period of time and who are concerned they will remain that way. Whether these women, or their spouses or partners, contracted the infection by primary or secondary means is immaterial. The initial problem arose because they followed to the letter a procedure as advised by the State, medical practitioners and the Department of Health and Children. As a result, they and their families' health suffered dramatically.</p>
          <p eId="para_897">The Government will require an ELISA test, which it states is the definitive test to determine eligibility. That may well be the case and it may draw a line in the sand but that line will not apply to all potential sufferers, including those who might be discovered at a later stage. Whatever the protestations of the Tánaiste that is a fact of life.</p>
          <p eId="para_898">The trauma and, in some cases, the death of those who were diagnosed and suffered in the past are well-known. We all know people, friends and constituents who received treatment and continue to receive it. They have undergone chemotherapy and still do so. Many have lived for the past ten years with the clear knowledge that they will never have good health again and that there was serious doubt about their long-term health prospects.</p>
          <p eId="para_899">I do not care what are the logistics. In such a situation we have a duty as legislators to reassure people that what happened before cannot happen again. More particularly, we must also ensure that any entitlements they have, whether to insurance or anything else, are protected so they are not penalised, excluded or in any way further punished for doing the right thing. They were asked to accept the treatment, which they did, and they have paid for it ever since.</p>
          <p eId="para_900">As a medical practitioner, the Ceann Comhairle would be more familiar with this type of situation than the rest of us. I am also quite sure he is very conscious of the concerns of the women who suffer from hepatitis C as a result of receiving anti-D. Their families, including their extended families, have suffered and continue to suffer.</p>
          <p eId="para_901">I referred to long-term health prospects and life expectancy. These people followed approved medical advice and paid the price. Any intervention of this stage must take full account of what might happen over the next five years. There will probably be more cases. Correspondence from Detta Warnock expresses concern that there are a number of women who, along with their families, may find themselves at a disadvantage following the passing of this legislation. They will be added to that list of people who have paid a high price. Why should that happen? Why should we countenance such legislation brought into the House in the dying days of this session? This issue requires debate over a longer period. We must consider the experiences of the past and the likelihood of recurrences. The Tánaiste contradicted this earlier but there is other opinion. Who is right and who is wrong? In those circumstances, one must err on the side of safety and protect the people who so far have not been protected or those who are likely not to be protected in the future by virtue of the passage of this legislation.</p>
          <p eId="para_902">I had the sad experience of attending the funeral of the late Mrs. McCole. It is a memory which will stay with me for the rest of my life. A full church witnessed the procession of the coffin of Mrs. McCole down the aisle, which was followed by her daughters, and it brought home in the most graphic way the magnitude of what happened in her case. I know several women in my constituency who are suffering and who have this threat hanging over their lives. I am not being chauvinistic but if something like this happened to the male population, there would be absolute outrage, and rightly so. At the time, for some unknown reason, the magnitude of the offence and damage done and the cruelty and trauma the women experienced was not recognised.</p>
          <p eId="para_903">Why not improve the situation for the sufferers? What is wrong with covering every possible angle to ensure nobody is excluded from the right to have a reasonable quality of life in so far as possible? We should not proceed with the legislation until a sufficient appraisal and a much wider examination have taken place of all its implications. I have no difficulty improving the situation in respect of insurance for the people concerned. However, I have a major concern about the number of people who might be excluded.</p>
          <p eId="para_904">We now have the benefit of hindsight and for that reason, we should not do anything which would in any way curtail the rights or entitlements of sufferers or those who are likely to become sufferers following a diagnosis in the future. There is an incubation period which can vary from one case to another. Although not necessarily as medical practitioners, we have all dealt with cases where an illness, not necessarily hepatitis C, was not diagnosed for several years and where, with the benefit of hindsight, it might have been possible to diagnose it but it could not have been confirmed. Is a person in those circumstances likely to be deprived of their entitlements as envisaged in the Bill? From the information Members on all sides and party leaders have received, there would appear to be a serious doubt. If there is a doubt, we must err on the side of safety.</p>
          <p eId="para_905">It is not as if the number of cases will continue to grow but even if it did and large numbers of women and their spouses or partners would be entitled to compensation and cover as envisaged under the insurance element of this legislation, we should not deprive them of it. Why make a bad situation worse? Why not confront the situation and say mistakes were made in the past, which should not have been? We now know about those mistakes and there is no excuse for doing anything which would in any way militate against those who have not yet been diagnosed or those who have been cleared but might be diagnosed in the future. That also applies to people's immediate family.</p>
          <p eId="para_906">As legislators we have a duty to all the people but particularly to sufferers of hepatitis C who were recipients of a treatment which was deemed to be good, safe and necessary. We now have no excuse but to ensure the legislation we pass encompasses all of the aspects of the trauma, ill-health, suffering, pain and poor quality of life hepatitis C sufferers have experienced since the initial problem arose.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#TomHayes" eId="spk_295">
          <from>Mr. Hayes</from>
          <p eId="para_907">I thank the Ceann Comhairle for the opportunity to speak on this very important Bill. I am disappointed, like many others, that the Bill has not come before the House as a straightforward insurance Bill in the form that those affected expected. Making amendments to a sensitive Bill of this nature does not project a positive image of a caring Government. On the contrary, it suggests the Government is more interested in protecting itself than looking after the interests of those hepatitis C sufferers whose condition is definitely the fault of the State, which all Members accept.</p>
          <p eId="para_908">I choose to speak on the Bill because I know people who have had the shadow of hepatitis C hanging over them for some time, having received blood transfusions at the time the infection was spread. The trauma the victims and their families suffered is nothing short of disgraceful. Now they are faced with disappointment with regard to this Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_909">I have personal experience of this matter, having visited a lady infected with hepatitis C. I have heard her describe her feeling of helplessness and her worries about the normal things in life which we all take for granted, such as her family's future. She is not bitter but she expected to get fair play from the authorities and the Government. It needs to be said but has not been said often enough in this debate that those involved expect fair play. The patients' rights group has shown nothing but good faith throughout this process. Is our message to it that its good faith was in vain, that it cannot trust the Government and that future victims of the State's tragic mistakes cannot trust the State to compensate appropriately for those blunders?</p>
          <p eId="para_910">We must focus on those suffering from hepatitis C and understand the human side of the situation. The victims' lives are forever changed by the fact they were given infected blood products through no fault of their own. The range of symptoms that victims must endure, including aches, pains, fatigue and so on, makes everyday life more difficult than it should be. They are left with a heavy burden to bear. The State must not only show a willingness to make amends for its mistake, it must also show compassion to those affected.</p>
          <p eId="para_911">Introducing the provision for a scientific test, the ELISA test, to prove the sufferer has hepatitis C will almost certainly limit the number who can avail of the insurance scheme. Many of my colleagues have referred to the many limitations of this test — its failure to diagnose conclusively is a real worry. Given these limitations, why are we incorporating it into legislation? It does not make sense to do so. We have had several examples of flawed legislation in the House in recent weeks. Why are we adding another flawed Bill to those already on the Statute Book?</p>
          <p eId="para_912">The victims seek a stand-alone Bill to deal with insurance only. How can we justify not giving them this limitation because of the test? I appeal to the Tánaiste to give the victims of hepatitis C the Bill they seek. They are only a small group. The State made a terrible mistake in administering contaminated blood products. The least we can do is seek not to cause them any further anguish. Unless we amend the Bill to make it a stand-alone Bill dealing with insurance for victims and their spouses, we will continue to let down the victims rather than seeking to address the situation comprehensively. That is their plea. Only a small number of people are involved and I urgently request to Minister to bring forward such a Bill.</p>

A scheme of compensation is in place to help those affected and their families, but monetary compensation is nothing when compared to the loss of quality of life of people and their families in this great scandal that will affect our country for years to come. Some €660 million has been given out in compensation. So what? It is just to help people along. The medical card back-up is costing €15 million and this Bill will deal with the insurance aspect, which is necessary because insurance companies were prepared to treat those involved like lepers and not give them adequate insurance cover for life, mortgage or travel policies.</p>
          <p eId="para_916">A sad situation had developed with regard to the people concerned and I am pleased the Minister has come forward with a Bill to deal with the matter. Consultations have taken place with the different associations and groups involved. I hope it will bring some further comfort to these unfortunate individuals who are the victims of a lifestyle imposed by the State by the provision of inappropriate products that caused terrible health damage to those who received them.</p>
          <p eId="para_917">I am not sure exactly how the scheme will work but I take from the Minister's contribution that it has been set down in a certain way following consultations. I have had correspondence from the Irish Haemophilia Society raising concerns to which I feel duty bound to refer. I hope the Minister will discuss these concerns with the officials of the Department and will make contact with the society to find whether the difficulties can be ironed out.</p>
          <p eId="para_918">We must be accommodating with regard to those affected by this scandal. We should not in any way create barriers to proper compensation, health care or insurance, which is provided for in the Bill. The Minister and the Government certainly do not want that to happen. If difficulties cannot be clarified, let us try to tease them out on Committee and Report Stages. Nobody in the House, including those on the Government side, wants to place further burdens on the victims of hepatitis C, and HIV in some cases. As Members of the Oireachtas, we have a duty to ensure the best possible health protection is afforded to the unfortunate people in question.</p>

     the position with regard to the number of principal and senior development specialists with Irish Aid volunteering to take part in the Government decentralisation programme; if he will confirm that legal difficulties surround the process; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

          <speech by="#ConorLenihan" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Foreign_Affairs" eId="spk_300">
            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs (Mr. C. Lenihan)</from>
            <p eId="para_921">Three principal development specialists serve in Irish Aid headquarters in Dublin, none of whom has applied to decentralise to Limerick. There are 12 senior development specialists in Irish Aid headquarters, none of whom has applied to decentralise to Limerick. Two senior development specialists originally applied to decentralise to Limerick but subsequently withdrew their applications. There are nine development specialist posts in headquarters and five development specialists are scheduled to decentralise, of whom four commenced employment since the announcement of the decentralisation programme in December 2003 and one applied via the central applications facility.</p>
            <p eId="para_922">A Labour Court case is ongoing regarding the terms and conditions under which technical grades are employed in various areas of the public service, including the specialists employed by Irish Aid. Technical staff employed by Departments and offices, including specialists and other fixed-term workers employed in Irish Aid, brought cases to the Rights Commissioner under the Protection of Employees (Fixed-Term Work) Act 2003. The case, which involves complex legal issues, has been referred to the European Court of First Instance.</p>
            <p eId="para_923">Some of the issues involved in the decentralisation of Irish Aid to Limerick have, therefore, a wider Civil Service dimension and must be resolved at central level. Discussions are ongoing with representatives of the specialists, their union — IMPACT — and the Department of Finance about the issues involved.</p>
            <p eId="para_924">Decentralisation is a Government decision and the Government is committed to moving ahead with its implementation. At present 37 posts in the directorate are filled by officers who have signalled their intention to decentralise to Limerick. In addition, 15 officers, either from elsewhere in the Department or from other Departments, are expected to take up duty at Irish Aid headquarters in the next three months. A further six officers serving elsewhere in the Department, mostly abroad, have also expressed an interest in decentralising to Limerick. This means that a total of 58 or 47% of the 124 posts advertised on the central applications facility, CAF, will be in the Department by autumn of this year.</p>
            <p eId="para_925">It is planned to have most of the senior management team for Limerick in place by the third quarter of 2006. The director general of Irish Aid has already indicated that he will decentralise to Limerick. Two counsellors are now in place in the directorate, both of whom have volunteered to go to Limerick and were recruited via the central applications facility. A third counsellor will take up duty this summer on return from a posting abroad. Two others recruited via the CAF are expected to take up duty in early July and will move to Limerick. The changeover of the senior management team, as in other grades, is being implemented in a planned and careful way so as to minimise disruption to the business of the directorate. While there are challenges ahead, management and staff are working effectively together to maintain the quality and integrity of the Irish Aid programme. I hope a greater number of specialists will, in time, volunteer to decentralise to Limerick.</p>

            <p eId="para_928">I wish to voice my dissatisfaction. During Question Time last month we heard a great deal of bluster and huffing and puffing from the Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs, Deputy Conor Lenihan, as he tried to mask the disastrous position of the decentralisation of Irish Aid to Limerick. Why, on that occasion, did he not inform the House that major legal problems had arisen with regard to the decentralisation programme? He chose to make these problems public during a visit to South Africa. Will the Minister of State comment on the remarks made by the head of Dóchas who stated decentralisation will damage the efforts of Irish Aid? Does he agree that the matter is descending into a shambles, given that moneys donated to non-governmental organisations to assist their efforts in the Third World will be wasted on making trips to the decentralised office and there will be no direct link to between the NGOs and Irish Aid? Will he admit that a major problem has arisen in the decentralisation programme?</p>

            <p eId="para_935">If he has an opportunity to do so, the Deputy will probably confirm that I have made perfectly clear in the House, in his presence, and in my appearances before the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs that a legal impediment has arisen. There is nothing new about the statement I made in the interview I gave <i>The Irish Times</i> from Africa, although I note the newspaper gave it ample coverage nonetheless. I made the same comments on the specific legal issue in a number of a parliamentary replies, some of which may have been issued to the Deputy. The case taken by the specialists has been well aired in newspapers in recent months and I understand several specialists from my Department wrote to <i>The Irish Times </i>in connection with the legal issue they have. There is, therefore, nothing new in my recent comments which appeared in previous replies. It may be worthwhile for the Deputy to read over these again before he frames another question on this matter.</p>
            <p eId="para_936">The decentralisation to Limerick is not a shambles. Perhaps the Deputy did not listen to the substance of my reply. The good news it contained is that the percentage of those intending to decentralise to Limerick has increased. The figure I provided on the previous occasion I spoke in the House was that 41% of our staff requirement of 121 posts had been met. This figure has since climbed to 47%.</p>

            <p eId="para_938">As I stated on the previous occasion, from the central applications facility it appears that Limerick is a popular choice among staff from outside the Department. The transfer of specialists is still held up and the Department may have to face certain aspects of this issue. This would be normal in any event as one would not move everybody at once during any office move. We will try to phase the move to ensure the least disruption to the programme and the work of those in the headquarters and office of Irish Aid.</p>
            <p eId="para_939">With regard to the issue of a direct connection with non-governmental organisations, I agree that many NGOs are Dublin based. Much of the population is in Dublin and the east coast on which much of our focus has been in the past. I presume the Deputy agrees with the conceptual notion behind decentralisation.</p>

          </question>
          <speech by="#NoelTracey" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Foreign_Affairs" eId="spk_321">
            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs (Mr. Treacy)</from>
            <p eId="para_949">I emphasise the deep concern of the Government about the increasingly serious situation in Gaza and the West Bank. It is essential that all parties have the courage to act with restraint — in particular at this time, the Government of Israel — and to avoid any further actions which cause additional escalation and endanger lives.</p>
            <p eId="para_950">On 16 June the European Council issued a declaration on the Middle East peace process which set out the overall policy and the specific concerns of the European Union. It reminded all parties of their responsibilities to protect civilian lives and set out unambiguously the longer-term obligations on both sides. These include the need for Israel to end all activities in the occupied territories that threaten the viability of a two-state solution and are contrary to international law. The EU has been consistent in its approach to the Palestinian authority. We welcome the conduct of the democratic Palestinian elections in January and since 30 January the EU and the wider international community have set out the steps required of a Hamas Government. It must commit to non-violence, recognise Israel's right to exist and accept the agreements negotiated with Israel by the PLO and the authority. We support the efforts of President Mahmoud Abbas to encourage Hamas to accept the peace process. If there is significant movement in this direction by Hamas, the Government is committed to arguing strongly for an appropriate EU response.</p>
            <p eId="para_951">The Government monitors closely the situation in the occupied territories, shares the widespread concern about developments in Gaza and the West Bank and believes that the Palestinian people should not face the prospect of a humanitarian crisis because of the reluctance of its Government to abide by the basic rules of the peace process. We have given a commitment that the level of Ireland's bilateral assistance to the Palestinian people will be maintained in 2006. The EU has been the strongest supporter of the Palestinian people, providing total assistance of €500 million annually. It has stated that it will continue to provide all the necessary assistance to meet the basic needs of the Palestinian people. It is unreasonable, however, to argue that we should continue capacity-building assistance to the Hamas Government irrespective of its attitude to the peace process.</p>
            <p eId="para_952">The European Council and the Quartet have endorsed the European Commission's work to establish a temporary international mechanism to channel assistance directly to the Palestinian people. The operation of the mechanism will commence in the coming days, based on a funding allocation of €105 million by the Commission. This will bring the total Community aid to the Palestinian people so far this year to €259 million. The mechanism will focus on essential services, starting with the health services. It will also involve a programme of allowances to the many Palestinian families in need. The arrangements will be reviewed after three months.</p>
            <p eId="para_953">I hope that other international donors, including the Arab states, will make early and substantial contributions through the new mechanism. As the European Council emphasised, it is also now important that Israel finds a way to resume the transfer of withheld Palestinian tax and customs revenues, which are essential in averting a crisis in the Palestinian territories. The withholding of these revenues has been the most significant factor in the economic difficulties now facing the Palestinians.</p>

          <speech by="#MichaelDHiggins" eId="spk_322">
            <from>Mr. M. Higgins</from>
            <p eId="para_954">While the Minister of State's reply goes a little further towards even-handedness, it is unacceptable. There is no reference to the fact that 60 Hamas politicians have been rounded up and arrested near Ramallah by Israel. Israel speaks of 87 people arrested overnight, of whom it says 64 were members of Hamas and 23 were members of other factions. The Palestinian Liberation Organisation says 84 people have been arrested, including seven cabinet officials and 21 members of the Palestinian Parliament. It is extraordinary that the Minister of State, in replying to a question such as mine, did not condemn that. It is not surprising, however, because he refers to the statement of 16 June, which is a pious evasion by the EU. No explicit sanctions have been threatened against Israel for its continuation of illegal settlements in the West Bank. In his reply perhaps the Minister of State will point out such sanctions.</p>
            <p eId="para_955">On the other hand, the Palestinians, whose elections he welcomes as free and fair, now find the people it elected are arrested arbitrarily by the Israeli authorities. This has not been condemned. Apparently, it is okay to threaten sanctions on the Palestinian people but to rely on moral suasion against the illegal settlements. There is nothing even-handed about the EU's position. It speaks of laying down conditions for the Hamas but not for the Israeli Government. This afternoon the Minister of State did not even condemn the arrest and detention of members of parliament elected in elections he regards as free and fair. He has not suggested that, for example, in his agreement with the Israeli authorities he will insist on human rights clauses. He has not suggested that he will not deal with Israel until the illegal barrier is removed and he has not asked them to withdraw immediately from the West Bank. What kind of response is that to the flagrant actions that are happening outside every principle of international law? Irish people have a more advanced position and every time they hear the General Council end of statement in Europe they are appalled because they cannot hear the Irish view.</p>

            <p eId="para_960">I did not interrupt anybody and I am about to respond. We are concerned about the escalating situation in Gaza and we appreciate the concern of the Israeli authorities about the recent incident, including the kidnapping of a soldier. He should be released immediately and unconditionally. However, Israel's reaction must be restrained and proportionate. In particular, the long-suffering people of Palestine should not be made to suffer further. All of us are concerned about the arrest of elected members of parliament and we condemn it. Ireland has added its voice to that of the UN Secretary General in calling for maximum restraint, in particular by the Israeli authorities. Our ambassador in Tel Aviv conveyed this message to them and this morning conveyed our serious concerns regarding the need for maximum restraint. Our consul general in Ramallah also this morning asked the Palestinian authority to do everything possible to secure the immediate release of the Israeli soldier. We have been active, consistent, fair and equitable with all sides, taking into account the seriousness of the situation.</p>
            <p eId="para_961">President Abbas is doing his best to resolve the situation and deserves our support. Governments in the region are being equally helpful. Diplomacy must be given the time and opportunity to work and Deputies will share my view on this. It is important that we use all our communications networks and opportunities through our excellent diplomatic staff, who do an outstanding job on behalf of Ireland in ensuring human rights, equity and freedom for all citizens on both sides. We must play our role, through the EU, in ensuring there is a mechanism to bring peace, stability, a proper structure and mutual respect for both Governments, support for the citizens of both areas and transfer of resources internationally and through the EU. We must do our utmost to ensure that Israel recognises its key responsibility in transferring the customs and tax duties that are rightfully due to the Palestinian people in order that they have the resources necessary to run the territories in an efficient manner. We have not been found wanting, nor will we be so.</p>

A short answer will do.</p>

            <p eId="para_964">We accept the plan and want to ensure the agreements reached with President Abbas and Hamas can be implemented. It is important that the Hamas Government fulfils its responsibilities to recognise Israel, condemn violence and accept and support the peace process. If it indicates clearly, through diplomatic channels, that it accepts this situation we have no difficulty in ensuring further support to help it bring peace to this troubled region. This has been a complex and difficult situation for a long time and it is important that we are even-handed in dealing with it and use all diplomatic channels available to ensure the rule of law prevails and respect for human life is absolute.</p>

     the circumstances surrounding the transporting of a handcuffed US marine through Shannon Airport without the necessary permission being obtained by the US from the Irish authorities; the subsequent discussions he has had with the US authorities regarding this incident; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

          </question>
          <speech by="#NoelTracey" eId="spk_331" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Foreign_Affairs">
            <from>Mr. Treacy</from>
            <p eId="para_966">I refer the Deputy to the statement of the Minister for Foreign Affairs in the Dáil on 13 June, when he gave the House a detailed account of the matter to which the Deputy's question refers. Immediately after the incident in question was reported to the Department of Foreign Affairs by the US Embassy, the Minister for Foreign Affairs summoned the US ambassador to Iveagh House, where they met for the best part of an hour. He outlined our grave concerns. The ambassador confirmed the sequence of events and made clear that the failure to seek consent arose from an administrative error. He conveyed his deep regret for the breach of procedures and undertook urgently to advise his authorities of our views. In confirming the US authorities' determination that the use of Irish airspace and airports by the US be completely transparent and in conformity with Irish law and the wishes of the Government, he also confirmed his willingness to review the situation immediately with a view to ensuring there is no recurrence. The Minister informed the ambassador that, notwithstanding the fact this incident had no connection with allegations of extraordinary rendition, it was unacceptable that it should happen.</p>
            <p eId="para_967">The following morning, the Minister briefed the Government meeting on these developments. Following the subsequent discussion, it was decided to make clear the Government's grave concern and to ask for a full written report from the US embassy. In addition, to ensure that appropriate steps are taken to prevent any recurrence of this incident, we are engaging in further discussion with the US authorities.</p>
            <p eId="para_968">Officials from the Department of Foreign Affairs have met officials from the US embassy, most recently on 20 June, and have been in subsequent contact by telephone. The embassy is preparing its written report and has also taken steps to prevent any recurrence of the episode, in particular by seeking to ensure that all relevant personnel are aware of their obligations and of the procedures to be followed. On the basis of our discussions with the US authorities, I have no reason to believe that this was other than an isolated incident which arose from an administrative error.</p>
            <p eId="para_969">Moreover, as the Minister and I have previously emphasised, this incident is quite distinct from the question of extraordinary rendition, and I remain confident of the continuing validity and weight of the clear assurances repeatedly given to us by the US authorities in that context.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#JohnGormley" eId="spk_332">
            <from>Mr. Gormley</from>
            <p eId="para_970">The Minister of State claims this is distinct from extraordinary rendition but does this incident not confirm that the Government does not have a clue what is going on in Shannon Airport but must wait for a cleaner to board an aircraft? The authorities at Shannon Airport did not contact the Government but contacted the US Embassy. The Government is completely out of the loop. Is it not the case that the Minister of State does not know whether extraordinary rendition is taking place and would prefer not to know? That is probably closer to the point.</p>
            <p eId="para_971">Will the Minister of State please outline what protocols are in place? I understand that permission is required from the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform for prisoners to go through Shannon Airport. Will the Minister of State confirm this? We are none the wiser on the requirements after this incident.</p>
            <p eId="para_972">Is it not the case as stated in <i>The Examiner</i>, that there are no protocols in place? Is it the case that the troops we see wearing uniforms in Shannon and elsewhere, for example, in the recent incident in Ennis, are in breach of Irish defence legislation? Is this acceptable?</p>
            <p eId="para_973">I regret that the Minister for Foreign Affairs is not here to answer my question directly. He told <i>The Guardian</i> that because of this incident we would have to conduct searches of the aeroplanes. The Minister of State did not mention these in his response. From now on will we conduct random searches, or was that promise made hastily after this incident? I see the Minister of State nodding which is interesting. Will he confirm to the House that the Government will conduct these searches?</p>
            <p eId="para_974">Many Deputies on this side of the House have been calling for that sort of action for some time and have received a negative response.</p>

          <speech by="#NoelTracey" eId="spk_391" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Foreign_Affairs">
            <from>Mr. Treacy</from>
            <p eId="para_1036">Human trafficking, which is an important issue for Ireland and the European Union, featured in the conclusions of this month's meeting of the European Council. It was listed as one of the areas in which the EU can deliver concrete results to benefit the citizens of the EU. The Council's conclusions express its determination to pursue the fight against human trafficking by fully utilising the resources of Eurojust, Europol and the task force of police chiefs. The issue of human trafficking was also considered at the most recent meeting of the General Affairs and External Relations Council, which examined the draft conclusions of the European Council. Article 5 of the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights prohibits trafficking in human beings. In 2004, the EU adopted a Council framework decision on combating trafficking in persons. My colleague, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, who has primary responsibility for what is first and foremost a criminal justice matter, is preparing legislation to criminalise trafficking for the purpose of sexual and labour exploitation.</p>
            <p eId="para_1037">A specific action plan to deal with trafficking in human beings was adopted by the European Council last December. The plan, which is wide-ranging, covers areas such as the co-ordination of EU action, the prevention of trafficking and the prosecution of offences linked to trafficking. The implementation of the plan has been actively pursued by the Justice and Home Affairs Council, in which Ireland is represented by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform. Under this country's existing criminal law, it is an offence to traffic a male or female person under 17 years of age for the purpose of sexual exploitation. The offence is punishable by up to life imprisonment.</p>
            <p eId="para_1038">I would like to refer to the work being done in this regard in international fora other than the EU. Human trafficking has been dealt with by the Council of Europe. That organisation's negotiations on the Convention on Action against Trafficking in Human Beings concluded last year. The convention, which was opened for signature in Warsaw on 16 May 2005, aims to prevent and combat trafficking in people in all its forms. A similar action plan was endorsed by the Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe in December 2003. Ireland is a signatory to the UN Convention on Transnational Organised Crime and its two accompanying protocols on smuggling and on the prevention, suppression and punishment of human trafficking. The Department of Foreign Affairs has provided over €1.7 million, through Irish Aid, for anti-trafficking projects carried out by the International Labour Organisation and a respected non-governmental organisation, under the leadership of the Minister of State, Deputy Conor Lenihan.</p>
            <p eId="para_1039">Human trafficking is receiving considerable attention at EU and international levels. My colleague, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, has raised it in bilateral contacts with his EU counterparts. He and I will continue to use relevant bilateral meetings to highlight our concerns in respect of this serious matter.</p>

            <p eId="para_1040">I do not understand why the Department of Foreign Affairs refused to answer this question when I tabled it as a priority question the last time the House took foreign affairs questions. Does the Minister of State agree that the recent "Prime Time Investigates" documentary exposed the conditions of slavery, rape and violence which are endured by trafficked women and children? Does he agree the programme also exposed that this country's controls in this regard are very lax and that our passport control system is porous? The Minister of State's reply confirmed that we are continuing to classify human trafficking as an immigration issue rather than as a human rights issue.</p>

When such people were taken into this country, they were checked to ensure all their paperwork and documentation was in order. Nobody was aware that the children in question were to be exploited at a later stage. Such behaviour is a criminal offence under our laws. As we speak, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, who responded to Deputy Allen when this matter was raised previously, is preparing legislation to deal with these issues. He intends to ensure that no loophole can be utilised in future and that people cannot be exploited in future. The European Union is at one on this issue. We are totally committed to ensuring that human trafficking does not take place here. The House can be assured that this country's system of passport control is very tight. The problems which have been mentioned tend to develop after the passport control stage. The issues in question are not related to the operation of our passport control system.</p>

            <p eId="para_1069">The Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, which is the licensing authority for Ireland's export control system, consults the Department of Foreign Affairs on all military licence applications and on some applications relating to controlled dual use goods. Ireland's export control system is implemented in a manner that fully meets its obligations as an EU member state and a participant in other international export control fora. Authorisation is given to export licence applications following careful case-by-case examination of their consistency with our international obligations, including the application of arms embargoes and compliance with the EU code of conduct on arms exports. The code of conduct refers to eight criteria which each application must satisfy before it can be approved. The criteria include respect for human rights; the internal situation in the final destination country; the behaviour of the buyer country in the international community, particularly its attitude to terrorism, the nature of its alliances and its respect for international law; regional peace and security; and the risk of diversion under undesirable conditions. The relevant regional sections are involved in the consultation process in the Department. These sections monitor and analyse the evolving political situation of each proposed country of end-destination, as well as issues such internal conflict and respect for human rights, to allow the Department to provide comprehensive and up-to-date observations to the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment on each specific case.</p>
            <p eId="para_1070">Officials from the Department attend the relevant EU working group meetings, including those of the conventional arms working group in Brussels, where EU officials exchange denial notifications and share information about their respective export control policies and regulations. The Department is also represented at regular meetings of the international export control regimes, including the Wassenaar arrangement, which deals with conventional weapons, the Australia group, concerned with chemical and biological exports, the missile technology control regime and the nuclear suppliers group. These meetings provide important opportunities for officials to exchange information with respect to particular end-destinations and end-users.</p>
            <p eId="para_1071">The Department is also consulted by the Department of Transport on applications involving the transit or overflight of civil aircraft carrying munitions of war or dangerous goods. In considering such applications, the Department of Foreign Affairs, as a matter of policy, applies criteria similar to those which relate to the export of weapons or dual use goods.</p>

It stated it requires the integration of those minimum standards into all planned policies, budgets and processes in an institution. Does the Minister of State agree that the decisions of the Department of Foreign Affairs do not meet those standards? Does he agree that the absence of a rigorous human rights-based approach to his responsibilities has been exposed by the passage of arms and a helicopter gunship through Shannon Airport to serial human rights abusers in Indonesia and Israel?

At least 49 Palestinians, including 11 children, have been killed by Israeli forces. Does the Minister of State agree with the Palestinian President, Mahmoud Abbas, that the bombardment of civilian infrastructure amounts to collective punishment, a crime against humanity? This would have been carried out by weapons such as an Apache helicopter.</p>
            <p eId="para_1076">Does the Minister of State agree that the kidnapping by Israel of 25 elected Palestinian representatives demonstrates Israel's lack of commitment to democratic principles? Will he clarify that, after consultation with the Department of Transport, as required by the 1973 order, the Department of Foreign Affairs approved the use of Shannon Airport for the transfer of military helicopters and other military apparatus to Israel? Does the Minister of State agree the role played by the State in the sale and transfer of arms to human rights abusers is unacceptable and must cease immediately?

            <p eId="para_1084">Deputy Ó Snodaigh's earlier assertion is false. No embargo was in place against Indonesia at the time the goods transited through Ireland. In this case, the views of the Department of Foreign Affairs were sought in accordance with standard procedures. Our advice to the Department of Transport was based on all relevant foreign policy considerations, including the fact that Indonesia has made significant strides towards democracy. It has also been the victim of several grievous terrorist attacks such as those in Bali. Deputy Ó Snodaigh may not remember that fact.</p>

     <b>Mr. Crowe</b>
      asked the 
     <b>Minister for Foreign Affairs</b>
     the position regarding the Basque peace process; and if in his view the political party Batasuna should now be removed from the EU blacklist of so-called terrorist organisations.

            <from>Mr. Treacy</from>
            <p eId="para_1107">In replies to parliamentary questions on this subject on 4 April, the Minister for Foreign Affairs welcomed the announcement by ETA of a permanent ceasefire from 24 March. He also made it clear that next steps in the process were purely a matter for the Spanish Government and elected representatives to consider.</p>
            <p eId="para_1108">Today the Spanish Prime Minister, Mr.Zapatero, spoke to the media on the Spanish Government's assessment of the ceasefire and on possible next steps in the process. I await a report from the Irish Embassy in Madrid on this. Those steps could include Spanish Government contacts with ETA and arrangements for talks between political groups. Political parties that are in conformity with Spain's law on political parties, including its provisions on support for violence or legitimisation or terrorist actions, would be eligible to take part.</p>
            <p eId="para_1109">The Batasuna political party was made illegal in Spain following a judgment of the Spanish Supreme Court in March 2003 in the framework of the law on political parties. Batasuna was subsequently added to the EU list of terrorist organisations on 4 June 2003 by a unanimous decision of the EU member states. Removal of Batasuna from the list would require, in the first instance, an initiative by the member state most concerned. Any request in that context and against the background of the awaited report by the Spanish Prime Minister to the Spanish Parliament would be carefully considered at all levels by Ireland and the EU.</p>

The Minister of State claims this is a matter for Spain alone. It is not because it is an EU-wide decision to put Batasuna on a blacklist. This is not helpful for the situation developing in the Basque country.</p>

            <from>Mr. Treacy</from>
            <p eId="para_1128">I refer the Deputy to the statement by the Minister for Foreign Affairs to Dáil Éireann on 13 June, in which he addressed the question of aircraft inspection comprehensively. As was pointed out in his statement, we were the first Government, when rumours of extraordinary rendition emerged, to raise with the US authorities our concerns about the matter. We were also the first Government to demand assurances that our territory would not be used for such purposes.</p>
            <p eId="para_1129">The Minister was the first to raise this issue among EU colleagues in advance of Secretary of State Rice's visit to Europe during the British Presidency, following which, at the Minister's suggestion, the Presidency wrote to Secretary of State Rice on the matter. To speak of a failure to act, which is the essence of the charge on positive compliance, against such a background of proactive intervention, is not reasonable. As we have also repeatedly made clear, the Garda Síochána has the powers it needs to investigate all allegations of illegal activity. In addition, there is no legal bar to the search of civilian aircraft of the type allegedly involved where there is a basis for doing so.</p>
            <p eId="para_1130">I also remind Deputies that to engage in the search and inspection of aircraft without any basis for doing so would be to set aside categorical, specific assurances which we, unlike almost every other state in Europe, have received from the US authorities, that in the context of extraordinary rendition, prisoners have not been transferred through Irish territory, nor would they be, without our permission. These assurances have been confirmed by the US Secretary of State, Condoleezza Rice. No other state in Europe, to the best of my knowledge, has this combination of clear, categorical assurances and confirmation from the highest levels of the US Government.</p>
            <p eId="para_1131">It remains the Government's position, therefore, that our obligations under international law are being fulfilled. I want yet again to stress that if we had reason to believe the US was in breach of its undertakings to us in the matter of extraordinary rendition, we would respond immediately. We are also open to examining, in consultation with partners, any practicable and specific proposals that may be made in consequence of the current Council of Europe and European Parliament processes.</p>

            <p eId="para_1135">The Minister of State appears to be going back on the word given by the senior Minister, Deputy Dermot Ahern. Is the Minister of State aware that the Minister, Deputy Dermot Ahern, told <i>The Guardian </i>on 16 June this year, “Given the fact that an incident like this has happened we would put the [police] on notice that perhaps they should start inspecting on a case-by-case basis”?</p>

We are fully committed to all of those situations and these laws and regulations are in place to deal at any time with suspected criminal activity. We have absolute assurances that this is the position. Extraordinary rendition is not taking place. We accept those assurances until we have evidence to suggest otherwise. There is no other evidence and under no circumstances has there been any extraordinary rendition of prisoners through Ireland at any time. That is the <i>de facto</i> position.</p>

It is a red herring to suggest the onus is on the citizen. Does the Minister of State agree? In his response to the questionnaire supplied to the Council of Europe he correctly stated the Air Navigation and Transport Act 1988 and the Air Navigation and Transport (Amendment) Act 1998 allowed for inspections. He did not state, however, that not one single inspection resulted. Does he agree that compliance requires inspection and the responsible implementation of the State's obligations?

            <from>Mr. Treacy</from>
            <p eId="para_1176">I propose to take Questions Nos. 8, 61 and 150 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_1177">As Deputies will be aware, on 16 May the UN Security Council adopted Resolution 1679 which paves the way for a UN force in Darfur and the transition of the present UN-authorised African Union, AU, mission in Sudan, AMIS, to UN command. A delegation from the UN Security Council undertook a mission to Sudan and Chad, as well as to the African Union headquarters in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, from 5 to 13 June. The visit is regarded as having been useful, although agreement has not been reached with the Government of Sudan on a transfer of peacekeeping to the United Nations.</p>
            <p eId="para_1178">Separately, from 5 to 22 June, a joint UN-AU technical assessment team led by the UN under secretary general for peacekeeping operations held wide-ranging discussions with Sudanese leaders aimed at strengthening the AU monitoring force in Darfur and preparing for its possible transition to a fully fledged UN peacekeeping operation. The team held consultations in Khartoum and Darfur to assess the immediate needs for strengthening AMIS which initially will be responsible for helping to implement the peace accord. The team also undertook an assessment of all the requirements for a possible transition from AMIS to a UN force in Darfur.</p>
            <p eId="para_1179">The under secretary general briefed the Security Council on the team's mission on Tuesday, 27 June. The UN Secretary General will shortly submit recommendations to the Council on all relevant aspects of the mandate of a UN operation in Darfur, further to Resolution 1679. It is understood the Secretary General's report will recommend that planning for transition should proceed but note that transition on the ground will not be possible without the consent of the Government of Sudan.</p>
            <p eId="para_1180">The United Nations has been engaged for some time in planning and identifying the military capabilities that may be required and commenced consultations with a range of member states, including Ireland, to accelerate the sourcing of these capabilities. Ireland has advised the United Nations that, due to the extension of our engagement in Liberia to May 2007, together with our other substantial commitments to UN peace support operations, we are not now in a position to provide capabilities for the prospective UN mission in Sudan. The situation will, however, be kept under constant review and I can assure the House, as the Taoiseach has personally assured the Secretary General, that Ireland remains committed to peace support operations under a UN flag, including in Africa.</p>
            <p eId="para_1181">The removal of obstacles to the delivery of humanitarian aid has been a matter of particular concern to the Government and I am pleased to report that, at Ireland's initiative, the General Affairs and External Relations Council on 12 June called for action in this regard by all parties in Darfur. Ireland fully supports the conclusions adopted on Sudan by the Council, as well as the declaration adopted by the European Council on 16 June. The General Affairs Council has stated the European Union will work for the full and rapid implementation of the Darfur peace agreement, DPA, and called on all parties to implement the agreement. The Council has made plain its willingness to take measures against those impeding the peace process, as well as its support for the International Criminal Court investigation into human rights abuses in Darfur. The European Union remains committed to helping AMIS through provision of planning, technical, financial and equipment support to both military and police components, taking into account the new tasks arising for AMIS from the DPA.</p>
            <p eId="para_1182">The Government has been particularly supportive of efforts to improve the situation in Darfur. Members of the Permanent Defence Force have served with the African Union monitoring mission in Sudan, while the Government has contributed €1.5 million in financial support to AMIS to assist with the recruitment of humanitarian and human rights officers and the construction of police stations to improve security in displaced persons' camps. From 2004 to 2005 the Government committed €10 million to Darfur for relief purposes. More than €1 million has been specifically committed to Darfur this year, as well as a further €3.8 million to all of Sudan, including Darfur. The Minister of State, Deputy Conor Lenihan will testify to this, as he has done on many occasions.</p>
            <p eId="para_1183">The Minister, Deputy Dermot Ahern, will travel to Sudan in the first week of July and meet representatives of the Government of Sudan, as well as representatives of the United Nations and non-governmental organisations, NGOs. He will also travel to Darfur to see the situation on the ground in displaced persons' camps.</p>

            <from>Mr. Allen</from>
            <p eId="para_1184">It is estimated that the conflict in Darfur has affected 3.6 million people, including 1.8 million internally displaced persons and 200,000 exiled to Chad.  Some 200,000 are dead. With this in mind, I am disappointed that we are so stretched we will be unable to contribute to the possible expansion of a peacekeeping force in the region. However, I commend the Minister of State on current efforts. We have to give credit where credit is due.</p>
            <p eId="para_1185">In view of today's announcement by the Minister, Deputy Dermot Ahern, regarding a new task force of specialists being set up to enter regions in greatest need, will some of the people concerned, when recruited, be sent to Darfur? What discussions have taken place to date on the allocation of specialists to the region?</p>

            <p eId="para_1186">We have 460 troops in Liberia where we were requested by the UN Secretary General to maintain a very strong troop complement. The Government has agreed to do so. Our rules oblige us not to have more than 850 members of the Defence Forces out of the country at any one time. We are participating in operations in Liberia, Kosovo, Bosnia, Afghanistan and the Congo at this time, which means we have reached our limit and are fulfilling our obligations under UN agreements.</p>
            <p eId="para_1187">Regarding the initiative, confirmed today, taken by the Minister and the Minister of State, Deputy Conor Lenihan, this team of specialists will be available to study all regions where support is needed and, if necessary, visit and actively engage in them. The Minister of State, Deputy Conor Lenihan, and his team will continue to liaise with NGOs and our diplomatic teams around the world and, where necessary, our specialists will be available to assist in humanitarian operations.</p>

            <p eId="para_1189">The Abuja agreement is critically important and was discussed at the European Council by the Taoiseach and his colleagues. It was also discussed at the General Affairs and External Relations Council, GAERC, by the Minister and me, with our colleagues, and at the Council of Europe. Every diplomatic effort is being made with EU High Representative Solana, the EU Three and others to ensure the agreement comes into operation as rapidly as possible to see the region progress in the interests of humanity. The Minister will certainly raise the issue.</p>

     the position in regard to all parties in Northern Ireland expressing their support for the PSNI; when he expects Sinn Féin to be in a position to take their seats on the policing board; the efforts he has been making in this regard in recent months; if he expects movement on this issue before, during, or after the summer 2006; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

          </question>
          <speech by="#NoelTracey" eId="spk_514" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Foreign_Affairs">
            <from>Mr. Treacy</from>
            <p eId="para_1191">The clear position of the Government is that all parties should give their support to the new policing arrangements in Northern Ireland. Through the progressive implementation of the Patten report, the PSNI has undergone a wide-ranging transformation in recent years and is now one of the most accountable policing services in the world. The latest report of the independent oversight commissioner for policing, issued on 6 June last, confirmed that the "Independent Commission's vision of a new beginning to policing is both well under way and irreversible". Therefore, there are no substantive reasons in terms of policing reform for any further delay by Sinn Féin in endorsing the policing arrangements in Northern Ireland and taking their seats on the policing board and on the district policing partnerships.</p>
            <p eId="para_1192">Full political support for policing will benefit all sections of the community in Northern Ireland. It is also a critical element in terms of putting in place a new political dispensation in Northern Ireland. Early progress on policing will contribute to building trust and confidence in the period ahead. Nevertheless, we do not believe it would be helpful at this stage to raise this issue as a precondition or make it an obstacle to political progress in Northern Ireland. The Government has repeatedly made clear that there is a need to see progress in this regard without delay and we will continue to use every opportunity in the period ahead to press for positive movement.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#MichaelDHiggins" eId="spk_515">
            <from>Mr. M. Higgins</from>
            <p eId="para_1193">Does the Minister for State agree that a certain ambiguity has been created by the contrasting positions of the Taoiseach and the Minister for Foreign Affairs? Will he clarify the matter? The Minister for Foreign Affairs has said that participation in the policing arrangements is not a precondition. At the same time, the Taoiseach has said that participation in the policing arrangements in Northern Ireland is a vital part of any new deal. I put it to the Minister of State that ambiguity has been created with regard to the structure of policing.</p>
            <p eId="para_1194">Would it not be better to deal with such transitional difficulties as are there, such as the issue of MI5 being the lead agency for intelligence gathering, as has been raised by Sinn Féin on occasion? It is time that the Government indicated its position clearly. Is it continuing to ask of Sinn Féin that it fully participate and seek such changes from within as would satisfy its criticisms or is it tacitly sending a separate message to the party that it is all right to stay outside? Which is it? Is it the Taoiseach's or the Minister for Foreign Affairs's version that is Government policy?</p>

            <from>Mr. Treacy</from>
            <p eId="para_1195">Our position has been very even-handed in Northern Ireland. We want to be fair to every party. We want total inclusivity, engagement and involvement. We want the democratic process to move forward. People are misconstruing the statements made by the Taoiseach and the Minister for Foreign Affairs on this serious issue.</p>
            <p eId="para_1196">The Government has been consistent in calling for the full endorsement of the new policing arrangements by all political parties without delay. As I stated, the latest report from the oversight commissioner for policing points out that 124 of the 175 Patten report recommendations have now been fully implemented, which is a considerable achievement. Among the outstanding issues, the absence of Sinn Féin from the policing board and the district policing committees is now one of the most significant. Therefore, it is vital that political support for the new arrangements becomes universal so that the reform process can be brought to full fruition.</p>

        <speech by="#IvorCallely" eId="spk_524">
          <from>Mr. Callely</from>
          <p eId="para_1208">I am grateful for the opportunity to speak on this Bill. I offer my congratulations to the Irish Haemophilia Society, the Irish Kidney Association, Positive Action and Transfusion Positive on their excellent work in representing their members and keeping this issue to the fore over many years. I understand that the Bill will establish a statutory scheme to address the insurance difficulties experienced by persons infected with hepatitis C and HIV through blood products administered by the State.</p>
          <p eId="para_1209">Unfortunately, most people in this country are familiar with hepatitis C because of the many thousands of unfortunate people infected following the administration of contaminated blood and blood products through the Irish Blood Transfusion Board.</p>
          <p eId="para_1210">We understand that hepatitis C can vary in severity. A person can suffer from acute hepatitis C, where there is a rapid onset of the disease, or chronic hepatitis C, where the onset is gradual but will be of long duration. The main means of contracting hepatitis C is through contaminated blood, which is how the people we are discussing were infected. The disease can also be passed from mother to baby.</p>
          <p eId="para_1211">The real tragedy of hepatitis C and HIV lies in the fact that there is no vaccine or cure for them at the moment. Those affected must live out their lives in the shadow of chronic diseases and are likely to require long-term medical care. The Bill addresses three elements in an attempt to alleviate hardship. These elements are compensation, the special health card and life assurance support. I understand that adequate funding for the scheme will be made available by the Exchequer for approximately 30 years.</p>
          <p eId="para_1212">The supports currently available to those infected consist of the hepatitis C and HIV compensation tribunal and the Health (Amendment) Act, which provides for a range of free health care services. The compensation tribunal was established in 1995 to compensate those infected and became a statutory body with the enactment of the Hepatitis C Compensation Tribunal Acts of 1997 and 2002, which make provision for compensation to those infected by HIV as a result of receiving a relevant blood product. I understand that the State has already paid out over €250 million in compensation to over 1,300 women infected with hepatitis C and that the final payment is expected to top €500 million.</p>
          <p eId="para_1213">However, these are mere figures which cannot calculate the devastation caused to these women and their families following their infection. The Health (Amendment) Act Card entitles those affected to general practitioner, nursing and home help services, as well as counselling services for them and their families, regardless of income. Prescribed drugs, medicines and medical and surgical aids and appliances are also available. Those affected are entitled to these services for life.</p>
          <p eId="para_1214">There is no suggestion that any amount of money, the required supports or services to which I just referred or any other form of compensation can ever make up for the suffering inflicted on those people who were infected with HIV or hepatitis C because they received contaminated blood or blood products from this State. It is hoped that this Bill, while long overdue, has the potential to provide the necessary answers and supports sought by sufferers and the relevant advocacy groups.</p>
          <p eId="para_1215">The inability of sufferers to buy life assurance, mortgage protection policies or travel insurance has added to the hardship experienced by them and their families. This issue of insurance was highlighted by advocacy groups and the consultative council on hepatitis C as far back as 1997. The Department of Health and Children initially sought advice from the insurance industry, while also consulting with advocacy groups on solutions to the problem. I understand that there are two separate issues for people with hepatitis C and HIV regarding insurance. Certain people can only obtain insurance with increased premiums, while others are deemed uninsurable by the insurance industry. The Government has proposed to deal with the problem by paying the additional risk premium where the insurance provider is willing to provide cover, subject to an additional premium. Where no assurance is available, the State will assume the risk on the life cover. In each case, the person requiring insurance will pay the average basic premium which an uninfected person of the same age and gender would pay. This effectively evens the playing field for those with hepatitis C and HIV.</p>
          <p eId="para_1216">It is a matter of grave concern that groups representing haemophiliacs infected with hepatitis C and HIV through State-administered contaminated blood products are not completely happy with the content of this Bill. Before I entered the Dáil at 5.36 p.m., I received a memorandum from one of the advocacy groups which makes three points. The first is that in its communications over several years, the group always believed that this Bill would be stand-alone legislation and that there was never any question of linking it to any other scheme or mechanism. The group argues that the changes mean some of its members and some members of other advocacy groups will be disenfranchised and prevented from taking part in the compensation scheme. The group's second point is that subsections (<i>a</i>) and (<i>b</i>) of section 1 and sections 2 and 6 should be deleted and that if this were done, all the advocacy groups would endorse the Bill. The group’s third point is that the advocacy groups are happy to engage in discussions with the Department to address any changes that may be required to the hepatitis C compensation scheme.</p>
          <p eId="para_1217">I am known as a person who likes to deliver, achieve results and ensure that measures are all-inclusive. I am surprised that we have travelled this road and are in possession of this legislation but are still receiving communications of this nature at this late stage from people who honestly and in good faith engaged in discussions to achieve satisfactory results but who are not satisfied with the legislation at the eleventh or twelfth hour. This situation is completely unsatisfactory. I urge the Minister to give due consideration to the concerns set out in the fax I received and other concerns voiced by groups representing those who have been infected. They have waited long enough for their needs to be met. They were infected because of errors in the use of blood products by State agencies. I am surprised we find ourselves in this situation. We should do all we can to address their concerns.</p>
          <p eId="para_1218">I understand that the Irish Haemophilia Society, the Irish Kidney Association, Positive Action and Transfusion Positive all oppose the Bill, which introduces a new scientific definition for hepatitis C that is used in other jurisdictions. Such a definition can be used but we should also examine the situation in this jurisdiction and work with these groups to secure agreement. The Bill specifies that the person has not been diagnosed positive for hepatitis C for the purposes of the Act unless the diagnosis is based on a positive ELISA test or if the person has displayed symptoms of acute infection such as jaundice or raised ALT levels within 16 weeks after the administration of the anti-D blood product. The advocacy groups contend that this definition will exclude a number of haemophiliacs who were treated with infected blood and who have displayed medical symptoms of hepatitis C but who have as yet not tested positive for the disease. I understand that the advocacy groups are also critical of an amendment to the Hepatitis C Compensation Tribunal Act 2002 which restricts the entitlement of some spouses and partners of hepatitis C sufferers to claim compensation.</p>
          <p eId="para_1219">This Bill is designed to acknowledge the rights and meet the entitlements of those who contracted hepatitis C and HIV from blood products provide by the State. If the Bill is not effective in doing so, we must re-examine its content. I believe that amendments will be made to this Bill before it is enacted. While I acknowledge that the provisions in the Bill regarding the definition of hepatitis C bring Ireland in line with other jurisdictions where compensation schemes operate, we as public representatives must be satisfied that we have done all we can to deal adequately with the consequences of the infection of people through State-administered blood products. Those who contracted hepatitis C and HIV as a result of contaminated blood products have a basic entitlement to life assurance and mortgage and travel insurance in line with the rest of the population. It is not acceptable that they are discriminated against because of their health problems and it is up to the Government and the House to ensure they are treated equitably and with dignity. This means that those who were infected should be able to obtain insurance cover in line with the rest of the populace.</p>
          <p eId="para_1220">This is an urgent matter and those who were infected should not find themselves in this position or wait any longer. We must ensure that the Bill addresses all their concerns. I earnestly ask the House to unite and ensure the passage of appropriate legislation. It is my understanding that the people involved in the discussions, particularly the advocacy groups, clearly put forward their case during the months and years preceding the Bill's introduction to the House. Most Deputies are anxious to ensure that their desires are met. Therefore, I do not understand why we cannot proceed in the most appropriate fashion to get the best result for the people seeking our support and assistance on this issue. I look forward to the developments that will hopefully take place on this proposal during the coming hours.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#KathleenLynch" eId="spk_525">
          <from>Ms Lynch</from>
          <p eId="para_1221">I concur to a great extent with many of the last speaker's comments. Having this legislation before the House that has been in the making for the past nine years and on which there was extensive consultation in the past two years beggars belief. The people who entered the negotiations with the Tánaiste's officials did so in good faith. They are not unreasonable people. If we were dealing with unreasonable people, this debate would not be so calm. They are not rebels or out to cause trouble. Rather, they had normal lives until this happened to them. They needed to become politicised to provoke action and to ensure that their difficulties were managed in a statutory framework. While they achieved this, it was not easily done.</p>
          <p eId="para_1222">The next obstacle they needed to surmount was that of insurance. We are discussing young men and women who could not get mortgage protection and, therefore, could not get mortgages. We are discussing people in their early 50s who had paid their mortgages and wished to take holidays. Despite being nervous about getting sick while abroad, they could not get travel insurance because of particular health problems. We are discussing men and women with young families who could not get the life assurance policies that would have given them and their families a degree of comfort. These are privileges we all expect. For fear that anyone will claim that I did not say so, I should have commenced by stating that I have an interest in this matter, as I am rhesus negative and was given anti-D in 1977.</p>
          <p eId="para_1223">We are discussing normal people who were hoping to live normal lives. The events that occurred were not of their making. The people responsible walked away scot free, which was the greatest injustice of all. We are not only discussing women, but a range of people, such as young men and women and those in their prime as we would currently define it. These people had perfectly normal lives and in certain circumstances were given transfusions of infected blood. Women who went to hospital for what should have been one of life's most joyous occasions, namely, having a baby, received anti-D and suffered the consequences.</p>
          <p eId="para_1224">Why are these three provisions in the legislation? The Title of the Bill makes no reference to insurance, yet the Bill is fundamentally about that issue. It should be stand-alone legislation, but this is akin to a three-card trick merchant playing "Find the lady". In any major European city, a huckster putting together a three-card trick table would be arrested and run off the streets for fraud, but here it is in Parliament, introduced by someone whom we all expected to be a caring Tánaiste. She has been badly advised. When she stood up in the Chamber this morning and said that no one will be excluded by the Bill, she was not telling the truth.</p>
          <p eId="para_1225">There are people who have still not made the connection between infection and their ongoing bad health, nor has it occurred to their general practitioners. There are people who are about to fall in love with someone who has been infected. They are not considering compensation or their future beyond what we all considered when we fell in love, that is, a happy-ever-after ending. However, in this instance, it will not be happy ever after. There will be consequences and matters to be managed. It was in this context that the original compensation Act was introduced. It put in place a structure that enabled people to manage lives that had been altered by the State, not to research a cure.</p>
          <p eId="para_1226">When the Tánaiste says no one will be excluded, she is wrong. I do not know who is advising her, but those people are wrong. The reason they are advising her is interesting — the mindset of closing off an appalling vista. I have news for them. The appalling vista happened between the late 1970s and early 1990s. This Bill tries to set right the appalling vista and the Government, which appears to have a death wish, will bring down on its head an awful price that it must pay. Is it true that circumstances change but we do not, as mentioned by the last speaker? In this instance, it seems to be the case.</p>
          <p eId="para_1227">The Tánaiste rightly stated that Positive Action agreed that the definition should be based on a diagnosis by the ELISA test. That was the case in the original Bill presented to the then Minister for Health in 1995 before the 1997 Finlay report, which has been accepted as the Bible in the matter. The Bill is about the three-card trick and spin, but the latter will not work, as the people involved are so conversant with this legislation and so aware of the consequences of this change to their lives that they will not be fooled.</p>
          <p eId="para_1228">It is important that the conclusions of Ms Justice Finlay Geoghegan on this issue be read into the record. However, we now have evidence in the form of a letter from the blood bank, as it was then, to Ms Justice Finlay Geoghegan. Referring to the fact that only a maximum of 100 people were affected, which makes it astonishing that the Minister's advisers are allowing this to happen, it states:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1229">However we now have evidence that it is also possible (although apparently rare) for a person to be infected and subsequently lose both detectable virus and indeed detectable antibodies. This happened in the case of donor Y. While we have no laboratory means of identifying these persons, we have however taken a history of symptoms or signs from those who received BTSB anti-D. We are thus aware of 74 recipients of 1977 anti-D who had an episode of jaundice at that time which is most likely to be related to exposure to hepatitis C.</p>
          <p eId="para_1230">We need to start reminding ourselves that the first we heard of this was on "Morning Ireland" in 1991 or 1992. The first the blood bank heard about it was in 1990 or 1991, when the university in England which was carrying out the test for the blood bank wrote to the BTSB in Dublin. The letter was from the original report into what went wrong in the blood bank and stated that there was something in the blood. It was not non-A nor non-B but something else was there.</p>
          <p eId="para_1231">It was first discovered 15 years ago that hepatitis C existed. Now the Minister for Health and Children tells us that men, women and children who were infected in the peak year in 1977 should have a conscious history of their symptoms, but this disease does not have a history. We do not know enough about it, because it is so new. However, the Minister does, as do her advisers, who say if people test negative under ELISA it means there is nothing wrong with them. That is complete rubbish. Experts in the field will say they do not know everything about the disease, but they know that nothing is foolproof and that ELISA does not pick everything up. Women test negative for both antibodies and virus but will swear they have been infected and suffer the symptoms. How can the Minister say nobody will be excluded when people do not even make the connection between infection and symptom?</p>
          <p eId="para_1232">One witness called by the State, and I am sure the Department officials will know of this because they seem to know everything else, made a very telling report. He writes:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1233">However, several longitudinal studies have documented the subsequent loss of antibody reactivity over time in those with cleared infection. In the East German anti-D cohort from whom early samples were available for testing, 18 from 43 women who cleared infection became seronegative for antibody over an interval of ranging 8-20 years.</p>

          <from>Ms Lynch</from>
          <p eId="para_1235">The statement is by Professor Peter Simmonds. It continues:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1236">Similarly, 11 from 63 cleared infection over 10 years from infection clearance, and a further 9 from 56 over 3 years in a community based study in Italy, comparable to the loss of antibody in prospectively followed haemophiliacs (3 from 12 over 6-15 years;) and post-transfusion non-A, non-B hepatitis patients (6 from 90 over at most 23 years;). In common with the seropositive individuals with cleared infections (see above), where investigated, none of individuals who became seronegative in these various cohorts showed evidence for ongoing replication of HCV, either from PCR testing of plasma samples, or from liver function test abnormalities attributable to HCV.</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1237">The lack of stored samples from women who received HCV-contaminated anti-D immunoglobulins in Ireland has prevented longitudinal studies of the outcomes of HCV infection comparable to the above studies. However, I am aware of the evidence presented at the HCV Tribunal that several women who received contaminated batches of Irish anti-D immunoglobulins in 1977 or 1978 became jaundiced shortly after prophylaxis (therefore providing evidence for acute infection with HCV), but who are now negative for antibodies to HCV. This is fully consistent with the findings for frequent loss of anti-HCV antibodies in cases of resolved infections.</p>
          <p eId="para_1238">This statement is by somebody who studies the subject for a living and was the State's witness. He says one can clear the infection and the antibodies but the symptoms will persist, but the Minister says they will not. She will only accept the very specific scientific ELISA test. Does she think consultants who testify on behalf of somebody who tests negative are telling lies? Does she not trust her own tribunal to deal with these issues? It is incredible that the Minister for Health and Children should replace a scheme that was working perfectly well with another piece of legislation, thereby retrospectively altering legislation which was hard fought for and was directed at a group of people, both men and women, whom this State infected. Whether we like it or not that is what happened. It infected them because we were not proactive enough in testing blood products.</p>
          <p eId="para_1239">The shutters came down after 20 June. I have asked for sunset clauses in legislation before and have been told they were not necessary but in this case one is applied on the day the Bill was produced and no further claims will be accepted after that date. That is outrageous. We have still not received an explanatory memorandum so I still do not know why it has been done.</p>
          <p eId="para_1240">The people affected constitute very small groups. One is rhesus-negative, pregnant women whose husbands were rhesus-positive. There are also small groups of people who received blood transfusions and who had renal failure.</p>
          <p eId="para_1241">The Tánaiste said €660 million has already been spent. I can see the headlines. People will ask what we are doing. Just over 2,000 people were compensated — that is how small the figure was. The consequences were not minute but the number was very small. The rest of the money will go to pay for the tribunal and legal expenses.</p>
          <p eId="para_1242">This legislation is mean and mealy-mouthed. I cannot find words to describe it. It also limits people who will never go to a tribunal or to the High Court and as a result of this alteration to the hepatitis C compensation tribunal legislation, they will not receive a medical card either. The Bill says to people to test positive after all this time. All the scientific data states that over a period of time, the majority of people will clear the virus and the antibodies. How is one to realise that test? It cannot be done. That test is not fool-proof and, hopefully, with the advance of science, we will have a better test which picks up things at a much lower level.</p>
          <p eId="para_1243">Another witness called by the State spoke about the effectiveness of the ELISA test. Dr. David Foster said, in response to a question about whether the ELISA test would pick up people who had been infected, that "There is a real danger that to exclude a person who cannot show a positive ELISA Test will give rise to injustice". He also said:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1244">I think again it is a question of level and cut off. What happens in the simple ELISA is that patient's serum are allowed to bind to Hepatitis C proteins and the level of binding is then assessed. Whether there is positive or negative depends on a cut-off value and the cut-off value is defined at the level at which the vast majority of people who have active Hepatitis C have a number greater than that, and the vast majority of people who do not have active Hepatitis C are lower than that. So clearly there is a cut-off level.</p>
          <p eId="para_1245">He goes on to state that one could have a lower level and be infected but that one would not test positive with ELISA.</p>
          <p eId="para_1246">I still do not understand why the Government has introduced this legislation. There is paranoia in some Departments that we face an appalling vista and, therefore, we must legislate to restrict it. That appalling vista occurred between 1977 and 1991. I hope we will try to sort out what happened then rather than damn these people once again. This is appalling legislation and I appeal once again to the Tánaiste to abandon it and to come back with the type of Bill these people thought they would get, that is, a comprehensive one dealing with insurance.</p>

          <from>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Mr. S. Power)</from>
          <p eId="para_1248">I am happy to have the opportunity to speak on this very important legislation. The Tánaiste has already explained in detail the provisions of this Bill and commended it to the House. As the Tánaiste said, officials have been in discussion with the four support groups on the details of the Bill and have taken their concerns on board. One of the issues raised by the support groups and which was also referred to by several Deputies was the matter of the ELISA test. As a result, the Tánaiste has decided to table an amendment on Committee Stage to extend the number of tests that can be used to determine eligibility to include RIBA and PCR tests. Like the ELISA test, the RIBA test is also used to diagnose the presence of antibodies to the hepatitis C virus while the PCR test identifies whether the virus itself is present in the individual's bloodstream.</p>
          <p eId="para_1249">In addition, to cater for the development of new and more sophisticated tests in the future, the Tánaiste intends to table an amendment that will allow her to make regulations adding new tests to the ones already specified. As Deputy Lynch mentioned, tests are developing rapidly and she expressed the wish that some new tests might appear in the near future. We are allowing for that should it arise. When the Tánaiste opened today's debate, she acknowledged the contribution of the four hepatitis C support groups — the Irish Haemophilia Society, the Irish Kidney Association, Positive Action and Transfusion Positive — in working with officials on the details of the insurance scheme and thanked them for their significant effort in bringing matters to a conclusion. I reiterate the Tánaiste's sentiments and acknowledge the fine work done by the support groups, not alone in regard to this Bill but in representing their membership so assiduously over the past decade.</p>
          <p eId="para_1250">The Irish Haemophilia Society and the Irish Kidney Association were already in existence when the tragedy of hepatitis C afflicted their members. This gave both societies a new and tremendously difficult challenge to face in supporting their members, who not alone had to cope with the trauma of their underlying condition but had the added burden of another serious illness with which to cope.</p>
          <p eId="para_1251">Following the identification of the links between anti-D and hepatitis C in February 1994, Positive Action was formed later that year to represent the women infected with hepatitis C through the administration of anti-D. As information on the anti-D disaster became known, it became clear that the virus had been transmitted onwards via blood donations, and, as a result, Transfusion Positive was established in 1995 to represent the men, women and children infected with hepatitis C through blood transfusions administered within the State.</p>
          <p eId="para_1252">As we know only too well, hepatitis C does not respect age or gender. Those affected have included men and women, from the very young to the elderly and all ages in between. I am aware that State-acquired hepatitis C is often wrongly associated in the public mind as affecting women only. However three of the four support groups represent men as well as women infected with hepatitis C through blood transfusion and blood products, and their needs are always given due regard. The executive members of all four support groups have always striven to act as advocates on behalf of all the different strands that go to make up their membership, and have always been vocal in representing their interests.</p>
          <p eId="para_1253">From an early date the support groups entered into negotiation with the Minister for Health and Children and officials of the Department. It soon became clear they had a strong and coherent voice that needed be heard. During 1994 and 1995, Positive Action and Transfusion Positive were recognised formally by the Department as the main representative bodies for persons infected through anti-D and through transfusion respectively. That position remains unchanged today.</p>
          <p eId="para_1254">As the tragic effects of the hepatitis C virus became known and more sufferers were identified, the organisations' numbers grew. From the effects caused by hepatitis C came the solidarity of people supporting each other through adversity and working in the best interests of their relatives, friends and fellow members. The position of all four organisations was recognised when the Consultative Council on Hepatitis C was established in 1996, and all four were given a statutory entitlement to places on the council. From its first meeting in 1997 to its most recent meeting earlier this month, the support groups' representatives on the consultative council have worked tirelessly on behalf of their members to ensure their concerns were addressed.</p>
          <p eId="para_1255">The support groups did not confine their advocacy role to negotiations at the national level but undertook to represent their members in their dealings with regional and local services. At hospital and regional level the organisations have interacted with service providers to ensure the needs of their members are recognised and that services are responsive to those needs.</p>
          <p eId="para_1256">Transfusion Positive played a major part in lobbying for improved facilities for children with hepatitis C at Our Lady's Hospital for Sick Children, Crumlin, and this was acknowledged at the opening ceremony last year for the new medical tower at the hospital. To its credit, the organisation was always anxious to ensure that the very best facilities were available to all children with the virus, not only the children it represents. The dissemination of information to parents of children with hepatitis C has also been another area to which Transfusion Positive has made an invaluable contribution.</p>
          <p eId="para_1257">From 1994 onwards, Positive Action developed a strong and responsive organisational structure to support and represent its members. The organisation also developed effective lobbying skills and was instrumental in the establishment of the Finlay tribunal in 1996. The outcome of the tribunal led to a massive overhaul of the Irish Blood Transfusion Service, which is now at the forefront of international developments in transfusion medicine. It is a testimony to how far Positive Action has come and the high esteem in which it is held that its founder member, Ms Jane O'Brien, was appointed by the Tánaiste as a member of the board of the Irish Blood Transfusion Service.</p>
          <p eId="para_1258">The Irish Kidney Association was already faced with the enormous challenges posed by renal disease when some of its members were affected by the doubly cruel blow of infection with hepatitis C. Despite the thankfully small number of renal patients affected by the virus, the association from the beginning recognised the importance of providing professional counselling for this cohort and has been at the forefront of patient support and advocacy for its membership. In addition, the critical contribution of organ donation in giving new life to both renal and liver patients was always a particular focus of the Irish Kidney Association. Its chief executive officer is tireless in his efforts to promote organ donation awareness nationwide, not alone for the benefit of hepatitis C patients, but for the benefit of all those who need a transplant now or may need one in the future. The continued success of the Irish liver transplant programme, operated through St. Vincent's Hospital in Dublin, is a testimony to the sterling work performed by the Irish Kidney Association in promoting organ donation.</p>
          <p eId="para_1259">The special contribution of the Irish Haemophilia Society to the support of its members with hepatitis C cannot be over-emphasised. Nor can any of us comprehend the depth of the tragedy suffered by its members, having first become aware that so many of them were infected with HIV to then find that some were co-infected with hepatitis C. Others, having escaped the scourge of HIV, found they had instead been infected with hepatitis C.</p>
          <p eId="para_1260">The disaster which befell the Irish Haemophilia Society and its members has been well documented in the media and through the Lindsay Tribunal, but this is only part of its story. Most people will not be aware that despite, or perhaps because of the suffering they have endured, the Irish Haemophilia Society has played a major role in working to improve the lot of persons with haemophilia not alone in this country but around the world. The society is currently twinned with its counterpart in Bosnia and encourages other Western countries to participate in twinning arrangements with their less fortunate colleagues. The former chairman of the society, who for many years was also chairman of the World Haemophilia Federation, acts as a roving ambassador to haemophilia societies in some of the poorest countries in the world. He works tirelessly to assist them in gaining the most basic services for their members.</p>
          <p eId="para_1261">One of the hallmarks of all the support groups is the important role played by family members, sometimes as active members of the organisation or else providing invaluable support behind the scenes. Today, as well as acknowledging the role of the support groups, it is also timely to pay tribute to the families affected by the virus and to recognise the debt we all owe to these families. I hope the insurance scheme introduced in the Bill will go some way towards giving autonomy back to these families and allow them to avail of the mortgage and life assurance that are part and parcel of the essential supports every family needs to protect the financial security of its members on the same basis as the rest of the community.</p>
          <p eId="para_1262">First and foremost, however, the provision of this insurance scheme is a public acknowledgment of the needs and entitlements of the men, women and children infected with hepatitis C through blood and blood products. The credit for this must go to the chairpersons and executives of the four organisations, who have worked so hard and achieved so much.</p>
          <p eId="para_1263">There is no doubt this is an important measure that will provide support to people diagnosed with hepatitis C or HIV as a result of receiving contaminated blood or blood products from the State. For years it has been obvious that infected people's inability to buy life assurance and mortgage protection policies created additional difficulties to those they were already experiencing. The Bill addresses an inequity that has existed for several years. There has been criticism of certain aspects of the Bill but there can be little doubt that the scheme will be of great benefit to the persons infected with hepatitis C and HIV administered in State blood and blood products. I hope the amendments proposed by the Tánaiste will address some of the concerns expressed inside and outside the House in recent times.</p>

        <speech by="#MJNolan" eId="spk_531">
          <from>Mr. Nolan</from>
          <p eId="para_1266">I welcome the opportunity to speak on this legislation. Many people have been affected by contaminated blood, not only women, as many previous speakers indicated, but also men. This has had a catastrophic effect on the individuals concerned and their families and friends. While the Minister's proposals will not compensate them for the grief and suffering they have endured, it will go some way towards addressing some of the problems with which they must deal during their lifetime. There is no cure for this infection and the State must accept full responsibility for it and in some way compensate the victims.</p>
          <p eId="para_1267">The purpose of the Bill is to provide reasonable access to the insurance market for those infected by contaminated blood products who cannot obtain life or travel insurance and to provide that the Government will pay the balance where individuals are able to get some degree of insurance but the insurance companies have loaded their premiums. Insurance companies are not to blame for loading premiums in some cases as they are commercial entities for which the bottom line is the need to stay in business.</p>
          <p eId="para_1268">The Government is accepting its responsibility and I hope the House will pass the legislation. I am also pleased to note that the Minister will accept on Committee or Report Stage the inclusion of additional tests to determine eligibility for the scheme and that it will be possible, through ministerial regulation, to accommodate any new tests which become available in the future.</p>
          <p eId="para_1269">It is important to place on record the support provided to the individuals affected and their families by various support groups through professional counselling. I am aware at first hand of the impact this infection has had on the unfortunate individuals who have had to deal with this tragedy.</p>
          <p eId="para_1270">For many years, people infected with hepatitis C have made a reasonable case that a method of addressing the insurance difficulties they and their spouses have faced has not been accommodated. No particular solution to these difficulties was readily available. The Government, through this legislation, is introducing an internationally accepted system of tests used by many other countries in assessing eligibility for the various benefits available to those who have suffered infection. Many of the individuals infected by contaminated blood products find it almost impossible to obtain any type of insurance. The Government accepts its responsibility and is taking action in this regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_1271">In order to take a consistent approach, the Government agreed that a hepatitis C diagnosis should be defined in terms of a scientific test. A number years ago we had the scandal of the Army deafness cases when a redress scheme was abused. I would not like this episode, which I have raised in the House previously, to be repeated in any other case. While I am not implying that anyone will abuse the scheme proposed in the legislation, I observed how the legal profession abused a scheme established by the Government in a genuine attempt to help individuals who had suffered badly as a result of their membership of the Defence Forces. The scheme was hijacked by a number of solicitors' firms which trawled the country in search of former members of the Defence Forces. They then effectively told those people that they had a hearing disability and should apply for compensation under the scheme.</p>
          <p eId="para_1272">The Government, through this legislation, is trying to establish a fair system for diagnosis for individuals infected by hepatitis C and make their life a little easier. To ensure the support scheme is operated in a fair and equitable manner and those determining eligibility under the scheme use clear, consistent criteria, the Government has decided that the diagnosis will be determined by means of an internationally accepted test. The Minister of State, Deputy Seán Power, indicated that future Ministers will be able, by means of regulation, to introduce new tests as they are developed.</p>
          <p eId="para_1273">Since 1997, it has been clear that the inability of infected persons to obtain life insurance or mortgage protection cover has added further to the great damage they have already suffered. This was one of the issues raised by the consultative council on hepatitis C from its earliest meetings in March 1997. Determining an appropriate scheme for diagnosis is difficult and we must look to internationally accepted criteria to determine eligibility.</p>
          <p eId="para_1274">I hope the House will accept the Bill on the basis that it marks a further step in trying to make life a little easier for the unfortunate individuals infected by contaminated blood products and their families. This is not, however, the end of the process as the House will enact many more Bills and regulations to accommodate the needs of the families in question.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#JerryCowleyIND" eId="spk_532">
          <from>Dr. Cowley</from>
          <p eId="para_1275">I am pleased to speak on the Bill, which shows what has been the position of several Governments on this critical issue affecting people's health. It is symptomatic of much that has occurred and tells a sad and sorry story. In the early 1990s the Irish Blood Transfusion Service, as it was then known, diagnosed a number of people with hepatitis C but did not inform them immediately, which put the individuals in question and their families at great risk. In some cases, people were not told for years that they were infected. This issue was the subject of four legal cases, one of which is before the High Court. Its legacy includes the deaths of at least 88 haemophiliacs who contracted HIV from contaminated blood products and the infection of more than 1,000 people with hepatitis C from infected batches of anti-D.</p>
          <p eId="para_1276">The deaths of 88 haemophiliacs is terrible and regrettable. We learnt today that, since Christmas, eight people infected by the State with hepatitis C or HIV have died and that these individuals, two of whom were women aged 48 and 49 years, respectively, had no life insurance at the time of their deaths. Either they could not obtain life insurance or were quoted premiums that were so high as to be out of their grasp. No company wanted to provide them with life insurance cover because they were considered too high a risk on the grounds of a disability, namely, hepatitis C or HIV. Instead of the State protecting their constitutional rights to bodily integrity, as it is obliged to do under the Constitution, the agents of the State killed them by giving them infected blood product which caused the predicament in which they found themselves. I welcome the provisions in this Bill rectifying the life insurance position. It is the least the State should do. The only pity is that it has taken so long, nine years, which is scandalous. As a medical student in 1991 I went to the United States on a J1 visa to try to earn some extra money. I remember seeing advertisements on the streets of New York seeking blood donations in exchange for dollars. Everybody knew that drug addicts donated blood regularly as a revenue earner to feed their drug habit. It was, therefore, no surprise that HIV and hepatitis C turned up in donated blood. I am glad compensation has been paid to some of the victims. The Irish Government has paid €660 million in legal fees and compensation so far to some 2,000 victims of the contaminated blood scandal. Although that is a lot of money, it is only money and cannot give those people back what has been taken from them. It has wrecked people's lives and health and taken loved ones away from their families, mothers, fathers, sons, daughters, aunts, uncles, grandmothers and grandfathers.</p>
          <p eId="para_1277">It is terrible that so much money had to be paid because of negligence and the failure of the State to do what it should have done. It is remarkable how so much harm was done by people not doing what they were supposed to do. I worked in Mayo General Hospital as an obstetric house doctor around the time the infected batches came out. One of my tasks as a junior hospital doctor in obstetrics and gynaecology was to inject rhesus negative women after the births of their children with the anti-D blood product to kill any cells of the baby's blood that might have crossed from the afterbirth to the mother, and which could sensitise her to the baby's blood and make antibodies which could affect future pregnancies. This injection has eliminated a serious condition. However, when one has such an injection one expects it to be safe and when it turns out that some were lethal injections with such a terrible cost to people's lives, one must question what happened and how it was allowed.</p>
          <p eId="para_1278">Little did we realise that certain batches of this blood produce were infected and that the agents of the State were aware of the international concerns for some time but did not take the proper steps to ensure infected products did not get into this country. Unfortunately infected products did in and it is a matter of public record through the Lindsay inquiry that a catalogue of failures, neglect and inadequacies was perpetrated by the then Irish Blood Transfusion Service Board. Unfortunately most of the victims are women who were infected with hepatitis C when they received the infected blood products in this way. Approximately 1,000 of the victims were recipients of anti-D blood products and 700, mainly renal patients and haemophiliacs, received blood transfusions or blood clotting factors. It is terrible how this happened and how the victims, their families and the taxpayer must live with the consequences of somebody else's mistake. It is unacceptable that this Bill contains changes of which the advocacy groups concerned were not aware until Tuesday of last week.</p>
          <p eId="para_1279">I laud the work of Transfusion Positive, Positive Action, the Irish Haemophilia Society and the Irish Kidney Association on behalf of victims and their families. When I met haemophiliacs in my professional career as a GP I was always affected by the fact that people were born with this affliction and that if they fell, instead of receiving just a bruise, they could suffer bleeding into their joints because they lacked a basic clotting factor. When this happened it was a terrible situation and that bleeding had to be stopped with an injection. Those young children were always very brave. To think that some of them received a lethal product which would lead to their deaths affected me. If it affected me, what must it have done to their families to lose a child in that way? For haemophiliacs to be affected like this was unforgivable.</p>
          <p eId="para_1280">The main change causing problems includes an amendment to the Hepatitis C Compensation Tribunal Act, which requires all new applicants to the tribunal to undergo stringent scientific tests to prove their condition instead of relying on the word of a specialist hepatitis C doctor. I note the Tánaiste's addition of the other tests, which is important. This area is not as cut and dried as people might think. It is still a grey and evolving area and epidemiological information is still coming to light about the value of these tests. A medical colleague informed me that he was surprised when a patient of his tested positive for hepatitis C, but two subsequent tests proved negative. This raises the argument that if one can get a false positive test, one can get a false negative test. Most infected people remain infected until treated. Some have lost the virus from their systems but they will still retain antibodies. There are exceptional circumstances where somebody who has contracted hepatitis C can have a negative antibody or ELISA test result. For example, in a health worker who contracted the hepatitis C virus from a needle stick injury one could monitor the liver function test data beginning to rise as evidence of infection. By intervening early with the antiviral drug, Interferon, in theory at least, it is possible that the immune process could be prevented so that no antibodies are produced, resulting in a negative test, even though hepatitis C has been contracted. In other words, somebody could be infected with hepatitis C but form no antibodies. Therefore the tests are uncertain and if there is doubt the benefit of the doubt should be given to the afflicted person.</p>
          <p eId="para_1281">There is a human face to this. I have a constituent who is badly afflicted with hepatitis C and even though her consultant hepatologist is prepared to swear or give evidence that this person has hepatitis C, based on repeated clinical examinations, this is not acceptable. It should be acceptable and I have called for it to be acceptable on a number of occasions in this Chamber. Although the person to whom I refer is desperately ill, she cannot even get a medical card. This is a disgrace because she and her family are going through hell on earth. This lady has a young family and is in great need. She is in and out of hospital with various afflictions, all related to her hepatitis. She is constantly in need of the services of her GP and consultant hepatologist and she must bear these crippling costs. She and her family have enough to worry about trying to keep her well and dealing with the fact that she is ill and unable to do the things any mother should be able to do with her children, to take part in their play and be with them as they grow up. This lady is in a poor state and should not have to worry about the terrible financial hardship she is undergoing.</p>
          <p eId="para_1282">This situation must be resolved. Humanity cries out for people like this to be given the support they need. I have pleaded with the Tánaiste to reconsider her stance on providing free health care for this poor lady and the estimated 100 women who are severely affected by hepatitis C and who have not tested positive, as this lady has not, but have every other manifestation of the illness. This is a small number of women so affected, but their need is great. The Tánaiste has informed me that while she is sympathetic to the women, she cannot support an extension to the current eligibility requirements. Why not? It has been said the Tánaiste is a very definite person. She does not do the nuances very well, however. I do not know whether this is correct but this is a definite situation and it is critical to look after these ill women, including my desperately ill constituent.</p>
          <p eId="para_1283">Haemophiliacs have got a raw deal. What has happened to them is unparalleled in any group and whatever can be done to help and support them should be done. It is very unfair to be born with such an illness but no words can describe what has happened to these haemophiliacs and their families. It is a gross injustice.</p>
          <p eId="para_1284">The State does not face up to situations it should face but tries to fight cases, such as that of Mrs. McCole, which cry out for justice that is not done. Instead, there is an attempt to deny, or worse, to fight someone who seeks justice and has a right to be treated fairly and with equity. This applies also in respect of autism. The money used to defend the indefensible should be spent on services.</p>
          <p eId="para_1285">I calculated from replies I received from the Department of Health and Children that approximately €8 million of taxpayers' money was spent on fighting the parents of children with autism who were trying to get health services for their children. I asked a similar question of the Department of Education and Science and found that approximately €12 million has been spent on fighting parents who were trying to secure special education for their children with special needs. Parents will do anything to ensure that their children receive the equivalent of a normal education, or as near to that as possible. Instead of spending that money on providing services for those people with special needs or children with autism, the Government spent it on trying to deny those children the right to the health and educational services they need and deserve. That amounts to €20 million, which is a large sum.</p>
          <p eId="para_1286">The Hepatitis C Compensation Tribunal (Amendment) Bill 2006 represents people infected with hepatitis C through infected blood and blood products administered by the State. The problems relate to sections 1, 2 and 6. In the past all groups were consulted prior to the publication of an amendment Bill but in this case it was sprung on them on 20 June for debate today, with the result that there is no accountability to the groups involved or the infected people they represent.</p>
          <p eId="para_1287">The groups feel that the new exclusion of consortium for partners of sufferers is underhand. In 2002 the then Minister for Health and Children introduced an entitlement for the spouses and partners of people with hepatitis C to claim for compensation for the loss of consortium. This morning the Minister, Deputy Harney, said that these changes do not discriminate against children, but the groups argue strongly against this. Today's children, tomorrow's adults, will have no safety net for their future partners.</p>
          <p eId="para_1288">Hepatitis C is a debilitating disease which can be more or less dormant for many years but a bout or flare-up of the symptoms can leave a person bedridden. Such a person, infected by the State, or his or her partner, should receive compensation. Similarly, it is wrong that those who do not test positive but have all the manifestations of hepatitis C, which the consultant hepatologist is prepared to state, can be denied the compensation they deserve and require.</p>
          <p eId="para_1289">The groups feel that this exclusion concerns money, not accountability. It was decided behind closed doors. There was no dialogue or debate with the people affected and the groups feel insulted that the Government is saying sorry but not showing regret. They maintain that the Minister has been in consultation with the relevant insurance groups and is following advice. She is aware that many people remain to be diagnosed and the floodgates have not yet opened. They say, "Infected by the State; the future will now not be the same as the past."</p>
          <p eId="para_1290">The ELISA test is the current hepatitis C determining test. A woman who last Monday tested negative on the ELISA test but has all the symptoms, and written confirmation from the then Irish Blood Transfusion Board that she received infected blood, is not entitled to compensation. The 100 women who have all the symptoms of hepatitis C but not a positive ELISA test will not be considered under this new legislation.</p>
          <p eId="para_1291">The Minister wants all testing based on the results of the ELISA test. A positive result will be the only form of recognition of the disease, as well as the RNA test which she has added, and other tests. To get this through quickly the Minister has verbally confirmed that those already in the system testing negative but with all symptoms will be compensated. I hope that the Minister will do as much as she can to try to include those 100 women who are not being compensated. They cannot even get medical cards.</p>
          <p eId="para_1292">In a reply to a parliamentary question on 7 March 2006 the Minister said that in September 2005 she told the groups representing those infected that they had her full support. Where is that support now? In January 2002 the Irish Blood Transfusion Board stated on paper that 64,500 women tested negative for hepatitis C but that 19,000 may have received potentially infected product.</p>

        <speech by="#SeanFleming" eId="spk_533">
          <from>Mr. Fleming</from>
          <p eId="para_1294">I welcome the opportunity to speak on the Hepatitis C Compensation Tribunal (Amendment) Bill 2006. Earlier this month the Tánaiste announced the publication of this Bill to establish a statutory scheme to address the insurance difficulties experienced by persons infected with hepatitis C and HIV through the administration within the State of blood and blood products. This important measure addresses the problem faced by these people of being unable to purchase mortgage protection and life assurance policies. These people were infected through no fault of their own. They received services from the State and were entitled to expect the highest possible standards. The Oireachtas on behalf of the State and various bodies on behalf the Oireachtas let those people down. Many were affected as a result. It is right that the State face up to its legal and moral responsibilities in this issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_1295">The Government acknowledges in the strongest possible terms that the infection of people with contaminated blood products was catastrophic for them and their families. While no monetary support or compensation can ever repair the damage, Ireland is doing more for victims compared with other countries in similar circumstances. No other country has introduced an insurance scheme. This Bill shows that Ireland is committed to working with the victims of infection to provide all the supports possible for them.</p>
          <p eId="para_1296">The scheme will cover the insurance risk of the 1,700 or more people who are entitled to avail of insurance products, regardless of other medical conditions they may have, as long as they pay the standard premium that an uninfected person of the same age and gender would pay. Such considerations might sound quite materialistic, but they are practical things which have to be taken into account if victims are to lead lives which are as normal as possible, enjoy normal facilities and have the security of insurance that other people have.</p>
          <p eId="para_1297">The enactment of this Bill will provide for a third form of recompense. The first form of recompense is compensation from the Hepatitis C and HIV Compensation Tribunal, which to date has awarded over €660 million to approximately 2,000 people. The second form of recompense is the special health card, which has been mentioned by various people during this debate. The cost of health care under the Health (Amendment) Act 1996 is approximately €15 million per annum. A third form of recompense — the life assurance support scheme — will be put in place with the enactment of this Bill. It is estimated that, over its lifetime, the scheme will cost approximately €90 million, which is small fry. It is not as if we will be providing €90 million in any one year — we will be providing €90 million over several decades. I expect the scheme will cost between €1 million and €5 million in any given year. The annual cost is not a serious issue. When one considers the State's moral responsibility in this regard, it is clear that the annual cost is not worthy of a row or a detailed debate. Even if the cost transpires to be greater than that currently envisaged, it should be borne in mind that the State would be meeting a significantly higher cost if it was only a money issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_1298">The Tánaiste said clearly earlier today that the Government has agreed, in the interest of having a consistent approach to all these supports, that "a hepatitis C diagnosis", under the Hepatitis C Compensation Tribunal Acts 1997 and 2002 and the Health (Amendment) Act 1996, should be defined in terms of a scientific test, known as the ELISA test. Alternatively, "a hepatitis C diagnosis" can also be determined if the person displayed symptoms of acute infection with jaundice within 16 weeks of the administration of an infective agent. I will come back to that aspect of the matter. The Tánaiste has indicated that some amendments to the Bill will be proposed on Committee and Report Stages, for example to deal with the ELISA test. I look forward to the relevant part of the legislation being broadened so it does not refer specifically to that test only. I understand it will be possible, as time goes by, to introduce regulations to make variations to the new testing regime.</p>
          <p eId="para_1299">The symptoms associated with hepatitis C include tiredness, aches and pains and depression. Many such symptoms are common to a number of conditions which are not associated with hepatitis C. It has been decided, to ensure the support scheme operates in a fair and equitable manner and that those determining eligibility under the scheme use clear and consistent criteria, that diagnosis will be determined by means of an internationally accepted test. A similar scientific definition of hepatitis C diagnosis is used in other jurisdictions, like the UK and Canada, where compensation schemes operate. Ireland is the first country to introduce an insurance scheme for victims in these circumstances. We will take further steps in respect of the various tests. I am sure the Tánaiste, who has been listening carefully to people over recent days, will make some movement in that regard. I cannot say at this stage how far she will be able to go. I am pleased that some amendments will be made when the Dáil debates this matter further tomorrow.</p>
          <p eId="para_1300">It should be noted that the expert group on hepatitis C, which is chaired by the chief medical officer of the Department of Health and Children and includes leading liver consultants and a member of Positive Action, agreed in 1998 that eligibility for the Health (Amendment) Act card should be determined on the basis of a positive diagnostic test for hepatitis C. Deputy Cowley has used his medical experience to tell the House about the cases of people who were given false diagnoses on foot of various tests. A positive reading is given in some cases when that should not be the case. In other cases, a negative reading is given when that is not accurate. It is important that we do not restrict ourselves to one particular test. Technology moves on as the years pass. We should provide for the flexibility to deal with changing circumstances.</p>
          <p eId="para_1301">I would like to speak about the question of consortium. The Bill proposes that compensation for loss of consortium will be awarded to the spouses and partners of infected people if the relationships commenced before the diagnosis of hepatitis C or HIV became known. New partners or spouses of infected people who knowingly entered such relationships after the diagnosis of hepatitis C became known will be unable to claim damages for loss of consortium. However, other headings of claim for compensation by persons in this category, such as loss of earnings, loss of society and post-traumatic stress, will not be affected by the amendment. I ask the Tánaiste to examine this provision in a humane manner, if possible. When I spoke to a representative of the Irish Haemophilia Society during my preparations for today's debate, I was disappointed to learn about the problems in this regard. Given that we have a moral responsibility to people who were infected by the State through no fault of their own, the essence of what we should be trying to do is to allow such people to lead the rest of their lives in as normal a manner as possible, just like the rest of us can do.</p>
          <p eId="para_1302">People may not have been diagnosed with hepatitis C or HIV before they entered a relationship. This Bill is saying, essentially, that if they knew before they entered the relationship that they had such a diagnosis, they entered the relationship at their own risk. That is not fair or moral. One will probably find well-paid legal experts who will say it is legal, but one could also find even better-paid legal experts who say it is not legal. The legal experts will make fortunes in the Four Courts, while people suffer as a result of this legislation. I have a big problem with our tendency to deal with issues like this in this manner. The legal approach often over-rides what I call the human approach. I ask the Tánaiste to think about this provision over the course of the night. If this matter is contested in the courts at some future stage, I am afraid people will think the legislation was not safe.</p>
          <p eId="para_1303">I am not a legal person. I am sure the legal people will contradict flatly what I am saying. I am speaking as an ordinary person who was elected to this House to represent the people. I believe people who were infected in this way are entitled to the maximum support from the State. It is not fair to tell people who know they have hepatitis C that if they enter a future relationship, they will do so at their own risk. If the State takes such an approach, it will condemn such people to lonely lives. I hope this matter can be revisited in the short time available to the Dáil before it passes this legislation. If it is not possible to come up with a wording that deals specifically with the point I am making, I hope the Tánaiste will provide in this Bill for the power to make regulations so these matters can be dealt with by statutory instrument after people have had time to consider and debate them further. The Tánaiste is anxious to have the Bill enacted so that as many people as possible who are deprived of access to the insurance market because they are infected with hepatitis C or HIV can avail of insurance products. I expect the Bill will be accepted by the House over the next day or so, before being considered by the Seanad in the coming days.</p>
          <p eId="para_1304">I refer to a document that I, like most Deputies, received from the Irish Haemophilia Society, the Irish Kidney Association, Positive Action and Transfusion Positive, which represent people who were infected by hepatitis C and HIV through infected blood and blood products which were administered by the State. The groups have said this Bill makes "fundamental amendments to the Hepatitis C Compensation Act 1997 which will significantly limit the categories of persons entitled to make claims for compensation and for provision under the health code". They also point out that they were not informed of these changes until recent days. I understood this legislation was primarily intended to deal with the issue of insurance, but we seem to be back-tracking to some extent by making some fundamental changes to the eligibility criteria. I thought such issues had been dealt with in previous Acts.</p>
          <p eId="para_1305">This Bill proposes that people infected with hepatitis C are to be identified solely by scientific tests, whereas currently a clinical diagnosis of hepatitis C is accepted by the tribunal and the High Court and for all other purposes such as entitlement to health provision. Given the Oireachtas has been content before now to stand over a clinical diagnosis as being valid in the High Court and the tribunal, I cannot understand why we are now saying that position will no longer hold from 20 June. I do not think we should be revisiting previously accepted positions on these issues. My intervention will not necessarily change the Tánaiste's opinion, but I ask her to reconsider her approach and to give herself some extra space by allowing for regulations to be used if these issues need to be revisited, but it is not deemed necessary to introduce further new legislation. The Tánaiste and Minister for Health and Children has proposed that in some cases, although a person who was infected through an identified infected blood product, such as anti-D, and had symptoms compatible with a hepatitis C infection, he or she will no longer be able to establish an entitlement to compensation on health provision. I hope this provision will be reconsidered. There was an entitlement for spouses and partners of hepatitis C and HIV sufferers to make claims for compensation for loss of consortium. The Bill proposes to exclude certain categories of persons from such an entitlement, for example, the spouse or partner of a young person infected at birth. That is unfair on those infected at birth through no fault of their own, or that of their mothers or the maternity hospitals.</p>
          <p eId="para_1306">Without going back over the Bridget McCole situation, if our society has learned anything, it is that the legalistic approach should not dictate the normal Christian values to look after those who, through no fault of their own, have a particular problem. There will be an opportunity on Committee Stage tomorrow for the Tánaiste and Minister for Health and Children to explain this provision and give a humane response as opposed to a legalistic one. She has agreed to allow for extra tests, other than the ELISA test. This is welcome as it is inevitable that progress will be made in testing. Provision should be made to take such developments into account. The thrust of the hepatitis issue will continue for many more years.</p>
          <p eId="para_1307">Deputy Cowley referred to the issue of legal fees. The State has already paid out €660 million in this case. How much of that was in legal fees or was it all direct compensation to the people affected? Deputy Cowley highlighted the legal fees for special educational needs for which the State has paid €20 million. I am not sure if his figure is accurate but it certainly is more than €10 million. He argued that the State spent this money preventing people gaining access to special educational needs facilities to which their children were entitled. I disagree with his assertion. Recently, the Oireachtas Committee on Finance and the Public Service examined this area with the Office of the Chief State Solicitor. I found it perturbing that the State's legal bill was one sixth of the costs being submitted by the private solicitors on behalf of their clients.</p>
          <p eId="para_1308">The Chief State Solicitor's office made it clear that the extent of fees being charged by private solicitors for their clients was a barrier to the conclusion of cases. There was agreement between the State and the families on the required special educational needs for the children concerned. However, some solicitors insisted on not letting their clients settle cases until they received what came to six times the fees they are entitled to. We must pay attention to solicitors overcharging and preying on those with special needs. Some seek to extract the maximum amount of money from the State with little regard to the special needs of the children concerned. The same occurred with the army deafness claims in which legal fees came to 50% of the total compensation package.</p>
          <p eId="para_1309">Recently at the Committee of Public Accounts it was asked if some of these schemes are less compensation for victims and more a gravy train for the legal profession. This is a matter that must be addressed by the House soon. I am glad that the Taoiseach and the Minister for Finance are conducting a detailed assessment of all legal costs being paid by the State to ensure it is being done properly.</p>
          <p eId="para_1310">The insurance scheme will provide certain types of insurance to claimants who fall into the following categories: hepatitis C-infected anti-D recipients, hepatitis C-infected transfusion recipients, HIV-infected recipients of relevant products, the children or spouses of eligible persons with hepatitis C or HIV who have themselves been diagnosed positive for the virus, a parent, brother or sister of an infected person who is himself or herself diagnosed with hepatitis C or HIV infection, and certain other claimants to which the Minister extends eligibility for compensation by means of regulation made under section 9 of the 1997 Act. The regulation also specifies the category of those eligible for the insurance scheme. It includes those refused the relevant insurance on the grounds that they have been diagnosed positive with hepatitis C or HIV, those whom the administrator reasonably believes would be refused if they applied for insurance or those who have been refused unless they pay a higher premium than persons of a similar age and gender who have been not diagnosed positive with hepatitis C and HIV.</p>
          <p eId="para_1311">It is important to note an administrator will deal with the scheme. Approximately 1,700 people are affected and will be calling on this fund to assist them to pay for insurance cover entirely or incrementally. The legislation gives full details on the administrator and the conditions on the establishing the administrator. There is provision for the indexation of payments. Mortgage and remortgage protection and travel insurance have been included in the Bill and will be dealt with by regulation. There will be a time limit for applications, phased payments and provisions for those over 50 years of age up to 75 years of age. Other medical conditions will have to be factored in. Information must be made available — on reasonable grounds — to the administrator. The administrator will regularly report to the Oireachtas on the operation of the scheme. This is important in the interests of accountability and will allow Members to check on an intermittent basis if the scheme is working as intended.</p>
          <p eId="para_1312">I welcome the Bill but there are several matters that must be addressed. If they are not sorted out in the next 24 hours, I would like them to be dealt with by regulation. It is important that the 1,700 people waiting on this legislation see it passed by the Houses before the summer recess to allow them to proceed with these aspects of their lives like everyone else.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#JanOSullivan" eId="spk_534">
          <from>Ms O’Sullivan</from>
          <p eId="para_1313">I support the amendment moved by Deputy McManus. I do so because of the issues that have been raised by other speakers. Having listened to the last two Fianna Fáil Members, Deputies Callely and Fleming, it is a pity the Taoiseach has quashed the backbenchers' committee which wanted to have an input into Government policy. If the views of those two Deputies were taken into account, the Bill would not have been introduced and the Tánaiste and Minister for Health and Children would have had to examine the issues raised.</p>
          <p eId="para_1314">Today should be a day of celebration for those who have had to fight so hard and who have been so abused by the State through the administration of the anti-D product. As Deputy McManus said, they were poisoned by the State. It should have been a day of success for those people because they have negotiated long and hard to have an insurance scheme implemented. The legislation should have been the culmination of their hard work. They have had to fight the State all the way for many years.</p>
          <p eId="para_1315">Today, they find themselves back in that position. That is not as it should be. As Deputy Fleming said, if the Tánaiste and Minister for Health and Children was in touch with the human aspect of this issue, she would not then have introduced sections 1, 2 and 6. It would then be about the result of the negotiations and consultations that went on with the four organisations concerned, the Irish Haemophilia Society, the Irish Kidney Association, Positive Action and Transfusion Positive. Unfortunately, the Government has unilaterally introduced these other aspects that are in the legislation which the four organisations did not see until it was too late and we are faced with the current problem. They did not see the Bill until 20 June this year. Despite the fine words spoken by the Tánaiste, this is not consultation, this is not what those groups thought they were getting because these elements have been introduced in spite of what they stated they wanted all along.</p>
          <p eId="para_1316">I received a number of phone calls on this issue, as I am sure did other Members. I quote from an e-mail I got today from a constituent:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1317">I am one of your constituents . . . and I would like you to contest on my behalf the Bill that An Tánaiste, Mary Harney, is putting before the Dáil this 29 June 2006. The insurance scheme for hep C-HIV has answered all of our needs but she has added amendments to the Health Amendment Acts 1997 and 2002 to the Bill without giving us hep C people any notice. She is effectively offering us insurance coverage at the cost of the dilution of the Health Amendment Acts 1997 and 2002. This is a very serious concern to those of us State-infected with hep C.</p>
          <p eId="para_1318">That is the view of one person, and we have all spoken to representatives of the four associations.</p>
          <p eId="para_1319">The ELISA test was highlighted in the course of today's debate. I was in the Chair when Deputy Twomey, who is a medical doctor, made his contribution and he gave a clinical analysis of the faults in the Bill in terms of the ELISA test. In his contribution, the Minister of State, Deputy Seán Power, referred to the fact that amendments in regard to further tests will be tabled. He mentioned the RIBA test and the PCR test. He also stated that regulations would add further new tests. That is to be welcomed as progress in the sense that at least the Tánaiste understands there is a problem in this regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_1320">I am sure Deputy Twomey would be better able than I to respond on this issue. As I understand it, this does not address the central problem, namely, that clinical diagnosis is being rejected in the sense that, in terms of the legislation, it will not be part of the decision-making process. That is what is wrong. I am not a doctor, but I would expect any medical judgment on an illness to include a clinical diagnosis. We have been told that these tests do not identify the presence of infection in all cases.</p>
          <p eId="para_1321">The four organisations issued a press statement this evening, which states: "The groups ... have rejected the arguments of the Tánaiste ... in the Dáil today." It also states: "The groups have pointed to passages in the Finlay report ... where it is stated that it is possible for a person to be infected with hepatitis C and subsequently lose detectable virus and indeed detectable antibodies." Deputy Twomey made this point this morning. It goes on to state: "The ELISA test is supposed to detect antibodies but as Finlay confirms it does not always do so." I understand that the other tests, as proposed in the forthcoming amendments, also do not always detect antibodies. The statement continues:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1322">The groups have also pointed to the opinions of consultant hepatologists who have said that in patients who have been exposed to the virus there may be low levels of antibodies that do not reach the level of cut-off in the standard test. In such cases the hepatitis C compensation tribunal has been willing in the small number of cases in which it has arisen to date to accept the evidence of a consultant hepatologist of a clinical diagnosis of hepatitis C as entitling a claimant to compensation.</p>
          <p eId="para_1323">That is the point made by Deputy Fleming, that the compensation tribunal accepted clinical diagnosis, yet the Government will not accept it in the context of the Bill. I urge the Tánaiste to accept the evidence of highly qualified medical experts that indicates she is wrong in what she is doing in the legislation.</p>
          <p eId="para_1324">My colleague, Deputy Lynch, pointed out that the draft Bill referred to by the Tánaiste this morning was drafted in 1995, before further information became available in the context of the Finlay report. The Tánaiste appears to have come before the House with a legalistic opinion in regard to these three points. She has not taken on board the human element involved and the fact that we are talking about a number of people who have symptoms, who have been infected by the State and who are entitled to be included in the insurance scheme. The Tánaiste should listen to the voices on every side of the House, the organisations concerned and the individuals concerned, who are not in this small group of 100 or so people who will be covered because they have tested in accordance with the requirement, but who are concerned for the other people who will be excluded if the Tánaiste gets her way. It is essential that the Tánaiste listens to the voices that have been raised.</p>
          <p eId="para_1325">As has been pointed out by other speakers, only 2,000 people benefited from the money that has already been expended. A large proportion of that money went on legal fees and the costs of running the tribunals. It is disingenuous to suggest that a great deal of money has been expended and paid out to the people concerned.</p>
          <p eId="para_1326">Like many Members of the House, I know people who are directly affected and I know the effect it has had on their lives. These people have to plan everything they do to have the energy to do it. These people have to make sure they get the necessary rest so they will have the energy to do something with their day. This can be as simple as baking a cake, looking after their children or picking children up from school. Their illness is a recurring factor in all aspects of their lives on a daily basis. While in some cases people may not have tested positive in the tests to which we have referred, they have been affected and they have the clinical symptoms. That is the human side of the issue. In most cases, the people directly involved cannot hold down jobs and they cannot do many of the normal things other people take for granted.</p>
          <p eId="para_1327">Before I come to the issue of loss of consortium, I wish to refer to an article which indicates that the HSE has cut funding for the "look-back reassurance programme" that has been carried out by the Blood Bank, which is designed specifically to identify women at risk of hepatitis C from anti-D. Is cost-cutting at work here? Is that what this is all about? If this programme, which is specifically aimed at trying to find out if there are still women who were infected by anti-D, is affected by cost-cutting, is this legislation also about saving money? If that is the case, it is despicable because it is saving money at the expense of a vulnerable sector. I welcome the fact that the Minister of State, Deputy Brian Lenihan, is shaking his head.</p>

          <from>Ms O’Sullivan</from>
          <p eId="para_1331">I would welcome if someone dealt with the matter because it is strange that the specific programme investigating the infection of women with hepatitis C who were given anti-D is no longer being funded. I do not know if funding is being cut for other Blood Bank programmes. It would be interesting to know what is the position. The fact that it is this particular programme certainly looks pointed.</p>
          <p eId="para_1332">Many speakers referred to the issue of loss of consortium which is dealt with in section 2. I find this provision extraordinarily mean. This suggests that if a person was married or had been living with someone for a significant length of time when they were diagnosed, they are entitled to be included. However, if a young person has not had any relationship his or her future spouse or partner is not entitled to compensation. This seems extraordinarily mean as, undoubtedly, that person's life will be affected along with the person who is infected. Why add this stipulation? Why not simply leave things as they were in the Hepatitis C Compensation Tribunal Act 1997? Why amend it so in section 1, 2 and 6? Such thinking appears to be entirely legalistic and does not take into consideration the people concerned.</p>
          <p eId="para_1333">I imagine the money involved is quite small and I do not think any public representative or member of the public would begrudge compensation to a person in such a situation where he or she has, as Deputy Lynch said, fallen in love and decided to have a long-term relationship knowing his or her partner is infected and that the relationship may be affected at a physical level and at other levels. The State is responsible for the condition of the person he or she has fallen in love with, it is not due to anything that person has done. The sufferer's condition is due to actions taken in the past, when, in many cases, people did not know what they were doing.</p>
          <p eId="para_1334">I do not understand why the Tánaiste and Minister for Health and Children has exposed her Government to the mess it is in today when she could have left the previous legislation alone. She could have introduced an insurance scheme, which would have been applauded by all and we would not be here at 7.40 p.m. arguing with the Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children Deputy Lenihan and arguing with the Government. The backbenchers would not be arguing with the Government either. It is very telling that the Fianna Fáil backbenchers who have spoken this evening have all argued for this Bill to be significantly amended, if not withdrawn. They want to see a way out for the Government as do we in the opposition. None of us want this legislation to be the last thing we do this term in the Dáil because it will not leave a good record for the Oireachtas.</p>
          <p eId="para_1335">I know the Tánaiste has stepped back a little, but it is not enough to address the issue at the heart of this. I urge that she step back further and acknowledge that she has been misled. No Member will hold it against her, rather we will applaud her for recognising it. I urge that she and the Government make a quick decision this evening on this issue and then give the necessary time to it and have real, required consultation with the four representative organisations. Otherwise she is, again, forcing them to fight the State when they believed the battle was over, that this legislation was the final piece of the jigsaw that would give them what they need. Their lives will never be returned to them but they could, at least, be given the financial security and insurance they expected. They could then feel that the State understands it is responsible and recognises the need for recompense in all of the aspects that concern them. I ask the Government to rethink this issue and do the decent, humane thing. It should recognise that this small group of people will not cost the State a huge amount of money and are deserving of and entitled to our care and consideration.</p>

          <from>Mr. B. Lenihan</from>
          <p eId="para_1340">The reason the HSE is no longer providing the funds is they are provided by the blood bank from its profits. To suggest there has somehow been a cutback in the services that are rightly provided, in terms of the reassurance people need, is simply not correct. There has been no cutback in services; there is an allocation of resources from a different source.</p>
          <p eId="para_1341">We all acknowledge the pain and suffering inflicted on more than 1,700 of our citizens infected with hepatitis C and HIV through the administration of blood and blood products within the State. It is an emotive issue and the Tánaiste has already stated that no compensation or support scheme will ever set right the wrong done. The State stands as a legal wrongdoer. People say we should not be legalistic about issues like this. The State, as a juristic person, is the legal wrongdoer in this case and must account for its wrongdoing like any other wrongdoer.</p>
          <p eId="para_1342">We are, on all sides of the House seeking to do this through difficult legislation. There are three prongs to providing support to infected persons. The first, compensation, has been provided through the Hepatitis C and HIV Compensation Tribunal which was put on a statutory footing in 1997. To date around 2,200 people have received awards and, happily, we were able to facilitate the making of these claims for compensation in a non-adversarial fashion.</p>

          <from>Mr. B. Lenihan</from>
          <p eId="para_1344">I will deal with that in a moment. Claimants may appeal their awards to the High Court. Infected persons, their spouses, partners and next of kin have been presenting claims to the tribunal since its establishment. The total cost of the tribunal to the end of 2005 is more than €660 million which includes legal costs, fees and administration costs. The actual amount of awards is €580 million so legal costs have not been as disproportionate as costs have been in many other schemes.</p>

          <p eId="para_1346">The number of claims is far more substantial. There have been around 2,200 awards and the total cost of the tribunal has been more than €660 million. The actual amount of awards is almost €580 million. That has been provided by the Exchequer.</p>

          <from>Mr. B. Lenihan</from>
          <p eId="para_1348">The State has a proud record on this issue under this Government. The second prong in providing support to infected persons is the Health (Amendment) Act card, which entitled the holder to a range of health care services free of charge. I will not take the House through all of the details relating to the card, but health care costs under the Health (Amendment) Act are approximately €15 million per annum. The expert group on hepatitis C, chaired by the Department's chief medical officer and including leading consultants and a member of Positive Action, agreed in 1998 that eligibility for the card should be on the basis of a positive diagnostic test for hepatitis C. The Department has prepared a detailed guide to the services available through the card which includes hospital and primary care services, home support and, this year, a new home nursing scheme being piloted in the east. The representative groups are involved in shaping the development of all new services to ensure they meet their needs.</p>
          <p eId="para_1349">The third and vital prong is the insurance scheme that is, at long last, before us. With the enactment of this Bill, the unease the victims had about life insurance support will be addressed. I welcome broad welcome for that aspect of the legislation in the House. This will cost approximately €90 million over the lifetime of the scheme, which will run for at least 30 years. Under the proposed scheme, the State will pay the additional risk premium where the life assurer is willing to provide cover subject to an additional premium or the State will assume the risk on the life cover where the assurer is not willing to provide cover. In each case, the person requiring insurance will pay the average basic premium which an uninfected person of the same age and gender would pay.</p>
          <p eId="para_1350">The scheme will be available in respect of all standard life assurance policies offered by life assurers authorised to transact life assurance business in Ireland and which opt to participate in the scheme. Life assurers which wish to participate in the scheme will enter into an agreement to abide by the rules of the scheme, which will provide for an appeal in the event of a dispute.</p>
          <p eId="para_1351">The scheme will be administered under the aegis of the Health Service Executive. Specific details on the administration of the scheme will be set out in regulations and an administrator will be recruited as soon as possible after enactment of the primary legislation. A travel insurance scheme will be developed within six months of the commencement of the main scheme.</p>
          <p eId="para_1352">The State has continued to honour its commitment to maximise the services available to persons with hepatitis C and HIV. Last week an international conference on hepatitis C was hosted by the consultative council on hepatitis C in Dublin Castle, funded by my Department. At this conference we saw how Irish clinicians are working with their international colleagues to improve knowledge about hepatitis C and to ensure the treatment provided to patients is of the highest possible standard to maximise their chances of clearing the virus and living a normal, healthy life. The news from this conference was very good and signalled that more breakthroughs in effective therapies are anticipated.</p>
          <p eId="para_1353">The conference had a parallel programme which allowed persons with hepatitis C to attend the scientific sessions. It also had specially designed sessions for patients. This was achieved through the excellent co-operation between the support groups, including the Irish Haemophilia Society, Transfusion Positive, Positive Action and the Irish Kidney Association, and clinicians, the HSE and my officials of the Department.</p>
          <p eId="para_1354">Much has been done in recent years to improve services for persons with haemophilia. The national haemophilia treatment centre at St. James's Hospital has evolved into the national centre for hereditary coagulation disorders and occupies premises at St. James's Hospital. The national centre is a state-of-the-art facility, fully equipped for the diagnosis and management of haemophilia and related disorders, staffed by a highly skilled and dedicated team of professionals and administrative staff——</p>

          <p eId="para_1359">The National Haemophilia Council was set up under statute in 2004. It is chaired by Professor John Bonnar and includes clinicians, nurses, representatives of the Irish Haemophilia Society and health service officials, who work together to advise the Tánaiste and Minister for Health and Children and others on all aspects of haemophilia. The council is an excellent example of co-operation between the service consumers and providers in helping to optimise the services provided.</p>
          <p eId="para_1360">We have also seen dramatic improvements in the Irish Blood Transfusion Service. The tragic episodes which took place in 1977 and again between 1991 and 1994 have been addressed. Every effort has been made by the State to make recompense to the victims of this terrible scandal.</p>
          <p eId="para_1361">As Deputies are aware, a multi-million pound investment was approved in the late 1990s to support the reorganisation and redevelopment of the Irish Blood Transfusion Service nationally. The primary objective was to ensure that the board was resourced to provide a transfusion service in line with best international standards. New testing programmes have been introduced by the IBTS in advance of most other international transfusion services. Continuous monitoring of international developments takes place, such as guarding against emerging threats, for example, variant CJD.</p>
          <p eId="para_1362">I will turn to the questions that have been at the heart of today's debate. I have already dealt with the matter of the reassurance programme, raised by Deputy O' Sullivan. Deputies generally, on all sides, raised two issues which were of concern to them regarding this legislation. One was the question of the introduction of a scientific test in the assessment of liability and the other was the question of consortium.</p>
          <p eId="para_1363">With regard to the issue of the scientific test, Deputy O'Sullivan argued that clinical diagnosis is not being taken into account. Of course, clinical diagnosis will still be taken into account——</p>

          <p eId="para_1407">I know exactly the society to whom it refers. We all know what consortium refers to but in its legal aspect it is somewhat technical because the claim does not belong to the victim. It is not a claim of the victim but one which has always existed for the partner or the spouse of a victim who has been deprived of that consortium.</p>

          <p eId="para_1409">Perhaps the Deputy might allow me to conclude on that issue. The history of this matter in common law was always that if someone was involved in an accident, the partner or spouse had a claim for the loss of consortium. However, that claim in common law never applied to someone whom the person who had suffered in the accident might subsequently marry. That is the key point. By not enacting the consortium provision, one is putting the State in a worse position than any other wrongdoer. No other wrongdoer must compensate on this basis an indeterminate class that may arise in future.</p>

            <from>Mr. Glennon</from>
            <p eId="para_1421">I thank the Leas-Cheann Comhairle for allowing me to raise this important issue on the Adjournment and thank the Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children, Deputy Brian Lenihan, for agreeing to respond, having survived the previous few minutes.</p>
            <p eId="para_1422">This issue unfortunately arises from the nursing homes refund scheme. I say "unfortunately" because the scheme has had an unfortunate history. I have no wish to add to that other than to say that certain matters have been brought to my attention regarding the administration of that scheme and the award of contracts in that regard which are worthy of pursuit and investigation. We are aware that our health system is in no way perfect, since that can be true of no country. Equally, every Member is aware anecdotally of some difficulties on the procurement side, whether it be of a single can of paint by the lowest store man to the awarding of contracts. I do not want to deal with the PPARS system whose very mention sends something of a shudder down everyone's spine.</p>
            <p eId="para_1423">If the problems in health service procurement were resolved, even to a significant degree, we would have done a major service to the health system and gone a long way towards resolving the problems. My interest in this issue is on behalf of an unsuccessful party to the tender process, an operator in my constituency where jobs are at issue, as well as on behalf of some very concerned senior staff members of the Health Service Executive and the taxpayer.</p>
            <p eId="para_1424">We have a duty to pursue genuine issues, and in that regard, as the tendering process is now complete and the cooling-off period has expired, we should, with complete transparency, investigate the issues arising, especially those to which I referred in my request for this Adjournment debate. We must have the names of the tendering companies, their ranking by price, the HSE's policy on outsourcing work relevant to the project, particularly to the Indian subcontinent, and the advice given to tenderers relevant to such outsourcing at inception and conclusion of the tender process. Was the lowest tender accepted, and if not, why not?</p>
            <p eId="para_1425">I assure the House that this is by no means a witch hunt but an entirely legitimate and justified inquiry whose purpose is to ensure that fairness and equity prevailed in the process at all times. I look forward to a comprehensive response from the Minister and firmly take the view that anything less will only give rise to further questions and serve no one, least of all the clients due to benefit from the running of the scheme.</p>

          <speech by="#BrianLenihan" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Health_and_Children" eId="spk_612">
            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Mr. B. Lenihan)</from>
            <p eId="para_1426">I am replying on behalf of the Tánaiste and Minister for Health, Deputy Harney. I thank Deputy Glennon for raising the matter. The Health (Repayments Scheme) Act 2006 was signed by the President on 23 June and provides a clear legal framework for a scheme to repay recoverable health charges for publicly funded long-term care.</p>
            <p eId="para_1427">The Health Service Executive has responsibility for administering the repayment scheme for recoverable health charges, including the recruitment of an outside company to assist in its management. Owing to the nature, volume and complexity of the repayments involved, it was decided, in line with a Government decision, to appoint an outside company with appropriate knowledge and experience of dealing with mass repayments. A procurement team was established within the HSE and a tendering process was advertised in the <i>EU Journal</i> and the Irish national newspapers for the selection of such a company.</p>
            <p eId="para_1428">The HSE has advised me that the following seven companies or consortia tendered for the repayment scheme: Capita; Northgate HR Information Solutions; Fexco Outsourcings Solutions and Mentec; Elision Group; SWS Business Process Outsourcing Limited; Care Charges Refund Scheme Limited; and KPMG McCann Fitzgerald.</p>
            <p eId="para_1429">Following consideration of the tenders, the HSE has selected a service provider, the consortium comprising KPMG Accounting Group and McCann Fitzgerald Solicitors, to manage the repayment scheme within the agreed parameters. The cost will be based on the total number of repayments but has been capped at €15 million, excluding VAT. The HSE is satisfied that the successful consortium met the necessary criteria and is confident of its ability to deliver all aspects of the scheme and that the consortium will plan, manage and execute the scheme in accordance with international best practice.</p>
            <p eId="para_1430">The tendering companies were not ranked by price alone, as the award criteria required the contract to be awarded to the most economically advantageous tender while also having regard to the criteria outlined in the advertisement placed in the <i>EU Journal</i>. The criteria used for the selection of the company were those outlined in the advertisement referred to above, and those related to cost, technical capacity, legal expertise and economic and financial capacity.</p>
            <p eId="para_1431">The HSE's policy on outsourcing is to comply with all EU procurement and trade law. The HSE has indicated that all EU guidelines and directives have been complied with in awarding the contract. It is understood from the HSE that a very small proportion, approximately 5%, of the work to be undertaken by the company will be outsourced outside the EU. That work is of a data entry nature and will not involve the operation of help lines, the provision of information or any related matters, all of which will be performed within the State. The HSE has worked directly with the Data Protection Commissioner to ensure that all necessary measures are in place to protect the confidentiality of information.</p>
            <p eId="para_1432">The HSE has stated that it did not offer any advice to the companies on whether to outsource elements of the repayment process. The HSE has not released the details of the cost of the other tenders as the selection process was not based on cost alone, and those costs are also commercially sensitive. The company selected to administer the repayment scheme was not the lowest tender received, but the preferred company had the highest combined score when the award criteria outlined above were considered.</p>
            <p eId="para_1433">The company has already commenced its preparatory work and intends to launch the scheme to the public in the middle of July. It will be initiated by a comprehensive public awareness campaign to ensure that anyone entitled can easily apply for repayment.</p>

          <heading>Pension Provisions.</heading>
          <speech by="#TomHayes" eId="spk_613">
            <from>Mr. Hayes</from>
            <p eId="para_1434">I will not need the five minutes allowed to me. I thank the Leas-Cheann Comhairle for selecting this matter for discussion on the Adjournment, since it is a very important issue for me and many of my constituents.</p>
            <p eId="para_1435">I would like to know the reason for a 14-week delay in pensions being issued to eligible people. Letters have been coming from the Department of Social and Family Affairs. I do not criticise it, since it has been very efficient, especially at dealing with our parliamentary questions and queries, over an extended period. However, I am disturbed by the letters it is sending. The letters explain that there is a temporary delay of 14 weeks in processing pension applications and ask people not to contact the office. The letters also request that people contact their local Health Service Executive office if they are short of money in the meantime. These are people who are retiring after working very hard for a long time and paying their taxes, but find that their pensions are not in place. This is a deplorable state of affairs for people who have given considerable service to the State.</p>
            <p eId="para_1436">Given our buoyant economy, I cannot understand why staff cannot be assigned to these offices to alleviate the problem. Retirement represents a major change in people's lives and for them to be told that they will be left without a pension for 14 weeks after a long period of working is not good enough. What is the reason for this delay, when will it be resolved and when will normal service resume? This delay affects a considerable number of people. Over a short period, six people contacted my constituency office about this matter. If this resonates in other constituency offices, it must be a very significant issue. I expect a very clear and positive answer from the Minister of State.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#BrianLenihan" eId="spk_614" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Health_and_Children">
            <from>Mr. B. Lenihan</from>
            <p eId="para_1437">I am delivering this reply on behalf of the Minister for Social and Family Affairs. I must deliver a considerable amount of the reply before Deputy Hayes arrives at the reason for the delay. That said, I thank him for raising this matter on the Adjournment because I am aware of these delays.</p>
            <p eId="para_1438">The Department of Social and Family Affairs is committed to providing a quality service to all its customers. This includes the necessary processing of applications and ensuring that the decisions on entitlements are issued as expeditiously as possible, having regard to the eligibility conditions which apply. The challenging customer service standards are set out in the Department's statement of strategy 2005-07, backed up by its customer service charter. In the case of pension claims, customers are advised to apply for pensions at least three months before reaching pension age to ensure there is no delay in receiving their entitlements.</p>
            <p eId="para_1439">The Department is developing a new generation of IT systems under its service delivery modernisation, SDM, programme which will allow it to be more responsive to customer needs. The main objectives of the SDM programme are to provide customers with improved service, provide a proactive comprehensive service that takes account of related services needed by the customer, enable speedy implementation of change, ensure effective control of fraud and abuse, maximise benefits of information and communication technology, implement progressive management and work practices and develop better organisational structures and a better work environment where staff will be supported to provide an excellent service.</p>
            <p eId="para_1440">SDM is a multi-year programme of change which seeks to ensure more efficiency and effectiveness through the use of modern technology and redesign of existing business processes to deliver more flexible and more personalised service delivery. Phase 1 of this programme has already been successfully implemented for child benefit.</p>
            <p eId="para_1441">The old age contributory and retirement pensions section was hitherto supported by the PENLIVE computer application. This system is now over 20 years old and is being replaced to enable the Department to deliver the enhanced services outlined above. At the end of May 2006, the old age contributory and retirement pension payments were moved to the new IT platform and the administrative sections were reorganised to improve service to customers and achieve the full benefits of the new technology. As could be expected in a change programme of this magnitude, there was a need for intensive training for all staff involved. To date, some 220,000 customer records have been transferred to the new system.</p>
            <p eId="para_1442">The activity involved in achieving the change has affected the capacity of the area concerned to process claims during the transition phase and, accordingly, a backlog of work has accrued. At present, there are some 12,000 claims awaiting decision compared to a normal level of approximately 4,000 claims on hand at any one time. The situation is being monitored closely and plans are in hand to address these cases, including the deployment of additional resources to process these claims as quickly as possible. The original receipt date will be taken as the date of claim and customers will not lose out as a result of the temporary delay currently being experienced.</p>
            <p eId="para_1443">Customers are being advised of the reasons for the temporary delay. In the meantime, any documentation, such as birth, marriage or death certificates, submitted in support of claims is being processed and returned as quickly as possible. The staff in the Department make every effort to process claims speedily. However, the over-riding consideration in processing claims is to ensure that customers receive their correct entitlements in a timely fashion.</p>
            <p eId="para_1444">Looking to the future, the new SDM programme will allow the Department to be more proactive in dealing with customers. It offers the prospect of issuing reminders to people reaching pension age to apply for their pensions in advance so as to avoid delays in payments issuing to them. In respect of the child care supplement, I believe Deputy Hayes's own party focused on the fact that I was able to advise persons of their entitlements in advance using that computer system. This facility will now be extended to pensions once this new programme is introduced.</p>
            <p eId="para_1445">The Deputy's party was, understandably, not aware of the fact there were substantial savings in the issuing of these reminders to individuals because it discloses to us the non-existence of certain parties at specified addresses. That said, that matter is not on the Adjournment this evening but I could not resist mentioning it when I saw Deputy Stanton sitting opposite me.</p>
            <p eId="para_1446">The SDM programme will also allow for enhanced procedures for processing claims for related services, such as the free travel allowance and household benefits. This will also simplify the process for customers as it will remove the need to make separate applications for these services and will reduce processing times for claims. This introduction of this new technology will have a very positive impact but, unfortunately, it has caused a slight blip, as outlined by Deputy Hayes, which the Department is working very hard to resolve.</p>
            <p eId="para_1447">The Department is conscious of the impact of the delays on customers, particularly people claiming pensions, and is taking action to ensure that the difficulties currently being experienced are minimised. It is intended to make progress in addressing the situation over the coming weeks and to return to the normal standard of service to customers as soon as possible.</p>

            <from>Mr. Stanton</from>
            <p eId="para_1448">I thank the Ceann Comhairle for giving me permission to raise this very important matter on the Adjournment on behalf of the people of Cobh and I thank the Minister of State for coming here to reply. He and I held a debate on the issue during Question Time on 23 June 2005.</p>
            <p eId="para_1449">We all agree that new prison is badly needed to replace Cork Prison. We know about the overcrowding, inadequate facilities and the need to improve areas of work, training, education and medical services, as well as the need to provide predominantly single-cell accommodation with in-cell sanitation. A decision was made to locate this new prison complex on Spike Island without any public debate or consultation. It appears that public consultation will take place after the decision has been made. Perhaps we should appoint a commissar to run the country and forget about debate and consultation.</p>
            <p eId="para_1450">Other sites could have been considered, such as the old Irish Steel plant at Haulbowline, which encompasses 50 acres. Haulbowline already possesses a bridge and a security presence and is owned by the State. The site even contains room for the Naval Service to expand its base. The town of Cobh would benefit greatly if Spike Island was developed as a heritage centre. Last night in the other House, my colleague, Senator Paul Bradford, outlined the historical richness of Spike Island. Tonight I will extol the economic potential that could be lost to Cobh if Spike Island is developed as planned.</p>
            <p eId="para_1451">The bridge would mean that it would be cut off from Cobh and would only be accessed from the western side of the harbour and any economic benefit would be lost to Cobh. Cobh could do with the economic assistance that would be afforded by Spike Island. Other areas around the world that possess nothing like the history or heritage of Spike Island, such as Robben Island, Alcatraz and Port Arthur, are extremely popular tourist attractions. Many responsible and respectable people in Cobh who are very concerned about this development and have not been consulted will call on the Minister to re-examine the matter, visit the area and consult with and listen to them before he goes any further.</p>
            <p eId="para_1452">An alternative site for this prison exists. The people objecting to the siting of the prison on Spike Island are not taking the NIMBY approach. A site exists in the harbour with a bridge and a security presence. If a super prison is developed on Spike Island, the danger is that it will be lost forever. As Senator Bradford pointed out last night, there was a monastic settlement on Spike Island in the 6th century. During the previous debate on this matter, the Minister of State told me he had never visited the island. Perhaps he has visited it since.</p>
            <p eId="para_1453">The island contains an amazing star-shaped fort which, if developed and opened to the public, would be a wonderful tourist attraction that could be on a par with Alcatraz or Robben Island. I have visited the fort many times. The building is remarkable and there is a range of areas to explore.</p>
            <p eId="para_1454">John Mitchell and Thomas Francis Meagher spent some time there, as did convicts before they were shipped to Australia. During the War of Independence, there were a number of amazing escapes from the island. It is rich in heritage and history and it would be a shame to lose it. I call on the Government to reconsider the matter, as there is an alternative site. The people in the area want to help, but they do not want this island ruined and lost forever.</p>

            <from>Mr. B. Lenihan</from>
            <p eId="para_1455">I am replying on behalf of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform.</p>
            <p eId="para_1456">As mentioned in Seanad Éireann yesterday, the need for a new prison to alleviate the current overcrowding at Cork Prison has been well documented, which the Deputy acknowledged in raising the matter. Recently, the Inspector of Prisons in his inspection report on Cork Prison condemned the facility and acknowledged that space at the institution is at a premium.</p>
            <p eId="para_1457">Having considered various options, the Minister is satisfied that the only feasible option for the replacement of the existing Cork Prison is the construction of a modern prison complex on Spike Island. Officials from the Irish Prison Service, in conjunction with the Office of Public Works and professional advisers, are developing proposals for the construction of this new complex. The facility will address the overcrowding and inadequate facilities associated with Cork Prison and will, in addition, offer significant improvements in the areas of work, training, education and medical services as well as providing predominantly single cell accommodation with in-cell sanitation facilities.</p>
            <p eId="para_1458">The new prison complex on Spike Island will allow the Irish Prison Service to strengthen measures to ensure drugs are not smuggled to prisoners. For example, the new complex will locate exercise yards where drugs cannot be propelled into them and new visiting facilities will eliminate the potential for passing drugs to prisoners on visits. In addition to eliminating supply routes, the new complex will provide modern medical and other facilities to allow the prison service to meet its commitment in its recently published drugs policy and strategy to deliver a broad range of high quality interventions to support drug abusers in attempting to conquer their addictions. Modern facilities support the staff delivering these interventions by providing them with the best tools and environment in which to carry out their work.</p>
            <p eId="para_1459">The commissioning of the bridge will facilitate the development of new prison facilities on the island to replace the existing outdated accommodation at Cork Prison. The OPW has been instructed to prepare the relevant planning procedures, including an assessment of the environmental and related issues arising to enable the construction of a bridge to the island. The Minister has been advised by the OPW that this planning process will commence by this summer. As soon as the planning requirements are complete, it is intended to commence construction of the bridge, which will take approximately 18 months to complete.</p>
            <p eId="para_1460">The contract for the bridge and the prison facilities will be placed following public tender and the Minister has instructed the OPW to prepare the design and other works required prior to the issue of the tender for the construction of the bridge. Deputy Stanton is amused, but I seem to recall in my constituency——</p>

The Minister is not at this stage in a position to give an estimate of the amount of land required for the prison development or the costs of the project, as this will be the subject of a public competition.</p>
            <p eId="para_1464">The Minister does not propose to change his plans for a new prison development including a bridge at Spike Island. He does, however, note the concerns raised regarding the history and heritage aspects which arise in the context of this development. He wishes to reassure the Deputy that the implications, if any, on the heritage, archaeology or related aspects of the proposed developments will be addressed in detail in the course of the planning process, which will be undertaken in due course. At that stage, all the relevant material including properly balanced assessments of the various issues, including archaeology, will be made available as part of the public consultation process which it is hoped should commence later this year.</p>

          <speech by="#CatherineMurphy" eId="spk_619">
            <from>Ms C. Murphy</from>
            <p eId="para_1465">I thank the Ceann Comhairle for selecting this item, as I hold the distinction of being the first person to receive a P45 as a consequence of the abolition of the dual mandate. While it might be thought I am joking, that is exactly how it happened. I was happy to receive it because it meant that I had been elected to the Dáil.</p>
            <p eId="para_1466">I supported the end of the dual mandate. For several years, I worked as a full-time county councillor. There was more than enough work in a rapidly developing area such as Kildare to justify that time and it would be difficult to imagine how one could have adequately done that job on top of the workload of an Oireachtas Member.</p>
            <p eId="para_1467">Recently, I have visited the public gallery of Kildare County Council a number of times. The issues of unfinished housing estates were being debated and I wanted to get a feel for how that matter was being treated. Having been in a council chamber before and after the abolition of the dual mandate, I do not doubt that a valuable link between local and national levels and a great deal of institutional memory have been lost because many Deputies and Senators had served for considerable durations on various councils.</p>
            <p eId="para_1468">As a Member of the Oireachtas, I deal with more county council related matters than I did when I was a councillor, particularly in respect of housing, planning, transportation, sanitary services and so on. Those issues are raised with me as a consequence of the mandate I received on 11 March 2005. Like all Members, I see this as part of our day-to-day work. Indeed, I have opened a constituency office to deal with it.</p>
            <p eId="para_1469">I will outline a number of difficulties that have presented. I will be absolutely and abundantly clear when I state that I am not being treated differently from the other seven Members from Kildare. Kildare County Council moved to new purpose-built offices last January. The offices are open plan with security doors at the entrance to every section operated by swipe cards. After a protest, councillors were provided with swipe cards, but five months after the move and numerous complaints later, provision for Oireachtas Members remains by way of the public counter. All of Kildare's Members served on its county council, we know individual officials and we can rely on goodwill to get work done. Staff who have known me for years have told me that they do not know whether they are allowed to let me in and that the situation is ridiculous.</p>
            <p eId="para_1470">On one occasion I sent an e-mail of a list of planning files I wanted to check. I stated that I intended to visit to inspect the said files, but found that I needed to take a number and join the queue at the public counter. The files began to arrive approximately 25 minutes later and 35 minutes after that I was advised the offices were closing for lunch and I would need to leave. I made a complaint on 9 May and received the following reply:</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1471">I have received your e-mail re access and services at planning department. The situation you have outlined is unsatisfactory and the appropriate staff have been so advised. Arrangements are in hand to improve access for elected members visiting the planning counter and revised arrangements for telephone access. These arrangements will be advised shortly.</p>
            <p eId="para_1472">Nearly three months later, I have still not been advised of any new arrangements. The next time I sent an e-mail, most of the files were available at the specified time. Last week, I telephoned the council to speak to a planner and was told that I would only be dealt with between 2 p.m. and 3 p.m.</p>
            <p eId="para_1473">I do not want to carve out through ongoing complaints a means of interacting with the council's officials, nor do I want to rely on goodwill because I happen to know a particular official. Some reasonable working arrangements should have been put in place. When a Green Party councillor, J. J. Power, proposed that the same arrangements put in place for councillors should be extended to Oireachtas Members, he was told that he and other councillors had no function in that regard, as it was an executive function and the manager would make the decision.</p>
            <p eId="para_1474">The executive has locked us out and the P45 I referred to earlier has been taken literally. I am angry about this, as I am not trying to deal with matters on my own behalf. Rather, I am trying to deal with matters that affect the county's citizens who contact me. Often they contact me as a last resort, having failed to resolve the matters themselves. I visit the council's office approximately once a week, part of the reason for which is an overdependence on voicemail. Often such mail goes unanswered.</p>
            <p eId="para_1475">I do not know how other local authorities operate. I have discussed the Kildare situation with other Members who are astonished. Therefore, I suspect the situation is not universal. It was not the intended outcome of abolishing the dual mandate. Will the Minister examine the executive function referred to and will the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government issue guidelines on Oireachtas Members? Will those Members be surveyed on their interactions with their local authorities so that a more appropriate arrangement is put in place between them?</p>

          <speech by="#BrianLenihan" eId="spk_620" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Health_and_Children">
            <from>Mr. B. Lenihan</from>
            <p eId="para_1476">I thank Deputy Catherine Murphy for raising this matter. I reply on behalf of the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government but I am conscious that the reply does not address the precise points raised by the Deputy. It is more general in scope but I assure Deputy Murphy that the complaints she makes are not unique to herself as a Member of the House. Irrespective of whether Members hold executive office, the difficulties to which she refers have been encountered with some local authorities, though others have established a high standard in the way they deal with the matter.</p>
            <p eId="para_1477">I am not in a position to comment further on that but the points the Deputy makes are highly relevant. I will transmit her views to the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Roche. A review of the matter is under way in the Department, conducted at an official level, the findings of which will be studied by him with a view to considering what improvements can be made to regulations which he introduced.</p>
            <p eId="para_1478">The Local Government Act 2003 provided for a single local authority mandate. Concerns were expressed at that time about the continuing role of Members of the Oireachtas in respect of the various local authority activities, with the abolition of the dual mandate. When the single mandate for local government was introduced, arrangements were put in place to provide Oireachtas Members with a right in law to access documentation and information and to communication generally with local authorities.</p>
            <p eId="para_1479">Regulations, which came into operation on 1 August 2003, apply to local authority dealings with Members of the Oireachtas. As part of these arrangements, local authorities are required as a matter of course to supply or make available free of charge a range of documentation to Oireachtas Members who register their interest in receiving such information with the local authority. The range of information to be made available includes agendas, notices and minutes of local authority meetings, including committee meetings if so requested, the corporate plan, the local authority budget, draft and actual development plans, development contribution schemes, weekly lists of planning applications and decisions, draft and final by-laws and annual reports.</p>
            <p eId="para_1480">Most important, a local authority, in dealing with correspondence from a Member of the Oireachtas, is required to operate to equivalent systems, procedures and timeframes as apply for county, city or town councillors. Members of the Oireachtas may attend a meeting of a local authority or of its committees. In addition, managers are required to meet at least annually with local Oireachtas Members and thus provide an opportunity for an update on developments, and for any difficulties encountered to be raised and addressed. I do not have the regulations to hand but if Members are free to attend meetings by virtue of the regulations they must have access to council property and rooms, to answer one of the Deputy's specific questions.</p>
            <p eId="para_1481">The above is, of course, additional to normal and regular contacts between public representatives and local authority officials regarding particular problems or issues. Above all, it is an objective of local authorities to deal as expeditiously as possible with requests for access to information from Oireachtas Members. The Minister expects local authorities to facilitate parliamentary representatives, in the spirit and the letter of the regulations, in the timely provision of local authority documentation.</p>
            <p eId="para_1482">Officials at the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government have just completed a review of the practical operation of these arrangements at local authority level. The Minister will study the findings with a view to issuing supplementary guidance to local authorities if required.</p>

          <speech by="#ConorLenihan" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Foreign_Affairs" eId="spk_621">
            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs (Mr. C. Lenihan)</from>
            <p eId="para_1484">Ireland has been strongly supportive of the reforms which have taken place in what was formerly known as the Central Emergency Revolving Fund (CERF).</p>
            <p eId="para_1485">The new Central Emergency Response Fund (CERF) was brought into being by a General Assembly resolution last December. Previously, the CERF was a loan-based mechanism which provided resources to UN agencies from a $50 million reserve, only when the agency had guaranteed funding pledged by a donor.</p>
            <p eId="para_1486">As part of the Humanitarian Response Review commissioned by the UN and carried out last year, it was recommended that the CERF be enhanced as a grant-based mechanism providing UN agencies and eventually Non-Governmental Organisations (NGOs) with funding for both sudden-onset emergencies, as well as for so-called forgotten or neglected emergencies. It is intended that the CERF reach $500 million in funds. To date, it has achieved funding of some $300 million. It will be replenished at regular intervals by donors.</p>
            <p eId="para_1487">When it was first proposed that a standing fund be established, Ireland commissioned a review of the practicalities of reforming the CERF. This review was shared with our UN partners and other Government partners and contributed to the progress towards the reform of the CERF. The new Fund is being managed by the Emergency Relief Coordinator, the UN's top humanitarian official, on behalf of the Secretary-General. In addition, an advisory group has been established to oversee its workings. The CEO of Concern, Mr. Tom Arnold, was appointed as the only NGO representative on the Advisory Group. It will provide advice to the Secretary-General on the use of the Fund.</p>
            <p eId="para_1488">Already this year, CERF funds have been released for the drought in the Horn of Africa and for humanitarian needs in the initial period of the violence in East Timor in recent weeks. I will continue to closely monitor the progress of this new tool to ensure that it effectively fulfils its intended role of strengthening the system of global humanitarian response.</p>

          </question>
          <speech by="#DermotAhern" as="#Minister_for_Foreign_Affairs" eId="spk_622">
            <from>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern)</from>
            <p eId="para_1494">I propose to take Questions Nos. 11, 34, 65, 70 and 80 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_1495">The Government shares the widespread concern about the lack of progress in the Middle East Peace Process and the serious situation in the Occupied Territories. The immediate priority is to ensure there is no further escalation of the situation in Gaza. It is essential that all parties exercise restraint over the coming days.</p>
            <p eId="para_1496">The Government has been consistently active within the EU and the UN in promoting a lasting, peaceful and just settlement of the Israeli — Palestinian conflict. The events and difficulties of recent months serve to confirm that the only way forward is through negotiations between the parties leading to a viable two-State solution. Within the Union, the Government continues to pursue a policy approach aimed at ensuring that the EU remains fully engaged in the process, with a clear and balanced message for the parties. The EU is playing a vital role in the work of the Quartet to create an environment for the earliest possible return to negotiations.</p>
            <p eId="para_1497">The European Council on 16 June issued a Declaration on the Middle East Peace Process which set out clearly the overall policy and the specific concerns of the European Union. The EU remains firmly committed to a negotiated two-State solution. The Declaration addressed forthrightly the recent deterioration in the security situation in Gaza and the West Bank. It condemned the violence against Palestinian civilians, the firing of rockets at Israeli population centres and the continuing extra-judicial killings. I believe it is particularly important today to underline the European Council's reminder to all parties of their responsibility to protect civilian lives.</p>
            <p eId="para_1498">Both parties have clear obligations under the Quartet Roadmap, and under international law. The international community has stated very clearly since 30 January that the democratically-elected Government of the Palestinian Authority must commit to the peace process. Regrettably, there has been little sign so far of significant movement in this direction by Hamas. We continue to hope that, through their cooperation with President Mahmoud Abbas and engagement in a Palestinian national dialogue, political progress will prove possible.</p>
            <p eId="para_1499">We remain concerned about the humanitarian situation in Gaza and the West Bank, and do not believe that the Palestinian people should suffer because of the reluctance of their Government to abide by the basic rules of the peace process. The European Council endorsed the urgent work of the Commission to establish a temporary international mechanism to channel assistance directly to the Palestinian people. Following endorsement by the Quartet on 17 June, the operation of the mechanism will commence in the coming days, based on a funding allocation of €105 million by the Commission. This will bring the total Community aid to the Palestinian people so far this year to €259 million. The European Council also called on Israel to resume the transfer of withheld Palestinian tax and customs revenues, which are essential in averting a crisis in the Palestinian territories.</p>
            <p eId="para_1500">The Government has continued to raise directly with the Israeli authorities our concerns about the serious humanitarian and economic impact of policies and activities in the Occupied Territories. We have also worked with our partners to ensure that the EU maintains its clear position that Israel must end all activities in the Territories which are contrary to international law and which threaten the viability of a solution based on the co-existence of two States. These include the continued expansion of settlements, the construction of the separation barrier on occupied land, activities in and around East Jerusalem and in the Jordan Valley, and the demolition of Palestinian homes. The European Council Declaration set out the EU position unambiguously, and repeated the commitment of the EU that it will not recognise any change to the pre-1967 borders which is not agreed between the parties.</p>
            <p eId="para_1501">It is now more urgent than ever that the conditions be established for a return to meaningful negotiations. The European Council called for an early engagement between the Israeli Prime Minister and the President of the Palestinian Authority. Their informal meeting in Jordan last weekend was a small but encouraging step. It is in the interests of the Israeli and the Palestinian people that their dialogue be developed further in the weeks to come.</p>

            <from>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern)</from>
            <p eId="para_1504">I propose to take Questions Nos. 12 and 159 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_1505">I last met the Turkish Foreign Minister Abdullah Gul in the margins of the UN General Assembly in New York in September 2005 and he used the opportunity to discuss the Cyprus issue. On that occasion he made it clear that while Ireland did not believe recognition of Cyprus by Turkey should be a condition for starting accession negotiations, it will, however, be an absolute requirement for eventual accession by Turkey. Minister Ahern also reiterated Ireland's strong support for the UN process for a resolution of the Cyprus problem and in particular for the UN Secretary-General's Mission of Good Office.</p>
            <p eId="para_1506">The United Nations has the lead role in the search for a comprehensive settlement of the Cyprus problem. The EU enlargement process provided impetus for efforts towards a settlement, which were undertaken by the UN Secretary-General in the first half of 2004, during Ireland's EU Presidency. As a result of the referendums in Cyprus on 24 April 2004, the accession to the EU of a united Cyprus on 1 May 2004 was not possible. Since 1 May 2004, the Republic of Cyprus has been a Member State of the EU and, in the absence of a comprehensive settlement, the application of the laws and regulations of the Union to the northern part of the island is suspended.</p>
            <p eId="para_1507">In his most recent report on the UN operation in Cyprus, Secretary-General Annan emphasised the importance for the parties to resume contacts and to begin to think about how to re-engage in the search for a settlement. The Secretary-General's Special Representative, Michael Moeller, has engaged in a process aimed at encouraging renewed contacts. In this regard, the decision by both the Greek and Turkish Cypriot leaders to meet on 3 July next to discuss the missing persons issue is to be welcomed. The Under-Secretary-General for Political Affairs, Dr. Ibrahim Gambari, will visit Cyprus, Greece and Turkey later in July to assess the political situation and the prospects for a full resumption of negotiations On 29 July 2005, as part of the preparations for the opening of Turkey-EU accession negotiations and in accordance with the conclusions of the December 2004 European Council, Turkey signed the Ankara Agreement Protocol to take account of the accession of the new Member States, including the Republic of Cyprus. At the same time, however, Turkey also issued a Declaration stating that its signature, ratification and implementation of the Protocol did not amount to recognition of the Republic of Cyprus.</p>
            <p eId="para_1508">In response to the Declaration, on 21 September 2005 the EU issued a Counter-Declaration recalling the status of the Republic of Cyprus as a Member State of the EU. The Counter-Declaration noted that recognition of all Member States, including, of course, Cyprus, is a necessary component of the accession process and underlined the importance the Union attaches to the normalisation of relations between Turkey and all Member States. The European Council, at its meeting on 16 June last, reviewed progress made in the Turkish reform process and welcomed the start of substantive accession negotiations with Turkey. The Council recalled that the pace of the negotiations will depend on Turkey's progress in preparing for accession measured against the requirements set out in the Negotiating Framework. This includes the fulfilment of Turkey's obligations under the Ankara Agreement Protocol. The European Council recalled that the Council will ensure, in the course of 2006, a follow up on the progress made on all the relevant issues included in the Counter-Declaration.</p>

Minister Ahern intervened to underline Ireland's insistence on the need for a balanced outcome to the current round of WTO negotiations which respects the reforms to the Common Agricultural Policy agreed in 2003. The draft conclusions for the European Council, which took place in Brussels later that week, were discussed in some detail. As Deputies will be aware from last Wednesday's statements in the House, the European Council focused largely on the Constitution and the Future of Europe. At the GAERC, Ireland broadly welcomed the Presidency's approach in its preparations for the European Council.</p>
            <p eId="para_1514">Ministers also agreed the EU Common Position for the Science &amp; Research chapter of the accession negotiations with Turkey. This allowed this particular chapter to be provisionally concluded, which represents a worthwhile step forward in the negotiations with Turkey.</p>
            <p eId="para_1515">The Council held discussions on the Western Balkans, and approved conclusions which emphasised the importance of improved cooperation by Serbia with the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY), and welcomed the signature of the Stabilisation and Association Agreement with Albania. The Council had a separate discussion on Montenegro, and agreed that the EU and its Member States would develop their relations with the Republic of Montenegro as a sovereign, independent State, following the outcome of the recent independence referendum and the subsequent acts by the Montenegrin Parliament.</p>
            <p eId="para_1516">Ministers were briefed on preparations for the EU-US summit, which subsequently took place in Vienna on 21 June. The Council approved an extension of the common position on Cuba and underlined that constructive engagement and a critical and comprehensive dialogue remained the basis for the EU's policy. Ministers deplored the further deterioration of the human rights situation in Cuba since the last evaluation in June 2005, and again urged the Cuban government to unconditionally release all political prisoners. It was also agreed that work should begin at EU level on a mid-and long-term strategy on Cuba.</p>
            <p eId="para_1517">Over lunch, the Council discussed Iran, the Middle East Peace Process, and Iraq. Ministers were briefed by High Representative Javier Solana on his visit to Tehran on 6 June when he presented to the Iranian authorities a new proposal for resolving the Iranian nuclear issue through a long-term agreement based on mutual respect and the establishment of international confidence in the exclusively peaceful nature of Iran's programme. Ministers discussed the Middle East peace process on the basis of a presentation by High Representative Solana following his recent visit to the region. Commissioner Ferrero-Waldner informed Ministers on the state of preparations on the establishment of a temporary international mechanism designed to ensure direct delivery and supervision of assistance to the Palestinian people. Ministers discussed the situation in Iraq following the formation of the new national unity government on 20 May, as well as measures to enhance EU-Iraq relations based on Iraqi priorities in the new government's programme. They had an exchange of views in this respect with the foreign minister of the new Iraqi government, Hoshyar Zebari. Finally, under Any Other Business, there was a brief exchange on the current situation in Burma, and in Timor Leste.</p>

            <p eId="para_1520">I propose to take Questions Nos. 14 and 15 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_1521">Ireland has a particularly close association with the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT), which came into being following an initiative taken by the late Frank Aiken. His pioneering efforts were recognised when Ireland was invited, following the Treaty's negotiation, to be its first signatory in 1968. As the Minister for Foreign Affairs has made clear on a number of previous occasions in this House, support for efforts to strengthen the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty remains our highest priority in the area of disarmament and non-proliferation.</p>
            <p eId="para_1522">At the last NPT Review Conference in May 2005, there were a number of specific proposals on actions that States Parties might take to meet the challenges confronting the Treaty. Regrettably, the Conference ended without agreement on substantive conclusions and recommendations on how to strengthen the non-proliferation regime.</p>
            <p eId="para_1523">The next scheduled Review Conference of the NPT will not take place until 2010. It will be preceded by a series of preparatory committee meetings beginning in 2007. The EU has not yet begun its internal deliberations for these meetings but these will be on the basis of the Common Position agreed in April 2005, which remains valid. In the meantime, Ireland is working with like minded countries and with civil society to identify areas where implementation of the Treaty can be strengthened.</p>
            <p eId="para_1524">On 23-24 May last, for example, together with two of our partners from the New Agenda Coalition, Sweden and New Zealand, Ireland co-funded a seminar on NPT issues organised by the United Nations Institute for Disarmament research (UNIDIR). The Seminar, entitled "Unfinished Business: Building on the NPT 2005 Review Conference" took place in Geneva and brought together relevant Government experts and representatives of civil society to look again at a number of key issues which had been raised at last year's review Conference but on which debate had been curtailed by time constraints.</p>
            <p eId="para_1525">We are also participating in the Article VI Forum, which is focused on discussion of the nuclear disarmament obligations set out in Article VI of the Treaty and which is being organised by an umbrella group of NGOs, the Middle Powers Initiative. The next meeting of the Forum will be held in Canada at the end of September and will aim at identifying concrete proposals to assist the process of nuclear disarmament. The Chair of the international Commission on Weapons of Mass Destruction, Hans Blix, who has recently released a highly significant and relevant report, is to address the Forum on his findings during the September meeting.</p>

            <from>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern)</from>
            <p eId="para_1528">I propose to take Questions Nos. 16 and 89 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_1529">The question of Iran's nuclear programme is kept under constant review within the European Union at official level and is also the subject of regular discussions at Ministerial level, most recently at the General Affairs and External Relations Council meeting of 12 -13 June, which Minister Ahern attended. At this meeting Ministers discussed latest developments including the package of incentives that was presented to Iran by High Representative Solana on 6 June.</p>
            <p eId="para_1530">The package contains a number of significant elements in the areas of nuclear, economic and political cooperation. In the nuclear field, it reaffirms Iran's right to nuclear energy for peaceful purposes and proposes cooperation with Iran to build a modern proliferation-proof nuclear power programme; legally binding guarantees of fuel supply are also proposed. On the economic and political fronts, a number of benefits are proposed, such as dialogue on regional security issues, as well as a strategic energy partnership with the EU.</p>
            <p eId="para_1531">Some initial Iranian comments have suggested that there may be some elements of the package on which Iran might seek clarification. Last week, High Representative Solana announced that he had spoken with Ali Larijani, Secretary of the Supreme National Security Council of Iran, and would be meeting with him in the coming days to explain the package of incentives further. It is important, however, that Iran engage genuinely and substantively as quickly as possible.</p>
            <p eId="para_1532">The question of Iran's nuclear programme is an issue of concern to the whole international community and not just western Governments. This is clear, inter alia, from the many IAEA Board of Governors resolutions in recent years. Moreover, before the package of incentives was presented to Iran by High Representative Solana, the Foreign Ministers of the EU3 met with their counterparts from the United States, Russia and China. At this meeting the incentives package was endorsed by all of the countries present. Both Russia and the US have also confirmed that they are prepared to enter into negotiations with Iran provided that all enrichment and reprocessing activities are suspended beforehand.</p>
            <p eId="para_1533">The Government's position on the Iranian nuclear programme is a matter of public record. Ireland remains strongly committed to a diplomatic solution to this issue. Minister Ahern has made clear on several occasions Ireland's full support for the EU3 efforts in this respect. It is now essential for Iran to constructively examine the proposals that have been received. Immediate suspension of enrichment activities will allow for early and substantive discussion on the package and provide an opportunity for any clarification needed of its details. I would urge Iran to respond quickly and take the steps necessary to enable progress towards a diplomatic solution.</p>

            <from>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern)</from>
            <p eId="para_1537">I propose to take Questions Nos. 17, 68 and 164 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_1538">The crisis in Timor-Leste erupted in late April with the dismissal of some 600 soldiers, a third of the armed forces. Ensuing violence cost at least 37 lives and drove some 10-15% of people from their homes into makeshift camps. The security situation in Timor-Leste has been brought under control but the country remains tense. There are continuing sporadic disturbances, now mainly involving disaffected youth. The two Irish staff members in the Irish Representation Office in Dili, who had been temporarily withdrawn to Darwin, have now returned to their posts in Dili.</p>
            <p eId="para_1539">The political front remains tense and unpredictable. Prime Minister Alkatiri resigned on Monday last, 26 June, after several days of political demonstrations. President Gusmão, who had assumed increasing day-to-day responsibility, had requested the resignation. A meeting of the State Council, a Presidential advisory committee, took place on 27 June to discuss the next steps. The President extended the period of the state of crisis and his responsibility for defence and security matters. He also announced that he would take immediate steps towards forming a new government but did not rule out dissolving parliament and holding elections if this was not possible.</p>
            <p eId="para_1540">The impact of the recent disturbances on the people of Timor-Leste is a matter of deep concern to the Government. The Timor-Leste Government and the United Nations (UN) have indicated that the priority needs are for food, emergency shelter, water and sanitation facilities, health services and protection of vulnerable groups, particularly, the elderly, women and children. In response to the urgent need for assistance, the Minister of State for Development Cooperation and Human Rights, Mr Conor Lenihan T.D., announced on 23 June emergency funding of €500,000 for humanitarian relief in Timor-Leste. This funding is in addition to our longer term commitment to provide assistance through Irish Aid's development aid programme. It will enable our partner organisations in the UN, the Red Cross and Non Governmental Organisations (NGOs) to implement the emergency response on the ground, and assist the displaced populations with food, emergency shelter and basic needs.</p>
            <p eId="para_1541">A declaration, adopted at the European Council on 16 June, expressed the EU's deep concern over the situation in Timor-Leste, urged all parties to refrain from any further violence and called for the re-establishment of political dialogue, security and public order conducive to a return to normalcy in the country. The declaration also stated the EU's belief that the UN continues to have a leading role to play and that the agreement of a mandate for a new and robust UN Mission, responding to the expectations of the Timorese on the facilitation of political dialogue and reconciliation as well as on the restoration and maintenance of security, would be of major importance in ensuring that the 2007 elections will be peaceful, free and fair.</p>
            <p eId="para_1542">The UN Security Council (SECCO) held an open meeting on 13 June at which it heard from the UN Secretary-General's Special Envoy, Ian Martin, who ended a 9 day visit to Timor-Leste on 7 June and also from Timor-Leste's Foreign Minister Ramos Horta. SECCO has agreed a short extension of the current residual UN Mission's — UNOTIL — mandate, which had been due to expire on 20 June, to allow time for the SG to prepare a report, in early August, on options for a future UN role. Ian Martin returned to Timor-Leste on 26 June to lead an assessment mission to plan the next stage of UN assistance to Timor-Leste and also to assist in the resolution of the present crisis. In line with our long-standing commitment to Timor-Leste, Ireland fully supports a continued UN role, in the light, of course, of the UN's own assessment.</p>
            <p eId="para_1543">Ireland's involvement in Timor-Leste began in the period leading to independence. Humanitarian and reconstruction assistance was provided in the aftermath of Indonesian withdrawal in 1999. In March 2003, Timor-Leste was designated as Ireland's first programme country in Asia and a long-term development strategy was put in place, with a focus on nation-building and poverty reduction and on supporting the implementation of Timor-Leste's National Development Plan.</p>
            <p eId="para_1544">Ireland is committed to supporting the Government and people of Timor-Leste in achieving their long-term development goals. A new Irish Aid development strategy was recently approved for the period 2006-2008 with a budget of over €19 million. It continues the emphasis on support for capacity building, for local development, and for the promotion of human rights and gender equality.</p>

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs (Mr. C. Lenihan)</from>
            <p eId="para_1546">HIV/AIDS presents an enormous challenge to developing countries, especially in Africa. Sub-Saharan Africa is by far the worst-affected region in the world. AIDS is now the leading cause of death in this region. Over 3 million new infections occurred there in 2005, while the disease claimed the lives of over 2 million adults and children in the same year. Women and girls make up almost 57% of those living with HIV in sub-Saharan Africa and 11 million children in this region have lost one or both parents to AIDS.</p>
            <p eId="para_1547">We are totally committed to fighting HIV/AIDS and see our efforts as fundamental to poverty and vulnerability reduction. Between 2001 and the end of this year, we will have expended over €250 million on HIV/AIDS related programmes. Most of these resources are directed at the most affected countries, primarily in sub-Saharan Africa.</p>
            <p eId="para_1548">Ireland has Embassies and significant aid programmes in Ethiopia, Lesotho, Mozambique, South Africa, Tanzania, Uganda and Zambia. All these countries are hugely affected by HIV/AIDS and are struggling to control the spread and impact of the pandemic on their socio-economic bases.</p>
            <p eId="para_1549">Engagement and funding at country level supports a range of projects and programmes implemented by Governments and civil society organisations. These projects and programmes cover interventions that strengthen local institutional capacity to deal with HIV/AIDS; support the planning and delivery of essential HIV prevention, treatment and care services; provide basic needs for children orphaned by AIDS; support organisations and networks of people living with HIV; upgrade health care facilities and train health workers in HIV drug administration and management.</p>
            <p eId="para_1550">In Mozambique, we are working closely with the Government and the Clinton Foundation in the provision of HIV treatment services. Ireland has contributed to Mozambique's achievement in reaching and in some cases exceeding its HIV related service targets. In Lesotho, we also hope to build a partnership with the Government and the Clinton Foundation to address the HIV/AIDS crisis in that country.</p>
            <p eId="para_1551">As well as working directly at country level, Ireland also supports international efforts to address HIV/AIDS and its impact. The Global Fund to Fight AIDS, TB and Malaria is one such example. By the end of 2006, Ireland will have contributed €60 million to this Fund.</p>
            <p eId="para_1552">Irish Aid recently produced a report on its response and commitment to HIV/AIDS over the period 2001-2006. The Taoiseach presented this report to the United Nations Secretary General, Kofi Annan, when he met him during the High Level Review on HIV/AIDS held in New York at the end of May. In his address to the UN High Level Review, the Taoiseach pledged that we will spend €100 million per annum on addressing HIV/AIDS and other diseases of poverty.</p>
            <p eId="para_1553">We will continue to work with Government and civil society partners to ensure a coordinated, accelerated and more focused response to HIV/AIDS which prioritises prevention, particularly among young men and women.</p>

            <p eId="para_1556">I propose to take Questions Nos. 19 and 60 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_1557">Ireland has strongly supported the provision of humanitarian and development assistance to the Palestinian people. The core objective of Ireland's assistance in Palestine has been to alleviate the material consequences of the ongoing conflict by enhancing the capacity of Ireland's partners in Palestine to respond to the crisis and to begin, where possible, to meet the future development needs of the Palestinian people.</p>
            <p eId="para_1558">In 2005, Ireland delivered in excess of €4 million in humanitarian and development assistance to Palestine. Humanitarian assistance has been channelled through the United Nations Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA), which remains our key partner in the provision of basic services to the Palestinian people. In response to UNRWA's appeal for funding, Ireland provided early funding of €1.5 million to UNRWA in 2006. This was un-earmarked core funding which allows UNRWA to respond flexibly to the emerging challenges. Ireland will continue to respond to changing humanitarian needs in Palestine.</p>
            <p eId="para_1559">Our development funding has been focused on support for basic education, strengthening local government through local rural development programmes, and support for key United Nations' agencies.</p>
            <p eId="para_1560">We also provide significant support for civil society organisations in Palestine which work to promote human rights and democratisation and to facilitate community rehabilitation.</p>
            <p eId="para_1561">The Government is extremely conscious of the need to continue assistance to Palestine in the current difficult political climate. Ireland's programme of assistance in 2006 will include continued support for partner UN Agencies, NGOs and Bethlehem University. We have made clear that we are determined to maintain the overall volume of our assistance to Palestine.</p>
            <p eId="para_1562">We do not believe that the Palestinian people should face the risk of a humanitarian crisis because of the reluctance of their new Government to respect the peace process. However, there is agreement among all the Member States that the EU cannot maintain its capacity-building support for the Hamas Government under the Oslo process, given that the Government has not committed to the conditions set out by the Quartet and the EU.</p>
            <p eId="para_1563">This month, the European Council agreed that, as a matter of priority, a Temporary International Mechanism (TIM) should be established to provide for basic needs, including health services. Ireland has been to the fore in the EU in arguing for the widest possible definition of the basic needs to be covered.</p>
            <p eId="para_1564">I can assure the Deputy that Ireland will, both nationally and in the multilateral framework, do all that is within our capacity to alleviate the suffering of the Palestinian people and to pursue our development interventions to the extent possible, while being cognisant of the wider political realities.</p>
            <p eId="para_1565">The Government is also committed to the provision of humanitarian assistance to the Iraqi people. Since 2003, Ireland has delivered over €7 million to meet the immediate emergency humanitarian needs of some of the most vulnerable groups in that country. Funding has been delivered through key non-governmental partners such as Concern, Goal and Trócaire and through UN and international agencies such as the World Food Programme, the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF), the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (UNOCHA) and the Red Cross family. This year I have allocated €0.5 million to the Mines Advisory Group, a partner organisation to Trócaire, for mines clearance activities in northern Iraq. Funding will also be provided this year to support the provision of health services to the Marsh Arab population in Southern Iraq.</p>

            <p eId="para_1569">I was approached by sporting figures in Northern Ireland who were concerned that the requirements for Northern Ireland players were to change under FIFA regulations. The reported change would have had the effect of obliging all players who want to represent Northern Ireland to carry a British passport. This change, if brought into effect, would directly contravene both the spirit and the letter of the Good Friday Agreement and was, therefore, unacceptable.</p>
            <p eId="para_1570">On learning of the possibility of a change in FIFA's eligibility criteria, I immediately wrote to the President of UEFA to seek clarification of the issue. I also instructed the Irish Ambassador to Switzerland to make contact with both UEFA and FIFA to ensure that they understood the importance of finding a solution that respected the sensitivities of both the main traditions in Northern Ireland. In light of our serious concern, the Irish Embassy to Switzerland remained in intensive contact with FIFA, which culminated in a meeting, on 29 May, between the Ambassador and the Director of FIFA's legal division. In addition to contact at official level, I discussed our concerns with Secretary of State Hain at the British-Irish Council of 2 June. We agreed to adopt a joint position on this issue.</p>
            <p eId="para_1571">Subsequent to this, on 19 June, the Irish Football Association issued a statement on this subject. It said that while "the administrative detail of this is being finalised" a "solution has been reached which will allow players holding an Irish Passport to continue to represent Northern Ireland."</p>
            <p eId="para_1572">I am satisfied that a solution has been reached that respects the terms and the spirit of the Good Friday Agreement, and will allow Irish Passport holders to continue to play for Northern Ireland.</p>

            <p eId="para_1577">There are 3 categories of Specialists employed by Irish Aid: Principal Development Specialists, Senior Development Specialists, and Development Specialists.</p>
            <p eId="para_1578">Three Principal Development Specialists serve in Irish Aid headquarters in Dublin. None of the three has applied to decentralise to Limerick.</p>

            <p eId="para_1580">Finally, there are nine Development Specialist posts in headquarters. Five Development Specialists are scheduled to decentralise.

            <p eId="para_1581">Discussions are on-going with representatives of the Specialists, with their union IMPACT, and with the Department of Finance about the issues involved in decentralisation which also, of course, have a wider Civil Service dimension.

            <from>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern)</from>
            <p eId="para_1586">I propose to take Questions Nos. 22, 56, 86 and 92 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_1587">Ireland takes a consistently strong position on Burma, including in the European Union framework and at the United Nations. Together with our EU partners, we avail of all opportunities to call for the immediate release of Aung San Suu Kyi, to condemn the abuse of human rights and fundamental freedoms and deplore the lack of progress towards democracy in Burma.</p>
            <p eId="para_1588">The recent visit by UN Under-Secretary-General (UN USG) Gambari to Burma from 18-20 May was the first high-level visit to that country by a UN representative in more than two years. I welcome the fact that he was able to meet with the most senior Burmese leaders as well as with Aung San Suu Kyi and representatives of her party, the National League for Democracy, during the visit. I also welcome the agreement by the Burmese government that the UN should play a role in promoting common ground between the government and the National League for Democracy so that the National Convention, which is due to resume its work in October, can proceed in a more inclusive way. I would appeal to the Burmese authorities to live up to their undertakings in this regard.</p>
            <p eId="para_1589">While welcoming the above developments, I remain very concerned about the situation. On 26 May, the EU issued a statement which noted with deep concern that the process of democratisation in Burma had recently suffered a worrying setback as the Burmese government stepped up its pressure against ethnic groups and the two main political parties. The statement noted that these actions contradict the professed intention to establish a genuine democratic nation. The statement also urged the Burmese government to accelerate the democratisation process, a process which should engage all political and ethnic forces in the country in a genuine dialogue and lead to the speedy completion of a constitution under civilian rule, which commands popular support and promotes peaceful and sustainable development.</p>
            <p eId="para_1590">I remain deeply concerned that Aung San Suu Kyi has been detained continuously for three years without charge and, once more, urge the Burmese government to restore fully her freedom and civil liberties. UN USG Gambari's visit generated high hopes that her detention under house arrest, which was up for renewal a few days after he left Burma, might not be renewed by the authorities. This did not happen. On 27 May, the EU issued a further statement which deeply regretted the decision of the Burmese government to extend the house arrest of Aung San Suu Kyi and deplored the fact that international appeals, including that of the EU, had once again gone unheard.</p>
            <p eId="para_1591">The situation in Burma was most recently discussed at the EU General Affairs and External Council Meeting in Luxembourg on 12 June. On that occasion the Netherlands called for EU support for a possible initiative at the UN Security Council. While I am not aware of any plans for this to happen in the near future it is something I would very much welcome. The EU applies a range of sanctions and restrictive measures against Burma, referred to as the EU Common Position, which had been due to expire on 30 April but which has been renewed for a further year. In the absence of any significant progress in Burma, Ireland strongly supported the renewal.</p>
            <p eId="para_1592">The Government made an announcement about the establishment of diplomatic relations on a non-resident basis with Burma on 13 February 2004. However, given that the political and human rights progress which had been expected of the Burmese Authorities at that time, most notably the meeting of an open and unhindered National Convention and the release of Aung San Suu Kyi, was not delivered on, the Government decided to put the process in cold storage. Any decision to reactivate the process will have to await positive and significant moves on the above lines by the Burmese Government.</p>
            <p eId="para_1593">I will continue to raise concerns about Burma on all possible occasions and to call on the Burmese government to assume its responsibilities towards its people and to allow the fullest possible UN involvement in a genuine process of democratisation and reconciliation.</p>

            <p eId="para_1595">In the aftermath of Operation Murambatsvina launched by the Zimbabwean government in May 2005 and which resulted in an estimated 700,000 people being left homeless or without a livelihood, the former President of Mozambique, Mr. Joaquim Chissano, was requested by the African Union (AU) to act as a Special Envoy and mediate with both the Zimbabwean government and the opposition parties in Zimbabwe in an effort to promote political dialogue. However, the Zimbabwean government has refused to cooperate with this initiative or to engage with former President Chissano in his mediator role. The Zimbabwean government also refused to facilitate the visit in June 2005 of an earlier envoy appointed by the African Union, Mr. Tom Nyanduga, specifically to report on the consequences of Operation Murambatsvina.</p>
            <p eId="para_1596">I regret the unwillingness to date of the Zimbabwean government to cooperate with AU efforts to promote internal dialogue and mediate in the current difficult situation in Zimbabwe. I would encourage the AU and its member States to continue to use what influence they have to urge the Zimbabwean government to alter its current failed policies and move to a path of internal dialogue and peaceful, democratic change in Zimbabwe. The Government along with our EU partners will continue to work with all those in the international community seeking to promote democratic change in Zimbabwe. Senior officials from my Department availed of recent political consultations with South Africa in Pretoria on 22-23 June to outline the serious concerns which we have regarding Zimbabwe.</p>
            <p eId="para_1597">I also welcome the increased engagement by the UN Security Council and the efforts of Secretary General Annan and his Humanitarian Coordinator, Jan Egeland, to highlight the serious humanitarian situation in Zimbabwe. I understand that Secretary General Annan may meet with President Mugabe and President Mbeki of South Africa en marge of the forthcoming AU Summit in Banjul, The Gambia on 1-2 July. The AU Summit itself will provide a further valuable opportunity for African leaders to address, and encourage efforts to improve, the serious political, economic and humanitarian situation in Zimbabwe.</p>

            <p eId="para_1602">I propose to take Questions Nos. 25, 37, 88 and 158 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_1603">Accession negotiations are underway with two countries — Turkey and Croatia. Negotiations were opened with both countries on 3 October 2005 and an extensive screening process is currently ongoing, which scrutinises the compatibility of Croatian and Turkish legislation with that of the EU. The fact that this screening process is running in parallel with both countries does not mean that the pace of their progress towards membership is linked. Each country will be judged on its own merits.</p>
            <p eId="para_1604">After a negotiating chapter has been screened the EU can decide, on the basis of a proposal from the Commission, whether the negotiations in that sector can be opened. The June 2006 European Council reviewed progress made to date and welcomed the opening — and provisional closure — of substantive negotiations with both countries on the "Science &amp; Research" chapter. In all, there are 35 chapters that form part of these negotiations.</p>
            <p eId="para_1605">The European Council reaffirmed the EU's commitment to supporting both countries' efforts to comply with the Union's membership criteria. It encouraged Croatia to continue its reform efforts and to achieve sustainable progress towards the fulfilment of EU standards. It called on Turkey to intensify its reform process, implementing it fully and effectively so as to ensure its irreversibility and sustainability.</p>
            <p eId="para_1606">The Council recalled the need for Turkey to fulfil its obligations under the Association Agreement and its Additional Protocol, which takes account of the accession of the new Member States, including the Republic of Cyprus. Turkey's progress in fulfilling these obligations, which include the need to recognise the economic, maritime and navigational rights of all EU Member States, as well as its implementation of the revised Accession Partnership, will be evaluated later this year.</p>
            <p eId="para_1607">The European Council also addressed a number of general questions on enlargement. It reaffirmed that it would honour existing enlargement commitments, while protecting the cohesion and the effectiveness of the Union. The Union's capacity to absorb new members is seen as an important consideration in future enlargement decisions. If EU membership is to be further extended, the Union will need to ensure that it has the economic, political and institutional capacity to make this possible. It is already understood that, as Turkey's accession could have substantial financial consequences, its negotiations can only be concluded after the establishment of the Union's financial framework for the period beyond 2013.</p>
            <p eId="para_1608">Heads of State and Government undertook to hold a further debate at the December 2006 European Council on all aspects of further enlargement, including the Union's capacity to absorb new members and improving the quality of the enlargement process. The Commission is to prepare a special report on the Union's absorption capacity. This report will also deal with the perception of enlargement by European citizens and the need to explain the enlargement process adequately to the public within the Union.</p>
            <p eId="para_1609">Ireland has always been supportive of the process of EU enlargement from which we have consistently benefited. It has been our policy to consider each candidate on the basis of its own merits and this principle will continue to underpin our approach to the negotiations with both Croatia and Turkey.</p>

            <p eId="para_1615">I propose to take Questions Nos. 26, 41, 83, 97 and 101 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_1616">The forthcoming accession of Bulgaria and Romania will mark the completion of the Union's 5th enlargement — increasing its membership from 15 to 27 Member States.</p>
            <p eId="para_1617">The June European Council confirmed that it is the Union's common objective to welcome both countries as members on 1 January 2007. The EU could, however, postpone the accession of either or both countries for up to one year if the Commission considers that either country would be unprepared to meet the requirements of membership in 2007.</p>
            <p eId="para_1618">On 16 May 2006, Enlargement Commissioner Olli Rehn presented the Commission's Comprehensive Monitoring Reports on Bulgaria and Romania to the European Parliament. He confirmed that their accession on 1 January 2007 remains an achievable goal for both countries. They need to make progress in addressing the outstanding issues highlighted in the monitoring reports. A final decision on the date of accession will be taken in light of the Commission's next monitoring reports which are due in October.</p>
            <p eId="para_1619">Some of the problem areas that remain are common to both countries, particularly in relation to putting in place the necessary arrangement for the disbursement of EU funds. In the agricultural area, both countries need to set up a proper, integrated administration and control system.</p>
            <p eId="para_1620">While both countries need to sustain their efforts in reforming the judiciary and fighting corruption, Bulgaria has been urged to devote special attention to this area. In its most recent report, the Commission stated that "Bulgaria needs to complete the reform of the judiciary, ensure tangible results, and take the additional steps to guarantee its independence". The Bulgarian Government has formulated an Action Plan aimed at addressing the remaining problem areas highlighted in the Commission's report. This includes further measures aimed at improving the independence of the judiciary. Their progress will be further assessed in the next Commission report.</p>
            <p eId="para_1621">Ireland believes that both Bulgaria and Romania need to make full use of the time available to address the remaining issues so that they can join the Union, as planned, on 1 January 2007. We hope that they will succeed in their efforts. Ireland very much looks forward to working with both countries as partners in a successful Union of 27 Member States.</p>

      asked the

     when Ireland will ratify the Optional Protocol of the United Nations Convention against Torture in view of the departure from equivalence as far as the Good Friday Agreement is concerned.

            <p eId="para_1623">I refer the Deputy to my response of 10th November, 2005.</p>
            <p eId="para_1624">On 18 December 2002, the Third Committee of the United Nations General Assembly adopted the Draft Optional Protocol to the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment (OP-CAT). Ireland, along with other EU partners, fully supported the draft Optional Protocol and worked for its adoption at the UN General Assembly and the Commission on Human Rights.</p>
            <p eId="para_1625">The object of the Protocol is to establish a system of regular visits undertaken both by an independent international body and by national bodies to places of detention with a view to preventing torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment. The international body is to be a subcommittee of the UN Committee against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment. At the national level, States may maintain, designate or establish one or several bodies for the prevention of torture at the domestic level.</p>
            <p eId="para_1626">As regards our signature of the Optional Protocol, with a view to subsequent ratification, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform informed the Dáil on Tuesday, 8 November, that he is reviewing national legislation to ascertain whether legislative changes would be required before signature and ratification of the Optional Protocol. I understand that he has commenced consultations with other Government Departments and Bodies, including the Department of Health and Children and the Department of Education and Science, in relation to arrangements for the inspection of institutions for which they are responsible.</p>
            <p eId="para_1627">While it is the case that the UK has already ratified the Optional Protocol, I do not believe that this creates any substantive disparity between the two parts of the island. Significant protection in relation to torture already exists in this jurisdiction. Ireland has ratified the European Convention for the Prevention of Torture and Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment (entered into force for Ireland on 1 February 1989). That Convention establishes a visiting system predating but similar to that established under OP-CAT. We understand that the Committee for the Prevention of Torture (CPT, the body established under that Convention) has already conducted 3 visits to Ireland in 1993, 1998 and 2002 and is due to visit again this year.</p>

            <p eId="para_1630">I propose to take Questions Nos. 28 and 71 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_1631">The ambition of the EU to be able to respond quickly to emerging crises has, and continues to be, a key objective of the development of the European Security and Defence Policy (ESDP). An important aspect of ESDP is the development of a standby military rapid response capacity, in the form of Battlegroups. Almost all EU Member States have already made a commitment to contribute to a specific battlegroup formation. Apart from Ireland, the only countries which have not done so are Denmark, which is in a special position due to its opt-out in this area, and Malta. Ireland has indicated to its EU partners a positive disposition to taking part in battlegroups.</p>
            <p eId="para_1632">As I have previously reported to the House, a delegation consisting of representatives from the Departments of Defence and Foreign Affairs and the Defence Forces met with their Swedish counterparts in Stockholm on 10 March 2006 to discuss possible participation by the Defence Forces in the Nordic battlegroup, which is due to be on standby during the first half of 2008. Our representatives outlined Ireland's position in relation to battlegroup participation and international peacekeeping generally and gave a presentation on the capabilities which Ireland could make available to a battlegroup.</p>
            <p eId="para_1633">The legal, operational and other issues surrounding participation in battlegroups were considered by an interdepartmental working group established by the Minister for Defence, which included representatives of my own Department. The report of the working group was considered by the Cabinet Committee on European Affairs and, informally, by the Government. Following this report, my colleague the Minister for Defence decided to introduce legislation to amend the Defence Acts. On 20 June 2006, the Government approved the introduction of the Defence (Amendment) Bill 2006, which was debated in the Seanad on 27-28 June and will be debated in the Dáil on 5 July 2006.</p>
            <p eId="para_1634">Regarding our possible participation in the Nordic Battlegroup, my colleague, the Minister for Defence informed the House on 22 June 2006 that the consultations with Sweden, including technical discussions on a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) and on the specific nature of our contribution, are continuing. Any decision on a specific contribution to the Nordic, or any other, battlegroup would, of course, be subject to formal Government approval.</p>

            <from>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern)</from>
            <p eId="para_1636">The United Nations has for some time been considering the question of a new international legal instrument aimed at the protection and promotion of the human rights of persons with disabilities. The process formally began on 19 December 2001 when the UN General Assembly established an Ad Hoc Committee (AHC) whose mandate it is to consider proposals for a comprehensive and integral international convention to promote and protect the dignity and rights of persons with disabilities.</p>
            <p eId="para_1637">To date seven sessions of the AHC have taken place. These sessions have been held in New York twice a year since 2002. Ireland has been represented by officials from several Departments, including the Department of Foreign Affairs and the Department of Justice, Equality &amp; Law Reform. The policy issues being discussed at the AHC are primarily ones on which domestic Government Departments lead, but my Department has a co-ordinating role.</p>
            <p eId="para_1638">Ireland has participated actively in EU discussions on the proposed Convention and supports the agreed EU common position on the matter. The EU has expressed its support for an international convention anchored by certain fundamental principles, including: non-discrimination, equality of opportunity, autonomy, participation and integration.</p>
            <p eId="para_1639">Together with our EU partners, Ireland believes that the guiding principle of any new legally-binding instrument in relation to the human rights of persons with disabilities that will emerge from these discussions should be to ensure that persons with disabilities can better enjoy their human rights. We consider that a new legally-binding instrument should facilitate the implementation of existing rights in the specific situations faced by persons with disabilities.</p>
            <p eId="para_1640">Ireland has also been particularly active in ensuring civil society participation in the drafting process. We have funded participation by disability NGOs. In addition Ireland has pressed the EU to underline the importance of maintaining the unprecedented level of NGO participation in the drafting process.</p>
            <p eId="para_1641">At the most recent AHC session, in January 2006, the Committee's Chair, drawing on earlier discussions and previous texts, proposed a compromise text which continues to be the subject of discussions.</p>
            <p eId="para_1642">There is however agreement on large parts of the Chair's text of the draft Convention. The document outlines the general obligations of States in relation to the rights of persons with disabilities. The draft treaty includes references to certain civil and political rights, such as the right to freedom of expression and the right to privacy, and also to certain economic and social rights such as the right to education and the right to health. It specifies that discrimination on the grounds of disability is impermissible, and provides that persons with disabilities be given the equal opportunity to enjoy their human rights.</p>
            <p eId="para_1643">Questions that remain outstanding include: the inclusion of a definition of disability, monitoring provisions of the Convention, accessibility to the built environment, legal capacity, enforced detention of persons with disability and involuntary treatment.</p>
            <p eId="para_1644">The 8th session of the AHC will begin on 15 August 2006. The Chair believes agreement on the draft instrument can be reached in August and has expressed his wish to see the draft Convention adopted this autumn at the 61st session of the United Nations General Assembly.</p>

          <speech by="#DermotAhern" as="#Minister_for_Foreign_Affairs" eId="spk_639">
            <from>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern)</from>
            <p eId="para_1646">The UN Human Rights Council is at present holding its inaugural session in Geneva. The current session began on 19 June and will continue until the end of this week. The next session will take place in September.</p>
            <p eId="para_1647">My colleague, Minister of State Noel Treacy T.D., addressed this new body on behalf of the Government on 20 June. He called for the new UN Human Rights Council to make itself fully relevant by confronting the very real and practical human rights challenges which the world faces today. He also presented Ireland's view that there should now be a decisive shift to effective implementation of the standards elaborated by the Council's predecessor, the Commission on Human Rights.</p>
            <p eId="para_1648">In addition, the Minister argued that some of the best aspects of the Commission must be preserved and, in particular, that the active engagement of the Commission with civil society on human rights issues should continue. He underlined Ireland's commitment to a positive and constructive environment within the Council, but emphasised that the Council must also be frank in addressing wilful neglect and violation of international human rights.</p>
            <p eId="para_1649">Two significant innovations may contribute to the effectiveness of the new body. It will meet more frequently during the year, thus potentially allowing a greater capacity to deal with human rights violations in real time. Secondly, it will develop a system of universal periodic review of States' human rights records, which may help address the argument of selectivity levelled against its predecessor. Ireland, together with our EU partners, will seek to shape the periodic review mechanism so that it provides a credible and effective oversight process.</p>
            <p eId="para_1650">In terms of its composition, States are elected to the 47 member Council by the General Assembly on the basis of regional allocation of seats. The first elections to the new UN Human Rights Council took place on 9 May 2006. A table showing those States elected is set out below.</p>
            <p eId="para_1651">The General Assembly Resolution establishing the Council included a number of provisions aimed at addressing concerns relating to the human rights records of its members. Whereas election to the former Commission on Human Rights was by a simple majority of States present and voting in the General Assembly, members of the Human Rights Council have to receive the support of an absolute majority of the General Assembly. In addition, States are elected by secret ballot.</p>
            <p eId="para_1652">Prospective members of the Council are also obliged to commit themselves to upholding the highest standards in the promotion and protection of human rights, and they will be the first to be scrutinised under the new universal periodic review mechanism.</p>
            <p eId="para_1653">A mechanism has also been established to allow for the expulsion of a member of the Council if it is deemed by a two-thirds majority of the General Assembly to be responsible for gross and systematic violations of human rights. In this general regard, Ireland and our European Union partners have undertaken not to vote for any State that is subject to Security Council sanctions for human rights related reasons.</p>
            <p eId="para_1654">I am confident this new body can represent a fresh start and, in particular, that it has the potential to contribute significantly to the UN's active engagement on human rights issues.</p>

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs (Mr. C. Lenihan)</from>
            <p eId="para_1704">The Government's programme of assistance to developing countries reflects our longstanding commitment to human rights and fairness in international relations and the recognition that democratisation, good governance and the promotion of human rights are as important as economic policy and reform for reducing poverty and achieving development.</p>
            <p eId="para_1705">Support to good governance and democratisation is now a major priority area of expenditure in the development cooperation programme, accounting for over €103 million in 2005 — up from €88 million in 2004. This included support for pro-democracy initiatives in twenty-four countries worldwide in the areas of: support for NGO-based pro-democracy initiatives (five countries); support for election monitoring (thirteen countries); and support through the country programme budget of Irish Aid in the priority programme countries (six countries). Support for NGO-based pro-democracy initiatives: Examples of the type of programme supported include: In Sierra Leone, €116,000 was disbursed in 2005 to support democratisation through the "Accountability in Local Government Initiative", which seeks to encourage citizens to take an active role in local development planning, local government meetings and the preparation and monitoring of budgets.</p>
            <p eId="para_1706">In Peru, €314,342 was provided from 2004 to 2006 for a project which aims to contribute to the human development, democratisation and construction of a culture of peace in indigenous communities affected by the armed conflict.</p>
            <p eId="para_1707">In The Philippines , €234,439 was granted from 2004 to 2005 for a project aimed at "Strengthening the democratic processes in Local Government".</p>
            <p eId="para_1708">In South Africa, Ireland supports prominent NGOs such as the Centre for the Study of Violence and Reconciliation, the Human Rights Foundation and the South Africa Institute for Democracy. Support for Election Monitoring: In 2005, 60 monitors participated in 13 international election missions, mainly through the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) and the European Union. These missions were to Albania, Afghanistan, Azerbaijan, Burundi, Ethiopia, Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia (FYROM), Liberia, Moldova, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Palestine, Sri Lanka and Venezuela. Expenditure in 2005 was €110,074.</p>
            <p eId="para_1709">In 2006, 57 election monitors have so far participated in 11 international election missions in Palestine, Ukraine, Uganda, Belarus, Haiti, Fiji, Republic of Montenegro (Serbia &amp; Montenegro), Bolivia, Democratic Republic of Congo, Nicaragua and Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia (FYROM). Irish Aid support in the bilateral country programmes Good Governance is a key component in all of Irish Aid's bilateral country programmes. In Uganda, €7 million is being provided for assistance for governance initiatives, including support to the Justice, Law and Order Sector, targeted at improving citizens' access to justice, the Uganda Human Rights Commission, and an anti-corruption group. In Mozambique, five main areas are being supported: justice; democratisation; Human Rights; anti-corruption and civil society participation, for a total of €2.75 million. Support to local governance initiatives in Tanzania will total €5.7 million. In Timor-Leste (East Timor), €300,000 was provided in 2005 for governance initiatives including support to government and civil society organisations to promote democracy and human rights. In Vietnam, €950,000 was given in 2005 to support local government, assist in legal development and strengthen the capacity of the National Assembly and People's elected bodies in the interests of increasing transparency and accountability. Governance is a major area of emphasis in Ireland's assistance to Ethiopia. In 2005, €4.5 million supported strengthening of the public sector, civil service reform, Parliamentary institutions, local NGOs active on Human Rights issues and prisoner support organisations.</p>

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs (Mr. C. Lenihan)</from>
            <p eId="para_1712">I propose to take Questions Nos. 32 and 154 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_1713">The complex series of factors which contribute to the enormous needs we encounter in Africa include food insecurity, poverty, environmental degradation, weak governmental capacity and policies, unequal global trading relationships, protracted conflict, severe infrastructural weaknesses, poor governance, debt and the effects of HIV/AIDS.</p>
            <p eId="para_1714">Addressing Africa's needs, especially the interests of the poorest and most vulnerable, necessitates a comprehensive and coordinated series of actions by the international community and African Governments. In order to measure development progress and to set benchmarks, the United Nations has developed the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), which were endorsed by the leaders of the world in 2000.</p>
            <p eId="para_1715">While the MDGs are undoubtedly ambitious, they can be reached if all stakeholders, the affected countries themselves, the donor community, the UN and EU work together to ensure that poverty reduction, good governance and sustainable development are the cornerstones of all our efforts in Africa.</p>
            <p eId="para_1716">For Ireland, Africa is at the heart of the programme of official development assistance and our approach has a number of distinct but complementary elements. As regards the immediate challenges of natural disasters, conflict and food crisis, our humanitarian budget is a key instrument in meeting immediate needs. Our recovery and long-term development programmes seek to assist countries emerging from natural and man-made emergencies and also address the underlying causes of poverty in all its manifestations.</p>
            <p eId="para_1717">Long-term development is the core of our aid programme in Africa. We have a strong partnership with six countries in sub-Saharan Africa, namely Ethiopia, Lesotho, Mozambique, Tanzania, Uganda and Zambia. We are assisting the Governments and peoples of these Programme Countries to address the fundamental causes of poverty through promoting good governance, delivery of essential basic needs, including the fight against HIV/AIDS and promoting economic growth.</p>
            <p eId="para_1718">In addition, we work in many other African countries, either directly or through our partnerships with the United Nations, the Red Cross family and NGOs such as Concern, Goal, Trócaire, Oxfam and others. In the context of an increasing aid budget, as we approach the UN target of 0.7% of GNP by 2012, these interventions are being further strengthened through enhanced support at the global and country levels.</p>
            <p eId="para_1719">Ireland's approach to efforts to promote security and stability in Africa includes our contribution to the security and stability of Liberia through the deployment of troops with UNMIL, the UN Mission in Liberia, since 2003. Ireland has also provided assistance to the African Union (AU) Mission in Sudan (AMIS), as part of the EU's joint actions to foster peace and security in Darfur. In addition, we have pledged support to the UN's Peace Building Fund and have been strongly supportive of the establishment of the Peace Building Commission. We are actively seeking ways to support regional organisations in Africa, particularly the AU which represents an important strategic partner for the European Union and the international community generally.</p>
            <p eId="para_1720">The challenges facing Africa are enormous. But there is some encouraging news. Many African economies are growing. Inflation, now averaging 8% a year, is at its lowest level in many African countries since soon after independence. While there are exceptions such as Somalia, Zimbabwe and others, many African countries now have less violence and civil strife than for many years. There is relative peace in Sierra Leone, Liberia, Angola and southern Sudan. The Democratic Republic of Congo is preparing for elections next month. We must build on progress. We must address continuing needs. Through our growing aid programme, we will continue to make a difference on the ground in Africa and to work with all donors, including the UN and EU, to make a real and lasting difference in the lives of the poorest in Africa.</p>

            <p eId="para_1724">I propose to take Questions Nos. 33, 53 and 148 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_1725">I would refer the Deputies to my statement in Dáil Éireann on 13 June 2006, in which I addressed in some detail the most recent Council of Europe report, that of Senator Dick Marty, the rapporteur appointed by the Committee on Legal Affairs of the Parliamentary Assembly.</p>
            <p eId="para_1726">Despite the pervasive lack of hard evidence contained in Senator Marty's report, it makes for disturbing reading in relation to the details provided of some specific cases in other countries. It confirms why we are right to oppose extraordinary rendition. As regards the specific case of Ireland, however, Senator Marty's report produces absolutely no new evidence which would support allegations that the Government is in any way colluding in the practice.</p>
            <p eId="para_1727">In addition to the shortcomings of the evidence contained in Senator Marty's report, there is a lack of a clear chain of reasoning: it contains simply some very cursory assertions, including one that Ireland "could be held responsible for collusion" for being a "stopover" for flights involving the unlawful transfer of detainees. I utterly reject this assertion, which seems to be based on a quite implausible and ill-founded analysis of what might conceivably have been possible for us to do.</p>
            <p eId="para_1728">Moreover, Senator Marty fails to take account of our complete opposition to extraordinary rendition and the categoric assurances we have received that it does not take place through Ireland. To allege collusion without addressing either of those points is quite unfair. I would remind the House that neither Senator Marty, nor anyone acting on his behalf, has approached or addressed a single query in this respect to the Government or to our Permanent Representative to the Council of Europe.</p>
            <p eId="para_1729">I would reiterate the Government's intention to consider carefully with partners any specific and workable recommendations that may be made by the Council of Europe in this area. I would anticipate that if such recommendations emerge-whether through the Parliamentary Assembly or the Secretary General-they will require coordinated action at a European level if they are to be implemented in an effective manner.</p>

            <p eId="para_1732">I propose to take Questions Nos. 35 and 163 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_1733">The famine of 1991 occurred in the same year as the overthrow of the government of Said Barre. For 15 years, civil war raged and Somalia was widely seen as a 'failed state'. However, in recent years, there have been some positive developments despite current difficulties.</p>
            <p eId="para_1734">A National Reconciliation Conference, the fourteenth attempt to re-establish central government in the country, began in Kenya in October 2002 with financial support from Ireland and the EU. It resulted in the creation of Transitional Federal Institutions (TFIs) including the Transitional Federal Parliament (TFP) which, in October 2004, elected President Abdullahi Yusuf Ahmed. The Transitional Federal Government (TFG) was inaugurated in December 2004. The formal relocation to Somalia of the TFIs began in June 2005. The first session of the TFP on Somali soil was held in Baidoa on 26 February 2006 with about 80 per cent of deputies in attendance. The TFP has continued its work since then and has made progress on some important initiatives including the National Security and Stabilisation Plan.</p>
            <p eId="para_1735">However, during the spring of 2006, Mogadishu experienced an upturn in violence as conflict escalated between the clan-based warlords who had controlled the city and a grouping called the Union of Islamic Courts. By mid-June, the Union of Islamic Courts had seized control of most of Mogadishu and some of the surrounding region. The TFG responded by sacking those ministers who had been involved in the conflict as warlords and declaring itself ready for dialogue with the Union of Islamic Courts. In its capacity as chair of the Arab League, the Government of Sudan hosted the first high-level talks between the two sides in Khartoum leading to an agreement on mutual recognition on 22 June. It is now likely that future talks will be held in Somalia.</p>
            <p eId="para_1736">The chairman of the Union of Islamic Courts, Sharif Sheikh Ahmed, has written to the United Nations, the European Union and the United States, calling for the establishment of friendly relations with the international community, based on mutual respect. Ireland, together with its EU partners, will continue to support a political solution as the only way to provide stability to the people of Somalia. I therefore look forward to ongoing dialogue between the TFG and the Union of Islamic Courts. The EU fully supports the efforts of the TFG to extend peace, stability and effective governance based on the rule of law throughout Somalia.</p>
            <p eId="para_1737">I condemn the murder of Swedish cameraman Martin Adler. I understand he was filming a demonstration in Mogadishu when he was killed on 23 June.</p>
            <p eId="para_1738">Somalia is one of the countries worst-affected by the drought currently afflicting the Horn of Africa. In many ways this sad situation demonstrates the link between peace and development. Fifteen years of conflict have destroyed infrastructure and livelihoods. In response to the current crisis, the Government has allocated €2.947 million in emergency humanitarian funding to Somalia so far this year. This is in addition to almost €3 million in emergency funding provided to a range of non-governmental organisations and UN agencies for programmes in Somalia in the 2004-2005 period. A further €1 million was apportioned to Concern and Trócaire under the Multi-Annual Programme in 2005.</p>

            <p eId="para_1742">The debt burden is accepted as being a serious factor in retarding the progress of the poorest countries from achieving development. Ireland's principal commitment at present in the area of debt relief and debt cancellation is to the Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative (MDRI) at the World Bank/IDA. The Minister for Finance has pledged €59 million as Ireland's contribution to this programme, which comes into effect on 1 July and will continue until 2044. The total amount of debt relief planned by the World Bank is US$37 billion. Exceptionally, Ireland intends to pay the full amount of its contribution in the present year. This decision not only underlines Ireland's continued support for 100% debt relief for the poorest countries but also helps to ensure that the World Bank/IDA is adequately funded and is enabled to continue providing credit to developing countries.</p>
            <p eId="para_1743">The MDRI is expected to provide debt relief initially for 17 heavily-indebted poor countries (HIPC) which have already reached completion point in the existing HIPC programme, that is to say they have fulfilled all the conditions of financial and economic management prescribed by the World Bank. Other heavily-indebted countries may qualify in due course.</p>
            <p eId="para_1744">The HIPC debt relief programme initiated in 1996 was open to 42 countries, of which eighteen have now reached completion point. A number of other countries are still in the process and may reach completion point later. Ireland contributed €30 million to this programme. However, although substantial amounts of debt were cancelled, it became apparent that the programme had not taken sufficient account of the levels of poverty and of other problems such as HIV/AIDS in the participatin g countries. Ireland has taken the view that a country's requirement to repay debt must not prevent it from maintaining an adequate level of expenditure on services such as education, health and water supply.</p>
            <p eId="para_1745">Under the MDRI now coming into effect, the yearly value of the debts being cancelled could be up to US$700 million. While the impact of debt relief measures taken to date requires further analysis, it is clear that debt relief alone will not solve the problems of poverty and indebtedness. Even if all of the relief in the MDRI programme turned into new money in developing country budgets, it would still be less than one-fiftieth of the increase in annual aid budgets which the World Bank estimates is needed to achieve the internationally agreed Millennium Development Goals.</p>

            <p eId="para_1750">The EU-US Summit, which took place in Vienna on 21 June 2006, provided an opportunity for both sides to underline the strength of the EU-US relationship in terms of trade and investment but also increasingly as partners in handling difficult situations around the globe. The Summit included discussions on, inter alia, foreign policy, energy security, economy and trade. The promotion of democracy was the main theme in the foreign policy discussion with a particular focus on Iran and the Middle East. There was also a substantive exchange of views on Guantánamo. Discussion in relation to extraordinary rendition concentrated on the need to continue a dialogue that is underway between legal experts from the EU Member States and the US on the legal and human rights issues arising from efforts to combat terrorism.</p>
            <p eId="para_1751">In the Summit Declaration, both the EU and the US agreed to intensify efforts to promote peace, democracy, freedom, the rule of law and respect for human rights in the world to make it more secure, safe and prosperous for all mankind. The EU and US undertook to implement international obligations in respect of global challenges such as measures to combat terrorism, non-proliferation, natural disasters and pandemics, whilst also ensuring that human rights law, refugee law and international humanitarian law are complied with fully.</p>
            <p eId="para_1752">Ireland was fully involved in negotiations on the Summit Declaration. The broad themes set out in the Declaration represent an implicit consensus between the EU and the US and are fully in line with our national approach. The outcome of the Summit represents the continuing improvement of the transatlantic relationship which has been evident since the Dromoland Castle Summit held under the last Irish Presidency of the EU in June 2004.</p>

            <p eId="para_1757">I propose to take Questions Nos. 40 and 51 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_1758">Agreement on the basis for US-India civil nuclear cooperation was reached on 2 March 2006 between President Bush and Prime Minister Singh during the former's visit to India. Under the agreement, India has agreed, inter alia, to identify and separate civilian and military nuclear facilities and programmes and to file a declaration regarding its civilian facilities with the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). India has agreed to classify 14 of its 22 nuclear power reactors as civilian facilities and voluntarily to place these under IAEA safeguards.</p>
            <p eId="para_1759">The 45 participating countries of the Nuclear Suppliers Group (NSG), including Ireland, have agreed guidelines governing the export of items that are specially designed or prepared for nuclear use and for nuclear related dual-use items and technologies. Under these guidelines the export of such items to India is prohibited and the question has arisen whether the guidelines should be changed or an exemption granted to India. Ireland has been an active participant in discussions on the US-India deal within the NSG. As Minister of State Tracey anticipated in the House on 24 May, the NSG Plenary, which took place in Brasilia from 29 May to 2 June, was not asked to take any decision on the issue. Instead, we received an update on developments since the last NSG discussion in March and agreed to return to the matter in October, when more information might be available.</p>
            <p eId="para_1760">This Agreement is a complex matter on which our analysis is still continuing. Not all of the details of what precisely is involved are yet clear and we would wish to have the fullest possible information in order to make a considered judgment. We have been active in asking many questions on those aspects where we needed greater clarity in order to assist our own analysis. This is the case, for example, with regard to the safeguards agreement that India has yet to negotiate with the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). Our final view will ultimately depend on our assessment of the potential impact of the US-India deal on the global non-proliferation regime, and on the approach taken by like-minded countries.</p>
            <p eId="para_1761">There are differing views, internationally, as to the potential impact of the deal on the global regime and on the NPT, in particular. The recently released report of the Commission on Weapons of Mass Destruction, chaired by Hans Blix, has, for example, concluded that the compatibility, or otherwise, of the US-India deal with the NPT is a matter of judgment. The Director General of the International Atomic Energy Agency, Mohammed El Baradei, has also noted in a recent op-ed piece that this is a complex issue on which intelligent people can disagree and that, ultimately, it comes down to a balance of judgment.</p>
            <p eId="para_1762">As Minister of State Tracey made clear in the House on 24 May, while we have still to reach a final, considered and informed judgment on the matter, we do have genuine concerns about what appears to be envisaged. We continue to see the NPT as a unique and irreplaceable multilateral instrument for maintaining and reinforcing international peace and security. The Treaty establishes a legal framework both for preventing the further proliferation of nuclear weapons and for the elimination of existing nuclear weapons through the obligation to pursue nuclear disarmament. We will remain committed to the universalisation of the NPT and will continue to call upon all States not party to the Treaty, including India to accede as non nuclear weapon States.</p>

            <p eId="para_1768">The European Council on 15/16 June accepted that more time and further work are needed before firm decisions can be taken on the future of the EU Constitution, which has now been ratified by 15 Member States. The European Council expressed the hope that the ratification process will be completed.</p>
            <p eId="para_1769">There is no specific deadline for the ratification of the European Constitution, and I do not think that setting a strict deadline would be helpful. Clearly, the original target date of November 2006 for the entry into force of the Constitution will not now be met.</p>
            <p eId="para_1770">The European Council Conclusions envisage extensive consultations with Member States culminating in a Presidency report in the first half of 2007. The Council Conclusions mention 2008 as the date by which the necessary steps will have been taken to allow the process advance. This represents a shared commitment to take the necessary decisions by that time.</p>
            <p eId="para_1771">Ratification of the Constitution is a matter for each Member State. In Ireland, ratification will, of course, be by referendum. Following last year's "No" votes in France and the Netherlands, the Government decided that no date would be set for the referendum until the overall situation becomes clearer at the European level.</p>

            <p eId="para_1776">NEPAD, the New Partnership for Africa's Development, is an African-owned and led initiative which is intended to eradicate poverty and promote and achieve sustainable development in Africa in the 21st century. It is based on the recognition that the primary responsibility for Africa's future lies not in the hands of donors or multilateral institutions but in the actions of Africa's governments and peoples. NEPAD has been adopted by the African Union as its socio-economic programme and has also been endorsed by the UN General Assembly which has urged international support for its implementation.</p>
            <p eId="para_1777">NEPAD is ambitious in its scope, both in seeking to create the conditions for sustainable development in Africa, through promotion of peace and security, democracy and good governance, and in attempting to promote policy reforms and increased investment in key economic sectors, such as agriculture, human development, infrastructure, education and energy. A development plan for the agricultural sector, the CAADP (Comprehensive Africa Agriculture Development Programme), has been agreed though implementation to date has been limited.</p>
            <p eId="para_1778">The major progress achieved to date through NEPAD has been the African Peer Review Mechanism which scrutinises, monitors and reports on progress in good governance (both political and economic) through a forum of Heads of State of participating countries. Twenty-six countries, including Irish Aid's six programme countries in Africa, have so far signed up to the APRM while the first two formal reviews, of Ghana and Rwanda, have now been completed. The report on Ghana was published in April 2006 and the Ghanaian government has now prepared a programme for follow-up implementation. The report on Rwanda will be considered at the next APRM Heads of Government Forum to be held later this year and will hopefully be published thereafter.</p>
            <p eId="para_1779">Ireland's policy in relation to heavily-indebted poor countries has concentrated on the need to relieve the burden of debt in order to permit adequate public expenditure on necessary services to reduce poverty, including health, education, water and sanitation.</p>

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs (Mr. C. Lenihan)</from>
            <p eId="para_1782">I propose to take Questions Nos. 45 and 57 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_1783">The Rapid Response Initiative aims at strengthening Ireland's operational response to humanitarian crises. Ireland already plays a key role in supporting the UN, the International Red Cross family and Non-Governmental Organisations (NGOs) to respond to humanitarian emergencies abroad. The Asian Tsunami of December 2004, the remarkable response of the Irish public to that catastrophe and the UN agenda for humanitarian reform have convinced me that Ireland can and should enhance its humanitarian response.</p>
            <p eId="para_1784">My Department is leading on the rapid response initiative but is working closely with other Departments, including in particular the Department of Defence. I envisage that this initiative will enable us to work closely with other Departments, including on the release of key skilled people to take part in emergency teams deployed to make rapid needs assessments and assist in the coordination of relief.</p>
            <p eId="para_1785">The three main components of the initiative are the pre-positioning and transportation of material humanitarian supplies to disaster locations; the creation of a register of highly skilled and experienced individuals for deployment with agencies at short notice; and an overall enhancement of our support to international humanitarian response agencies and mechanisms.</p>
            <p eId="para_1786">The first element of this initiative will see Ireland pre-positioning humanitarian supplies. The rapid availability and deployment of material supplies such as shelter, food, water and sanitation equipment are key elements for a successful response to an emergency, whether natural or man-made. Recent humanitarian emergencies, such as the Pakistan earthquake, have shown that gaps exist in the surge capacity of the international community to deploy an adequate level of humanitarian supplies quickly.</p>
            <p eId="para_1787">I am proposing that we help to address this gap by pre-positioning supplies in two specific sectors — shelter and water/sanitation. The exercise is being undertaken in close co-operation with the United Nations, which has the leading role in international emergency response. It is my intention that some of these humanitarian supplies will be stored in Ireland, with the assistance of the Department of Defence and the Defence Forces, and a further stock will be located at an international hub managed by the United Nations.</p>
            <p eId="para_1788">Following extensive discussions with a range of relevant agencies, we are now putting in place plans for the establishment of the rapid response register. A public advertisement will issue in due course to set out the skills which these discussions have identified as particularly sought after at this time. The international community's humanitarian response has particular gaps in capacity and it is our hope that we can help bridge some of these gaps in certain key sectors. The advertisement will invite applications for inclusion in this targeted register.</p>
            <p eId="para_1789">Our partner organisations all use, to varying degrees, stand-by arrangements within their own and other organisations to enable them to take on extra staff capacity in the event of a sudden on-set humanitarian emergency. It is our intention that the register will complement these arrangements with the provision of expertise in key sectors of response. In order to ensure a successfully functioning register, it will need to be carefully and professionally managed.</p>
            <p eId="para_1790">On the enhancement of our partnership with the key humanitarian organisations and mechanisms, proposals have been invited from the UN agencies with whom we have met as well as from our Irish NGOs. While we already provide substantial project-based support to the NGOs for their work in emergencies, I look forward to receiving innovative proposals for support to enhance these organisations' capacity to respond in line with best international practice including working ever more collaboratively in emergency response.</p>
            <p eId="para_1791">As work on the above progresses, I will provide further updates.</p>

            <p eId="para_1795">I propose to answer Questions Nos. 46, 62 and 102 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_1796">I attended the European Council on 15/16th June in place of the Taoiseach. The Taoiseach reported to the Dáil on the outcome of the Council on Wednesday 21st June.</p>
            <p eId="para_1797">The June European Council dealt with a wide range of issues, but its main focus was on the European Constitution. The Council had an extended discussion concerning the fate of the Constitution and the related issue of the Union's future enlargement agenda. There was agreement that more time and further work are needed before firm decisions can be taken on the Constitution.</p>
            <p eId="para_1798">The European Council did, however, chart the road ahead with regard to the European Constitution. The European Council Conclusions envisage extensive consultations with Member States culminating in a Presidency report in the first half of 2007. It is intended that this report should provide the European Council with the basis for further decisions concerning the European Constitution.</p>
            <p eId="para_1799">At the same time, the European Council reaffirmed the importance of delivering for the citizen and of pressing ahead with the Union's challenging agenda. That agenda includes the fight against crime and terrorism, dealing with the challenges of energy and climate change and promoting economic growth and job creation under the revitalised Lisbon Agenda.</p>
            <p eId="para_1800">The European Council supported work already underway to ensure that EU citizens can avail of the consular services of all the Member States around the world. In an important development, the Council agreed to make the way it conducts its business more transparently by doing more of its work in public session. It also welcomed the Commission's recent initiative to improve communication with National Parliaments in relation to legislative and other proposals.</p>
            <p eId="para_1801">The Council agreed that Slovenia would adopt the euro in January 2007, and commended Lithuania for its progress towards meeting the criteria for membership of the euro group. Slovenia's adoption of the euro is an important illustration of the success of the Union's 5th enlargement.</p>
            <p eId="para_1802">On enlargement, the Council reaffirmed the Union's intention to honour its existing commitments while, at the same time, ensuring the Union's capacity to continue to function effectively as it enlarges. There is to be a further, in-depth discussion of enlargement at next December's European Council. On the external relations side, the European Council adopted Declarations on the Western Balkans, Iran, Iraq, the Middle East Peace Process, Africa, Lebanon and Timor Leste.</p>
            <p eId="para_1803">On the Middle East Peace Process, it endorsed the proposed Temporary International Mechanism to channel assistance directly to the Palestinian people, which has been drawn up by the European Commission. The European Community stands ready to contribute a substantial amount to the international mechanism. The European Council urged Iran to give an early positive response to the far-reaching initiative proposed by the EU High Representative, the Foreign Ministers of France, Germany and the UK, China, the Russian Federation and the United States.</p>

            <p eId="para_1807">I would refer Deputies to my statement to Dáil Éireann of 13 June 2006, in which I addressed the question of aircraft inspection comprehensively. This statement sets out my clear and precise views at this time on all aspects of the extraordinary rendition issue.</p>
            <p eId="para_1808">As was also pointed out in my statement, and as conveyed directly to the Irish Commission on Human Rights, we were the first Government, when rumours of extraordinary rendition emerged, to raise with the US authorities our concerns about the matter. We were also the first Government to demand assurances that our territory would not be used for such purposes. To speak of a failure to act — which is the essence of the reference to positive compliance — against such a background of proactive intervention is not reasonable. As we have repeatedly made clear also, An Garda Síochána has the powers it needs to investigate all allegations of illegal activity. There is no legal bar to the search of civilian aircraft of the type allegedly involved, where there is a basis for doing so.</p>
            <p eId="para_1809">It remains the Government's position therefore, and we have set this out in detail in ongoing correspondence with the Commission, that we are fully in compliance with our obligations under international law.</p>

            <from>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern)</from>
            <p eId="para_1811">There are a number of programmes within my Department which support educational initiatives. While some of the supported activity takes place within Ireland, most of the monies are expended on educational initiatives overseas, particularly in the developing countries.</p>
            <p eId="para_1812">The Department's Reconciliation Fund, which supports organisations involved in promoting improved relations between the two communities in Northern Ireland and between both parts of Ireland, has supported a limited number of educational activities focused on achieving enhanced dialogue and mutual understanding. Grantees in the broad area of education have included the Irish School of Ecumenics and the Integrated Education Fund.</p>
            <p eId="para_1813">In the areas of conflict resolution and democracy building, the Department has supported a number of educational activities, including the scholarship in memory of the late Swedish Foreign Minister, Anna Lindh, and our contribution to the European Humanities University focused on Belarus. The Department's "Communicating Europe Initiative" has also supported a number of educational activities designed to achieve a better understanding of issues relating to the European Union; these included support to the National Adult Literary Centre for an informational publication on the EU and a case study on Enlargement, published in the printed media, which was circulated to all secondary schools.</p>
            <p eId="para_1814">As part of the promotion of cultural relations with other countries, my Department makes an annual grant (currently amounting to €254,000) to the Ireland — US Fulbright Commission. This programme, jointly funded by the Irish and United States Governments and in operation since 1957, provides awards to enable postgraduate students, post-doctoral scholars and professionals to study, undertake research and lecture at prominent US third-level colleges. In addition, the Department supports a small number of Irish Studies programmes at, and provides book donations to, selected universities abroad.</p>
            <p eId="para_1815">As part of the Government's Asia Strategy, the Department funds and administers the Shanghai Internship Programme. As well as attending briefings and seminars on political and economic matters, the participants from Shanghai attend an intensive English language course in Ireland.</p>
            <p eId="para_1816">The support of education provision has always been a focal point of Ireland's official development aid (ODA) programme, delivered by Irish Aid. The Government's forthcoming White Paper on Development Cooperation will reaffirm our ongoing commitment to education in developing countries — in particular, the emphasis on universal primary education; strengthening the capacity of national systems; and ensuring increased participation of girls and women in the education system.</p>
            <p eId="para_1817">Irish Aid has supported the strengthening of the education sector in its bilateral development programmes in Lesotho, Zambia, Tanzania, Ethiopia, Uganda, Mozambique, South Africa and Palestine. Supporting educational infrastructure is also an important element of the partnership programmes with the major NGOs that are funded by Irish Aid. On the multilateral level, Irish Aid contributes to a number of development programmes that are focused on education; these include UNICEF, the World Bank's Education for All Fast Track Initiative and activities promoted by the European Development Fund. Irish Aid also supports a fellowship programme for postgraduate students from developing countries.</p>
            <p eId="para_1818">In Ireland, the Department promotes development education to raise awareness and understanding of the rapidly changing, interdependent and unequal world in which we live. Development Education seeks to engage people in analysis, reflection and action for local and global citizenship and participation. The Department's Development Education Unit is currently engaged in developing a "Linking and Immersion Scheme" for second level schools in Ireland and a programme for engagement between Irish Aid and third level education and research institutions. Both schemes should be rolled out in 2007.</p>
            <p eId="para_1819">Finally, I might mention that the Department provides support through a "Refund of Fees Scheme" to officers who are pursuing, in their own time, educational courses that are accepted as being relevant to their employment in the Civil Service. A total of 45 Departmental officers are currently availing of this Scheme.</p>
            <p eId="para_1820">If there are specific aspects of the above educational initiatives and activities on which the Deputy would like more detailed information, I would be happy to arrange for its provision.</p>

            <p eId="para_1823">I propose to take Questions Nos. 49 and 66 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_1824">As stated to the House, most recently on 24 May 2006, the Government is fully committed to the active promotion of full observance of universal human rights standards, and opposes, and seeks the elimination of, the practice of human trafficking.</p>
            <p eId="para_1825">The importance of addressing trafficking in persons has been recognised by Ireland and our EU partners. Article 5 of the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights prohibits trafficking in human beings. In 2004 the EU adopted a Council framework decision on combating trafficking in persons. I understand that my colleague, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, who has responsibility for the issue domestically and also within the EU, is currently preparing legislation which will criminalise trafficking in human beings for the purpose of their sexual and labour exploitation, as provided for in the Framework Decision.</p>
            <p eId="para_1826">The Council of Europe last year concluded negotiations on a Convention on Action against Trafficking in Human Beings. This Convention, which was opened for signature at the Third Summit of the Council of Europe in Warsaw on 16 May 2005, aims to prevent and combat trafficking in people in all its forms, national or international, whether or not it is linked with organised crime.</p>
            <p eId="para_1827">The Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), at its Ministerial Meeting in December 2003 in Maastricht, endorsed an Action Plan against Trafficking in Human Beings, and subsequently appointed an OSCE Special Representative, Helga Konrad, whose mandate expired on 9 May 2006. A successor has not yet been appointed.</p>
            <p eId="para_1828">Europol and the European Police College, CEPOL, organise courses on an EU-wide basis for police forces dealing with investigations into the trafficking of human beings. I understand from my colleague, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, that Garda Officers working in the Garda National Immigration Bureau investigating the trafficking of human beings have attended such courses.</p>
            <p eId="para_1829">Ireland is also a signatory to the UN Convention on Transnational Organised Crime and its two accompanying protocols on prevention, suppression and punishment of trafficking in persons, especially women and children and smuggling of migrants by land, air or sea. The protocol on trafficking not only provides for measures to suppress trafficking, but also measures to protect the victims of trafficking.</p>
            <p eId="para_1830">Through its participation at international fora such as the United Nations General Assembly, the UN Commission on Human Rights (CHR), the Council of Europe and the OSCE, Ireland has raised its concerns in cooperation with like-minded countries regarding these issues. As a member of the EU, Ireland coordinates with the other EU Member States in these fora. At the meeting of the CHR in Geneva in 2005, Ireland made a national statement condemning the trafficking of people and welcoming the appointment in 2004 of a Special Rapporteur on Trafficking in Persons. Ireland will continue to support initiatives in this area in the new Human Rights Council which has replaced the Commission on Human Rights.</p>
            <p eId="para_1831">In addition, my Department has provided over €1.7 million in funding for the ILO and NGO anti-trafficking projects through Irish Aid.</p>

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs (Mr. C. Lenihan)</from>
            <p eId="para_1836">The Government's programme of development cooperation is based on our commitment to help poor countries achieve the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). The MDGs set a number of key, measurable development targets to be reached by 2015. The target of halving the population without access to safe drinking water or basic sanitation is one of the MDGs. This is a phenomenal challenge with 1.1 billion people, one in every six, currently without access to safe water. Additionally 2.4 billion people, two in every five, suffer indignity and disease resulting from poor sanitation.</p>
            <p eId="para_1837">Irish Aid, the Government's official development programme, recognises adequate water and environmental sanitation both as a fundamental right and as essential for social and economic development. Additionally we believe that they are prerequisites to the achievement of other basic rights, such as the right to health or to the achievement of equal rights for women and children, who currently bear the bulk of the burden associated with the lack of water and sanitation.</p>
            <p eId="para_1838">In 2005, the Government directly invested some €15 million in improving water and sanitation in sub-Saharan Africa. As the aid programme grows, we will intensify our support for programmes and projects whose objective is the provision of safe water and sanitation.</p>

            <from>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern)</from>
            <p eId="para_1840">When the Taoiseach and Prime Minister Blair met at Farmleigh on 26 January, they said that 2006 would be the decisive year for the peace process. On 6 April in Armagh, they set out the Governments' joint strategy for achieving a fully functioning Assembly and Executive this year, announcing that the Assembly would meet from 15 May and that Members would be given until 24 November, at the latest, to form an Executive.</p>
            <p eId="para_1841">In pursuit of this objective, the Taoiseach and I have been engaged in intensive efforts, in conjunction with the British Government, to bring about fully functioning devolved institutions in Northern Ireland. Throughout this period, I have maintained close ongoing contact with Secretary of State Hain and with the political parties in Northern Ireland. Peter Hain and I met in Dublin on 2 May where we jointly chaired the British-Irish Intergovernmental Conference; in London on 2 June at the British-Irish Council Summit and, most recently, in Hillsborough earlier this week on 26 June.</p>
            <p eId="para_1842">For the first time in over three years, Assembly Members have been engaging with each over the past few weeks at Stormont. I am accompanying the Taoiseach to Stormont today, where the two Governments will meet with all of the parties to take stock of developments, discuss the issues to be addressed and the timeframe for doing so.</p>
            <p eId="para_1843">We will be stressing that the deadline of 24th November is a firm one and that genuine and frank political engagement between the parties is crucial to addressing any obstacles to power-sharing and making the necessary preparations for government. The parties will need to make good use of the short time available to them so that important decisions affecting the lives of every section of the community can be taken by locally elected politicians. If, despite best efforts, this cannot be achieved, then it would fall to the two Governments to ensure that the Good Friday Agreement is implemented to the fullest possible extent for the benefit of all communities.</p>
            <p eId="para_1844">Providing all sides are truly committed to working together, I sincerely believe there is no reason why Northern Ireland should not have a First and Deputy First Minister and a power-sharing administration by that date. I hope that parties will continue their discussions over the summer so that the Assembly can quickly conclude work on outstanding issues and finalise their preparations for government in the autumn.</p>
            <p eId="para_1845">The Government will continue to offer full support to the parties over the coming months, as we have done throughout this process. Secretary of State Hain and I will have an early opportunity to take stock of progress when we meet next month at the British Irish Intergovernmental Conference.</p>

            <p eId="para_1847">Section 5 of the Transfer of Execution of Sentences Act 2005 provides that the Minister for Foreign Affairs may, by order, designate for the purposes of that Act a country that has become party to, or has given effect in its laws to, the Additional Protocol to the Convention on the Transfer of Sentenced Persons of 18 December 1997 or the Schengen Convention of 19 June 1990. As the Deputy will be aware, the 2005 Act has not yet come into operation. The designation of any country under Section 5 of the Act has therefore not yet arisen.</p>
            <p eId="para_1848">However, the action of the Minister for Foreign Affairs in designating a country under Section 5 of the Act would be on the basis that a particular country had become party to, or had given effect in its laws to, one of the two agreements. This would be a factual matter, not requiring a specific assessment of the human rights situation in the country in question.</p>
            <p eId="para_1849">However, it should be noted that under the Protocol and the Schengen provisions, Parties are not under an obligation to take over the execution of foreign sentences. Even after a country has been designated, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform has discretion in each particular case as to whether or not to proceed.</p>

            <p eId="para_1851">The UK Government is in no doubt as to the Government's views in relation to the risks posed to Ireland by nuclear facilities on the west coast of Great Britain, including Sellafield and Wylfa. Our views in this regard have been expressed strongly and repeatedly.</p>
            <p eId="para_1852">Together with my colleague, the Minister for the Environment, Heritage &amp; Local Government, I met with the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, Mr. Peter Hain, at a British — Irish Council meeting in London, on 2 June. We took the opportunity at that meeting to emphasise that the Government would be strongly opposed to the building of any nuclear plant in Northern Ireland. The Northern Secretary has acknowledged the lack of support for any such move.</p>
            <p eId="para_1853">As the House is aware, the United Kingdom is currently considering its future energy needs and reviewing its capacity to meet them. As part of this review, a consultation document was launched on 23 January 2006 by the UK Minister of State for Energy. Entitled Our Energy Challenge: Securing Clean Affordable Energy for the Long Term , this document states that the review will consider whether nuclear power should continue to be part of the mix of energy supplies for the UK in the future. While the review is not yet complete, Prime Minister Blair has clearly indicated his view that new nuclear builds in the UK should remain very much on the agenda.</p>
            <p eId="para_1854">The Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, in conjunction with the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland, engaged in the consultation process relating to the review. The submission made, which covered a number of issues of concern to Ireland, reiterated the Government's strong opposition to nuclear power in general and to the siting of any nuclear plants on the island of Ireland in particular. We are monitoring the progress of the UK review closely.</p>

            <p eId="para_1856">The 16th report of the Policing Oversight Commissioner issued earlier this month was an encouraging reminder of the progress that has been made in the reform of policing in Northern Ireland. Some 124 of the 175 Patten recommendations have been fully implemented. Most importantly, the primary institutions of policing — the Policing Board, the PSNI and the Police Ombudsman — are found to have largely accomplished the implementation of Patten. Of the issues that remain to be resolved, the most important is the issue of full community and political support for the Police.</p>
            <p eId="para_1857">Referring to the decision of the British Government to transfer primacy for national security matters to MI5 from 2007, the Oversight Commissioner expresses concern that this might diminish the robust accountability mechanisms currently in place and might affect the ability of the Police Service to combat organised crime effectively.</p>
            <p eId="para_1858">These concerns are shared by the Government. Discussions have taken place between my officials and their British counterparts with a view to ensuring that adequate accountability mechanisms remain in place, and that the Police Ombudsman continues to have jurisdiction over the actions of police officers seconded to MI5. Protocols are currently being agreed between the office of the Ombudsman and the security service to facilitate this.</p>
            <p eId="para_1859">I also raised this issue with the Secretary of State, Peter Hain MP at the meeting of the British-Irish Inter-Governmental Conference in May. The British Government indicated that it is prepared to discuss further with the political parties in Northern Ireland and with the Irish Government the exact details as to how the new arrangements will work in practice.</p>
            <p eId="para_1860">The broader issue of how the new arrangements will work in the context of the devolution of Policing and Justice will be a matter requiring discussion involving all of the political parties in Northern Ireland.</p>

More generally, the Government has raised the issue of the detainees in Guantánamo Bay with the US Authorities on numerous occasions. This was done at the highest level when the Taoiseach, accompanied by myself, raised our concerns with President Bush in Washington on 17 March 2006.</p>
            <p eId="para_1866">We have always made it clear that we believe that they must be treated in accordance with the requirements of international human rights law and international humanitarian law. This position is shared by the EU as a whole and these views were expressed at the recent EU-US Summit which took place in Vienna on 21 June 2006. The EU side urged that the detainees be either charged or released and that Guantanamo be closed. President Bush stated his intention ultimately to close the facility, which I welcome. I would urge the US administration to move to do so rapidly.</p>

            <p eId="para_1868">The EU will be deploying a 250-strong Electoral Observation Mission (EOM) to the forthcoming presidential and parliamentary elections scheduled to take place in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) on 30 July 2006. These will be the first multi-party elections in the DRC in over forty years and their successful conduct is absolutely critical to the consolidation of peace and security in the DRC and in the Great Lakes region as a whole.</p>
            <p eId="para_1869">The EU, including Ireland, is providing the bulk of the financial support towards the cost of the elections with total EU financial support amounting to some €235 million. Ireland has contributed €1.3 million in financial support towards the cost of the elections, including a recent contribution of €800,000 to the South African Independent Electoral Commission which is assisting in the logistical organisation and oversight of the elections.</p>
            <p eId="para_1870">The observer mission being deployed by the EU to the DRC will constitute the largest EU EOM ever deployed.

The EU EOM will be headed by General Morillon, a Member of the European Parliament. Two observers from Ireland will serve with the mission as long term observers and they are due to deploy to the DRC by mid-July.</p>

            <p eId="para_1872">I presume that the main part of the Deputy's question relates to recruitment to the diplomatic service. Third Secretary is the recruitment grade for the service, and is the first step towards more senior posts in the Department. Competitions for Third Secretary posts are conducted on the Department's behalf by the Public Appointments Service (PAS). The minimum educational requirement is a first or second class honours degree in any faculty. Candidates are also expected to demonstrate a wide range of skills and qualities in the course of the selection process. Detailed information about the Third Secretary competition is available on the PAS website <i>www.publicjobs.ie</i> . The last Third Secretary competition was advertised in January, 2005. I anticipate that the next competition will be launched in the latter part of this year.</p>
            <p eId="para_1873">The Deputy also asked about recruitment to posts in Irish Aid. There are currently no firm plans to recruit new specialists to the Department's Irish Aid Directorate, which is moving to Limerick as part of the Government's decentralisation programme. Discussions are on-going with representatives of the specialists, with their union IMPACT and with the Department of Finance about the conditions of service that will be applicable to specialists transferring with the Directorate to Limerick, and to those that choose to remain in Dublin. These are issues which, of course, also have a wider Civil Service dimension.</p>
            <p eId="para_1874">The Department of Foreign Affairs from time-to-time also recruits by open competition to fill some or all vacancies arising in a number of other grades. These include: Accountant/Auditor; Architectural Assistant; Assistant Legal Adviser; Deputy Legal Adviser; Legal Adviser; Clerical Officer; Clerical Officer (temporary); Executive Officer; Librarian; Night Watch Person; Services Officer; Cleaner; Stagiaire; Translator and various ancillary grades at Irish diplomatic, consular and aid missions. With the exception of posts attached to Irish missions, most of the competitions are conducted on the Department's behalf by the Public Appointments Service. If the Deputy would like to specify any areas in which he is particularly interested, I would be happy to provide him with further information.</p>

            <p eId="para_1876">The EU in recent years has taken a number of important actions to achieve fairer conditions in the international cotton trade, which has been marked by a prolonged decline in prices over the last decade.</p>
            <p eId="para_1877">The actions include improved access to EU markets for cotton-exporting Least Developed Countries (LDCs) following the Union's 2001 Everything But Arms Initiative. Furthermore, in April 2004, under the Irish Presidency, the Agriculture and Fisheries Council agreed on a substantial reform of its own regime of domestic subsidies in cotton. This decision greatly reduced the trade distorting impact of the EU's cotton support arrangements, and thus helped to improve coherence within the EU's development policy. It paved the way for the adoption by the General Affairs and External Relations Council, later in April 2004, of a proposal for an EU-Africa Partnership in support of cotton sector development, and subsequently the establishment of an EU-Africa Partnership on Cotton at the Forum on Cotton held in Paris on 5-6 July 2004.</p>
            <p eId="para_1878">The Paris Forum saw agreement on an Action Plan on cotton with seven major areas of focus, including international trade and development of national and regional strategies. The Action Plan, which is implemented through a number of coordination forums and mechanisms, is a cornerstone in the EU-Africa Partnership on Cotton. It has helped to improve the organisation of the African cotton sector and has also led to an intensification of EU development assistance to the cotton sector. Implementation of the Partnership can be expected to receive a significant stimulus over the next year, as EU funding becomes available for operational projects and programmes.</p>
            <p eId="para_1879">Within the WTO negotiations, the EU is fully committed to deliver on the agreements reached with the LDCs on the cotton issue. Earlier this month, the Union, following consultations with its African partners, tabled a proposal on cotton at the WTO aimed at enhancing trade opportunities for cotton exporting countries.</p>

            <p eId="para_1882">I propose to take Questions Nos. 75 and 113 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_1883">The European Security and Defence Policy (ESDP) is an integral part of the Common Foreign and Security Policy (CFSP) and serves the Union's general objectives of peace and stability. These objectives and the provisions governing ESDP are set out in the Treaties of Amsterdam and of Nice, which were approved by referendum. In this context, the European Union is increasing its ability to contribute to both the civilian and military dimensions of crisis management.</p>
            <p eId="para_1884">As I have previously emphasised, it is important to distinguish between the ESDP, which continues to develop, and the possibility of a common defence. Any move to a common defence would be for decision by the European Council acting unanimously and in accordance with Member States' constitutional requirements. At present, there are no proposals for such a move. In any event, Ireland's position is clear. The amendment to Art 29 of Bunreacht na hÉireann in October 2002 precludes Ireland from participating in a common defence. As a consequence, the Irish people would have to amend Bunreacht na hÉireann before Ireland could take part in a common defence.</p>
            <p eId="para_1885">The Union is continuing to develop its capabilities for crisis management, both military and civilian. The objectives which it has set itself are clearly set out in the (military) Headline Goal 2010 and the Civilian Headline Goal 2008. There are ten ESDP crisis management missions currently underway, both civilian and military, some of which combine both military and civilian elements. The civilian missions range from police and rule of law advisory and training missions, assistance to security sector reform, border monitoring missions and ceasefire monitoring missions. The main ongoing military mission has been the peace stabilisation mission in Bosnia-Herzegovina (EUFOR Althea).</p>
            <p eId="para_1886">Additionally, on 12 June 2006, the EU launched a military crisis management mission, at the request of the UN, to provide support for the UN Mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (MONUC) during the forthcoming electoral period there. An EU Planning Team has also been deployed to Kosovo in recent weeks to prepare for a possible rule of law advisory mission in that country.</p>
            <p eId="para_1887">I met my EU counterparts at the General Affairs and External Relations Council on 15-16 May, where we discussed a range of issues including civil military co-ordination, security sector reform in the Western Balkans and emergency and crisis response. I also represented the Taoiseach at the European Council on 15-16 June, where conclusions on improving the EU's emergency and crisis response capabilities were agreed and the Austrian Presidency report on ESDP was endorsed.</p>

            <p eId="para_1889">On 23 February 2006, the trial began of a group of 129 people, including members of the Coalition for Unity and Democracy (CUD), journalists and civil society activists. Several of the CUD members on trial were elected to public office in May 2005. The Ethiopian authorities claim that the group was responsible for launching and organising the June and November 2005 riots, as part of an agenda to overthrow the Government by force. They were charged as a group with treason, genocide and inciting violence. Although the Ethiopian penal code provides that the death sentence may be imposed in cases of treason and genocide, a moratorium on executions has been in operation since 1998 and is expected to continue.</p>
            <p eId="para_1890">Ireland, along with our EU partners, has underlined to the Ethiopian Prime Minister the need for the trial to be conducted in a transparent, fair and speedy manner in accordance with international standards. We also called for the release of the detainees on bail as a confidence building measure and for better access to detainees by families, lawyers and the international community. These points were reiterated when the Chairman and members of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs met the Prime Minister in Addis Ababa on 4 May 2006. The Oireachtas delegation also visited the prison where the detainees are held and met with two detained members of the CUD leadership and a civil society representative.</p>
            <p eId="para_1891">The Prime Minister has agreed to an EU request for international observation of the trial and a distinguished international lawyer, Mr Michael Ellmann, is observing the trial on behalf of the EU. EU Embassies in Addis Ababa, including that of Ireland, are also monitoring developments. While bail has not been approved, the Prime Minister has indicated that the Ethiopian authorities will do everything they can to ensure the expeditious completion of the trial. It is anticipated that it may end in December 2006.</p>
            <p eId="para_1892">On 22 March 2006, all charges were withdrawn against 18 of the detainees, including 9 being tried in absentia, and the prosecutor was instructed by the court to amend the genocide charge to "attempted genocide." The trial of the remaining defendants has continued during June. The prosecution is currently showing video evidence.</p>
            <p eId="para_1893">I myself will travel to Ethiopia from 5-8 July where I will meet with Prime Minister Meles Zenawi and Foreign Minister Seyoum Mesfin. I plan to also visit the detained CUD leaders and civil society representatives. I will press the Prime Minister to reconsider granting bail to those detained in relation to this case, particularly Mr Daniel Bekele and Mr Netsanet Demissie, both civil society activists, and Ms Serkalem Fasil, a publisher, who recently gave birth to a son in prison. I am also concerned by reports that several detainees are suffering from illness due to their conditions of detention.</p>

            <p eId="para_1896">Ireland, together with its partners in the EU, fully supports the current UN arms embargo on both government and non-government forces in Darfur.</p>
            <p eId="para_1897">I also conveyed to the Chinese Foreign Minister the Government's deep concern about the situation in Burma and urged the Chinese Government to use its good offices with the Burmese Authorities, including in relation to the position of Aung San Suu Kyi.

            <from>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern)</from>
            <p eId="para_1900">On 21 May, the Iraqi Parliament approved the new national unity Government presented by Prime Minister Nuri Al-Maliki. The formation of the Government was completed when the crucial positions of Defence, Interior and National Security Ministers were filled on 8 June. The new Cabinet is very broadly based, and it includes the main parties representing the Sunni community. This is a welcome and significant step forward for Iraq and for its people. It has been warmly welcomed by the European Union. Iraq now has a fully sovereign and democratic Government and Parliament, mandated for four years. The political transition process set out in United Nations Security Council Resolutions has been completed.</p>
            <p eId="para_1901">There is no doubt that the Iraqi Government now faces major political, economic and security challenges. However, perhaps for the first time in its history, Iraq has a democratic Government representing all of its people, which was freely chosen by them. We recognise this very significant achievement, which required the engagement of all the major political parties in Iraq. The all-party Iraqi delegation which visited Ireland last week provided impressive evidence of the courage and determination of the Iraqi people as they work to rebuild their country following decades of dictatorship and war.</p>
            <p eId="para_1902">The Government and its EU partners remain firmly committed to supporting the Iraqi people in restoring security and prosperity to their country. Since 2003, the EU has provided over €700 million in assistance for the reconstruction of Iraq. At its meeting on 16 June, the European Council adopted a Declaration on Iraq, which stressed that continuing EU support will be delivered in partnership with the new Government, and in line with its priorities.</p>
            <p eId="para_1903">The serious campaign of violence which forms the background to this political progress remains a matter of grave concern. Iraqi citizens are being targeted in openly sectarian bomb attacks, kidnappings and shootings, which continue to take a terrible toll of deaths and serious injuries. Despite their refusal to be provoked into large scale civil strife, the evidence is that sectarian retaliation and violence have unfortunately been rising steadily. It appears that, in some areas, minority communities are reacting by moving to areas where they feel more secure. It is probably still too early to form a judgement on whether the death of Abu Musab Al Zarqawi, the leader of Al Qaeda in Iraq, will affect the overall security situation.</p>
            <p eId="para_1904">The EU is supporting the Iraqi Government in its efforts to establish the rule of law and a culture of respect for human rights. It is also working with the Iraqi authorities, with the United Nations, and with the Arab League to support the national reconciliation process. I hope that the national reconciliation plan which Prime Minister Al-Maliki presented to Parliament on 25 June will mark an important development in this process.</p>

            <p eId="para_1911">On the outbreak of the war in Iraq, the Taoiseach moved a motion which was adopted by the Dáil on 20 March 2003, which reaffirmed Ireland's commitment to the United Nations as the guarantor of collective global security and the appropriate forum for the resolution of disputes threatening international peace and security. In his statement to the House, the Taoiseach acknowledged that there was no clear legal consensus on whether there was a mandate for the use of force against Iraq, based on previous Security Council resolutions. He noted that the arguments put forward by the coalition asserting the existence of a mandate were also supported by a number of countries which were not participating in the military action. However, he made clear the Government's position that Ireland would not participate in the military campaign without an explicit further Security Council mandate. This remains the Government's position on the circumstances of the invasion in 2003.</p>
            <p eId="para_1912">In relation to current military activity, it is clear that the international forces now serving in Iraq are operating under UN mandate, and at the request of the democratically-elected Iraqi Government. The presence of the Multi-National Force in Iraq was authorised by the UN Security Council in Resolution 1511 of October 2003. The authorisation was reaffirmed in Resolution 1546 of June 2004, and was extended to the end of 2006 by Resolution 1637, which was adopted unanimously by the Security Council in November 2005.</p>

            <from>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern)</from>
            <p eId="para_1915">I propose to take Questions Nos. 87 and 160 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_1916">The significant progress achieved in Afghanistan over the past four years should be acknowledged, although clearly considerable challenges still remain. The Afghan people have elected a President and Parliament and have a legitimate elected Government which is working to consolidate the progress that has been made. For the first time, issues of national importance are openly debated in Parliament giving the Afghan people, through their elected representatives, the opportunity to make their concerns heard. The reform process is continuing, with the assistance of the international community, across all sectors, including the police service, the Afghan National Army and the judicial system.</p>
            <p eId="para_1917">In any country, developing the democratic structures, institutions and administrative systems necessary to provide essential public services and ensure a secure environment for all is a process that takes time. Ensuring security in Afghanistan is an especially challenging and complex task, particularly given the presence of violent factions who stand to benefit considerably from a destabilised country. The security situation remains a cause of serious concern. Levels of insurgency-related violence have risen since the beginning of the year and attacks, including suicide bombings, aimed at the International Security Assistance Force (ISAF), other international security forces and Afghan security forces, have increased.</p>
            <p eId="para_1918">The Afghan National Army (ANA) and international security forces have been engaged in heavy fighting with Taliban insurgents in Kandahar, Helmand, Uruzgan and Zabul provinces in the Southern part of the country in recent weeks. Such fighting is expected to continue over the summer months as the ANA and international forces expand their operations into remoter areas in the South. The UN-mandated ISAF, which at present has some 9000 troops providing security assistance in Kabul and the North and West, is currently expanding its operations to Southern Afghanistan. The expansion will involve the deployment of an additional 7000 troops and will assist the Afghan Government in extending its authority across the country. The further expansion of the ISAF will clearly be of assistance to the international community in continuing to closely monitor the situation there.</p>
            <p eId="para_1919">The illicit narcotics industry remains a major challenge to the long-term security, development and effective governance of Afghanistan. Counter-narcotics was identified as a priority area in the EU-Afghanistan Joint Declaration signed on 16 November 2005. The Afghan Government operates a Counter Narcotics Implementation Plan and a National Drugs Control Strategy in an effort to work towards elimination of the narcotics trade. The UN Office on Drugs and Crime, in its 2006 World Drug Report published this week, has reported that the area under opium poppy cultivation in Afghanistan decreased by 21% from 2004 to 2005.</p>
            <p eId="para_1920">An Afghanistan Compact was launched at the International Conference on Afghanistan in London on 31 January/1 February and was endorsed by the United Nations Security Council in Resolution 1659 (2006) on 15 February. The Compact will guide the joint efforts of the Afghan Government and the international community in meeting outstanding challenges across three pillars of activity: security; governance; rule of law and human rights, and economic and social development. Counter-narcotics was identified as a cross-cutting priority in the Compact. The Compact notes that Afghanistan's transition to peace and stability is not yet assured and that strong international engagement will be required to address remaining challenges.</p>
            <p eId="para_1921">I am pleased that Ireland was in a position to pledge €5 million at the launch of the Compact. This new pledge, which will be expended over the next two years, reflects Ireland's continuing commitment to supporting the reconstruction and reform process underway in Afghanistan. Including this new pledge, Ireland has contributed a total of €22 million to reconstruction and recovery programmes in Afghanistan since January 2002.</p>
            <p eId="para_1922">There are a number of mechanisms in place to facilitate international monitoring of the situation in Afghanistan. Participating countries in ISAF, which includes a small Irish presence of seven Defence Force personnel, are on the ground to discharge their mandate and to monitor the situation. From an EU perspective, an important role is played by the EU Special Representative for Afghanistan, Mr. Francesc Vendrell, whose Office in Kabul provides regular briefings to Member States on developments in the country. The Deputy to the EUSR is an Irish national. The EUSR's Office, together with the European Commission, actively participates in the Joint Coordination and Monitoring Board, a body established by the Afghan Government and the international community to oversee the implementation of the Afghanistan Compact. UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan provides periodic reports to the UN Security Council on the situation in the country. The Special Representative of the Secretary-General (SRSG) for Afghanistan, Mr. Tom Koenigs, and the United Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan (UNAMA), also play an important role in monitoring the situation in Afghanistan.</p>

            <p eId="para_1927">Since 1997, an advancement of the funds by the Department in a court bond context occurred in the case of three Irish citizens in Columbia. In this particular consular case, the court judgment permitted the three citizens to be released from prison on payment of a bond. My Department, at the request of the Defence team, and given the on-going consular concerns about the safety of the persons concerned, advanced the funds to facilitate the payment of this bond on the basis of a firm undertaking to repay the sum involved. The funds were repaid in full. The decision to advance funds was taken by the Department in pursuit of its consular responsibilities, and was neither discussed nor taken at political level.</p>

            <p eId="para_1929">The EU's policy on Cuba is as set out in the Common Position agreed on 2 December 1996, during the then Irish Presidency. The General Affairs and External Relations Council reaffirmed the Common Position's validity on 12 June 2006. The Council's Conclusions on Cuba, which were also adopted on 12 June 2006, reiterated that constructive engagement remains the basis of the EU's policy with the ultimate aim being to encourage a process of transition to pluralist democracy in Cuba.</p>
            <p eId="para_1930">Of particular concern has been the staging since July 2005 of several dozens of acts of violent harassment and intimidation, including "acts of repudiation" whereby activists have been maltreated, expelled from their dwellings and beaten up. There are reports that some acts of repudiation are taking place with the collusion of the police and security forces.</p>

On the basis of discussions which my officials and I have had with the US authorities, I have no reason to believe that this was other than an isolated incident which arose from an administrative error. At my meeting with him on 12 June, the US Ambassador conveyed his deep regret for the breach of procedures, and confirmed his authorities' determination that the use of Irish airspace and airports by the US be completely transparent and in conformity with Irish law and the wishes of the Government.</p>

            <p eId="para_1943">I propose to take Questions Nos. 94, 99, 104, 115 and 122 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_1944">Under the Government's decentralisation programme, the Development Cooperation Directorate of the Department of Foreign Affairs, which is Irish Aid's Headquarters and currently based in Dublin, will decentralise to Limerick. Already, a total of 37 posts in Irish Aid Headquarters, including that of Director General, are filled by officers who have signalled their intention to decentralise to Limerick. A further fifteen officers are expected to take up duty at headquarters by early September and six officers serving elsewhere in the Department, mostly abroad, have also applied to decentralise to Limerick. The above total of 58 represents some 47% of the posts being transferred to Limerick.</p>
            <p eId="para_1945">It is expected that the move will take place in mid-2007. With any move of 124 staff, management concerns would dictate that the move be carried out in a manner that will minimise disruption. This may mean that there is some phasing of the move over a relatively short period of time.</p>
            <p eId="para_1946">Irish Aid's development assistance programme will remain an integral part of the foreign policy of the Government of Ireland. Development co-operation policy is rooted in our foreign policy, in particular its objectives of peace and justice and reflects our long-standing commitment to human rights and fairness in international relations and as such is inseparable from Irish foreign policy as a whole.</p>

            <p eId="para_1948">The Government has consistently been a strong supporter of the right to self-determination of the Saharawi people. Ireland played a prominent role in seeking a solution to the Western Sahara dispute during its term on the UN Security Council. The Government has remained closely engaged with the issue, particularly in discussions at EU level and at the United Nations.</p>
            <p eId="para_1949">Although there has been little progress towards its implementation, the Government continues to believe that the Baker II plan, which was recommended to the parties by the UN Security Council in July 2003, represents the best framework yet presented for a negotiated settlement. The plan envisages a preparatory phase under UN supervision, leading to a referendum to determine the future of the territory. It is clear that a genuine exercise of the right of self-determination must include independence as one possible outcome, but the Government has no views on what the outcome should be. This is a matter for the Saharawi people. The Government strongly supports the continuing role of the UN in working to bring the parties towards an agreement, under the Special Representative of the Secretary General, Mr. Peter Van Walsum.</p>

            <p eId="para_1951">The Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court entered into force on 1 July 2002 and to date has been ratified or acceded to by 100 states. An additional 43 states have signed the Statute, subject to ratification. The Rome Statute has been ratified by all but one of the EU Member States.</p>
            <p eId="para_1952">Together with our partners in the European Union, Ireland has been a consistent and strong supporter of the ICC, recognising it as an essential means to combating impunity for the most serious violations of international humanitarian and human rights law. This position has been recognised in the EU Common Position last updated in June 2003.</p>
            <p eId="para_1953">The 2003 Common Position commits the Union and its Member States to support the effective functioning of the Court, and to advance universal support for it by promoting the widest possible participation in the Rome Statute. In February 2004 a detailed Action Plan on the implementation of the 2003 Common Position was adopted under the auspices of the Irish Presidency of the EU.</p>
            <p eId="para_1954">Over the past six months the Austrian Presidency, on behalf of the EU, has carried out 19 demarches on the issue of the ICC, raising ratification of the Rome Statute with China, Turkey, Egypt, Morocco, Vietnam and Indonesia, amongst others. In addition to their efforts to promote ratifications, the EU and its Member States have been generous supporters of initiatives to promote the Court in third states, as well as to strengthen the capacity of states to cooperate with the Court. For example, in May of this year, Ireland participated in a two-day conference aimed at promoting ratification of the ICC among members of the Commonwealth of Independent States (an association comprising Russia and 11 other republics that were formerly part of the Soviet Union). The conference, held in Salzburg, Austria, was attended by representatives from the Russian Federation, Belarus, Ukraine, Kazakhstan, Turkmenistan, Moldova, Armenia, and Kyrgyzstan, all of which have yet to ratify the Rome Statute.</p>

            <from>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern)</from>
            <p eId="para_1958">The Government attaches the highest priority to the welfare of the undocumented Irish in the United States. We emphasise our strong support for measures that would enable the undocumented to regularise their status and have open to them a path to permanent residency in all of our dealings with contacts in the US Administration and Legislature.</p>
            <p eId="para_1959">The Taoiseach and I raised this issue with President Bush when we met with him on St. Patrick's Day. The President helpfully assured us of his support for a comprehensive approach to immigration which advances reforms, as well as addresses enforcement issues. This is an approach which he has endorsed strongly on a number of occasions since then.</p>
            <p eId="para_1960">In view of the prominence of immigration reform on the legislative agenda in the US, I returned to Washington D.C. on 23rd and 24th May to reiterate to key legislators the importance which the Government attaches to the welfare of the undocumented Irish.</p>
            <p eId="para_1961">I also availed of the opportunity of that visit to meet again with the Irish Lobby for Immigration Reform (ILIR), an organisation which is proving most effective in representing the views of many Irish people resident there and which the Government has been happy to support financially. ILIR continue to be active on the ground, including in meetings yesterday in Washington D.C. when they were joined by a number of Members of the Oireachtas.</p>
            <p eId="para_1962">The positive approach to immigration reform which is favoured by President Bush and legislators including Senator Kennedy and Senator McCain received a significant boost on 25th May with the passage through the US Senate of a comprehensive bill on immigration. The bill, proposed by Senators Hagel and Martinez, contains provisions that would provide a path to permanent residency for the majority of the undocumented in the US. In this way, it contains many of the key elements of the Kennedy/McCain bill. It is strongly supported by ILIR and I also warmly welcomed its passage through the Senate.</p>
            <p eId="para_1963">While we are greatly encouraged by the passing of the Senate bill, the reality remains that achieving further progress on this sensitive and divisive issue will present a very considerable challenge. However, the Deputy can be fully assured that our efforts on behalf of the undocumented Irish will continue to be prioritised in every way possible in the critical period ahead.</p>

            <p eId="para_1969">There has been no recent discussion on the sales of arms to Africa at the General Affairs and External Relations Council but the European Council, at its meeting on 15-16 December 2005, adopted an EU Strategy to combat the illicit accumulation and trafficking of small arms and light weapons and their ammunition. While this Strategy has a global geographic scope, it identifies Africa as the continent most affected by the impact of internal conflicts aggravated by the destabilising influx of small arms and light weapons.</p>
            <p eId="para_1970">There have been various estimates by a number of organisations as to the volume of exports of arms to Africa but there is broad agreement as to its impact. The EU Strategy, for example, notes that besides the humanitarian effects, the consequences of the abundance of small arms and ammunition in terms of development are well documented viz the weakening of State structures, displacement of persons, collapse of health and education services, the spread of pandemics, damage to the social fabric and, in the long term, the reduction or withholding of development aid. It is acknowledged that this trend mainly affects sub-Saharan Africa and is a key factor in limiting development.</p>
            <p eId="para_1971">At present, the export of all arms from EU countries must conform to the EU Code of Conduct on Arms Exports. Ireland was actively involved in the establishment of this politically binding code, which lists the factors to be taken into account when deciding whether to allow an export of military goods. These include respect for human rights, the internal situation in the country of final destination and the preservation of regional peace, security and stability. Discussions are ongoing in the EU on the possible reinforcement of the Code of Conduct.</p>
            <p eId="para_1972">The promotion and support of international efforts to secure appropriate safeguards on the sale and transfer of armaments is a key priority of Irish foreign policy. There are too many examples of conflicts which are fuelled by the proliferation of conventional weapons. This is especially an issue of concern in Africa, where the proliferation in particular of small arms and light weapons continues to bring much suffering to societies throughout that continent.</p>

            <p eId="para_1974">In recent months the Government has had discussions with various parties to the Parades issue, including the leadership of the Loyal Orders, the political parties, residents groups and the relevant British authorities. Our meetings have focused in particular on the small number of areas where there are continuing tensions, including West Belfast, Ardoyne, Short Strand, Dunloy and Portadown. Issues in relation to the appropriate policing of parades have also been discussed through the British-Irish Secretariat in Belfast.</p>
            <p eId="para_1975">It has been the position of successive Governments that the best solution for disputed parades in Northern Ireland is through dialogue and agreement at local level. In circumstances where agreement cannot be reached all sides should respect the decisions of the Parades Commission. The responsible manner in which the nationalist residents of the Springfield Road responded to the parade on Saturday 24 June was encouraging in this regard.</p>
            <p eId="para_1976">While we remain confident that the Parades issue is capable of effective resolution, the summer period is inevitably associated with heightened sectarian tension, as events in 2005 in North Antrim and in West Belfast underlined. There is an ongoing need therefore for political leadership from all political parties in Northern Ireland to ensure that the pattern of deteriorating community relations over the summer months is broken. At recent meetings with the parties, including the DUP, the Government has taken the opportunity to emphasise the need for such leadership.</p>

            <p eId="para_1978">The Criminal Justice Review, established pursuant to the Good Friday Agreement, considered the question of community restorative justice schemes in the context of strengthening support for the criminal justice system. It concluded that, in certain circumstances, such schemes had a useful role to play, but emphasised the need to operate within certain well-defined criteria. As part of the implementation of the Review, the British Government undertook to prepare guidelines for the operation of restorative justice schemes, and these were published as a consultative document last December.</p>
            <p eId="para_1979">In the context of ongoing discussions, we have had an opportunity to discuss this issue with the political parties and with the British Government, as well as with other interests. We are aware of the concerns expressed by various stakeholders, and will wish to ensure that any decisions in this area are consistent with the commitment to a widely-supported policing service. In considering proposals for change, the Government has emphasised its view that any programme should adhere to best international practice, must be human-rights compliant and have acceptable arrangements with regard to the handling of complaints. We have above all emphasised the need to operate in a manner which underpins the new dispensation in policing, and which contributes to the full implementation of the Patten recommendations. Indeed it seems clear that progress on policing is inevitably closely linked with the scope for the development of community restorative justice and related programmes. We will remain in close touch with the political parties and the British Government on this matter.</p>

            <p eId="para_1981">As indicated to the House, most recently on 24 May 2006, the case for ratification of this Convention has been examined by my Department in conjunction with the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, which has lead responsibility on the issue. Both Departments are aware of the advice referred to by the Deputy.</p>
            <p eId="para_1982">However, as previously indicated, the rights of migrant workers and their families are already protected under existing national legislation and under the Irish Constitution, as well as under EU law. In addition, the rights of migrant workers and their families are also addressed by Ireland's commitments under international human rights instruments to which the State is already a party. These international instruments include, for example, the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, and the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights.</p>
            <p eId="para_1983">The Convention referred to in the Deputy's question was adopted by the UN General Assembly in December 1990, and it entered into force on 1 July 2003, following ratification by the requisite number of States (20). The Convention has been open for signature and ratification since December 1990. However, to date only 34 States have ratified it. No European Union Member State has as yet signed or ratified the Convention, nor has any indicated an intention to do so.</p>
            <p eId="para_1984">The position essentially is that, in order for Ireland to ratify the Convention, significant changes would have to be made across a wide range of existing legislation, including legislation addressing employment, social welfare provision, education, taxation and electoral law. These changes would also have implications for our EU commitments. The operation of the Common Travel Area between Ireland and the UK might also possibly be affected.</p>
            <p eId="para_1985">As with all outstanding ratifications of international human rights instruments, the position regarding the International Convention on the Rights of All Migrant Workers and their Families is kept under review.</p>

            <p eId="para_1990">I remain concerned about this case, which has been raised with the Israeli authorities by our Embassy in Tel Aviv. The Embassy is continuing to monitor the situation closely, in cooperation with the Embassies of other EU Member States.</p>
            <p eId="para_1991">The person concerned was arrested on 23 May 2005, and on 16 June 2005 the Israeli authorities ordered his administrative detention for six months. This order was renewed for a further six months in November, but reduced to four months on review in December 2005. On 20 March 2006, the detention was renewed until 20 July. An appeal against the renewal was turned down on 10 May.</p>
            <p eId="para_1992">The Government, and our EU partners, have serious concerns about the practice of administrative detention in Israel and the Occupied Territories. We are working to ensure that they are addressed in the EU's continuing political dialogue with Israel. Most recently, our concerns about administrative detention were raised at the meeting of the EU-Israel Association Council which took place in Luxembourg on 13 June. In direct contacts with Israel, and in cooperation with its EU partners, the Government continues to raise its concerns about the human rights implications of Israeli security policies and the need to ensure full compliance with international law.</p>

            <p eId="para_1994">The Government and our EU partners strongly supported the work of James Wolfensohn during his tenure as Quartet Special Envoy with responsibility for the Israeli disengagement from Gaza. Mr. Wolfensohn stood down from the position on 30 April this year. The Secretary-General of the UN expressed his deep appreciation for Mr Wolfensohn's efforts, a sentiment echoed by the Quartet, which also noted his central role in the conclusion of the Agreement on Movement and Access and the development of an agenda for Palestinian economic recovery.</p>
            <p eId="para_1995">In advance of the Israeli withdrawal from Gaza in 2005, Mr Wolfensohn put forward a package of security and economic measures with the objective of developing the economy of the area and the prospects for its people. Key to his recommendations were provisions to ensure freedom of movement of both people and goods between Gaza and the outside world including, crucially, between Gaza and the West Bank. One outcome of this package was the transfer of Israeli-run greenhouses to the ownership of Palestinian co-operatives, a measure which was partly financed by Mr Wolfensohn personally. Another outcome was the Agreement on Movement and Access brokered between Israel, the Palestinian Authority (PA) and Egypt in November 2005 which was to ensure the freedom of movement for people and goods, which had been identified as essential to the future economic development of Gaza.</p>
            <p eId="para_1996">Subsequent developments have not been encouraging and little progress has been made on implementation of either the original recommendations made by Mr. Wolfensohn or the commitments entered into by Israel and the PA in the Agreement on Movement and Access. The Government, together with our partners in the EU, has consistently encouraged the parties to resume work towards such implementation and we will continue to do so.</p>

            <p eId="para_2030">The Methadone Treatment Protocol governs the prescription and supply of methadone to people who are opiate dependent and has been in operation since 1998. There is a cap on the number of patients who may be treated by Level 1 and Level 2 general practitioners, who have received specialist training in the treatment of patients who are opiate dependent. A Level 1 GP can treat up to a maximum of 15 patients. A level 2 GP can treat up to a maximum of 35 patients or a maximum of 50 in a partnership with 2 or more doctors in their own practice. The cap on numbers is to ensure patient safety and quality of service.</p>
            <p eId="para_2031">The 2002 Review of the Methadone Treatment Protocol recommended that in certain exceptional circumstances these numbers may be increased. Any increases in numbers would only take place with the approval of The Irish College of General Practitioners/Health Service Executive Review Group following an application from the GP/practice concerned.</p>

In real terms, the prices of personal computers have reduced substantially in recent years while their power and functionality has increased. In 1994 a personal computer cost in the region of €2,540 (£2,000) and amounted to about 20% of the net annual income of a single person on average earnings. Today, a home personal computer with good functionality may be purchased for about €700 which is under 3% of net average earnings.

The Irish League of Credit Unions (ILCU) has highlighted the current restrictions on longer-term lending as an important concern for the credit union movement and is advocating an increase in the lending limits. The Registrar of Credit Unions who is responsible for the regulation of credit unions under the Act does not favour a change in the lending limits at this time. In view of the divergence of views, I have referred this matter to the Credit Union advisory Committee (CUAC), the statutory advisory body on credit union matters under the Credit Union Act, requesting the Committee's advice on whether a review of the current limits on longer-term lending should be carried out. The recommendation of the advisory Committee is expected shortly.</p>

            <p eId="para_2121">In 2005, a decision was taken that children travelling from Belarus for recuperation visits under the auspices of various Chernobyl groups would require visas to enter Ireland. This requirement was made effective for most groups as from 1 January 2006 and will apply to all groups from 1 January 2007.</p>
            <p eId="para_2122">Prior to the visa requirement coming into effect, detailed discussions took place between the Visa Office of the Embassy of Ireland in Moscow and representatives of the various groups in order to ensure that travel by the children would not be disrupted. These arrangements are currently working well and I am satisfied that visas for the various children's groups are being processed speedily by the Embassy in Moscow. In the first five months of this year, 1,065 such visas have been issued.</p>
            <p eId="para_2123">I am not aware of any disruption of visits by children's groups travelling to Ireland arising from the introduction of the visa requirement. Nevertheless, the Embassy in Moscow will review the operation of the current scheme and will discuss it with the representatives of the various groups involved later this year.</p>
            <p eId="para_2124">Ireland has a small diplomatic service and any expansion of its network of resident Missions abroad must be approached on a phased basis, having regard to clear priorities. I am satisfied that our existing diplomatic arrangements in Belarus, namely accreditation on a non-resident basis by our Ambassador in Moscow, are sufficient to cover our interests and are working well. There are no plans to open a resident Embassy in Minsk.</p>

            <p eId="para_2126">The EU currently has three candidate countries, Croatia, the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia and Turkey. Accession negations have begun with both Croatia and Turkey. In line with the conclusions of the European Council meeting in Copenhagen in June 1993, in order to be granted candidate country status, applicant states are expected to have made progress towards meeting the necessary political criteria. These political criteria include the requirement that each has achieved a stability of institutions guaranteeing democracy, the rule of law, human rights and respect for, and protection of, minorities.</p>
            <p eId="para_2127">The European Council at its meetings in June and December 2004 respectively agreed that Croatia and Turkey sufficiently met the Copenhagen criteria to enable the opening of accession negotiations. The December 2005 European Council welcomed the progress made by the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia towards meeting the Copenhagen criteria and, in recognition of this progress decided to grant candidate country status to the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia. At the same time the European Council made it clear that further steps — such as the opening of accession negotiations — will have to be considered in the light of, amongst other considerations, the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia's compliance with the Copenhagen political criteria.</p>
            <p eId="para_2128">In recognition of the need to maintain progress in this regard, the Commission monitors the continued efforts in each of the candidate countries towards compliance with the Copenhagen criteria and meeting the obligations of membership by satisfying the economic and political conditions required. Also, in the cases of Croatia and Turkey, the EU will address the progress on human rights as relevant chapters are considered in the course of the accession negotiations.</p>

          </question>
          <speech by="#ConorLenihan" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Foreign_Affairs" eId="spk_715">
            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs (Mr. C. Lenihan)</from>
            <p eId="para_2130">The European Union, like Ireland, has a particular focus on communicable diseases including HIV/AIDS. The European Union approach is outlined in the 2005 report entitled "A European Programme for Action to Confront HIV/AIDS, Malaria and Tuberculosis through external action". This report provides for accelerated investment and effort both at European Union level and in conjunction with other global partners. Implementation of the report will see greater emphasis on Research and Development in Europe as well as greater financial and technical support for HIV and AIDS in poorer countries.</p>
            <p eId="para_2131">Since 1996, the European Union, with the support of Member States, has quadrupled its funding to HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria, the three priority diseases identified in the UN Millennium Development Goals. The European Union is now the second largest donor in this area and has provided over two billion euros for the period 2003-2006.</p>
            <p eId="para_2132">The United Nations accords exceptional priority to combating HIV and AIDS, as reflected in its General Assembly Special Session (UNGASS) on HIV/AIDS in 2001 and at a further such session in 2006. The Taoiseach took a leading role in both of these sessions. The efforts of the United Nations on HIV/AIDS are coordinated by UNAIDS, which has led an accelerated global response to HIV/AIDS. There has been a 28-fold increase in funding for low and middle income countries from €240 million to €6.6 billion in 2005. UNAIDS has recently launched a new global effort to achieve Universal Access to Prevention, Treatment, and Care and Support by 2010. This has major implications for international and national policy, and financial resources. UNAIDS has also made considerable progress in 'mainstreaming' HIV and AIDS in the plans and strategies of the UN development agencies.</p>
            <p eId="para_2133">Consolidation and coordination of effort is required if a timely response to the HIV pandemic is to be ensured. UNAIDS offers an opportunity for a wide range of organisations and governments to support such consolidation and coordination. It provides leadership to improve support to low and middle-income countries, in Africa and elsewhere, in scaling-up their responses to HIV/AIDS. This involves harmonising multilateral budgets, work plans, country-level responses, identification of needs and technical frameworks.</p>
            <p eId="para_2134">In conclusion, I would like to reiterate that Ireland, in its own right, and as a full member of both the European Union and the United Nations is fully committed to playing an important role on the issue of HIV/AIDS, as clearly demonstrated by the Taoiseach's leadership in attending the recent United Nations General Assembly Special Session on HIV/AIDS and his pledge to provide annual funding of €100 million to combat HIV/AIDS and other communicable diseases.</p>

            <from>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern)</from>
            <p eId="para_2137">I propose to take Questions Nos. 161 and 165 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_2138">On 5 May 2006 the Darfur Peace Agreement (DPA), negotiated under the auspices of the African Union with active support from the EU, UN and US, was signed by the Government of Sudan and Minni Minnawi, leader of the Sudan Liberation Army (SLA) faction with the largest number of fighters on the ground. However, the heads of the Justice and Equality (JEM) rebel group and the Abdelwahid El-Nur SLA faction refused to sign. Despite this, on 8 June thirty representatives from these two groupings signed a declaration of commitment to the DPA.</p>
            <p eId="para_2139">On 13 June one of the first steps in the implementation of the DPA was taken when the Darfur Ceasefire Commission (CFC) was established at the African Union Monitoring Mission in Sudan (AMIS) Force Headquarter in El Fasher. The CFC is responsible under the DPA for the implementation and monitoring of its ceasefire provisions and of other previous ceasefire agreements. Members of the SLA/Abdelwahid and JEM who are bound by previous ceasefire agreements also attended and pledged their support for peace in Darfur.</p>
            <p eId="para_2140">Since full and rapid implementation of the Darfur Peace Agreement is a precondition for lasting peace and security in Darfur and an end to the suffering of millions of its people, I call on all parties to fulfil their commitments. In particular, I would be glad to see the early convening of the Darfur-Darfur Dialogue and Consultation process. I understand that the African Union is involved in consultations regarding the nomination of a prominent African to chair the process and would urge that this be finalised quickly. It is imperative that the population of Darfur be given the opportunity to engage in a process of reconciliation and to take ownership of the Peace Agreement. It is also essential that the Sudan Government fulfils its commitment to disarm the Janjaweed.</p>
            <p eId="para_2141">The international community, particularly the EU, has been actively involved in securing a resolution to the crisis in Darfur. The EU Special Representative for Sudan, Pekka Haavisto, participated actively in the negotiations in Abuja which led to the signing of the Darfur Peace Agreement and subsequently tried hard to bring Abdelwahid El-Nur and his faction on board. Ireland fully supports the Conclusions adopted on Sudan by the General Affairs and External Relations Council at its meetings in May and June 2006 and the Declaration adopted by the European Council on 16 June. The matter has, of course, been a priority on the agenda of the African Union (AU) for some time. The UN Security Council has adopted numerous resolutions on the situation in Sudan and a delegation from the Security Council visited Sudan on 6-8 June. They held talks with President Bashir and visited the Darfur region. They also went to South Sudan where they met with the autonomous regional government. Implementation of the January 2005 Comprehensive Peace Agreement for Southern Sudan is closely followed by the UN Special Representative for Sudan, Mr. Jan Pronk.</p>
            <p eId="para_2142">On 22 June, a Technical Assessment Mission jointly led by the UN and the African Union (AU) concluded a two-week mission in Sudan. At the request of the UN Security Council, they carried out an evaluation of requirements for transition to a UN mission and reported to the Council on 27 June. The Mission indicated that, while the situation in Darfur remains very fragile, the Darfur Peace Agreement presents an opportunity which must be seized. The Mission recommended that, because of the fragile situation, a substantial UN force should be in place in Darfur by January 2007. A solid military presence in Western Darfur could also address the issue of cross -border incursions from Chad. Since a UN mission cannot be fielded without the consent of the Government of Sudan, the UN Secretary-General will discuss this matter with the President of Sudan at a meeting sponsored by the African Union on 1 July in an effort to overcome current Sudanese objections.</p>
            <p eId="para_2143">I will travel to Sudan from 2-5 July. I will meet with representatives of the Government of Sudan as well as with representatives of the UN in Sudan. I will also visit the Darfur region and see for myself the situation on the ground in the internally displaced persons camps.</p>

            <p eId="para_2145">Presidential and parliamentary elections are now scheduled to take place in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) on 30 July 2006. These will be the first multi-party elections in the DRC in over forty years. A total of 33 candidates will contest the presidency while some 260 political parties and over 9,300 candidates will compete for the 500 legislative seats in the new parliament. Over 25 million people out of an estimated potential electorate of 28 million have registered to vote.</p>
            <p eId="para_2146">Successfully conducted elections are absolutely critical to the consolidation of peace and security in the DRC and in the Great Lakes Region as a whole. The international community, including Ireland and its EU partners, is investing heavily in ensuring that the forthcoming elections are successful, given the major organisational challenge they represent for a country the size of western Europe with extremely poor basic infrastructure and ongoing security problems. The EU and its Member States alone are contributing some €235 million towards the overall cost of the elections which are estimated at well over $300 million. The EU will also deploy a 250-strong electoral observation mission, including two observers from Ireland, to monitor the elections.</p>
            <p eId="para_2147">Nationally, Ireland is also actively supporting the electoral process in the DRC. The Government has contributed a total of €1.3 million in support of the DRC elections, including a contribution of €800,000 announced by my Department last month in support of the South African Independent Electoral Commission which is assisting in the logistical organisation and oversight of the elections. The Government has also decided to provide five Permanent Defence Force personnel to serve with the EUFOR RDC mission which the EU is deploying, at UN request, to provide support, if required, to the UN MONUC peace-keeping mission during the electoral period. Ireland also provides three members of the PDF who serve with MONUC while the Government has also contributed over €11 million for emergency and recovery activities in the DRC since 2002, almost €5 million of which has been provided to date in 2006.</p>
            <p eId="para_2148">The DRC will continue to face considerable challenges in the post-election period and it will be important for the international community to remain engaged in support. Particular challenges will be security sector reform and completing the integration of national armed and police forces. The EU is already offering extensive support in this area though the EUSEC and EUPOL ESDP missions. The successful holding of the second Summit of the Great Lakes Conference, now provisionally scheduled for next December in Nairobi, would also help to underpin security in the DRC and throughout the region. A UN Security Council mission visited the DRC earlier this month and raised some of these themes in its discussions with the DRC government and parties.</p>

            <p eId="para_2150">The Unfair Dismissals Acts 1977 to 2001 protect employees from being unfairly dismissed from their jobs by laying down criteria by which dismissals are to be judged unfair and by providing an adjudication system and redress for an employee whose dismissal has been found to be unfair.</p>
            <p eId="para_2151">To qualify under the Unfair Dismissals Acts, an employee is normally expected to have at least one year's continuous service with the employer. A claim for redress under the Acts may be submitted initially to either of the adjudicative bodies specified in the Acts i.e. a Rights Commissioner or the Employment Appeals Tribunal within 6 months of the date of dismissal. Either party may appeal a determination of the Employment Appeals Tribunal to the Circuit Court. Redress may take the form of either financial compensation, re-instatement or re-engagement, whichever the relevant adjudicative body considers appropriate having regard to all the circumstances.</p>
            <p eId="para_2152">Alternatively, it is always open to individuals to seek professional legal advice on the remedies available under the common law in relation to dismissal. However, an individual is not entitled to recover both damages at common law for "wrongful dismissal" and redress under the Unfair Dismissals Acts for "unfair dismissal".</p>
            <p eId="para_2153">An explanatory booklet on the Unfair Dismissals Acts is available on the Department's website at <i>www.entemp.ie</i> or by contacting the Employment Rights Information Unit of the Department at (01) 631 3131 or on Lo-call 1890 201 615.</p>

            <p eId="para_2155">Community Employment is an active market labour programme designed to provide eligible long-term unemployed people and other disadvantaged persons with an opportunity to engage in training and work experience within their communities on a temporary, fixed-term basis. In this way Community Employment helps unemployed people to re-enter the active workforce by breaking their experience of unemployment through a return to work routine and through availing of training to assist them to develop both their technical and personal skills.</p>
            <p eId="para_2156">In April 2000 the total amount of time that a person could participate on CE in April 2000 was limited to 3 years. This measure was introduced to facilitate the movement of participants through CE, allowing new participants who may not otherwise have such an opportunity, to avail of the programme. FÁS has some flexibility to re-engage up to 20% of departing participants for a further year, based on certain criteria being met and FÁS has fully utilised this flexibility in recent months.</p>

            <from>Minister for Social and Family Affairs (Mr. Brennan)</from>
            <p eId="para_2163">The supplementary allowance (SWA) scheme is administered on my behalf by the Community Welfare division of the Health Service Executive (HSE). The scheme provides assistance to any persons in the State whose means are insufficient to meet their needs and those of their dependants, subject to qualifying conditions.</p>
            <p eId="para_2164">I am very conscious of the need to facilitate persons in receipt of social welfare payments to take up training opportunities and to ensure that the social welfare supports are structured to support this objective. A number of measures have been introduced in recent years to remove disincentives to taking up employment and training opportunities and to assist in the transition from welfare to work. These measures include easing of means tests through income disregards and the tapered withdrawal of benefits as earnings increase.</p>
            <p eId="para_2165">Where a person has an additional income as a result of participation on a training course the means test now provides for a weekly disregard of up to €60 per week with half of additional income between €60 and €90 also disregarded for means assessment purposes. For those participating in approved training courses, any lunch or travel allowances that are paid may also be disregarded. In addition certain training courses now provide a childcare allowance to participants on certain courses. Budget 2006 provided that these childcare allowances are to be treated in the same manner as a lunch or travel allowance and disregarded.</p>
            <p eId="para_2166">Under legislation a number of categories are specifically excluded from receiving assistance under the Supplementary Welfare Allowance Scheme. People in full-time education are normally excluded from receipt of rent supplement under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme. However, people participating in approved courses under the back-to-education allowance (BTEA) scheme receive a standard weekly rate of payment equivalent to the maximum rate of their previous social welfare payment and may retain any secondary benefits, such as rent supplements, fuel allowance or diet supplements which had been in payment prior to the commencement of their education course. These special provisions are in place to encourage and facilitate people to improve their skills and qualifications and, therefore, their prospects of returning to the active work force.</p>
            <p eId="para_2167">The BTEA programme was established to encourage and facilitate people on certain social welfare payments to improve their skills and qualifications and, therefore, their prospects of returning to the active work force. The requirement to be in receipt of a relevant social welfare payment for a minimum period has always been a feature of the scheme and is considered necessary to ensure that limited resources are directed at those most in need.</p>
            <p eId="para_2168">People already in employment are not considered to be in the target group for the scheme. An applicant must be in receipt of a relevant social welfare payment for at least six months, in the case of people wishing to complete a second level course, or twelve months in the case of people wishing to pursue third level qualifications. The twelve month requirement is reduced to nine in the case of people who wish to attend a third level course and who are participating in the National Employment Action Plan.</p>
            <p eId="para_2169">In the context of the Budget I announced that time spent in receipt of supplementary welfare allowance can count towards the qualifying period for back to education allowance in circumstances where the person establishes an entitlement to a relevant social welfare payment prior to commencing an approved course of study. This new provision will come into effect from September 2006. At present, to qualify for participation in the BTEA scheme an applicant must be, prior to commencing an approved course of study, at least 21 years of age (18 for people with disabilities).</p>
            <p eId="para_2170">Overall I consider that the current supplementary welfare allowance provisions ensure that people have a financial incentive to take up education or training opportunities. I would also mention that these arrangements are being considered further in the context of a policy review of the supplementary welfare allowance scheme which is due to be completed shortly.</p>

The premises have been subjected to inspections by Gardaí on five occasions to date in 2006. Gardaí have cautioned the licensee in respect of complaints of anti-social behaviour received from the local residents.

The recipient may pay the fixed charge of €80 within 28 days of the date of issue of the notice, or a fixed charge of €120 within 29 to 56 days. Where the fixed charge is not paid a prosecution will ensue. On conviction a Court may impose a fine of up to €1,500.</p>

            <from>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. McDowell)</from>
            <p eId="para_2335">I propose to take Questions Nos. 204 and 205 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_2336">A number of years ago my Department introduced a scheme whereby the requirement to hold a valid visa prior to entering the State was waived for certain persons travelling from Belarus with the Chernobyl Children's Organisation for the purposes of visiting Ireland for a period of rest and/or recuperation. The groups involved were, at the time, limited in number and were well known to my Department. The number of groups seeking such visa exemptions has increased significantly and there are now between 35 and 40 groups.</p>
            <p eId="para_2337">This practice worked well in the past but we found it necessary to re-evaluate the system for a number of reasons. First, the introduction of the Children Act 2001 has placed extra obligations on all parties involved in the establishment of private foster care arrangements. Some, but not necessarily all, of the arrangements entered into between host families, the Chernobyl groups and the parents of the children involved, fall into the category "private foster care arrangements" as defined by the Department of Health and Children. Indeed, officials of my Department met with officials of the Department of Health and Children on this matter to ensure consistency and agreement on the revised practices. Second, the introduction of Carrier's Liability under Section 2.1 of the Immigration Act 2003 means that visa waiver letters are no longer an acceptable alternative to visa endorsements on passports. Third, there are, unfortunately, indications that in certain cases children have not returned to Belarus on the agreed date.</p>
            <p eId="para_2338">While my Department may not be directly responsible for the welfare of these children as such, we have an obligation to put into place a system that guarantees, in as much as it is possible, their safety. Were we to continue the practice of issuing visa waiver letters we could be in breach of the relevant legislation.</p>
            <p eId="para_2339">We now have a dedicated visa office in the Irish Embassy in Moscow which can process these applications and officials of my Department have informed the Chernobyl Groups that such applications will be prioritised by that office. Ultimately our aim is to ensure the safety and welfare of the children who arrive into the care of this State and we are satisfied that the "one person, one visa" system for all is the best way forward in this regard.</p>
            <p eId="para_2340">I would emphasise that the safety of the children concerned is the primary reason for the introduction of these revised practices. A more serious breach of visa regulations involves a number of adults who sought to accompany children and who did not return to Belarus. This has resulted in tighter controls and checking of such application types. Such persons are circumventing immigration controls by using a vulnerable group to assist with their entry to the State and further have taken advantage of the good nature of their Irish hosts in certain circumstances. Adults who meet the necessary criteria will of course be granted a visa.</p>
            <p eId="para_2341">The new arrangements were notified well in advance to the groups involved and I have no plans at this time to undertake further consultations or discussions with them.</p>

Residence in this context means residence for which the applicant had the permission of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform and where such permission was not for the purpose of study or seeking asylum.

On the 2nd June, 2006, the Reception and Integration Agency made a further offer of accommodation at Balseskin Centre, St. Margaret's Road, Finglas, Dublin 11 to the woman. As previously outlined in previous questions to the house, there is a free and frequent bus service for Balseskin residents to the Rotunda Hospital and Dublin City Centre. She elected to decline this offer of accommodation also.</p>
            <p eId="para_2352">As this woman has been in direct provision for a period of over two years, she can be considered for placement in self-catering accommodation. However, the Reception and Integration has a limited supply of self-catering accommodation in its portfolio and there are currently a number of lone parents with children and families, who have been in direct provision for a period longer than her, awaiting placement at such centres. Accordingly the Reception and Integration Agency will contact her when a suitable vacancy becomes available.</p>

Temporary leave to remain as an exceptional measure was granted to the person concerned in November 2004.</p>
            <p eId="para_2357">My Department's records indicate that the person in question had permission to remain in the State continuously between November 2004 and November 2005. She has also been granted permission to remain from February 2006 until November 2006. There is no record that she has had permission to remain for the period December 2005 and January 2006 and, consequently, this period is not reckonable for naturalisation.</p>
            <p eId="para_2358">According to my officials' calculations, the earliest that the person in question will meet the above mentioned residency requirement is January 2010, provided, of course, she maintains her permission to remain in the State between now and then without any gaps.</p>

            <p eId="para_2377">I propose to take Questions Nos. 216, 218 and 220 to 222, inclusive, together.</p>
            <p eId="para_2378">DEIS (Delivering Equality of Opportunity in Schools), the action plan for educational inclusion, provides for a standardised system for identifying levels of disadvantage and a new integrated School Support Programme (SSP). The School Support Programme will bring together, and build upon, a number of existing interventions in schools with a concentrated level of disadvantage. The process of identifying primary and second-level schools for participation in the SSP was managed by the Educational Research Centre (ERC) on behalf of my Department and supported by quality assurance work co-ordinated through the Department's regional offices and the Inspectorate.</p>
            <p eId="para_2379">As a result of the identification process, 840 schools were invited to participate in the SSP. These comprised 640 primary schools (320 urban/town schools and 320 rural schools) and 200 second-level schools. I am delighted to say that 833 of the schools invited to join the new programme accepted the invitation. Schools that did not qualify for the new programme will keep the extra resources they are getting under existing schemes for the 2006/07 school year and after that they will continue to get support in line with the level of disadvantage among their pupils.</p>
            <p eId="para_2380">My Department is currently considering the arrangements to be made regarding the clustering of the 320 rural schools under the School Support Programme and other rural schools retaining their entitlements under previous programmes for 2006-07. Schools will be notified of the proposed arrangements in early September.</p>
            <p eId="para_2381">A review mechanism has been put in place to address the concerns of schools that did not qualify for inclusion in the School Support Programme but regard themselves as having a level of disadvantage which is of a scale sufficient to warrant their inclusion in the programme. The review process will operate under the direction of an independent person, charged with ensuring that all relevant identification processes and procedures were properly followed in the case of schools applying for a review. All the schools to which the Deputy refers have submitted review applications. The review process is currently underway and it is intended that it will be completed by the end of the current school year.</p>

     <b>Ms C. Murphy</b>
      asked the 
     <b>Minister for Education and Science</b>
     if her attention has been drawn to the fact that a secondary school (details supplied) in County Kildare is demanding that parents pay a registration fee in order to secure a school place for their children in the forthcoming year and is withholding items such as book lists until the fee has been paid; if her attention has further been drawn to the fact that the same school is charging a fee for students who have elected to undertake a transition year and those without the capacity to pay this sum are not eligible to enrol in transition year; if such school policies are standard throughout schools funded by her Department; if, there are any instances where parents would be entitled to exemption from such fees; her views on the fact that such policies could be seen as infringing on the ability of children to access free secondary school education; and if she will make a statement on the matter.

            <p eId="para_2395">It is a fundamental principle of the free post-primary education scheme that no charge is made in respect of: instruction in any subject of my Department's programme for secondary schools; recreation or study facilities where all the pupils are expected to avail themselves of these as part of the school programme; and any other activities in which all pupils are required to take part.</p>
            <p eId="para_2396">Schools are allowed to charge a booking fee when considering new applicants for enrolment, provided this is refundable following a decision on enrolment. Booking fees are sometimes required by schools in order to avoid "double booking" of pupils in schools which could result in the loss of teaching posts.</p>
            <p eId="para_2397">Voluntary contributions by parents or charges for optional extras over and above what is provided for in the general school programme are permissible under the scheme, provided it is made absolutely clear to parents that there is no question of compulsion to pay, and that in making a contribution, they are doing so of their own volition. I have asked my officials to contact the school authorities to clarify the nature of the transition year contribution.</p>

      asked the

     if her attention has been drawn to the situation in a school (details supplied) in Dublin 24 in which the two prefabs have been found to be rat infested and have been deemed unfit by a health and safety official; and if she will make a statement on funding which may be allocated to the school in view of its plight.

            <p eId="para_2399">As outlined to the Deputy in my response to his Parliamentary Question dated 28 June 2006, the school to which he refers applied for additional accommodation to cater for increased enrolments. This application was refused on the grounds that my Department is satisfied that there is considerable spare capacity in neighbouring schools. My Department's main responsibility is to ensure that schools in an area can, between them, cater for all pupils seeking school places. While this may result in pupils not obtaining a place in the school of their first choice, this approach ensures that the use of existing accommodation is maximised and that the development and support of one school over others does not occur.</p>
            <p eId="para_2400">If there are problems with the standard of accommodation which might require replacement this is a different matter and my Department will be in contact with the school about this issue. With regard to a leaking roof, my Department has not been appraised of this situation. The scope of the works, however, is appropriate for consideration under the summer works scheme. It is noted that the school has never made an application for funds under this scheme. The 2007 summer works scheme was recently published. The closing date for the receipt of applications is 29 September next. The governing circular letter and the application form are available on my Department's website <i>www.education.ie</i>.</p>

     her Department’s policy in relation to second level school sizes and the maximum appropriate size for second level schools; if her Department has made approaches to schools (details supplied) with a view to increasing the number of pupils in each school; the position in relation to further growth in school numbers given the huge demand for second level school places in the Dublin 15 area; if her Department has commissioned work in relation to planning for second level school numbers in the Dublin 15 area in view of the growth of house building in the area and the growth in population; and if she will make a statement on the matter.

            <p eId="para_2466">In general my Department seeks to maximise the use of school sites at primary and post primary level to cater for demand presenting in any particular area. To this end, where site conditions allow and with the agreement of the trustees, post primary schools to cater for up to 1,000 pupils are provided in areas where the population profile justifies this level of accommodation.</p>
            <p eId="para_2467">The enrolment at the specific schools to which the Deputy refers slightly exceeds 1,000 pupils. No approach has been made by my Department to either of these schools regarding further expansion. With regard to post primary provision in the Dublin 15 area, the Deputy will be aware that plans for a new post primary school in the Phibblestown area are at an advanced stage and, in view of the expanding population, the provision of a further post primary school in the area is currently under consideration.</p>

            <p eId="para_2491">Catchment boundaries have their origins in the establishment of free post-primary education in the late 1960's and were determined following consultation with local educational interests. For planning purposes the country was divided into geographic districts each with several primary schools feeding into a post-primary centre with one or more post-primary schools. The intention was and continues to be that these defined districts facilitate the orderly planning of school provision and accommodation needs.</p>
            <p eId="para_2492">A number of reviews have been carried out over the years where, for example, a new post-primary school is established in an area where previously there was none or, conversely, where a "sole provider" school closes due to declining enrolments. The Area Development Planning initiative, involving an extensive consultative process carried out by the Commission on School Accommodation, will also inform future revisions to catchment areas. An Area Development Plan takes account of demographic changes and projects future enrolments for existing schools and new schools if required. Catchment boundary changes will be made where the implementation of the recommendations in an Area Development Plan requires such adjustments. In the circumstances, I do not propose to have a general countrywide review of catchment boundaries.</p>

            <p eId="para_2494">Under the EU Birds Directive, Ireland, like other Member States, is required to maintain the population of the Hen Harrier, and to designate Special Protection Areas (SPAs) as required for the species.</p>
            <p eId="para_2495">In 2002, based on the then available information, nine possible SPA catchments were identified for Hen Harriers in the State. Since then, my Department has thoroughly reviewed the research and information on the Hen Harrier, including the results of a second national survey in 2005. Based on this work a significant reduction in the number and extent of SPAs is now envisaged.</p>
            <p eId="para_2496">In general, it is not anticipated that the designation of a site for Hen Harriers will have effects on existing farming, existing forestry, or other ongoing activities. Neither should designation of a Hen Harrier SPA result in any restrictions on future rural housing development, on the intensification of grassland management nor on the reseeding of rough grass fields in the area.</p>
            <p eId="para_2497">The main activities likely to require regulation would be land reclamation/habitat destruction; commercial turf extraction; scrub, gorse or hedgerow removal; and to intensive use of off-road vehicles, other than by farmers.</p>
            <p eId="para_2498">Any proposed windfarm developments will continue to be assessed through the planning process and planning authorities will assess each proposal on a case-by-case basis. I am today publishing Guidelines for planning authorities on wind energy development. These Guidelines point out there is huge potential to avoid or reduce negative environmental impacts, including those on the natural heritage, in designing wind energy projects.</p>
            <p eId="para_2499">Regarding the issue of further afforestation in the Hen Harrier SPAs, a Working Group of relevant interests both farming and forestry and my Department has been established to examine the issue with a view to developing a practical management regime for further forestry in the proposed SPAs.</p>
            <p eId="para_2500">Designation of SPAs does not, of itself, give rise to an entitlement to compensation. However Article 20 of the European Communities (Natural Habitats) Regulations 1997 provides that where consent to a specified operation or activity is refused the owner or occupier or user as the case may be paid by way of compensation, an amount equal to the loss suffered by the depreciation of an interest in the land to which he or she is entitled. In order to qualify for such compensation payments, it will generally be necessary to show that restrictions have been placed on activities which were practised for a period prior to the designation of the site in question. Compensation would be determined by reference to the predesignation and post-designation values of the land in question. The value of any amounts received under the Rural Environment Protection Scheme may also be taken into account is determining any compensation.</p>

            <p eId="para_2537">In July 1996 my Department issued Guidelines for Planning Authorities on Telecommunications Antennae and Support Structures. Their purpose was to assist planning authorities, An Bord Pleanála, operators of mobile telecommunications services and the general public by providing guidance on dealing with telecommunications masts and base stations within the planning system. The Oireachtas Joint Committee on Communications, Marine and Natural Resources reported in June 2005 on Non-ionising radiation from mobile phone handsets and masts. The Report made 11 recommendations, including a recommendation that planning guidelines and planning exemptions be examined with a view to ensuring that no equipment emitting electromagnetic or radio frequency emissions should be permitted to be sited near health centres, schools or other sensitive sites such as playgrounds or pitches etc. Following the report of the Joint Committee, the Government, in September 2005, approved the establishment of an inter-departmental advisory committee and an expert group, working to the committee, on the health effects of electromagnetic fields. The committee, on which my Department is represented, will provide advice to the Government on the appropriate action to be taken on foot of the recommendations contained in the report. The work of the committee and expert group is in train and I understand that the committee expects to report to the Government before the end of 2006. In the interim, it is not proposed to amend the current Guidelines for Planning Authorities on Telecommunications Antennae and Support Structures.</p>

            <p eId="para_2547">The key objectives of the Rental Accommodation Scheme (RAS) are to eliminate dependence on SWA rent supplement scheme by persons assessed as needing housing assistance on a long term basis; enhance the response of local authorities in meeting long-term housing need; provide an additional source of good quality accommodation for eligible persons and potentially provide more effective utilisation of resources for housing assistance. The initial project to transfer rent supplement recipients of 18 months or more continuous duration is due to be completed by the end of 2008.</p>
            <p eId="para_2548">Good progress has been made in setting up the management and financial systems, legal forms and administrative arrangements for the implementation of the scheme. Roll out commenced in an initial group of lead authorities in 2005 and the first transfers to the scheme were made in September of that year. The authorities now actively operating the scheme cover over 85% of the transferable cases and from mid-year it is expected that all authorities will have commenced work on the scheme. All of the relevant agencies are co-operating actively to ensure that by the end of 2006, effectively the first year of operation, 5,000 households will have transferred.</p>
            <p eId="para_2549">I am satisfied at this early stage that good progress is being made in meeting all the objectives for the Rental Accommodation Scheme including making savings where these can be achieved. In terms of achieving the objectives of the scheme, the indications from local authorities have been positive to date with over 1,200 cases transferred to RAS accommodation. A further 770 households who were recipients of Rent Supplement have been provided with local authority housing. A breakdown of the number of transfers to date by county from Rent Supplement to RAS is provided in the table below. A full review of the operation of the scheme, including an assessment of the financial costs and benefits, will be undertaken before the end of the implementation period in 2008. Initial indications are that there have been savings on rents on about a third of the transfers to private accommodation to date. The following table outlines the Number of Rent Supplement Cases transferred to the Rental Accommodation Scheme — it should be noted that Transfers from Rent Supplement to the Rental Accommodation Scheme commenced in 2005 — in 2004, 2005 and 2006 to the end of May, by county:</p>
