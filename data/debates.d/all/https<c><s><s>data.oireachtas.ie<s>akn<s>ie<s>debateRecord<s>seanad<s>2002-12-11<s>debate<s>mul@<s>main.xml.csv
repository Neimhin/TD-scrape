#RoryKiely	unknown-#RoryKiely-party	unknown-#RoryKiely-dob	unknown-#RoryKiely-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	0	I have notice from Senator Bannon that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:The need for the Minister for Health and Children to make a statement regarding the withdrawal of the provision of "on call" medical technician services in five midland ambulance bases.I regard the matter raised by the Senator as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment and it will be taken at the conclusion of business.
#MaryORourke	unknown-#MaryORourke-party	unknown-#MaryORourke-dob	unknown-#MaryORourke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	1	The Christmas spirit is setting in. We do not have many matters on the Adjournment. However, that is not the case with the business of the House.The Order of Business is Nos. 1, motion seeking the approval of a Council framework decision relating to the combating of the sexual exploitation of children and child pornography, a measure referred by the Seanad to the Joint Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women's Rights which is returned following discussion, without debate; No. 2, Planning and Development (Amendment) Bill, 2002 – Committee and Remaining Stages, to conclude not later than 2 p.m.; No. 3, statements on the high level of alcohol consumption by young people, to conclude no later than 6 p.m., with the contributions of spokespersons not to exceed 15 minutes and those of all other Senators not to exceed ten minutes, and on which Senators may share time; and No. 9, motion No. 19, to be taken from 6 p.m. to 8 p.m. There will be a sos between 2 p.m. and 3 p.m.May I say something with the permission of the Cathaoirleach?
#RoryKiely	unknown-#RoryKiely-party	unknown-#RoryKiely-dob	unknown-#RoryKiely-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	2	Yes.
#MaryORourke	unknown-#MaryORourke-party	unknown-#MaryORourke-dob	unknown-#MaryORourke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	3	We have tried from the beginning of the year not to take Committee and Report Stages of Bills together, but time is pressing and it is more difficult this week and next week to give full time to debates. The Planning and Development (Amendment) Bill will go to the Dáil tomorrow and the papers must be printed this afternoon. That is by way of explanation.
#BrianHayes	unknown-#BrianHayes-party	unknown-#BrianHayes-dob	unknown-#BrianHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	4	I am sure the Leader accepts that it is a bad precedent for Committee and Report Stages of a Bill to be taken together. It is understandable that it should happen where there is unanimity concerning the legislation, such as with the British-Irish Agreement (Amendment) Bill where we agreed to take all Stages in one day. However, it is clear that there is considerable disagreement concerning the Planning and Development (Amendment) Bill and, given that level of disagreement, it would be a bad precedent to proceed with both Committee and Report Stages today.Will the Leader take up a substantive issue with the Minister for Finance concerning the matter Senator Dooley raised yesterday regarding pricing and charges? The Government proposes to increase substantially the stamp duty on ATM, cheque, credit and laser cards, a measure was announced in the budget. However, when banks propose additional charges, they must write to their customers informing them of the charges before they are implemented.Will the Leader request the Minister for Finance to demand that all financial institutions write to their credit card customers informing them of the latest Government stealth tax which it is proposed to implement from 1 January next and giving them the option of leaving the credit card scheme if they choose not to pay? There is a law governing the implementation of bank charges and the same law should apply to increasing stamp duty on bank and credit cards. The budget announcement in this regard is an example of an agreement being breached in the middle of a financial year and this is a bad precedent. Will the Leader take up this issue with the Minister for Finance before he introduces the Finance Bill to the Houses?
#JoeOToole	unknown-#JoeOToole-party	unknown-#JoeOToole-dob	unknown-#JoeOToole-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	5	While I do not want a debate on No. 1, I would like the House to be aware that a precedent of taking such motions without debate is not being established. No. 1 has been discussed by a committee and has been returned to the House, which should be at liberty to discuss it if it believes it requires further discussion. We have agreed in the interests of having a smooth operation that, where it is proposed to refer a measure before the House to a committee, we do not discuss the measure until it is returned by the committee. The basis on which we do it is that, when it returns from the committee, it is open to discussion. I do not seek a discussion on No. 1 because I know it has been discussed at length. My point is that the matter should not be let pass without taking note of the agreed manner in which we deal with it.On yesterday's Order of Business, Senator Ulick Burke and others raised the proposed abolition of the Western Development Commission. This is outrageous given the discussions in the House about the importance of focusing on, understanding and developing what is happening in rural areas. What is at issue is that a Minister does not want another competitor in this sector. That is unacceptable, as were the comments made yesterday on the other side of the House. Only for the fact that the contributor is not present, I would deal with the issues as they arose. I would like a discussion in the House on this matter.The deciding vote of Independent Senators caused the appointment of a Minister with responsibility for the west in the previous coalition Government at a time when Fianna Fáil said it would never agree to increasing the number of Ministers of State from 17 to 19 and gave an assurance that, as soon as it entered Government, it would reduce the number from 19 to 17. Thankfully that never happened, as we all know. I would be the last one to reduce promotional prospects for anybody and it is important we should retain that. However, that is unacceptable and I would like the Minister to come here and explain himself. I would also like Fianna Fáil to initiate a debate within its own party on this. What is going on here is wrong and it gives the wrong signal. This is a decision that will badly hit people in the west. It certainly should not happen without much discussion and consultation.An issue related to that point, which also needs to be discussed and which could be taken in conjunction with the point just raised by Senator Hayes, is that of pricing. In this House about two months ago, during a discussion on inflation, prices and competitiveness, I gave the examples of the prices of milk and meat. I said Irish farmers would be better off in a trade union that would look after their interests rather than the IFA, which does not appear to look at what is happening out there. As we saw last night, the farmers are being crucified by low milk and meat prices. Somewhere along the line other people are making huge profits. It is time we looked at this matter. It is fuelling inflation and it is unfair on the prime producers – the farmers. It is unfair to the whole system and we are all suffering because of it. I would like to know why action cannot be taken. This could be discussed at the same time as the issue raised by Senator Brian Hayes.
#BrendanRyan	unknown-#BrendanRyan-party	unknown-#BrendanRyan-dob	unknown-#BrendanRyan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	6	As I have already informed the Leader, we will not agree to the Order of Business. The Leader's position on this has been entirely honourable and I am not accusing her of anything else. When we discussed this informally last week, the Leader, other Members and I were under the impression this was a simple Bill to deal with the possible extinguishing of large numbers of planning permissions by the end of December. On those grounds we, in the Labour Party, were happy to facilitate the Government. It turns out to be something entirely different and this is not the Leader's fault. This is a Bill with many sections of considerable complexity.There is a principle involved here and we must also consider the practicalities. Senator Hayes said we agreed to take all Stages of the British-Irish Agreement (No. 2) Bill last week in one session. In hindsight, having watched reactions, that was not a great decision either. There were issues to be teased out on that, which would have been better teased out in the Houses of the Oireachtas than by a slanging match between the Ulster Unionist Party and the Irish Government over the airwaves and in public. A situation has evolved that need not have evolved had proper time been used. It is a bad idea and often unexpectedly so.Apart from my own and the Labour Party's views on it, we have no assurance that this Bill is technically consistent. We will have no chance for a proper delay after Committee Stage to allow the Minister to take seriously into account any issue that may arise which he has not considered. We recently discussed the Digital Hub Bill with the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, Deputy Dermot Ahern, and issues arose on Committee stage which the Minister immediately accepted at least needed reflection. He did reflect and on some of them he did what the Opposition wanted and on others he did not. However, he accepted the wisdom in the Government on this issue was not 100%. The Government does not have a monopoly on wisdom – nobody does, least of all the Opposition.We are being told this Bill is so important that there will be no chance to investigate whether there might be mistakes or inconsistencies in it. How do we know? I have been in this House on and off for the past 20 years. Legislation has gone through with mistakes and inconsistencies. In the last Seanad, legislation that had passed through one House came here, to repeal a section in another Bill that did not exist. As Senator O'Toole will remember, with the then Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources, we had to find a way of amending it, quite surreptitiously, because there were mistakes in it. The Leader is now proposing that we should not have the opportunity to do that and my party does not accept it. This Bill is far to complex for that.I move an amendment to the Order of Business that No. 2 be the commencement of Committee Stage, that there should be no deadline on Committee Stage, and that Report Stage should be taken at a later date. My proposal is that we begin Committee Stage and we see how it proceeds. This Bill could be taken in the Dáil next week, so there is no reason for us to rush it today. We should have no deadline by which Committee Stage should end.

#BrendanRyan	unknown-#BrendanRyan-party	unknown-#BrendanRyan-dob	unknown-#BrendanRyan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	8	No. The Leader suggested that all Stages be completed by 2 o'clock today.
#MaryORourke	unknown-#MaryORourke-party	unknown-#MaryORourke-dob	unknown-#MaryORourke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	9	That is correct.
#BrendanRyan	unknown-#BrendanRyan-party	unknown-#BrendanRyan-dob	unknown-#BrendanRyan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	10	I propose that we commence Committee Stage and do no more than that.
#RoryKiely	unknown-#RoryKiely-party	unknown-#RoryKiely-dob	unknown-#RoryKiely-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	11	Committee Stage can be taken first and then we decide when to take Report Stage.
#BrendanRyan	unknown-#BrendanRyan-party	unknown-#BrendanRyan-dob	unknown-#BrendanRyan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	12	On the Order of Business, the Leader has proposed that all Stages be taken today. If I agree to the Order of Business, I am agreeing that all Stages be taken today and I do not agree to that.
#RoryKiely	unknown-#RoryKiely-party	unknown-#RoryKiely-dob	unknown-#RoryKiely-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	13	You are proposing that only Committee Stage be taken today.
#BrendanRyan	unknown-#BrendanRyan-party	unknown-#BrendanRyan-dob	unknown-#BrendanRyan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	14	Yes. Apart from that I want to raise two brief issues.
#RoryKiely	unknown-#RoryKiely-party	unknown-#RoryKiely-dob	unknown-#RoryKiely-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	15	I hope they will be brief.
#BrendanRyan	unknown-#BrendanRyan-party	unknown-#BrendanRyan-dob	unknown-#BrendanRyan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	16	This is a very serious issue and it needed to be explained. However, these will be very brief.
#MaryORourke	unknown-#MaryORourke-party	unknown-#MaryORourke-dob	unknown-#MaryORourke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	17	We might not understand them, but the Senator should go on.
#BrendanRyan	unknown-#BrendanRyan-party	unknown-#BrendanRyan-dob	unknown-#BrendanRyan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	18	That is not like the Leader.
#MaryORourke	unknown-#MaryORourke-party	unknown-#MaryORourke-dob	unknown-#MaryORourke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	19	I am sorry. The Senator should excuse me.
#BrendanRyan	unknown-#BrendanRyan-party	unknown-#BrendanRyan-dob	unknown-#BrendanRyan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	20	I would like the Minister for Foreign Affairs to come here and explain to us the Government's position on the hijacking of the Iraqi arms dossier by the United States. United States officials are the only people to have the full dossier and apparently they are editing it before it is given to anybody else. The Minister for Foreign Affairs should explain our role on the Security Council, if somebody else is to filter the information available to us. That issue is of central importance to the safety of this planet and we should debate it.The Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources should come here to explain what the Government is proposing to do with the RTÉ licence fee, and its proposals for RTÉ and public broadcasting generally. There is an atmosphere of rumour and confusion at present that is serving no purpose in terms of RTÉ's future.
#TerryLeyden	unknown-#TerryLeyden-party	unknown-#TerryLeyden-dob	unknown-#TerryLeyden-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	21	I ask the Leader to consider having a debate in the new year on the serious crisis in the Middle East. With the permission of the Chair and the House, we should invite the Minister for Foreign Affairs, the Israeli ambassador and the representative of the Palestinian people in Ireland to come to the House to have an open debate on this issue. A general election will be held in Israel in January and this House could facilitate discussions between both parties and could be a facilitator for peace and conflict resolution. As a neutral country we are in a unique position to have a detailed debate on this issue.
#MichaelFinucane	unknown-#MichaelFinucane-party	unknown-#MichaelFinucane-dob	unknown-#MichaelFinucane-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	22	When the Nice referendum was carried recently, we, in this House, were all very pleased it was successful. The European Convention was established to decide on a new constitution and treaty for Europe. A colleague of ours, Deputy John Bruton, has been assiduous in his attendance and has spoken out on many issues. However, there has been no commitment by the Minister of State, Deputy Dick Roche, to attend these meetings. What is happening?The Minister should come to the House to establish why we are sidelining this institution when the foreign affairs ministers from France and Germany are attending. We may regret sidelining it, because there will be no point waiting until June when proposals are formalised and then objecting. Ministers, like the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, are sniping from the sidelines in Dublin rather than being in there fighting the case in relation to tax harmonisation or any other issues that are being discussed. I ask the Leader to request the Minister for State to come to the House so that we can find out how serious the Government is about Europe.
#LiamFitzgerald	unknown-#LiamFitzgerald-party	unknown-#LiamFitzgerald-dob	unknown-#LiamFitzgerald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	23	I ask the Leader to comment on two issues relating to third level education. If proof was needed that the abolition of third level education fees has not improved access to third level from the ranks of the disadvantaged, it has become available today with the publication of official figures from the Department of Education and Science which show that 2% of students who avail of third level grant support come from the ranks of semi-skilled and manual workers.In terms of the socio-economic profile of the third level student population, another recent survey firmly supports today's figures. From September 2000 onwards, more than 7,000 disadvantaged students received top-up grants of about €1,555 each. I suggest this area should be given serious consideration as part of the current review of third level funding.On a related matter, a recent report forecasts a dramatic decline in the third level student population in the next ten years. The cause of the decline will be demographic trends, rather than funding issues. For every 100 young people in the 16 to 19 age group in 2000, there will only be 81 in 2010 and 79 the following year. Incidentally, the Leader should note that the study forecasts that the midlands will be worst affected with the equivalent figure set to fall to 71 within a decade. I am not sure if she will be able to do anything about it, although we both did our bit in that regard long ago. The report points up the need for an urgent review of our order of priorities in allocating the third level budget.
#DavidNorris	unknown-#DavidNorris-party	unknown-#DavidNorris-dob	unknown-#DavidNorris-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	24	I ask the Leader to request that the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Cowen, appear before the House to update Senators on the position regarding the report of the arms inspectors in Iraq. Many people are extremely concerned that the United States, very much an interested party in this matter, has hijacked the report. I heard a rather weak explanation from the United Nations in which it claimed it could not photocopy the report. If the United Nations cannot photocopy a document which can be carried through an airport in a plastic bag, the organisation is seriously under-resourced. It is extraordinary that one of the principal protagonists in this row should take the material and not only photocopy it and have it in its possession, but also deny access to it to the other members of the Security Council, of which Ireland is one.Apparently this morning's news reports used the word "edited" in the context of the report. What does "editing" entail in this regard? We are due to vacate our seat on the Security Council in about two weeks. We should not give a whimper of acquiescence to the United States on this extremely serious matter in doing so.The situation is obviously escalating. One of the more sinister events has been the detention of the ship from North Korea with 12 scud missiles on board. It is very alarming that the United States is playing down the issue and I wonder why. As our membership of the Security Council draws to a close, we are entitled to receive an explanation. We should give strong backing to our representative on the Security Council to challenge the unilateral action of the United States. If this process is to lead us to war, which I hope it does not, it must be clear and transparent and people must be confident that matters are being handled properly.With regard to taking all Stages of a Bill in one day, I understand the technical problem facing the Leader in that the date on the Bill requires that it be passed before the end of the session. However, this is not a precedent as, unfortunately, it happens every year coming up to Christmas. This year is not as bad as most of the 14 other years I have been in the House. I call on the Leader to apply pressure on Departments to ensure they do not leave important legislative proposals until the end of the session and ram them all through at once. The problem is a reflection on the Departments rather than the political parties.Yesterday was International Human Rights Day. I understand the Government proposes to reintroduce a new version of the legislation which incorporates the European Convention of Human Rights, possibly through the Dáil. Will the Leader indicate the current position? I understand the changes in the Bill will further erode the rights of plaintiffs. This matter should come before the House so that it may be discussed in a non-partisan manner.
#JohnDardis	unknown-#JohnDardis-party	unknown-#JohnDardis-dob	unknown-#JohnDardis-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	25	With regard to ordering business and the taking of various Stages of Bills on the same day, more experienced Senators will recall that taking Committee and Report Stages together has been a regular feature of business, whereas taking Committee Stage immediately after Second Stage is very unusual. It is a matter for the agreement of the House.With regard to the issue raised by Senator Finucane, members of the convention have regularly presented their views to the Forum on Europe. The chairman of the Forum on Europe is due to address the Joint Committee on European Affairs today. The Minister appeared before the committee prior to the Copenhagen summit. Ongoing liaison is taking place with regard to the work of the convention, which is not to say it would not be useful to debate the issue in the House. I do not believe any of the parties share the view expressed by Mr. Prodi that tax affairs should be covered by majority voting and we should lose sovereignty over them.
#MichaelFinucane	unknown-#MichaelFinucane-party	unknown-#MichaelFinucane-dob	unknown-#MichaelFinucane-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	26	Nobody said that. We should be in the forum on an ongoing basis.
#JohnDardis	unknown-#JohnDardis-party	unknown-#JohnDardis-dob	unknown-#JohnDardis-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	27	I share many of the views expressed by Senator Norris regarding Iraq. Several weeks ago, I noted in the House how, on a visit to the United States, I had been struck by the divergence between the views of the Administration and those of many citizens. It appears the Government of the United States has made up its mind on certain matters, irrespective of the contents of the inspectors' report and the document published by Iraq.
#DavidNorris	unknown-#DavidNorris-party	unknown-#DavidNorris-dob	unknown-#DavidNorris-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	28	Yes.
#JohnDardis	unknown-#JohnDardis-party	unknown-#JohnDardis-dob	unknown-#JohnDardis-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	29	It would be useful to debate the issue immediately after Christmas.
#KathleenOMeara	unknown-#KathleenOMeara-party	unknown-#KathleenOMeara-dob	unknown-#KathleenOMeara-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	30	I second Senator Ryan's amendment to the Order of Business. I agree with Senator Dardis that Committee Stage should not be taken immediately after Second Stage. Our agreement to take Committee Stage today reflects our reasonableness with regard to business generally. It would be much more desirable to take Second Stage this week and Committee Stage next week in order that the points raised on Second Stage could be considered by the Minister and his officials and reflected in the Bill when we take Committee Stage. The attempt to take Committee and Report Stages today means that it will not be feasible for the Minister to accept amendments tabled by Senators from this side of the House, even if he were inclined to do so. Effectively, therefore, we will have a wasted debate which is not good practice. Given the views expressed by many Senators on rushing legislation, it would be useful to put the brakes on this Bill.I agree with my colleague with regard to the drip-drip effect of the information emanating about RTÉ. I request that the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, Deputy Dermot Ahern, come before the House and set out his proposals in respect of the national broadcaster and the use of the publicly funded licence fee and allow us to respond.
#PeterCallanan	unknown-#PeterCallanan-party	unknown-#PeterCallanan-dob	unknown-#PeterCallanan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	31	I support Senator Dardis's comments on the manner in which the debate will be taken today. It is usual to take Report and Final Stages together, but somewhat unusual to take Second Stage and Committee Stage together.Senator O'Toole raised a very important matter. The "Prime Time" programme last night showed clear evidence of price fixing among the bodies trading in milk to the consumer. Such practices have a significant impact on the consumer and possibly the farmer. I ask the Leader to invite the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Harney, to the House to participate in a full debate on what is happening in the dairy and meat processing sectors. There was clear evidence last night that price fixing is being engaged in. It is a bad practice and the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment should come before the House at the earliest opportunity with a view to discussing the possibility of having the Competition Authority investigate the matter.
#JamesBannon	unknown-#JamesBannon-party	unknown-#JamesBannon-dob	unknown-#JamesBannon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	32	I support the amendment to the Order of Business. I see no reason to rush the Bill through the House. When legislation is rushed through, an air of suspicion is created. There is a need for more clarity in regard to the Bill and we must ensure that the social elements it contains are not destroyed. There are 120,000 people waiting for houses and we must ensure that their aspirations are met. We must get the legislation right this time. There are several references to Fine Gael policy in the amending legislation. I am delighted the Government is taking some of our policies on board in the Bill and I would like to explain them a little more in the course of the Committee Stage debate.
#PaulCoghlan	unknown-#PaulCoghlan-party	unknown-#PaulCoghlan-dob	unknown-#PaulCoghlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	33	Senator Finucane raised the important matter of the Convention on the Future of Europe, which the House discussed briefly on a previous occasion. I propose that we invite our three representatives at the convention, Deputy John Bruton, Proinsias De Rossa MEP and the Minister of State, Deputy Roche, to the House—
#RoryKiely	unknown-#RoryKiely-party	unknown-#RoryKiely-dob	unknown-#RoryKiely-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	34	That should be done through the Committee on Procedure and Privileges.

This country will have to start to make up its mind where it stands in regard to a union of nation states or a federal Europe. I make this proposal to which I think the Leader would be well disposed.
#MaryORourke	unknown-#MaryORourke-party	unknown-#MaryORourke-dob	unknown-#MaryORourke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	36	I proposed it last week.

#MaryORourke	unknown-#MaryORourke-party	unknown-#MaryORourke-dob	unknown-#MaryORourke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	43	Senator Brian Hayes and others raised price fixing and competition and the need for a debate on the matter. The Senator also asked that financial institutions inform their customers of the changes brought in by the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, in the budget. My experience is that we will pay for them anyway and that the financial institutions will recoup whatever expense is involved in informing people of them. It is a matter which should be brought to the attention of the Minister for Finance.Although not referring specifically to the Planning and Development (Amendment) Bill, 2002, Senator O'Toole said that in future we should seek to obviate circumstances where all Stages of Bills would be taken together. I will refer to that matter later, but I take the Senator's point. He also referred to the need for the House to debate the Western Development Commission, which was established under legislation approved by both Houses.Senator Ryan raised the Planning and Development (Amendment) Bill, 2002. I do not wish to be antagonistic. I thank the Senator for his telephone call about the matter yesterday and for what he said earlier. We had an informal agreement, but I understand those things change from time to time and there is no great angst about that. We had a four hour debate on Second Stage and I do not know how that could be construed as rushed. At the end of Second Stage, everyone who wished to vote was given the opportunity to do so. Senator Ryan called the vote, as is his right, and we participated in it. It is wrong to say Committee Stage is following Second Stage. The proof of this is that the Senator has tabled nine amendments. How did he manage to do so? The amendments look weighty and good and a great deal of thought was put into them. I do not see the reason for panic in regard to this Bill. There will be a debate on the Senator's nine amendments until 2 p.m. I do not see how that is speedy, rushed or hasty. A vote was called last night and the Senator, fair dues to him, has tabled nine amendments today. There will be three hours to debate the nine amendments and the Senator will exhaust himself discussing them.

He will be broken with stones.I thank Senators Dardis and Norris and others for raising the US hijacking of the Iraq dossier. It seems the US has already made up its mind that it wants war and that is what it will get, which is frightening.Senator O'Meara referred to RTÉ and the increase in the licence fee. Our understanding is that the increase was passed at Cabinet but there are some caveats and matters to be investigated. Everyone wants to discuss what RTÉ will do with the increase when it is introduced.Senator Norris called for the upcoming legislation on human rights to be debated. That would be a good matter for the House to debate.Senator Finucane referred the Convention on the Future of Europe and asked what Deputy John Bruton, the Minister of State, Deputy Roche, and Fianna Fáil are doing about it. I am not seeking to castigate the Senator, but this matter was raised on the Order of Business and I suggested that Deputy John Bruton, the Minister of State, Deputy Roche, and Proinsias De Rossa MEP come before the House with Valéry Giscard d'Estaing for a debate on the matter. That suggestion remains for the Cathaoirleach to consider at our Committee on Procedure and Privileges meeting. Senator Finucane may not have been here, but he is correct in raising the matter.Senator Fitzgerald referred to third level fees and asked about any evidence in that regard. I think he raised the matter because today's newspapers inquire whether the abolition of fees led to more disadvantaged people entering third level. The evidence overwhelmingly suggests that they did not. The Senator pointed to decreasing enrolment at third level, which is a matter of concern. However, more older people are going back to college to take modules of courses and extra degrees, which is good. There is clear evidence that the disadvantaged did not enter third level in greater numbers when fees were abolished. The Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Dempsey, is right to have a public debate, which will involve all the institutions, bodies and agencies, on the matter. Let us see what comes out of it. We should not be afraid of facts and should welcome such a debate.Senator Dardis pointed out that the Committee on European Affairs debated the future of Europe, although he said that this House would be a good venue in which to discuss the matter further.Senator Callanan raised price fixing and called for the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment to come before the House to discuss competition, pricing, cartels and so on. That is a matter which could be followed up, and I intend to do so.Senator Bannon did not oppose Second Stage but he is worried about the Bill now. Last night his party abstained on the vote on Second Stage, which it has every right to do, but it did not oppose it. That was noble of the Senator.

#KathleenOMeara	unknown-#KathleenOMeara-party	unknown-#KathleenOMeara-dob	unknown-#KathleenOMeara-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	74	I move amendment No. 1:
In page 4, to delete lines 40 to 56 and in page 5, to delete lines 1 to 4.Perhaps the Minister will clarify that, because this is amending legislation, there is no commencement section. These amendments deal with matters I raised in the debate on Second Stage. Page 4, lines 40 to 56, provide for the extension of the operation of the framework set out in the Planning and Development Act, 2000, to allow further flexibility to local authorities in operating the provisions of Part V of the Act. They allow for the swapping and matching of developers' land and sites.An important element of Part V of the 2000 Act, referred to by Mr. Justice Keane in the Supreme Court judgment, is to ensure the building of local authority housing and the provision of social and affordable housing take place in the context of providing a good social mix. The purpose of this is to avoid situations where poorer sections are housed in one part of the community while better off private housing is located elsewhere.From anecdotal evidence and my conversations with colleagues around the country it is clear that this is a contentious issue. I had recent experience of this when, as a public representative, I was approached by a resident who explained that a planning application had been lodged in respect of an area close to where he lived and that he was concerned about the housing mix that might ensue from the application of the social and affordable rule. My local authority adopted a 10% rather than a 20% provision in this regard.People get unnecessarily worked up about this issue. The principle of integration is very important and one we, as legislators, must take into account. It was debated in the context of the original legislation. I am concerned that the additional flexibility introduced by this Bill will undermine the power given to local authorities to ensure there is a social mix. I discussed the proposed amendments with a senior official in my local authority and he also took the view that allowing for land swapping and matching could mean that social and affordable housing could be confined to one area, thereby preventing the desired social mix in residential estates. That is the reason we seek the deletion of lines 40 to 56 on page 4.
#JamesBannon	unknown-#JamesBannon-party	unknown-#JamesBannon-dob	unknown-#JamesBannon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	75	I support these provisions. The purpose behind the 2000 Act was to introduce flexibility and allow for off-site provisions such as land swaps and cash payments to local authorities. This Bill addresses that aspect. Bricks and mortar do not unite people. Our concern is with social integration and in view of this it is important that people from all sections of the community become involved in local activities, including the management of their residential areas. This process should start at an early age among all residents. I will not vote in favour of the amendments.

#MartinCullen	unknown-#MartinCullen-party	unknown-#MartinCullen-dob	unknown-#MartinCullen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	78	The commencement date will be the date of signing of the Bill by the President, which I hope will take place before Christmas. These amendments would delete the options of providing land, houses or sites at another location or providing a payment instead. This would effectively remove the flexibility at the heart of the Bill. I, therefore, cannot accept them.The purpose of changing this section of the 2000 Act is to set out certain additional ways in which an applicant for permission for development may comply with the requirements of Part V in relation to the provision of social and affordable housing instead of reserving land in their proposed development for the local authority or providing houses or sites within the development. In addition to these existing options, the applicant for permission will be able to reach an agreement to reserve land or provide houses or sites at another location, or to make a payment to the local authority which will be used for the provision of social and affordable housing, or to agree to a combination of any of these options.As I have explained, the existing arrangements are too rigid and bureaucratic. Planning authorities and developers had difficulty in drawing up agreements and the rigidity was holding up housing supply. The complicated arrangements that have ensued are probably the reason the delivery of social and affordable housing to date is less than was hoped for. In the review I undertook, as promised in An Agreed Programme for Government, there was a consensus among those consulted that the system required more flexibility. Everybody said this, no matter what their perspective.The Bill introduces flexibility to speed up agreements and free resources. Instead of being limited to the existing options, local authorities and developers will have a range of possible agreements from which to choose. Local authorities will, therefore, be able to negotiate the type of agreement that best suits their needs and the needs of local communities. In doing so they will have to bear in mind, as the Senator correctly stated, the critical issue of social integration, the objectives of the housing strategy, etc. Senators are also aware that if no agreement can be reached on the provision of houses, the developer will be obliged to reserve the land within the development. I believe that agreements will be concluded more speedily and that more social and affordable housing will come on stream earlier.It is for these reasons that I cannot accept the amendment. I have placed my argument within the context of the local housing strategies of the local authorities. There is a very serious issue for members and officials of local authorities in terms of ensuring that the social integration provisions laid out in their development plans cannot be avoided. It cannot be a case of a developer finding 200 or 300 acres somewhere else and pretending that it fulfils the 20% provision or meets the social integration requirements. Local authorities will not accept that and neither will I.We must strike a balance between the various needs in order to encourage more integration. I do not wish to single out one authority, but Fingal County Council is delivering the greatest number of social and affordable housing units. The council has worked well and imaginatively with developers. Everybody understands the obligations on developers to deliver. The local managers have used flexibility, even though it was not specifically outlined in the Bill, to obtain volume and delivery. Fingal's approach is based on social integration and it is working.This process involves a trust which is based on legal imprimaturs, on housing strategy, on the law of the land and on what everybody wants to see included. In this section I have tried to reflect – in the best way possible but which the confines of relatively narrow criteria – that this has to be based on social criteria. I have no doubt that local authority members will be holding their managers and housing planners to account in respect of the sort of agreements that are being put in place in order to ensure that they obtain what the housing strategy has set out, namely, an underpinning of social integration in an area.I have been informed by those involved in the provision of social housing that social integration does not necessarily mean that many houses should be built alongside each other. We have been told that this is not a good way to proceed. Social integration means that the schools, shops, churches and community facilities in an area are there for the benefit of everyone, regardless of their social background.I agree with the Senator that we must avoid creating an imbalance, with all the people at the margins who are seeking a home on one side and those who are better off on the other. In fairness to local authorities, the day when people were shoved into huge housing estates and ghettoised has gone. The approach adopted during that period of trying to place people in modern homes and improve standards was not wrong. However, there was a consequential down-side of which we are all now aware. There is no possibility that a similar situation will obtain in the future.I have tried to work with the different people with whom I have had discussions. I think it is the best way forward. Yesterday, I used the example of the situation in the UK where they are achieving a much higher volume of social integration based on the same or perhaps somewhat wider criteria. I have taken the best from that system to deliver what we all want.
#KathleenOMeara	unknown-#KathleenOMeara-party	unknown-#KathleenOMeara-dob	unknown-#KathleenOMeara-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	79	I thank the Minister for his reply. He knows that we all have the same objectives, namely, to see social and affordable housing coming on stream much faster than heretofore and to ensure a good social mix in the process. These are the underlying principles of the Bill. I am concerned that perhaps we have not waited long enough to allow Part V to work. As the Minister said, it has been working in Fingal, an area where clearly—
#MartinCullen	unknown-#MartinCullen-party	unknown-#MartinCullen-dob	unknown-#MartinCullen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	80	But on the basis of what I am doing. That is the interesting part.
#KathleenOMeara	unknown-#KathleenOMeara-party	unknown-#KathleenOMeara-dob	unknown-#KathleenOMeara-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	81	I know that the Minister is using the Fingal experience. Obviously we are up against it in relation to the withering issue and we will deal with that later. In many ways, it is a pity it had to happen that way.If the Part V provision had remained in place for another year, the situation might be quite different. It takes time for new ideas and new legislation to work. The 2000 Act is an entirely new framework. The building industry is one of the major players in this process and, on occasion, it takes time for that industry to get the message that the Minister and Members are serious about this issue. We are serious about ensuring the social and affordable mix and about operating the Part V provision. That point must be put across strongly. One of the reasons I am disappointed with the Bill being put forward now is that it might seem that we are signalling the fact that we are pulling back from the Part V framework and from the serious commitment to ensuring that land is set aside for those who cannot otherwise compete in the market.I did not refer to my amendment on the payment issue when I spoke earlier. I am more concerned about this issue than about the earlier sub-paragraphs (iii), (iv) and (v). Amendment No. 2 refers to sub-paragraph (vi), which has within it the possibility of letting builders off the hook. I ask the Minister to explain how he will ensure that this does not become the option of first instance, rather than the option of last instance. Will the Minister clarify what will happen to those payments? Will they go into a special ring-fenced fund to be used by the local authorities for housing purposes only or will they go into the general local authority fund? We all know that finances are tight this year and that if money becomes available it could be subsumed into the general fund. Will the Minister provide an assurance about his directive to local authorities regarding payments to them from developers?
#MartinCullen	unknown-#MartinCullen-party	unknown-#MartinCullen-dob	unknown-#MartinCullen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	82	This is an important point. I stated yesterday that I will be giving a specific direction that, in terms of payment, it is the absolute final option. I will be monitoring this from my Department and it will also be the responsibility of managers to ensure that this is the case. I reiterate that local authority members will also be monitoring this and it will be unacceptable if this is just regarded as a source of funding.There were instances, particularly in the Dublin area, where the cost to a local authority of obtaining one or two units was huge. This did not make sense. In cases where a substantial payment in lieu was given, instead of obtaining two units, a local authority might get ten, 15 or even more units. That was the real reason behind the change.I have made it clear in my instructions to the local authorities that this will be the final option. Any moneys that the local authorities collect under the terms of this provision can only be used for the specific purpose of the provision of social and affordable housing. It would be disastrous if the money collected under this provision disappeared into the general funds of local authorities and was spent in other areas. That will not be allowed to happen.I return to the Senator's other point about the need to try to strike a balance. One should remember that some players would have said, "Get rid of Part V. That is what we want. Send it out the door. Forget about it. We do not want anything to do with it." Many members of the public might have subscribed to the same view. However, the Government did not go down that road. It was never an option I seriously considered, although there were those who would have wanted to see it happen in that way. I said Part V, the 20%, should remain.Senator O'Meara rightly made the point that in her local authority they did not choose to go to 20%, they chose to go to 10%. I think some local authorities misunderstood it. It was not a minimum of 20%; that was the maximum and they could work it out. If one looks at the figures, some local authorities chose to go for 15% affordable housing and only 5% social housing, while some went 50/50. Some went for a different balance. Some did not go to 20%, but to 8% and 7%. Therefore, there were different mixes and different options used. That was right because local authorities have different needs at different times.I am of the view that in terms of financial packages to local authorities there should almost be an envelope of funding and we should leave the local authority to decide that roads, say, are the priority this year. The priority in another local authority this year might be housing or waste management. It might be a mixture of the two.I am looking forward. It has nothing to do with this Bill, but I fundamentally believe in the primacy of local government and I want to see it strengthened. These are options which come about. It puts a great deal of responsibility on members in holding to account those charged with responsibility on the Executive side to account for what they are doing in implementing their own strategies. This is fixed into the strategy. That is why I said it must be within the housing strategy and within the development plan. Otherwise we will get builders buying 500 acres ten miles away and saying we can attach it some time in the future, which would be disastrous. There is a balance to be struck and I think the balance is right.It is important to emphasis the Part V provision regarding 20% remains. We are removing some of the rigidities. It is a show of trust by me to all of the players that we can deliver. It is a placing of faith in local authorities and their members that they have the capacity to hold to account. I will hold to account at this level, but I hope that my role will be a small one in that I will not have to be on the backs of the local authorities and that they themselves will make sure they are achieving social integration.On the Senator's other point, we could have waited much longer but the consequences would have been another year lost with small delivery. That is a judgment call. The Senator may take a different view. The relevant information that came to me did not indicate that doing nothing would suddenly change the picture.When he set this out, the direction of the former Minister, Deputy Dempsey, was absolutely right and I do not want to undermine that. I want to tease it out to deliver the basis of what he was trying to do in terms of social integration and I have looked at all the experiences to do that. That is what underpins it.

I appreciate where the Minister is coming from. He takes a pragmatic view and he trusts the local authorities and the players out there. To a large extent, at one level I would agree with him that they should get up and get on as best they can with doing the job that we, the legislators, have given them. That would be fabulous in an ideal world but as we all know it does not work as well as that. That is why I have concerns about how this will work in practice. I have concerns that the option of last instance, as we would like it to be, will become the option of first instance in some cases, although obviously not in all, depending on who is negotiating and the circumstances. I am concerned that it will become a habit.Money is not necessarily the problem, at least at present, particularly in the urban areas. Acquiring land for housing is the problem. In some cases to get the value of the 20% is not necessarily the solution. Acquiring land for public housing is very difficult and in some areas it is almost impossible. I would be concerned that putting that option in the legislation would create a certain pressure at the edges to go for that option. Pragmatism can go too far in that regard.The Minister's views are clear, as are his priorities. I am not sure that that will necessarily translate into action on the ground.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	93	It was decided by the House that amendments Nos. 1 and 2 would be discussed together. Senator Bannon may raise his question when we come to the section.
#KathleenOMeara	unknown-#KathleenOMeara-party	unknown-#KathleenOMeara-dob	unknown-#KathleenOMeara-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	94	I move amendment No. 3:
In page 5, line 43, to delete ‘undue'.The amendment is clear. I want to delete the word "undue" from this paragraph, which currently reads "the need to counteract undue segregation in housing between persons of different social background in the area of the authority".The object of the amendment is simple. It is to strengthen the language in the paragraph and, by so doing, to underline our core concern, the strong principle which should be contained in the legislation, that the need to counteract segregation in housing is a primary social objective and a primary objective of the legislation. It is objective which, as I stated already, was referred to by Mr. Justice Keane in the judgment when Part V was referred to the Supreme Court in 2000. This amendment is simply designed to strengthen the paragraph and I hope the Minister will take the same view.
#MartinCullen	unknown-#MartinCullen-party	unknown-#MartinCullen-dob	unknown-#MartinCullen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	95	The Senator's amendment would delete the word "undue" from the phrase "the need to counteract undue segregation in housing between persons of different social background in the area of the authority." The planning authority must give consideration to this need when deciding whether to enter into an agreement other than the reservation of land within the development under subsection (3)(b).I am determined that this new flexibility in making agreements will not lead to a breakdown in social integration. Builders will not be able to put social or affordable housing at the edge of communities with no social links and no infrastructure. However, social integration does not mean making people live side by side. It does mean ensuring that people of all social backgrounds are represented within a local community – going to the same shops and the same schools, benefiting from the same community facilities and the same transport links.I will be setting firm guidelines for local authorities as to the types of alternative arrangements that would be acceptable in terms of social integration. That is very important. In including this phrase in the section, which is clear in its meaning, I was following the existing language of Part V. I did it to maintain consistency. Section 94 of the Act requires local authorities, when preparing their housing strategies, to take into account the need to counteract undue segregation in housing between persons of different social backgrounds. The phrase is clear and I do not think the amendment would improve it. I understand what the Senator is trying to say, but I am trying to be consistent. If I start using different language now, we will end up with different interpretations. I would rather be consistent.

How does the Minister propose to collect the levy and will he guarantee that it will not be passed on to the purchasers of affordable housing? It is of the utmost importance that those who need housing do not end up having to pay the levy. There has been a tendency for levies to be passed on to purchasers. There must be a guarantee that this will not happen. Who will adjudicate when a dispute arises between local authorities and builders? Will an agency be put in place to adjudicate and decide upon evaluations and so on? These are important issues.
#MichaelPKitt	unknown-#MichaelPKitt-party	unknown-#MichaelPKitt-dob	unknown-#MichaelPKitt-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	97	When Senator O'Meara mentioned the issue of social segregation, it reminded me of the court case about which we heard yesterday in which the judge commented that just because people living beside each other might both be living in expensive houses, it does not necessarily mean they will get on. There is always a difficulty in dealing with segregation.Senator O'Meara wanted to remove the word "undue". I know that in County Galway when it comes to the issue of allocating affordable houses, there is always a difficulty in deciding who should get the end house, the middle house and so on. I understand a lottery system is used in most local authorities to decide which houses people can buy under the affordable housing scheme. There will always be a difficulty, but as we know from the court case mentioned, one can also have problems between people living in expensive houses, over driveways or whatever.When the Minister talked about the issue of making payments to the local authority, he pointed out that it was for the provision of social and affordable housing. I welcome this. He also pointed out that one could have a combination of the payment of money for social and affordable housing and the reservation of land at another location. Payment of money is not the only option, an issue about which people might be concerned. I know from my experience that there are many situations where private individuals could help if money was available to obtain land for community purposes, perhaps from the Land Commission. There are still some tracts of land available. Money could be used for that purpose. It would be useful to look at the question of the payment of money or provision of land at another location which I would not completely rule out. As the Minister said, the Bill gives us flexibility to provide housing as quickly as possible. I support the Bill.

Where local authorities have land banks and town and village plans are in place, I urge that the levies collected in particular areas be used to best advantage. Fingal has been mentioned as an ideal location where land has been developed. Where councils have land available, the levy should be used to promote public-private partnerships to provide social and affordable housing and thus meet housing need. Councils should have flexibility to use the land and the levy to best advantage.
#MartinCullen	unknown-#MartinCullen-party	unknown-#MartinCullen-dob	unknown-#MartinCullen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	99	In reply to Senator Bannon, there were three aspects that were overlapping. I shall try to deal with them. There are normal development charges that have always been paid. This remains the same. The money is paid into the capital fund within a local authority to provide for water, sewerage or whatever. It cannot be paid into the general fund, it can only be used on the capital side for the provision of facilities.There are two further payments, of which one is the levy related to the roughly 80,000 planning permissions outstanding. This relates to the withering clause. When the money is paid, local authorities must receive a receipt for each house in order that there is absolute transparency. Those acting on behalf of purchasers will no doubt want to ensure the levy has been paid and that they will not be caught for it again. It is a case of belt and braces. The money will have to be paid into the capital housing fund. As this is legally stated, there will be no other options.The third levy is the payment in lieu on Part V. I hope this will yield a small sum of money in the sense that there will be greater provision of land and houses than a simple payment of money. Whatever sum is received in lieu will also be paid into the capital housing fund as is legally provided for in the Bill. Section 3(12) states, "any amount paid to a planning authority in accordance with subsection (3)(b)(vi), (vii) or (viii) shall be accounted for in a separate account and shall only be applied as capital for its functions under this Part or by a housing authority for its functions in relation to the provision of housing under the Housing Acts, 1966 to 2002.” That is very specific and how the money is to be accounted for.I have no doubt that councillors will be asking the manager at monthly meetings about the latest agreements put in place, the basis for them, whether there have been land swaps, how much money has been collected, whether it has been paid into the account and so on. That is a transparent and accountable way of proceeding. There will be no option for managers or councillors to turn around and take any of this money and do something else with it. The Bill is very specific. These are the three levels – planning charges, levies or payments in lieu.
#KathleenOMeara	unknown-#KathleenOMeara-party	unknown-#KathleenOMeara-dob	unknown-#KathleenOMeara-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	100	I move amendment No. 4:
In page 11, before section 4, to insert the following new section:4.–Where the duration of a permission is extended by section 4 of this Act, the permission as so extended shall be subjected to a condition that it comply with the social housing provisions of Part V of the principal Act as if it were a permission applied for after the commencement of those provisions.This amendment goes to the heart of the Bill. Probably the most critical element is the decision of the Minister to extend planning permissions. About how many are we talking – 80,000?
#MartinCullen	unknown-#MartinCullen-party	unknown-#MartinCullen-dob	unknown-#MartinCullen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	101	About 44,000 at 31 December.
#KathleenOMeara	unknown-#KathleenOMeara-party	unknown-#KathleenOMeara-dob	unknown-#KathleenOMeara-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	102	In effect, the decision is to extend 44,000 planning permissions and levy 0.5% on their value. In so doing, as I said yesterday on Second Stage, it will eventually let them off the hook in relation to the social and affordable housing rule. In looking at the background to this I came across a speech given by Mr. Philip Jones, president of the Irish Planning Institute, to the national planning conference in 2001, the theme of which was the implementation of the 2000 Act and the national development plan. Naturally, Part V of the 2000 Act formed a core part of his address. I will refer to some of what he said because he was so on the ball. It is worth referring to because it echoes my thinking. I hope it will show that this thinking is not just a partisan Labour Party perspective and that the concerns I raise are echoed across the board.Let us consider the reason the withering rule was inserted in the 2000 Act. It was an anti-avoidance measure to ensure compliance with the Part V obligations. Mr. Jones referred to the fact:The Government wisely included a measure by which planning permissions granted between August 1999 and the coming into force of the housing strategies would have a life of two years. This was a necessary anti-avoidance measure, to ensure that builders and developers would not seek to frustrate the operation of the new provisions.He continued:It is just typical of the house-building sector, flushed with their success in persuading the Minister for Finance to dump the proposed 60% capital gains tax regime for the sale of development land, that they now seek to have the time limit removed. This will have the effect of further delaying the implementation of Part V.He went on to refer to the sustained lobbying campaign by the building industry in relation to Part V. He said:I have little doubt that, despite not winning the constitutional argument last year, many of the builders still have a rooted objection to the social and affordable housing provision, and will seek to stymie its application in practice in the case of individual planning applications.Isn't it time that our developers and builders saw themselves as part of the general community, and worked for the interests of everyone, not just their own profits? Isn't it time that they considered themselves part of society, not apart from it? . In order to avoid these problems, while still not letting the builders off the hook for their social responsibilities, I suggest that such planning permissions should be given an extension of their duration, beyond the two year limit, provided that the appropriate percentage of the houses or sites are transferred to the local authority as social and affordable housing, in accordance with the authority's housing strategy, before the end of the two years. The mechanism for such provision is in-built into the Planning and Development Act, where it allows the Minister to make amending regulations where he considers it necessary to ensure the full and proper working of the Act.I accept that neither Mr. Jones nor I is a constitutional lawyer.
#MartinCullen	unknown-#MartinCullen-party	unknown-#MartinCullen-dob	unknown-#MartinCullen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	103	Nor am I.
#KathleenOMeara	unknown-#KathleenOMeara-party	unknown-#KathleenOMeara-dob	unknown-#KathleenOMeara-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	104	The Minister has the advice of the Attorney General available to him. I have good advice, too, advice that has been available to our party for a number of years and which has been useful to Ministers and Departments from time to time when discussing legislation. Mr. Jones is making my point. Builders are being let off the hook by the extension of the two year rule. The principle inherent in the legislation, when passed by both Houses in 2000, is being fundamentally undermined and diluted. It is time the building industry was told to join the rest of us and that it is part of the community. It seeks to make a profit, obviously, but it must come on board with the rest of us, particularly where the provision of housing for those who are not capable of providing it themselves is concerned.The amendment we have brought forward agrees that the Minister should extend the permissions. We accept the point made on Second Stage that to terminate them now would cause a serious supply problem. However, in extending them the Minister should bring them within the remit of Part V. In so doing he would sustain the fundamental principle of the Bill and send a clear signal to the industry that it will not get off the hook and that its lobbying, at least in this case, has not worked.
#MartinCullen	unknown-#MartinCullen-party	unknown-#MartinCullen-dob	unknown-#MartinCullen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	105	The Senator's contribution is interesting. She is now saying I was right to try to keep the supply alive. As we have a different approach and the same objective, how do we do it? What the Senator said was my starting point. It is how I thought we should do it, being simple and straightforward. There did not seem to be a problem. There was a problem when I examined it. It would have been the most simple thing to do and was my preferred option, but a number of issues would have arisen, of which one was the fact that it would have meant applying legislation retrospectively. There is no question about this and the advice available to me was that it was questionable whether one could do it under the law.The second issue was that if I did take that course and it did stand legally, I would have been waiting another year or two for decisions because I have no doubt that it would have been challenged. Certain elements would have sought clarity as to whether I had the right to do it. I would have ended up, therefore, involved in a long case during which there would have been no supply. The chances of winning the case were slim.The third reason was that if we had gone successfully through all this, it would have meant that all the planning permissions, although not being null and void, would have had to be referred back to the local authorities to be renegotiated. That would have meant another long period following the legal test. This is assuming that our action would have stood legally and my advice was that it probably would not. Ultimately, I would have been defeating my original purpose, which was to maintain supply.If the Senator is reasonable, she will understand my response. That is the advice I received. Common sense dictated that I would have been on extremely doubtful ground if I had tried to apply it retrospectively. If I had, it would undoubtedly have been challenged. I do not know how long that process would have taken, but even if I had been successful, these permissions would still have had to go through the entire planning process again. Every individual agreement would have had to be referred back to the local authority to secure agreement on how the 20% requirement was to be achieved. I would have lost the supply in the immediate future, certainly for the next year or two.I agree with much that the Senator said. However, I made it clear – the Government was equally of this view – that if I was going to remove the withering provision and restore the planning permissions, I was not prepared to get nothing for it. The optimal view which the Senator has eloquently put across was my starting position. I then had to work out what was achievable and what I could get under the law. After a huge amount of discussion of all sorts of options, the best one was the one which would deliver or maintain immediate supply in the market. I wanted to get something for it. That is the reason I introduced the levy. It is fair and will bring a substantial amount of money into the local authorities. In 2003 and 2004 it will provide at least €80 million and possibly more, although we must wait to see what will happen in that regard.I am not fundamentally differing from the Senator. It was a judgment call. The purpose of my action was to maintain supply, but I was not prepared to maintain the planning permissions and get nothing back for the State. I wanted a community gain and the fastest, cleanest and most efficient way of doing that was through the provisions in the Bill. I spent six months considering this issue, including weekends at home trying to figure out how to get this into the market. By and large, because it is a ring-fenced and specific issue, the fastest and best way to get the community gain is through the action I have taken. The other course of action was fraught with legal difficulties which would have brought us far into the future, in which case I might as well have abandoned the provision and left things as they were. They were the options.

Perhaps the Minister will comment on a medium-term problem. The housing projects for which he is extending planning permission predate the 2000 Act. They are not, therefore, subject to the Part V provisions or the proposed levy. There is perhaps a danger that the building industry will concentrate on progressing those projects, which is well and good, and that new projects, which will be subject to somewhat more onerous conditions, will be neglected. The Minister might bear this in mind.
#MartinCullen	unknown-#MartinCullen-party	unknown-#MartinCullen-dob	unknown-#MartinCullen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	107	I am aware of the point the Senator is making and we may be slightly at cross purposes. The levy I referred to in this instance applies specifically to those permissions which would have withered. I introduced it in order to obtain a community gain. I considered all the options and wanted to get something back, but I did not want to lose the supply. This is separate from Part V and the Senator is absolutely correct to state that there was no imperative on these sites at all regarding the legislation. I had the option of either letting them wither or of maintaining supply. However, I then felt I would go the extra mile and try to get something back. These levies of 0.5% and 1% apply to approximately 80,000 planning permissions so there is an immediate ring-fenced gain of about €80 million which will go directly to the local authorities' housing capital funds. I have obtained a major gain.

#MartinCullen	unknown-#MartinCullen-party	unknown-#MartinCullen-dob	unknown-#MartinCullen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	109	I have brought more flexibility into the general operation of Part V. The position at present is that the 20%, or whatever is the agreed portion, must be on the specific land in development. This was giving rise to all sorts of problems. I have expanded the provision to include land swaps with local authorities and different sites. There is a final option which would cater for some areas in Dublin where there are high property costs and in which local authorities would find it very expensive to provide housing. Authorities might obtain only two units out of such an agreement, whereas a cash payment might yield more. That is based on the 20% and it has nothing to do with the 0.5% and 1% levies. It is my wish and that of the Government that, in the interests of social integration, Part V must work. We want properties to be built. We are not really interested in obtaining money, although there are special circumstances where that may be the best option for the local authority. However, it is the final option.
#KathleenOMeara	unknown-#KathleenOMeara-party	unknown-#KathleenOMeara-dob	unknown-#KathleenOMeara-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	110	I thank the Minister for his reply and am delighted to hear we started from the same square on the board regarding this matter. Obviously I do not agree with where he has moved to from there, even if he has had to listen to legal advice and so on.When the original legislation was debated in both Houses, the number of speakers who referred to the fact that it was bound to end up in the Supreme Court was quite extraordinary. We all knew we were looking at a fairly radical departure, namely, that the State would intervene and, in return for compensation, basically acquire land, sites and houses for the purpose of providing social and affordable housing for the common good. It was good that this was tested in the Supreme Court and it was even better that the court issued the judgment it did. That is the framework within which we are operating.If there had been no Supreme Court judgment, I would not be asking the Minister to look at the spirit of it. Mr. Justice Keane said on page 23 of the judgment that the schemes "are rationally connected to an objective of sufficient importance to warrant interference within a constitutionally protected right and given the serious social problems which they are designed to meet, they undoubtedly relate to concerns which, in a free and democratic society, should be regarded as pressing and substantial." In other words, the Oireachtas has the right to interfere with property rights in this case in order to advance the common good and to protect a basic right, namely, the right to housing where people do not themselves have the means to provide it.That is the framework within which we are operating. It gives the Oireachtas the authority, indeed the right, to act on these particular planning permissions and to bring them in under the Part V framework. I agree that the measures will probably be tested but my instinct is to let them be tested, particularly in the context of the existing judgment. The common good is better served by bringing these permissions under Part V.This is worth the risk for a number of reasons. Housing supply can continue and the provision of 20% of housing to a local authority means there would be a huge gain. In addition, it would underline a fundamental principle and send out a strong signal that we consider the common good of the fundamental right to housing and the provision of housing to be paramount. That is a very important signal to send. It might also convince those builders who do not consider themselves part of the rest of the world to join us. Given the urgent social need for housing with which we have been faced in recent years, those builders could get on with providing it.Though the Minister, having spent six months deliberating on the matter, will hardly change his mind, this approach would be worth pursuing. I quoted Mr. Jones from the Irish Planning Institute. Perhaps the Minister will give us the advice he received on the regulations in the original Act which, according to Mr. Jones, would allow the Minister to make amending regulations where he considers it necessary to ensure the full and proper working of the Act. Has the Minister explored the possibility of using those regulations to extend the permissions and bring them under Part V at the same time?
#JamesBannon	unknown-#JamesBannon-party	unknown-#JamesBannon-dob	unknown-#JamesBannon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	111	I understand the two year rule was introduced to prevent a flood of applications prior to the 20% social housing provision coming into force. I support the inclusion of the new section, but what we all need is increased housing output to meet the huge demand. There are 120,000 people on our waiting lists and we require upwards of 50,000 housing units to meet the demand. It is important that every effort is made to meet that demand, but we face a major challenge. Several bodies, including the Department, estimate that it may take in the region of 30 years to clear the waiting lists at the current rate. We must work on this and I support the inclusion of the new section. There is nothing wrong with it and it is a good proposal.
#MartinCullen	unknown-#MartinCullen-party	unknown-#MartinCullen-dob	unknown-#MartinCullen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	112	I listened carefully to Senator O'Meara's contribution and it struck me that we have reached the same point. The best way to achieve what the Senator suggests, and for me to get what I ultimately want – if it were open to me to do so – would have been to allow all the permissions to wither.
#KathleenOMeara	unknown-#KathleenOMeara-party	unknown-#KathleenOMeara-dob	unknown-#KathleenOMeara-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	113	No.
#MartinCullen	unknown-#MartinCullen-party	unknown-#MartinCullen-dob	unknown-#MartinCullen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	114	The Senator should bear with me. If these withered on 31 December and the applicants still wanted planning permission, they would have to renegotiate those permissions with the 20% provision. That would have been the fastest way to do it rather than obtaining the legal imprimatur, having it tested through the courts, etc., and then arriving at the point where the applicants would have to re-apply for planning permission.The fastest way to achieve what the Senator wants would have been to allow them to wither. The problem I had with that was clearly the supply; that was the fundamental issue. I also wanted to see if there was any way I could obtain a community gain out of this without interrupting supply. They were the issues with which I had to deal. I agree with the Senator's point about trying to have the full imprimatur of Part V applied to the permissions. The fastest way to do that would have been to allow them to wither and then move on.I believe the Senator will agree with me, particularly as neither of us has any great depth of legal knowledge, that if I did what she is suggesting, it is reasonable to assume that legal challenges would have arisen. If we had taken that route, all the planning permissions would have been frozen because nobody could do anything in respect of them until a judgment was handed down. If such a judgment was favourable in terms of the point made by the Senator, we would then have had to return the relevant permissions to the planning system.
#KathleenOMeara	unknown-#KathleenOMeara-party	unknown-#KathleenOMeara-dob	unknown-#KathleenOMeara-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	115	Having done so from square one.
#MartinCullen	unknown-#MartinCullen-party	unknown-#MartinCullen-dob	unknown-#MartinCullen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	116	Those involved would have had to do so because they would have had to have the 20% provision. They would have been obliged, one way or the other, to renegotiate with the local authorities. We are back to square one. Allowing them to wither would have achieved the same end as that to which the Senator referred.Another approach was to opt for supply and see if I could obtain a community gain from such an approach. I decided to pursue this approach. Relative to what has been happening in recent years, the inflation in house prices has dropped dramatically – although not to the level at which I would like it to be. I have made the point publicly that if one was to consider matters going forward, net income will not change that dramatically in the coming years. We have given back so much that we are at the bare bones of what the tax system should be delivering. In terms of the world economy and our competitiveness, we will not see substantial wage increases. People's incomes will remain quite static in the coming years. In terms of the ability of purchasers to pay, they will not be able to gallop in pursuit of spiralling prices. If that was the case, nobody will be able to buy anything. I have made the point directly in public commentary and when speaking to representatives of the building industry, that we must pause.Now is the time to maintain supply. In the region of 54,000 to 55,000 houses will be built this year, which will be a record. We have arrived at this point after many years of cranking up everything to increase supply to match demand. We need that consistent level of supply for the next ten years. Experts claim that the provision of 50,000 to 55,000 houses will be required per annum during that period in order to meet demand. The way to maintain price balance in the market is to increase supply. That is why I took this option. I do not have a fundamental disagreement with what the Senator suggested. If she were to think this through, as I did, she would realise that the best way to do what she wants me to do would be to allow these permissions to wither. We can forget about the spend that could have been involved in the next two or three years in terms of challenges in the courts and further planning negotiations. I opted for supply and a bonus and I think I achieved the right balance.

We will return to the normal position.

VAT was increased by 1% in the budget. As the Irish Home Builders' Association stated, this will put an extra burden on builders in that it will cost an additional €1,800 to build a normal house. Houses are zero VAT rated in the UK. Perhaps the Minister would consider introducing a similar regime here—

If he could introduce a policy that would reduce the cost of building a house, that would result in an increase in the housing stock.

#MartinCullen	unknown-#MartinCullen-party	unknown-#MartinCullen-dob	unknown-#MartinCullen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	124	Senator O'Meara asked a good question. I was trying to create a balance between what I thought I could obtain fairly from the market and what I could deliver into the housing funds. I chose the house value figure of €270,000 because I did not want to disadvantage people in the Dublin area, where house prices are higher than the rest of the country. I took the average price of a house in Dublin, which is approximately €266,000 and rounded it up to €270,000. I thought a 0.5% levy on houses valued less than €270,000 was reasonable in that I surmised I could get that from the market.If I were to take the total amount of what I might have obtained in respect of houses all over the country, it would be more substantial than that. In respect of houses with a value equal to or greater than €270,000, the levy will rise to 1% which is a reasonable figure. The yield on 80,000 units at €1,000 per unit is €80 million. I believe I am being conservative in terms of the amount we can bring in for local authority housing throughout the country and I hope the final figure will be much more substantial.The Senator knows that if I were to say something and not secure it, I would have to come back here to explain why I did not secure it. This provision demonstrates the capacity to spread the yield and indicates the amount of money which might accrue to the local authorities. The decision I made was subjective and was based on achieving a balance in terms of what I thought I could obtain and what was deemed to be fair. It is a measure which will not restrict housing supply and which will be of benefit to local authorities.

#MartinCullen	unknown-#MartinCullen-party	unknown-#MartinCullen-dob	unknown-#MartinCullen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	126	Every unit built under this scheme – in other words, all 80,000 units – is subject to the levy. A receipt will issue from a local authority for each house built within its area to ensure there is transparency and accountability in respect of the money collected on each unit. This is also important from the purchaser's point of view. I have no doubt that a purchaser's solicitor will check that the levy has been paid in order to ensure that the purchaser will not have to pay it at a later date. The levy is ring-fenced into the housing fund in the local authority area.
#KathleenOMeara	unknown-#KathleenOMeara-party	unknown-#KathleenOMeara-dob	unknown-#KathleenOMeara-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	127	Is the levy payable on commencement of the building or on the point of sale? A community gain levy of €1,000 applies to each planning permission for housing given after 20001 in the North Tipperary County Council area. This is a social, cultural and community fund, which is a good, but the collection of the money is not as simple as it might appear. Unless a person is employed to travel around the county checking the commencement of the building of houses, we will end up with less money than we should have. The fund is currently running at less than 50% of its potential maximum level. I asked this question because, in practice, we find that the collecting of the levy requires the employment of an officer. Is the levy collectable on commencement of building?
#MartinCullen	unknown-#MartinCullen-party	unknown-#MartinCullen-dob	unknown-#MartinCullen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	128	It is collectable on the sale of a house. The Senator is correct in that the fund will require to be managed by local authorities, particularly those which have a large number of such planning permissions. I am optimistic in that I believe everyone knows the position, that builders will want to continue to build to increase housing stock and that the levy will be paid. Local authorities will be required to ensure that the levy is collected. It will be clear to the developer and everyone else. Each receipt must be issued. From the purchaser's point of view, any solicitor worth his or her salt when examining documentation pertaining to a property will want to see the receipt to ensure the purchaser is not saddled with the levy at a later stage. There is a belt and braces approach both ways on it.

This receipt is evidence for house purchasers and their solicitors that the levy has been paid and that the condition of the planning permission has been complied with. Solicitors should not allow their clients to complete the purchase of the house without the receipt being produced. It is a protection for purchasers. Amendments Nos. 6 and 7 are consequential on the insertion of this new subsection to change the numbering in later subsections. I hope there will be agreement on this.

Not alone have I set out in legislation the levy but this subsection has also been inserted. This goes beyond what we have done before and gives a double guarantee. As I stated, solicitors must be mindful of this and ensure they have a receipt from the local authority to make sure the levy has been paid.

#MartinCullen	unknown-#MartinCullen-party	unknown-#MartinCullen-dob	unknown-#MartinCullen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	135	Amendment No. 9 inserts a new section in the Bill to amend section 97 of the 2000 Act. Section 97 of the Planning and Development Act, 2000, provides that an exemption certificate may be sought in relation to small housing developments – developments either consisting of four houses or less, or for housing on land of 0.2 hectares, that is, half an acre, or less. This exemption was included so as to exclude very small developments, including single houses from the Part V requirement.The issue of the 0.2 hectare exemption has been raised by a number of urban local authorities in particular. Their view is that it allows developments much larger than four units to be built without any social and affordable housing element. My Department's residential density guidelines, which are having such a welcome impact on the supply of housing, encourage higher densities in certain urban areas resulting in schemes with considerably more than four houses or apartments on sites of up to 0.2 hectares.In relation to town and city centres where small in-fill sites of this size are found, the guidelines recommend that there should, in principle, be no upper limit on the number of dwellings that may be provided. A site of 0.2 hectares in a town or city centre could, therefore, accommodate at least ten to 15 units. It is reasonable to retain a lower limit in the interests of fairness. For practical reasons it is hard to envisage reserving land on very small sites. However, given the impact of the density guidelines, it is reasonable to reduce the limit to 0.1 hectares.Amendment No. 8 makes a complementary change to section 96(b). This section provides that the levy shall not apply to small housing developments of four houses or less or to land of 0.2 hectares or less. The amendment also reduces the limit to 0.1 hectare. In fairness, I acknowledge that Deputy Gilmore raised this issue.
#KathleenOMeara	unknown-#KathleenOMeara-party	unknown-#KathleenOMeara-dob	unknown-#KathleenOMeara-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	136	I am aware that this matter was raised by Deputy Gilmore. As the change will probably only affect urban areas and in-fill sites, I support the amendment.
#KathleenOMeara	unknown-#KathleenOMeara-party	unknown-#KathleenOMeara-dob	unknown-#KathleenOMeara-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	137	I oppose the section.
#KathleenOMeara	unknown-#KathleenOMeara-party	unknown-#KathleenOMeara-dob	unknown-#KathleenOMeara-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	138	While section 14 appears innocuous at first glance – it is certainly incomprehensible – the explanatory memorandum is more revealing. It states the section "amends section 262(4) which provides that certain regulations made under the Act are subject to a requirement to get positive approval." I have no reason to disagree with this. However, the memorandum continues: "This amendment would remove the requirement to get positive approval for procedural regulations in relation to development by State authorities, while retaining the requirement that regulations determining the types of development which are approved under that special procedure will be subject to the positive approval requirement." I am concerned by this provision and call on the Minister to explain the reason it is considered necessary.
#MartinCullen	unknown-#MartinCullen-party	unknown-#MartinCullen-dob	unknown-#MartinCullen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	139	Section 14 proposes to amend section 262(4) of the 2000 Act which provides that certain regulations made under the Act are subject to a requirement to get positive approval of both Houses of the Oireachtas. Regulations determining the types of development which are approved under the special procedure which applies for certain State developments, mostly security related, will continue to be subject to the positive approval requirement. However, the amendment would remove the requirement to get positive approval for the procedural regulations in relation to these developments, that is, the regulations setting out the detail of how these developments are notified, the documents that must be included and so forth.During its passage through the Oireachtas the 2000 Act was amended to ensure important regulations made under the Act such as those exempting development or setting fees would be subject to the positive approval of both Houses. A number of planning regulations have already been the subject of this procedure, including the consolidated 2001 regulations.The types of regulations subject to this procedure are substantive, not procedural. However, due to an oversight, positive approval is required for both types of developments by State authorities which, for security reasons, are subject to a different procedure. As matters stand, therefore, even minor changes to the procedures, for example, changing the scale of the maps which must be provided, are subject to the requirement to seek positive approval. This was not the intention and is an unduly onerous requirement given that no substantive change has been made in the types of developments included. I propose, therefore, to provide that only substantive changes to the types of development involved will be subject to positive approval.
#KathleenOMeara	unknown-#KathleenOMeara-party	unknown-#KathleenOMeara-dob	unknown-#KathleenOMeara-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	140	I thank the Minister for his complex reply.

As I am not sure I fully understand the complex reply given by the Minister, I wish to tease out the amendment and get a second opinion before agreeing to it. This case provides a good illustration of the need for a gap between Committee Stage and Report Stage.
#MartinCullen	unknown-#MartinCullen-party	unknown-#MartinCullen-dob	unknown-#MartinCullen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	143	While I understand the Senator's concerns, I can confirm that all the substantive procedures will continue to be subject to the regulations. This is a technical amendment which sets out to differentiate between procedural and substantive changes. I gave the example of the current requirement to get the approval of the Houses for a proposal to change the scale of a map. All the changes as laid out in the regulations, of which I can make a copy available to the Senator, will remain under the positive approval regulation.
#KathleenOMeara	unknown-#KathleenOMeara-party	unknown-#KathleenOMeara-dob	unknown-#KathleenOMeara-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	144	This section contains very welcome provisions which give more flexibility to voluntary housing bodies. I commend the Minister for introducing them.
#MartinCullen	unknown-#MartinCullen-party	unknown-#MartinCullen-dob	unknown-#MartinCullen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	145	I welcome the Senator's comments and I am certain other Senators will wish to contribute on this important aspect of the Bill which has been overlooked in favour of its other provisions. The impact of this section on the marketplace is potentially greater than the other changes in the Bill. I am sure Senators will have examined the recent statistics on housing and noted developments in the voluntary sector, which is growing significantly. The potential for the emergence of a strong sense of community, belonging and pride is significantly greater in areas where there is a strong element of home ownership. People in such neighbourhoods will look after their property. All these positive features play a major role in terms of social integration. Nevertheless, the Government and the financial institutions can do much more. In some countries, for example, mortgages of 50 and 60 years are available to people who could never afford to take out a 20 year mortgage. This allows people to take a longer term view and creates a strong ownership element with all the important benefits this entails.Many of the current voluntary schemes, which are letting schemes under the current law, are extremely successful. They are well managed and the residents share a strong sense of place. Local housing committees also play a significant role and positive work is being done. The voluntary sector has proposed that it be allowed to expand its brief in this area in future. It now wants to get involved in affordable housing and shared ownership schemes. The concept behind such a move is that the sector would retain a significant part of the ownership of a scheme, thus ensuring housing units would not be immediately floated on the market at a high price and the people most in need would not lose out.I have welcomed the approach of the voluntary housing groups. If we do the right things moving forward, and given the possibility this holds, maybe we could expand it further in other areas directly with local authorities to see if we could get a better mix of housing ownership. The figures indicate that sector is growing quite substantially.This is a fundamental part of the Bill which perhaps, given the other more polarising issues, has been somewhat overlooked. I see this as a huge and equally significant part of the Bill, as the Senator does, if I am judging it correctly.
#JamesBannon	unknown-#JamesBannon-party	unknown-#JamesBannon-dob	unknown-#JamesBannon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	146	I agree with Senator O'Meara and the Minister. The voluntary housing organisations have been extremely active in meeting special category needs and in looking after the housing needs of the disabled and elderly in our society. It is important we harness the voluntary housing organisations' efforts to meet the more general housing needs of those on local authority housing waiting lists. Perhaps the Minister will try to facilitate them in this area. It would be beneficial to extend the role of the voluntary housing organisations and to harness their efforts.
#MichaelPKitt	unknown-#MichaelPKitt-party	unknown-#MichaelPKitt-dob	unknown-#MichaelPKitt-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	147	I join the Minister and other Senators in welcoming the work of the voluntary housing sector. I spoke about this matter yesterday on Second Stage and mentioned RESPOND and Clúid in County Galway and other agencies which have done excellent work in conjunction with the local authorities. I hope local authorities will look at the issue of returning emigrants. I am sure the Minister is aware the voluntary bodies play a significant role in this area. There is a voluntary housing scheme in Dunmore, County Galway, known as homes for elderly.No matter what way voluntary housing schemes and bodies go in the future – as the Minister said, there will be more people in affordable housing or shared ownership schemes – there will always be a need for a number of houses to be allocated to elderly people and I would not like to see such houses being sold off. Most local authorities hold a number of houses for that sector which are relet.As we said yesterday, it is part of the Irish psyche to desire to own a house and that is why affordable housing has been successful. However, there should be houses for particular sectors, such as elderly or returning emigrants. It is evident from the CSO figures that many retired emigrants are returning, are looking for housing and would like to live in their home place. I join in the well deserved compliments to the voluntary housing agencies.
#KathleenOMeara	unknown-#KathleenOMeara-party	unknown-#KathleenOMeara-dob	unknown-#KathleenOMeara-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	148	I agree with Senator Kitt regarding the excellent work being done by the voluntary housing sector. It has introduced a broader range of availability and has ensured that sectors which may not be taken care of by local authorities because of their own demands may be taken care of by the voluntary groups. There is no doubt that the fact such housing schemes are all purely rental has been a growing issue.The only caveat I would enter is that the ownership and tenant purchase schemes have created a problem in some areas, as the Minister probably knows. This problem has been studied and the type of person buying a house and moving out of an area is often the type one would want to stay in a community and build it up. We are ending up with small but difficult clusters of poverty, unemployment and related issues, including low level mental illness where people are unable to cope with everyday life. These people are not in a position to provide leadership within communities and to become involved in associations for estate management, which one would like to see and which are essential for the good management of estates. The voluntary housing groups provide an important level of support and backup in the management of their own units and estates and that is probably a critical element of their success.It is a problem which needs to be looked at and monitored because we must learn from the mistakes or lessons of the past. Maybe it is going too far to say there have been mistakes because there is undoubtedly a demand for people to be able to buy houses. As Senator Kitt said, part of the Irish psyche is the huge need for people to be able to own their homes and to pass them on to the next generation. We cannot gloss over that.As members of local authorities will know, one finds clusters of deprivation, difficulty and social problems in some local authority estates which are linked to the fact that in recent years some of those who would have provided leadership have bought houses elsewhere and have left. That is something at which we must look from a social policy point of view.It is a pity this area has been clouded by other elements in the Bill but it again goes to show that it is important not to rush legislation.
#CyprianBrady	unknown-#CyprianBrady-party	unknown-#CyprianBrady-dob	unknown-#CyprianBrady-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	149	I echo the sentiments expressed in regard to the voluntary housing sector. My experience of it is with Include, as is Senator Kitt's. It is probably one of the best organisations I have seen at work and it has co-operated extremely well with the local authority. I suggest that encouragement should be given to indigenous voluntary housing organisations. A number of such organisations are coming in from abroad and I urge that we give them as much support as possible.
#MichaelBrennan2	unknown-#MichaelBrennan2-party	unknown-#MichaelBrennan2-dob	unknown-#MichaelBrennan2-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	150	I wish to be associated with the congratulations to the voluntary housing sector. I have been involved in two housing organisation. Voluntary housing organisations deeply appreciate the State subsidies paid through local authorities which come back to voluntary housing organisation after 20 years. It is great to see the number of houses being provided by the voluntary sector which has met its targets under the national plans.Assistance to the voluntary housing sector can best be given where services have been provided. We should consider how we can help voluntary organisations to continue their work. Where elderly residents seek nursing home care, we should see if it could be provided in the same complex. Voluntary housing organisations providing family homes should receive every assistance to move into the affordable housing area. That would be welcome.
#PatMoylan	unknown-#PatMoylan-party	unknown-#PatMoylan-dob	unknown-#PatMoylan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	151	I compliment the Minister on this section and the voluntary housing organisations. The involvement of voluntary housing organisations in towns in most counties has been brilliant. Involving them further in the affordable housing and shared ownership area is the right way to go.Senator O'Meara raised the question of the sale of local authority housing and the tenant purchase scheme which I thought was good. In many cases, people bought those houses, sold them on and maybe built a bungalow or whatever on an independent site. By doing that, they afforded young couples the opportunity to get on the first step of the ladder by buying those houses in housing estates, often at a reasonable cost.Senators spoke about the OPD-type of house for the elderly and the excellent job done involving the local authorities and the voluntary housing bodies. Such housing is often let on a short-term basis to elderly people but the Minister and his officials must make sure the houses are not sold. Sometimes they are sold on and generate large profits while local authorities lose out significantly.These houses were built originally to serve the needs of elderly people. This issue should be examined so that it can be ensured the houses are not sold to family members of elderly people, for example, who buy them out so that they can make a quick buck. Ultimately, the local authority is the biggest loser. Elderly people keep the houses well and, while I dislike the notion that they should not be able to buy their own houses, certain individuals have walked away with money that should have gone to local authorities.
#JamesBannon	unknown-#JamesBannon-party	unknown-#JamesBannon-dob	unknown-#JamesBannon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	152	Senator Moylan's point is that local authority housing should not be sold, but control on the sale of such housing would be a better option. The sale or lease of houses should be subject to the terms and conditions of the local authority involved and these should be clarified so that houses are not sold to speculators. I believe in control of sales but, where necessary, houses should be sold and guidelines should be in place for such sales.A greater percentage of the receipts from the sale of houses that are resold within 20 years of purchase should be allocated to the coffers of local authorities. It is important that legislation should be introduced to that effect.
#MartinCullen	unknown-#MartinCullen-party	unknown-#MartinCullen-dob	unknown-#MartinCullen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	153	I thank the Senators for their contributions as they raised interesting issues, of which all of us are aware. I have served on a local authority and I acknowledge the point raised by Senator O'Meara and others about losing the people with the greatest ability within a community to harness the energies of those around them in leading committees and encouraging social development. Not all of us have the necessary social and interpersonal skills. The danger in encouraging people to do the right thing is that this creates a residual effect for those left behind and that is something of which we must be mindful.All the rules and regulations are in place for local authorities to administer the various housing schemes and make decisions. However, the interesting aspect of the legislation is that, even though the voluntary sector can participate in the social and affordable housing and shared ownership schemes, it will retain part ownership of the housing. Having built up significant local authority housing stock over the past number of years, which will be increased over the rest of this decade, it is important that we do not sell it off. That would be wrong and, while some people argue that selling will generate income for local authorities, the problem will start all over again. I favour giving people a sense of ownership and a sense of place in a house that can be maintained at a reasonable cost for future generations.As Senator Brady said, it is important that voluntary groups continue to develop and strengthen. He can be assured that my Department and I will give whatever assistance we can to local voluntary housing groups. Groups who have experience of such schemes in the UK have entered the domestic market. They have done a good job and given impetus to the market by demonstrating what can be achieved. It is equally important, however, that the indigenous voluntary sector should strengthen and have the capacity to deliver in communities throughout the State. My Department and I will work to ensure that happens.Senator Kitt referred to returning emigrants, an important issue. The provisions of the capital assistance scheme were amended last year so that one quarter of the units of accommodation built under the scheme may be allocated to elderly returning emigrants, which is a step forward. The Senator was very much involved in driving this issue, as a Member of the Lower House.We are ad idem with regard to maintaining housing stock and a sense of ownership while ensuring able people remain in their communities. I have attended numerous public meetings at which forms were handed out and I was stunned on one or two occasions because successful, upstanding people were found to be illiterate and this caused great embarrassment. However, this makes me mindful that other social issues must be addressed so that communities can develop and individuals can be assisted with their own development. If the core is removed from a community, it is left with people who might not have the confidence or the skills to participate fully in the life of the communities and who are fearful of becoming involved for various reasons.The section is a significant and important element of the legislation and I am glad all Senators agree with this approach. I sincerely hope it delivers greater capacity and more innovation and flexibility among voluntary groups.

As a principle, having dealt with much legislation over the years, it is not my preferred option to rush it. I have a healthy dislike of doing so. Unfortunately, there was a time limit on this Bill which was beyond my control. We had to deal with it in the way we did.Notwithstanding one or two reservations, we have had a very good discussion and we will obviously return to the issue of planning and other matters over the next year. We will begin to see the effects of the legislation. I thank my officials for all their work.
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	163	There is no denying the extent of under age drinking in Ireland. However, the problem of drinking is not restricted to under age or young categories but affects all age groups. The Health Behaviour in School Aged Children survey, published in 1999, found that over half of young people begin experimenting with alcohol before the age of 12. In the younger age groups, under 15 years, more boys than girls are current drinkers, but by the time they reach the 15 to 16 age group, statistics show that half of girls and two-thirds of boys are current drinkers.It is not only the extent of under age drinking which is of concern but also the pattern of drinking, in particular the level of binge drinking and drunkenness. One third of the 15 to 16 age group reported binge drinking three or more times in the last month and one-quarter reported having been drunk three or more times in the last month. The adverse effects of this type of alcohol use in social and medical terms are well known and documented.Ireland has had the highest increase in alcohol consumption among European Union member states in the past ten years. We experienced a massive 41% increase in per capita alcohol consumption between 1989 and 1999. Three other member states showed a modest increase while ten showed a decrease. Ireland's consumption continued to increase in 2000 and we now rank second after Luxembourg.While the country as a whole continues to drink alcohol in greater and greater quantities we cannot expect to tackle in isolation the issue of the misuse of alcohol by under age drinkers. We must accept that drinking by young people does not exist in a vacuum; it is influenced by society as a whole. We all have a responsibility to examine our drinking patterns in this light.The urgency with which we must tackle this problem is clearly seen from the indicators of alcohol related harm. Binge drinking and drunkenness lead to a wide range of problems. Poor school performance, accidents, relationship and delinquency problems are common in young binge drinkers. A study among school-going Irish teenagers reported that 35% of the sexually active respondents said that alcohol was an influencing factor in their engaging in sexual activity. Alcohol use has been identified as one of the main risk indicators in relation to teenage pregnancy.Unprotected sex also gives rise to increased risk of sexually transmitted infections. Among a group of 32 teenage girls attending a sexually transmitted infection clinic, almost half reported that they had unprotected sex on at least one occasion when drunk. During the past decade the incidence of sexually transmitted infection has increased by 165%.Excessive drinking increases the risk of drunkenness, fights, assaults and violence. Alcohol related offences committed by juveniles are also increasing. These include assaults, public order offences and drink specific offences, such as intoxication and possession of alcohol in a public place. Some 3,800 alcohol related offences were committed by minors in 2000. By 2001 this had jumped to 6,400.Tragically, there has been an increase in the number of young people committing suicide in recent years. There has been a sharp increase in male suicides, especially among the 15 to 29 age group and overall it is the biggest cause of death for men aged 15 to 35 years. Alcohol use is a significant risk factor in suicide and compounds the other factors. I appreciate that many factors can contribute to an act of suicide but it must be acknowledged that alcohol use is a significant risk factor in the aetiology of suicide.While it is important to be informed about the extent and consequences of alcohol use by young people, perhaps the most important question we must ask is what we can do to tackle it. For many of us, looking at our own lives and homes is a good place to start. Research has shown that for the very young, those under 15 years, the most common sources of alcohol are taking from the drink supply at home, being given it by their parents or having older siblings or friends buy it for them. The research commissioned by my Department in particular established this basic social pattern of how the habit of consumption is initiated. A careless attitude towards the household drinks cabinet can demonstrate a casual ambivalence towards alcohol and be a ready source for a vulnerable child. Equally, patterns of purchase and transfer of alcohol can contribute to the forming of that habit.Senators may be aware that the health promotion unit of my Department is currently running an alcohol awareness campaign entitled Less is More – It's Your Choice. The first year of this three year campaign specifically targeted under age drinkers. A phase of the campaign targeted those who buy, supply or sell alcohol to young people. It consisted of radio advertisements and posters which were displayed in pubs, off-licences and retail outlets where alcohol is sold. The emphasis was on everyone playing their part by not making alcohol accessible to young people. Another initiative involved the printing of sensible drinking advice on airline ticket wallets, which were circulated by the health promotion unit via travel agents. These coincided with the summer holiday season and examination results.The latest phase of the campaign specifically targets the 18 to 29 year old binge drinker. Binge drinking does not mean the drinker is an alcoholic but it can cost the country more because the person who occasionally overdoes it is at greater risk to him or herself and to others. A national advertising campaign on television and radio highlights the concept of excess. At local and regional level the campaign will focus on awareness initiatives in third level colleges, communities and the workplace. Supporting promotional materials have been developed to help spread the key messages of the campaign. These include calendars, mouse mats, posters, pens, notepads for use in the workplace or at college.The responsible serving of alcohol programme is a training initiative which was developed for those who work in the bar trade and hospitality sector. The aim of the programme is to limit harm in the drinking environment by not serving intoxicated customers, encouraging the use of age cards as standard practice to reduce under age drinking and promoting alternative strategies to reduce drink driving. The development of the national curriculum in health education, social, personal and health education, the promotion of school policies on alcohol and drugs and the greater involvement of parents and communities under the health promoting schools concept ensures a comprehensive and effective long-term approach in education.A strategic task force on alcohol was established by my colleague, the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Martin, earlier this year. It was given a remit to provide advice to Government and public bodies on measures to prevent and reduce alcohol related harm. The task force produced a report in May which I commend to the Seanad. It is an excellent report, worthy of examination. The statistics in the report are set out with unusual clarity.I have outlined some of the many ongoing initiatives and projects initiated by the Government. However, the process of changing our attitudes in this area depends on the attitudes of the individual, combined with a growing tide of public intolerance of practices which should not be considered socially normal. Debate, such as this, plays an important part in this process and assists in bringing about these changes. I appreciate that Senators will have many views on this issue.The Government looks forward to this debate and will examine with care any constructive proposal that might help to limit the harm we are suffering. It is important to look at every option, be it the question of advertising, the appropriate legislative character of the licensing code, questions of how we administer the public health system, empower our law enforcement authorities to deal with these matters and how the education system can inform attitudes.The adult world also has to question how our built environment puts the public house at the centre of so many of our communities. I am certain all these questions will be raised and discussed. We must realise that in many other countries many different types of initiatives have been taken. If we are to foster communal and individual responsibility, we must lead by example. We must put specific deterrents in place to encourage a better standard of conduct.
#JimHiggins	unknown-#JimHiggins-party	unknown-#JimHiggins-dob	unknown-#JimHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	164	I welcome the opportunity to contribute to this very important debate, probably one of the most important that we have had in this House in its short time or in the previous Seanad. We are talking about something that goes to the very heart and fabric of society. The Minister of State delivered an extremely good speech which was very good and crisp in its analysis. The reality is that we have had reports, recommendations, studies and task forces, but the problem has slipped out of control. We have an alcohol problem among young people that is of epidemic proportions.Anybody who saw the "Prime Time" special programme a fortnight ago could not have been but appalled at what was shown on the television screen. It showed people being disgorged from night clubs in one mass exodus. The casualty units of different hospitals in Cork, Dublin and Tullamore were visited to see the strewn corpses of unconscious youngsters stoned out of their minds.The Minister of State talked about attitude, in respect of which there is a problem. Nowadays it is accepted that when many young people decide what they will do for the weekend, they go out, not to have a social drink, but rather with the sole objective of getting stoned, drunk, intoxicated. It is a problem which we all must confront and cope with. Unless we cope with it as a matter of urgency, we will see a whole generation of young people with brain and liver damage and who are disco-deaf. They will be a liability on society, not to mention to themselves.We are facing an alcohol problem of epidemic proportions which in the next five or ten years will leave us on a par with the AIDS epidemic in Africa. It is a major problem that is eating into the heart of society and has to be tackled. The "Prime Time" programme showed the manner in which services were put under strain with doctors and nurses having to meet ambulances at the door. They had to pump the young people out in order to get them up and mobile again. It graphically illustrates that it is most unfair on the accident and emergency services in hospitals that they have to cope with this problem. Genuinely sick people who arrive in having suffered heart attacks, strokes or as a result of a road traffic accident have to take their place at the back of the queue. We should seriously consider the proposal that if somebody arrives in such a state of self-inflicted intoxication, there should be a minimum charge of €100 for the service, irrespective of their medical card status.I wish the schemes well, but they are not working. It is fine to talk about the responsibility of the Garda Síochána, schools or publicans, but it all begins with parents. If parents are not vigilant or caring enough to monitor the whereabouts of their children and their condition when they return, it is not fair to expect schools, the Garda or publicans to act in loco parentis. The primary responsibility lies with parents, both in terms of their own behaviour, performance and attitudes and the manner in which they manage the welfare of their children. Thousands of parents are abdicating their responsibilities on a nightly basis, not just in Dublin, Cork or Tullamore – this is the reality in every single town and village in rural Ireland. I have collected children from discos at appointed times and seen what the aftermath of a disco looks like – a battlefield. One would almost be afraid to walk through the mass exodus of unruliness that is the reality in every town in rural Ireland, not to mention the cities.There are problems regarding the licensing trade, although the vast majority of publicans are extremely responsible. They like to run their licensed premises in an orderly fashion and within the law. To try to make the distinction between somebody who is 17 years and 364 days of age and somebody who is 18 years of age is well nigh impossible. The Intoxicating Liquor Bill extended the licensing hours. In its passage through the Houses I proposed an amendment that there should be mandatory ID cards.An industry has been created for the production of forged ID cards. ID cards are extremely easy to forge and very easy to pass off to security staff in pubs and clubs. A Garda Síochána ID card scheme was introduced in recent years. It was bar coded and supposedly foolproof. Unfortunately, the take-up was relatively negligible. We should forget about the whole business of so-called civil liberties. If we have an alcohol problem of such gigantic proportions and are not able to police people going into clubs, discos or pubs and monitor their age on an accurate basis, it is time to look at this provision again and introduce mandatory ID card schemes. There are many countries, including ours, where civil liberties are accorded a very high priority, but I see no infringement whatsoever of one's personal or civil liberty in mandating them to carry an official State ID card.The Minister of State gave the frightening figure of 6,400 alcohol related crimes. The escalation from the earlier figure he gave speaks for itself. The inextricable link between alcohol abuse and violence is there to be seen in these figures, which refer only to reported crimes among juveniles.A huge number of crimes go unreported. I refer to instances where gardaí are either not present at the scene or where some of the people involved subsequently decide not to bring a complaint to their attention. The figures are a gross underestimation. The "Prime Time" programme, which visited three locations – Dublin, Cork and Tullamore – showed that as people emerge from the discos, pubs and clubs, there are inevitable street brawls and consequent injuries, not to mention larcenies and other crimes associated with alcohol abuse.At this stage, a multifaceted approach is needed. Parents have to be held to account for the actions of their children. I welcomed the provision in the Intoxicating Liquor Bill which forced the closure of pubs that were found to have served those under age. This is working well, but I came across a case recently where a licensed premises was closed for the weekend because the publican was not able to make the distinction between a person aged 17 years and nine months and 18 years. In that case, the drink was bought for the young person by his mother. How can one expect publicans to operate in such circumstances? Tadhg O'Sullivan stated earlier on "Today with Pat Kenny" that when a family is in a pub and the father goes up to the bar and orders a Coke, a gin and tonic and a vodka, the Coke goes to the mother, the gin and tonic goes to the father and the vodka goes to the child. If the family is seated in the corner of a crowded pub, how can the publican be held responsible for such an occurrence?Young people should themselves be brought to account. If somebody under 18 is found in a state of intoxication, they should be treated as having committed a crime. We must be tough, pragmatic and realistic. We need a multifaceted approach which must start with parents in the home. The police, publicans and advertising companies also have roles to play. The glamorising of alcohol has done a huge amount to induce people into believing it can create a lifestyle and a feeling of joie de vivre. That, in its own way, is a major contributory factor.I hope the debate will not end here and that it will be ongoing. There should be regular monitoring of how we, the State and the people come to terms with one of the greatest cancers which has ever been visited on society.
#CamillusGlynn	unknown-#CamillusGlynn-party	unknown-#CamillusGlynn-dob	unknown-#CamillusGlynn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	165	Cuirim fáilte roimh an Aire Stáit go dtí an Teach. With other Members, I recently requested a debate on this matter. The level of attendance in the Chamber is clearly indicative of the great importance Members on all sides attach to the debate.When a person mentions drug pushing, we are immediately placed in a frame of mind which leads us to believe that he or she is talking about one of the illicit drugs. However, we are discussing a legal drug, namely, alcohol. For fear this might be perceived as an exercise in publican-bashing, I assure the House that it is not. Publicans may be part of the problem, but they are also part of the solution.There have been many reports compiled in respect of this matter. In the late 1990s the Midland Health Board, which serves the area I represent, brought forward a report on under age drinking in second level colleges, convent schools, etc. In tandem with the statistics outlined by the Minister of State, the position has worsened in the interim. This leaves us in no doubt that it is not alarmist to say that the problem matter has reached epidemic proportions.If we have identified the problem, what is being done in terms of finding a solution? I agree with Senator Higgins that a multifaceted approach is necessary and that the problem must be attacked on a number of fronts. In Mullingar, signs have been posted which ask those who want a drink to prove they are over 18. Let us consider the issue of proof. I agree that uptake of the identity card system introduced by the Garda was minimal. This is a great pity and it poses major difficulties for security personnel at nightclubs. Some people refer to these individuals as "bouncers", but I think "security personnel" is a more appropriate term. All such security personnel need to be educated to some extent about under age drinking because they also have a role to play.People often demand that parents exercise greater control over their children. There is plenty of parental control from the point of view that young people are controlling their parents well. Any parent who brings a son or daughter in the age group where the ingestion of alcohol is illegal out drinking should be sent to jail and the child concerned should be placed in care. There is no point in joking about it. If a person supplied somebody with cannabis, marijuana or heroin, he or she would be an outcast in his or her own area. However, if a parent is seen giving their daughter or son a drink, people say that they "could do worse". It is taking that attitude, as a society, which has led to this problem reaching epidemic proportions.Having carried out the diagnosis, what about the prescription? What should we do about the problem? I firmly believe that parents, the Garda, publicans and of course the educational authorities have pivotal roles to play. We are reliably informed that whereas in the past boys and girls would go to school on a Monday morning tired as a result of partaking in games over the weekend, they now arrive with hangovers. The scene has changed and the problem has become much different.What action should schools take? Is there a case to be made for breathalysing young people? Some would say that would take away their rights, but what about their obligations to society? A great deal has been said about rights, but, in my opinion, people's obligations always play second fiddle to their rights.I want to return to a point, to which Senator Higgins referred and which I made when calling for this debate, namely, the situation that obtains at accident and emergency units. A recent radio debate revealed that the number of altercations between those attending A&E departments due to the consumption of alcohol is quite substantial. I agree with what Senator Higgins said but, if anything, my solutions would be a little more draconian. Not only must we recognise that these individuals take up the time of nurses, doctors and other personnel at A&E units, we must also take into account that gardaí are far too often called on to quell the disturbances they create and that ambulances must be used to transport them home.It is amazing to note that a European comparative study on alcohol estimated that alcohol related problems cost Irish society approximately €2.4 billion. Imagine what the Minister for Health and Children and our health boards and hospitals could do with that money if we did not have the nonsense that is going on. Then there is the situation pertaining to health care, road accidents, alcohol-related crime and lost productivity.How often have we seen young people fall into the clutches of the Dickensian Fagins of this world and exhorted to commit crimes and pass on their ill-gotten gains to them? What about the statistics available on the number of days lost to productive industrial activity? What about the number of people failing to turn up for duty morning after morning in hospitals, schools and other public services as result of over-indulgence in alcohol the night before, or indeed on an on-going basis?I take a drink. I like to think I am a social drinker. If people take a drink, however, they should ensure that the drink does not take them. That is what we are talking about. We are also talking about another statistic relating to suicide that has become evident in recent years. Anybody who has studied drink-related problems will appreciate that people take their own lives when they get to the stage of denial and delusion, when they no longer appreciate that they have a problem and when they eventually become frustrated by their inability to deal with the problem. It is a well-known statistic. Maybe I am incorrect in saying this since I do not have any clinical proof to substantiate the point, but it is rather strange that the incidence of juvenile suicide has increased in parallel with the growing consumption of alcohol by under age drinkers. Is it a coincidence or a fact?Young lads and lassies who went to the cinema a few years ago thought they were great when they pulled out a packet of cigarettes and passed it around. It was a very macho thing. People would describe you as a great fellow for smoking a fag. It is different now. It is not a cigarette but a naggin of whiskey, a bottle of vodka or one of those famous products referred to here recently, the alcopops. Alcopops smack of everything that is designed to encourage young people to drink. They even taste like pop. The producers of those drink products should reflect upon what has been said about the products.A huge amount can be done by sporting organisations. I acknowledge the great role that has been played by all the sporting organisations in this country, the BLE, the GAA, the FAI, the IRFU and the tennis clubs. They have a tremendous role to play because they can dissipate or utilise the energy of young people in some way so that they will not be so disposed to head to the nearest pub.Reference was made to the pubs that have been closed as a result of serving under age customers. This is a marvellous measure. The vast majority of publicans that I know – and I know many from having travelled around this country in almost 24 years of public life – are decent people. They have no wish to violate in any way the law pertaining to the serving of alcohol to under age people. Regrettably, however, there is a significant percentage of people who have to be weeded out of the vintner trade.If we are to curb this menace, there is a case to be made for the health boards taking a more positive role. A case has to be made for appropriately qualified people liaising with the educational authorities. There is much information available on under age drinking, but whether it is getting across or not is a matter for debate. We must get the message home loud and clear. Whether it is publicans, parents buying a drink for Johnny or Mary and sneaking it to them in the corner or an adult going into an off-licence and buying drink for young people, these people should be jailed. Nothing less should be done.Many Members are lining up to speak on this very important issue. The children of today are the leaders of tomorrow. What sort of leaders will we produce if we do not take an interest in this very serious matter? Given the statistics that have been outlined here today and that are freely available, if we do not do something soon it will be too late, and God knows what sort of society we will be spawning in the years ahead.
#MaryHenry	unknown-#MaryHenry-party	unknown-#MaryHenry-dob	unknown-#MaryHenry-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	166	I welcome the Minister of State to the House and I particularly welcome the mention in his speech of the fact that alcohol has been identified as such an important risk indicator in teenage pregnancy and the transmission of sexually transmitted infections. An even more serious issue I want to address is the importance of alcohol in drug-induced sexual assaults.I have here the figures from the sexual assault treatment unit in the Rotunda Hospital for the years 2000 and 2001. There were 253 attendances in 2000 and 256 in 2001. Over one third of cases involved girls under 19 and almost 10% of cases involved girls under 16. In an enormous number of cases these young women had consumed huge quantities of alcohol. The toxicologist told us recently that there were lethal levels of 300-400 milligrams of alcohol in the blood of some of these young women. When we think that 80 milligrams is the limit for driving we can imagine the state these girls were in, especially given that some of them would have had very little experience of alcohol.There was much talk from the mid-1990s about drug-assisted assaults and it was suggested that drugs such as Rohypnol, or benzodiazepine, were very important in the fact that so many young women could not even remember if they had been raped and their drinks had been spiked. When we discussed the "Prime Time" report, for which we should be most grateful, I was rather concerned that some Senators seemed to think that the spiking of drinks was common. These drugs are odourless and tasteless. In ten cases each year the sexual assault treatment unit sent specimens to check if rohypnol which lasts in the system for 72 hours was present in people's blood or urine. There was no rohypnol present, just lethal levels of alcohol. It is extremely important to recognise that alcohol is an important factor in sexual assaults.The level of alcohol consumed was astonishing. Nineteen women admitted to having had eight or more drinks while a number of them could not remember what amount they had. One admitted to having drunk 21 units. Some of them had also taken drugs such as methadone, cannabis, ecstasy and heroin. However, none had taken what are described as date rape drugs. It was not the case that somebody had spiked their drinks, their problems were self-inflicted. Some of the rape cases involved young men, eight in one year and ten in the next. Young women and men need to be warned that if they put themselves into such an intoxicated state, they are far more liable to be victims of assault.The figures do not take account of the Well Woman Centre and general practitioners' clinics, where women call the following morning seeking the morning after pill because they do not know if they had sex, consensual or not, the previous night. This is a shocking state of affairs which I hope the Department of Health and Children will tackle it in its educational programmes. It is an extremely dangerous situation.I am glad to hear so much sympathy being expressed for those who must work in accident and emergency units. All doctors and nurses must work in these units, but when I had to do it, I never encountered what is being experienced by those working in them now. Young drunk people lie around on mattresses until staff can get them to sober up. Some of the people concerned will have head injuries because they will have fallen. As it is hard to assess the head injury of a very drunk patient, some of them will die. This is a serious problem, not only for the dead person's family, but also for the staff who try to deal with the people concerned. I am glad to hear sympathy expressed for those who must work in such circumstances.
#DavidNorris	unknown-#DavidNorris-party	unknown-#DavidNorris-dob	unknown-#DavidNorris-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	167	I have been raising this issue in the Seanad for the last six years. At first, I was laughed out of court by people who regarded the massive increase in alcohol consumption and the deterioration in public behaviour and health standards as a source of amusement. I remember talking about the filth in the centre of our capital city as a result of people urinating, defecating and vomiting everywhere. Laughter was heard from the other side of the House with the quite witty remark, "urination once again." I hope we have got beyond this and no longer regard it as a laugh. It is an exceptionally serious health, economic and social problem and I am glad Seanad Éireann has at last woken up to this fact. However, it is quite amusing to find myself in danger of being trampled to death by the rush of people jumping on board on this issue. Thank God for it. I hope we will stand together and do something. Before the last general election the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Martin, a decent man, said market forces versus public health issues must be controlled once and for all. Let us do it. Let us stop talking about it and put teeth into the legislation. It can be done in this House.There is not merely anecdotal material on this problem. The strategic task force on alcohol has reported that in the last six years there has been a 50% increase in the consumption of spirits. Ireland has moved from 12th to second place in the world rankings of alcohol consumption and by next year we will probably be in first place. That is an extraordinary change in the statistics. Cannabis is a far less dangerous drug than alcohol, yet it is illegal. A total of 53% of young people have tried an illegal drug. A total of 32% per cent of 15 to 16 year olds have used cannabis while 22% have used solvents, but 89% have tried alcohol. That is worrying.People are afraid to walk the streets of cities and towns after the early evening because they are in danger of unprovoked assault. Several citizens of the State, especially young men, have been killed as a result of our inaction in the Oireachtas. It is many years since I first raised this problem in the Seanad. I predicted that if nothing was done, deaths would be the result. Sadly, my words were only too true. I was the victim of an unprovoked drunken assault outside my house some years ago and received five stitches in my face. On another occasion I went to the rescue of a man who was being kicked to death by his drunken companions. I could hear, in my bedroom, the thuds of their boots against his head. The Garda took a long time to arrive and I was reprimanded for going out with my shillelagh to protect myself.We need to wake up to this problem. One of the features of the current situation is the involvement of young women. I am middle aged, but in my day young women did not go out to get drunk. They rarely went into pubs. Now they go out specifically to get drunk. The drinks companies know this and target their products at them. There is no avoiding this fact. I had to laugh, when I saw a recording of the "Prime Time" programme, at the shamefaced attitude of everybody representing the drinks industry. They have much of which to be ashamed. Anybody who can read body language could see it. Some of the people concerned were my friends and I almost felt sorry for them. They were craven in response to the questions directed to them.Think of the tragic case of a young French woman, married to a Cork man, who was attacked in Cork by a couple of drunken trollops. She was beaten so severely that she is in constant pain and unable to bear children. The perpetrators got three years in jail, but the woman concerned and her husband have been given a life sentence. This is an increasingly common phenomenon.There is a social dimension to this problem. I have been contacted by a constituent who lives in Skerries where the nightclub is patronised by people whose average age is 18 to 27 years. The customers exit from a narrow side entrance onto New Street, a residential area. Some of the incidents that have occurred include urination in letterboxes, rows outside the premises, breakage of car wing mirrors, window boxes being smashed, flower beds on the roundabout destroyed and windows broken in. This happens despite the fact that the nightclub has hired private security men to police the streets. At the weekends most of the residents are barricaded inside their homes, even though this is a civilised country. The licence is coming up again for renewal and one wonders if the judge will do anything. However, I will deal with that issue later. While I am aware of the separation of powers, I am as entitled as anybody else to criticise judicial practice in this country and will do so. I have done it outside this House and will continue to do so.There is a problem with public disorder. There is also the massive cost to the Exchequer. Alcohol related health care costs amounted to €279 million last year, the cost of road accidents was €315 million and the cost of alcohol related crime, €100 million. There is huge financial output due to alcohol, €1,034 million. The total bill is €2,366 million per annum. Why do we tolerate this? It is because the drinks industry has increased its profits to €6.8 billion. As the Minister said, it is a case of market forces versus public health. This House should be on the side of public health, not market forces.In the old days we had companies such as Arthur Guinness, Jameson and Powers. It was a paternalistic system. Now we have none of them. Instead we have multinationals such as Diageo and Pernod Ricard. They also make underground railways, nappies and petfood. Their headquarters are in Paris, London and New York and they simply see a chart on which they want to increase profits. It is obvious that they do not give a damn what social damage they do. They have the lunatic idea that a small finite market such as Ireland can absorb limitless quantities of alcohol. There is no question that the major drinks manufacturers are deliberately and specifically targeting young people, particularly women.Every aspect of the advertising code is routinely broken. This is laid out in the reports; the code is broken every day of the week. Young people are given the impression that the consumption of alcohol will make them more sexually attractive, more interesting, better athletes and generally help them have a better time overall. The creation of drinks such as Bacardi Breezer and Smirnoff Ice make this perfectly obvious.The consequences are disorder, violence and the clogging of accident and emergency areas in hospitals. After midnight at weekends 50% of emergency cases are related to alcohol. What about decent people who may be taken ill at the weekend? Selfish little blackguards are clogging up services which are rightly the entitlement of those who are genuinely sick, not those who, as Senator Henry said, are sick as a result of their own stupidity. That is the reason they are in hospital.There are also unscheduled pregnancies and a huge increase in venereal infections. As has been said, it is quite typical for young women not to remember whether they had sex. They get the morning after pill on the basis that they may have had sex but do not remember. This certainly contradicts the message of the advertisements: if one cannot remember whether one had sex within a few hours of the event, it scarcely suggests the experience was either memorable or enjoyable. At least on the few occasions I have had that pleasure I have certainly remembered and knew all about it.This morning we heard the Heineken Rugby Cup – what an irony – was under review by the IRFU in administrative terms because at the last few matches there were over 300 teenagers getting drunk in the car park. One young woman of 13 years and a boy of 14 years had to be taken to hospital by ambulance.The current debate is put in context by last week's "Prime Time" programme. I am intrigued by the reaction to that programme – people said they were shocked, horrified, amazed and surprised. I am not, as I see this going home at night every weekend. I have seen it develop over the last ten years and sung like a canary about it in this House. I praise and salute the workers of Dublin Corporation who have the unenviable task of mopping up the urine, vomit and faeces liberally spattered around Dublin city centre.No doubt this came as a surprise to the middle classes living in the suburbs who have apparently closed their eyes to the situation. I specifically include most members of the Judiciary in that, particularly members of the Dublin District Court. I cannot understand how members of the Judiciary can in conscience rubber-stamp licences for badly run, ill-supervised, dangerous public houses which are a continual source of riot, confusion and even gun battles. I know what I am talking about; I know these places. How can so-called lapdancing drinking clubs be licensed?A consultant, Dr. Anne Hope, spoke of the obstructionism of the drinks industry, which was evident in the programme. Others spoke of the irresponsibility of the licensed trade. What about the irresponsibility of elements of the Judiciary and other licensing authorities? It seems in Dublin city centre all one has to do is apply for a licence for anything – a traditionally disreputable pub, gambling den or so-called lapdancing club – for it to be granted.It is perfectly well known that O'Connell Street is becoming a no-go area; one need only look at the cancellation of the Belvedere boys' Christmas fast. The causes are well known: the existence of badly supervised superpubs in the area and the easy accessibility of off-licence sources of alcohol, yet what do we have? The Ambassador Cinema has recently become a weekend boozerama for teenagers while St. Mary's Church is in the process of what one radio commentator with apparently no sense of irony described as reconsecration as a superpub. The Spar outlets on O'Connell Street have been licensed in the last couple of weeks to sell bottles and cans of beer to drunken louts on the streets late at night.To date the Oireachtas has been shamefully reticent on this subject because of the active political lobby and political subscriptions of the drinks industry. It is time to call a halt. In terms of the damage to society this is a bigger scandal than anything under review by any of the tribunals. We hear a lot about drink being part of Irish culture. Culture my backside – it is nothing short of barbarism. The sight every weekend of drunken louts and hooligans of both sexes brawling, vomiting and excreting all over the centre of the city is something no self-respecting savage would describe as culture. There has been a 301% increase in the number of public order offences, from 18,000 to 55,000, over the last six years in direct parallel with the massive increase in under age drinking. The Government has so far disregarded all warnings and the 1996 national alcohol policy paper was totally ignored. As a result, its dire predictions have come all too true.Alcoholic drinks should be clearly labelled as potentially highly dangerous to health. Identity cards, including age, should be mandatory for young drinkers. There should be a strict revision of the licensing process. Sponsorship and advertising by drinks corporations should be outlawed. Bar staff in public houses responsible for giving the last drink to a customer who is already drunk should be rendered criminally liable.In this situation is it still tolerable that we include alcohol in the consumer price index? Alcohol is not necessary to keep breathing, yet we have it with nicotine as two of the main engines in the way we estimate inflation. Let us get them out of the index, as it is utterly stupid to have them in there.
#JohnMinihan	unknown-#JohnMinihan-party	unknown-#JohnMinihan-dob	unknown-#JohnMinihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	168	I join previous speakers in welcoming this debate, which is timely, if not too late. International surveys have clearly set out that we are on a slippery road when it comes to our future, but it is no harm to remind ourselves of what such surveys indicate about Ireland. Previous speakers have referred to some of the results, but we should emphasise the point. We need to listen and face up to the situation.We are now drinking more than almost all our EU colleagues. In the last six years consumption of spirits alone has increased by over 50%, while there has been a staggering increase of 100% in consumption of cider. Between 1989 and 1999per capita alcohol consumption increased by a massive 41%. Overall per capita alcohol consumption in Ireland in 2002 was 14.2 litres and the latest estimates for 2001 suggest it will have increased.These statistics are even more staggering when we compare them to the figures for our EU counterparts. Nine other EU member states have shown a decrease in alcohol consumption during the same period, while three showed a modest increase of just 5%. If we look back in ten years' time to see this curve has not peaked, the consequences for our society and health system are frightening.Speakers mentioned the stresses on our health system. Inappropriate drinking results in immense suffering and costs. A conservative figure of €2.4 billion was estimated as having been spent in 1999 in health care as a result of road accidents, alcohol related crime and lost productivity. That is a serious figure and a wake-up call to our society. We must be serious and face up to this issue.Binge drinking also features in the surveys, particularly among 15 to 16 year olds. Many of us were raised in an era where we took the pledge in secondary school until we were 18 years. Though some did not take it and took a drink, binge drinking at 15 or 16 years must be recognised as a new phenomenon. People talk about cultural events, but we should look at the coverage in The Irish Times today of events in Donnybrook, to which Senator Norris referred. In one way the IRFU is to be commended for its action, but it has had to restrict ticket sales to schoolchildren for next Friday's rugby match because such games are used as gathering points for under age drinking and the consequences of such drinking. A 13 year old boy and a 14 year old girl were hospitalised after a recent match because of drinking. Children attending matches bring their alcohol with them in mineral or soft drinks bottles. This is a clear example of the abuses that are taking place. While I am disappointed about this, I believe we should salute the Leinster branch of the IRFU for taking the action it has found it necessary to take. Given that I am talking about the Heineken Rugby Cup, is there not a contradiction in terms of the sponsorship versus the reality? We have an unacceptable tolerance to drunkenness in this country. I am a non-drinker. I have no difficulty in saying that, but it does not mean that I am anti-drink; I am anti-drunkenness. My business is a corner premises in the city centre and, on average, I lose eight windows per year. I do not lose them as a result of people trying to break in, but as a result of drunkenness. I have had everything come through my window, from wing mirrors of cars to a young person as a result of violent behaviour.When I have been notified at 2 a.m. or 3 a.m. to respond to an alarm call, I have found that my premises has been broken into and I usually worry about the consequences, I have often sat in my car afraid to get out to turn off the alarm. I am not casting aspersions on the gardaí, but the reality of gatherings of people who are severely intoxicated in our city centres leaves a lot to be desired. I was laughed at during a recent meeting of Cork City Council when I suggested that our next meeting should be held at 12 midnight on a bus touring the city centre because this would allow members to see what goes on.The condition in which one can see young people, particularly girls, in the city centre is frightening. Senator Henry and others referred to the consequences of the state in which these people find themselves and I will not repeat the points they made. Young people have come to me with their parents as a result of incidents in which they were involved in the city centre. I refer here to decent people from respectable homes who have been so intoxicated that they were not responsible for their actions. When the nature of their actions was pointed out to them the following day, these individuals were horrified. We have a responsibility to these young people to protect them from each other and from themselves. We cannot allow a situation develop where, due to a lack of proper supervision and enforcement of the laws of the land, people are allowed ruin the rest of their lives. We must reduce alcohol consumption and control binge drinking.I return to what I said earlier about the pioneer pin that was available when I was young and when many people took the pledge in school. When I served in the Defence Forces overseas and people were released for weekends, there were always concerns that they would engage in binge drinking. We had a famous chaplain, Paddy Breslin, with us on one tour who dispensed temporary pledges to the effect that one would consume no more than four or five pints.We cannot tell young people they cannot drink because that is the way of life. However, we can try to educate them to be moderate in their drinking and to limit the amount of alcohol they consume. I am not advocating that the Total Abstinence Association changes the form of its pledge, but there is a message there. The message should be that we should seek a commitment from young people to limit the amount of alcohol they consume. There is nothing wrong with having a drink, but it is not right to get oneself into a state where one no longer knows what one is doing. I cannot subscribe to the boast some people make that they had a great night last night, that they got as drunk as a lord and that they do not remember a thing about it. That is nothing of which to be proud. It is not the direction in which society should be going.We must compliment our teachers and educational system. We must pay respect to the job teachers do in dealing with students under the influence of drink or suffering from hangovers, but, more importantly, on educating them and on pushing forward the standards that are acceptable in the society in which we live. We must do so because education is the way to correct these problems.Enforcement of the law is an issue. The laws on the Statute Book, particularly those that relate to public order, must be enforced. I do not find it tolerable that the vast percentage of people arrested for public order offences are released without charge or given the benefit of the Probation Act. We must get real. If we want to set down acceptable standards in society, we must come down hard and show leadership.We must also, without fear or favour, face up to the vested interests. This is a market driven addiction. People are making vast amounts of money out of it and we must face up to them because they also have responsibilities. I strongly advocate that we face up to the responsibilities of the production of a national ID card, not on a voluntary but on a compulsory basis. We must also examine the area of advertising. I refer in particular to advertising targeted at children and the so-called advertisements on TV that promote the drink culture, alcopops, etc., as being "cool" and an "in" thing of which to be part. They are, of course, nothing of the sort.A recent letter in one of the regional newspapers from a concerned parent reads:Nowadays we hear and read a lot about teenage drinking and the awful problems it causes.Recently I saw a flyer that I believe was being handed out to students. It stated that if a bottle of branch X was purchased in a particular bar, the buyer also received a free bottle.This is aimed at students along with other drink promotions. The purpose being the parting of students and their scarce resources. What about the aftermath, these promotions usually occur on weeknights with college the next day? Are these bars and nightclubs so greedy they don't care what these kids get into?Everyone is entitled to have a good time. But there is a responsibility here and the people who are granted a licence to sell alcohol should face up to that responsibility.Concerned parent.We all know concerned parents, but being concerned does not get parents off the hook. Unfortunately, there is a breakdown in some of the responsibilities parents should have and the control they should exercise over their children. Some Members referred to this point earlier and I am sure others will refer to it again later.I also wish to highlight the association between sport and alcohol. Sport is a worthwhile exercise. It is an alternative. It gives children a sense of being involved and provides them with the ability to interact with other children. However, the relationship between alcohol and sport is not compatible. Sporting authorities must face up to their responsibilities and not be driven by the markets in supporting alcohol sponsored events. We, as legislators, have a responsibility to face up to the protection of our citizens, particularly young people who are our future. Will we say that we will allow this unacceptable tolerance of drunkenness to continue or will we send out a clear and unequivocal message that the time has come for us to show leadership? Leadership is the only way that we will move forward on this issue.We, as legislators, must recognise the warning message the international surveys have sent us and say clearly and unequivocally that this is no longer tolerable. We need the courts to enforce the law, be it on licence holders or those in breach of the Public Order Act. Clear messages must be given by the District Court that drunkenness and activities resulting from excessive drinking will not be tolerated.We have a responsibility to educate young people for their own good and in their interests about what is acceptable and unacceptable. Not only must we protect them from each other, we must also protect them from themselves. I hope as a result of this debate that we will begin that process, which should include teachers, parents and the courts, to bring young people's futures back on track and secure the future of the country.

#JoannaTuffy	unknown-#JoannaTuffy-party	unknown-#JoannaTuffy-dob	unknown-#JoannaTuffy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	171	I agree with speakers that we need a multifaceted approach to the problem. I also agree with the Minister of State that it is a case of the individual's attitude combined with a growing tide of public intolerance for a practice that should not be considered a social norm.I would go further and say that we should not become reactionary as a result of the information being made available about under age drinking and alcohol consumption. It is an important issue but we should react in a balanced way. We need a programme of education, enforcement and provision of facilities which addresses the problem of under age alcohol consumption over a number of years as well as immediately. The main objective should be to assist young people. We need to protect them while also making them aware. They need other options as well as laws that are clear and enforced.I am in favour of examining the licensing laws but I oppose the rolling back of the licensing hours. Instead, we should examine what is being done in the United Kingdom where pilot schemes of 24 hour licensing periods are being introduced. The problem rests with people leaving pubs at the same time. Having closing time an hour earlier or a half hour later does not alter that fact.The problems we have experienced with alcohol have built up over the years. The Minister of State said the increase in alcohol consumption of 41% occurred over a ten year period and relates to changes in society such as modernisation, greater liberalism, higher disposable incomes and both parents working. When it is said that young people have greater disposable incomes, it should also be borne in mind that many cannot afford to buy a house. It is not as simple as saying that they have large amounts of money to throw away.It is important that we enforce the laws and penalise those who serve alcohol to under age people or sell it to them in off-licences. We should address the phenomenon of older people buying drink for younger people. I witnessed such a scene in an off-licence when a young man of 18 tried to buy drink for a girl of 14. I pointed this out to the man at the counter and he did what was right and did not serve them. It is obvious that this happens frequently and we need to address it by enforcing the law and penalising the people involved. We also need to address it through education because sometimes parents and older brothers, sisters and friends are guilty of buying drink for under age people. We all have a responsibility in this regard. It is a case of education and enforcement.It is important that we make under age drinking socially unacceptable and there should be strong legal consequences. We know we can do it because it has happened in other areas of enforcement, such as illegal parking. If a person knows the consequences will cause him or her serious inconvenience and stress, he or she will not take the risk. It is important that there are more closures of off-licences and pubs that serve under age people.I support the idea of a ban on the advertising of alcohol, but we should at the very least examine the law governing this area. It is bad that advertisements can be in circulation for so long before the Advertising Standards Authority of Ireland calls them into question and prohibits them. There needs to be screening of advertisements before they are released. Something must be done about the sponsorship of events by drinks companies, including sports and college events.It is important that there are education programmes in addition to curbing advertising. There needs to be greater education of people in school about the consequences of drinking. The reality is that people will drink and they therefore need to be educated drinkers. Most people go through a stage where they drink unwisely and eventually wisdom and experience bring them to drink differently later in life. However, people are beginning to drink much earlier, so there need to be programmes to educate them and make them aware of the problems and downside associated with drinking.We are all part of a society with this problem and it is not a question of them versus us. It has a great deal to do with the way our society socialises around alcohol. There need to be more options for people to socialise. In other countries on the Continent, young people gather in cafés where ice cream and coffee, among other things, are available as well as drink. They do not go out to get drunk but to meet other young people. That is the type of culture we need to develop. We need a firm but balanced policy which not only addresses our immediate concerns but has long-term objectives as well.
#GeraldineFeeney	unknown-#GeraldineFeeney-party	unknown-#GeraldineFeeney-dob	unknown-#GeraldineFeeney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	172	I welcome the Minister of State to the House and thank him for spending time with us. I regret that his colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Tom Kitt, has left. I remember in his previous ministry when he regulated consumer affairs that he described alcopops as insidious concoctions and introduced a regulation requiring them to be displayed alongside alcoholic drinks in bars, supermarkets and off-licences and not put to one side and glossed up to look like sweets or something similar to appear attractive to children. He wanted them highlighted for the dangerous drinks they are. It makes me feel that consecutive Governments, especially Fianna Fáil-led ones, have done something to try to combat the terrible cancer of under age drinking.People have spoken about statistics relating to the rising numbers and high percentage of young people who are drinking, so I will not cover that ground. Drink is part of our culture and heritage almost from the time we are born. We have always celebrated events with a great deal of alcohol, be they weddings, christenings, graduations – second and third level – sporting events or wakes. We pat each other on the back, congratulate each other and joke later about the morning after the night before.If one looks at where we are at today, it can be seen that we have not come very far. We can argue whether it is the good economy we have that is resulting in all this drinking or just that we are now coming into our own. There is a different relationship now between teenagers and our generation as parents, but perhaps that debate is for another day.I was glad to hear the Leader say we would resume this debate if there was not enough time. When I researched this subject, I was alarmed to read that in parts of the country children as young as nine years were experimenting with drink. It is frightening to think what an underdeveloped liver, not to mention a young mind, can make of alcohol at that age.The Minister will be interested in an article in the Sunday Independent on 8 December, which relates the saddest story ever of a young girl who said that when she became old enough to have her first legal drink, she was drying out in a treatment centre. The names used in the article were Carol and her daughter, Holly, but those are not their real names. Holly said:Alcoholism turns you into a horrible person. It strips you of your dignity, takes your friends away and hurts everybody around you, in particular those you love most.That is what I would expect somebody in middle age to say, certainly not a young girl of 18 years on the brink of adulthood. She went on to say:Most people think the weekends are for getting pissed [I apologise for the language]. The majority of us go out there just to get steamed and locked. That is what weekends are for.Her mother is a very angry lady and I do not blame her. She is looking to blame somebody. She blames politicians, publicans and lawyers. I hear the Leader saying she should be blaming herself. I know other speakers have blamed parents, but I will not knock them that much. There is an onus on us all. I have four children and do not always know where they are and regard myself as a very responsible parent. The majority are very good parents and it is not right to tar them all with the one brush just because there is a group of bad parents.Last Christmas my daughter, then aged 16 and a half years, went to a nightclub for the first time. Because of the time of year, I agreed to pick her up rather than have her queue for a taxi. I was in bed at midnight and set my alarm for 2.30 a.m. to collect her. When I arrived and was waiting for her, I locked my car because I was terrified by the number of young drunk teenagers who arrived. I drive a Volkswagen Passat like many of the taxis in Sligo and they thought my car was a taxi. I knew two of the individuals who did not even remember the next day or the following day. I did not ask them, but when I met them, they did not allude to it. I was absolutely horrified by what I saw.Holly's story is no different from that of any other young person. If we say this story is one in a million, we are deluding ourselves and telling lies. Children like Holly have big problems. They are alcoholics before they reach the legal age to drink.I was heartened when I listened to "Morning Ireland" this morning and the story as related by other speakers. Senator Minihan has complimented the Leinster branch of the IRFU for only issuing 500 tickets with the rest being issued as family tickets. It is not banning young people from the grounds who will be allowed in with their parents. The Senator went on to say the Leinster branch of the IRFU was very responsible. I have two sons who play rugby and know this holds true across the board with the IRFU. During school rugby matches the IRFU blanks out any advertising for alcohol, in particular the ones we see in Donnybrook that carry the name of the sponsors of the Heineken Cup.I am somewhat worried about the Public Order Act, as we know it today. It dates back to 1984 when Margaret Thatcher was in power in the United Kingdom. We modelled our Public Order Act on the UK Act. We all remember the miners' strike that was ongoing when it was introduced. There were many public order offenders at the time. It may now be time to look at the Act and consider what we can do to control under age drinking. As politicians, we have a responsibility to grab it by the scruff of the neck. I know Senator Minihan started off by saying he hoped it was not too late. I do not believe it is. We have often stood here and said what a great bunch of people the youth of this country are, which is true. However, we need to educate them when it comes to drinking and need to lead by example. They see adults whose only way to celebrate is through alcohol.I pay tribute to the excellent work done by the Garda. I know other speakers mentioned medics, nurses and teachers, all of whom I would highly commend. However, the Garda should come in for a special word of mention. Some of the men and women of the force are not much older than the people with whom they have to deal at weekends. They are putting their lives at risk. Some of them have told me that when they take in people who are drunk and disorderly, some young men are carrying Stanley knives and other weapons while young women have sharp pieces of glass in their handbags.
#FrankFeighan	unknown-#FrankFeighan-party	unknown-#FrankFeighan-dob	unknown-#FrankFeighan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	173	I also welcome this debate on the high levels of alcohol consumption among teenagers. While the problem of alcohol consumption is not new, it is now becoming an epidemic and drastic steps must be taken. The drink culture, as we know it, is very much part of the Irish psyche. We have given it a status and tolerance. The alarm bells are now ringing very late in the day which is worrying. I hope it is not too late to halt this stampede, but if we do not stop drinking at the present level of consumption, it will be too late.It took the graphic RTÉ "Prime Time" programme to set off alarm bells. I commend the makers of the programme for raising public awareness of the destruction caused by drink. It focused on young people and the drink culture. However there seems to be something inherent in the Irish psyche which makes drinking compelling to all of us. I enjoy a drink and sometimes have overindulged. It seems to be compelling, however, for young people of 16, 17 or 18 years, some of whom may have had fathers or other family members who drank.As a publican, I know the vast majority of publicans are very conscious and have tolerated laws relating to young people coming into pubs. It is now time to prevent young people under 18 years from doing so. I know the law is in place, but it is still tolerated. As politicians, we hold many meetings in pubs. The Taoiseach has opened pubs, as has my leader. The Tánaiste has opened off-licences. We are all to blame. We must ensure we cut out the opening of public houses because it sets the wrong example.We also have the Guinness All-Ireland Championship. Recently, at the Rose of Tralee festival, Gay Byrne paid tribute to the manager of Guinness group sales. Many members of the GAA who watched the recent "Prime Time" programme will no longer view as positive their association with the name of a brewery or local bar.We created the Irish pub, which we export throughout the world. Many such pubs feature slogans such as "Drop into an old friend" or "Guinness is good for you". This is a myth. I have never got up in the morning, having had a few pints of Guinness, with the feeling that it is good for me. We have created a major industry with its vested interests around alcohol. The vintners will lobby to promote their products and licences. Now is the time to shout stop.Each year we spend some €3.5 billion on alcohol, equivalent to the total amount spent on the health service. We are now ranked second in the European alcohol consumption league. Between 1989 and 2000, a period in which consumption of alcohol in other countries was declining, consumption here rose by more than 50%. That is hard to believe. Some 60% of young women and 50% of young men drink dangerously and there is a strong connection between alcohol and suicide.Alcohol is also involved in 40% of road fatalities, despite the growing culture of opposition to drink driving and the rising number of detections by the Garda, nearly 11,000 in 2001. In light of some 400 road deaths every year, I welcome the introduction of the new points system. Despite the universal awareness that drink driving is wrong, many people continue to drink and drive. Nobody ever stops drinking and driving because of the fear of killing somebody. Instead, we stop because we fear losing our driving licence and the consequent rise in insurance costs. What kind of civic pride do we have when these fears, not the fear of being killed or killing some poor unfortunate, cause us to stop drink driving? We have a very selfish attitude to alcohol.The "Prime Time" programme showed the violence associated with alcohol, which I, too, have seen. It featured young people, gardaí, ambulance crews and hospital emergency units being threatened. Fortunately, although I like a drink, I have never resorted to violence. It is time the courts implemented the law when the Garda brings people before them under the public order Acts.A decade ago I would not have had a problem intervening in a drink related row to ensure people did not make fools of themselves. One would not do so today because of another substance, ecstasy, which has led to people becoming much more violent. This has to stop. The cost to the health service must be enormous in terms of domestic violence and abuse. One also has the degrading spectacle of people appearing in court pleading that drink was responsible for their actions. This is no longer acceptable.The motion refers to alcohol and young people. The alcohol companies are targeting young people with their alcopops, pink clouds, Butterball, blue margarita, Aftershock and Smirnoff Ice. These are potent and expensive drinks which can be consumed in large quantities in a short time. We must put the brakes on the problem. While there are no quick answers, two studies of the problem have been published, the national alcohol policy report of 1996 and the task force report of 2002.Many people have argued in favour of revising the licensing laws in respect of pub opening hours. At the time longer opening hours appeared to provide the answer to our problems. Given the problems caused by the recent changes, I call on the Government to revisit the licensing laws.During the St. Patrick's day festivities children are present in pubs in every town in the country in flagrant breach of the law. We must demonstrate a willingness to tackle alcohol abuse. Every occasion from birth to death is used as an excuse to drink alcohol. The practice by many pubs of hosting first communion and confirmation parties sends out the wrong signal, as does the presentation of winner's medals to football teams in pubs. We have to make a difference.Having identified alcohol abuse as a major crisis, we must get to grips with it. It is vital we use alcohol in a more reasonable, acceptable and sensible manner. While the challenge is on a par with climbing Everest, the alternative is an abysmal prospect.
#EddieBohan	unknown-#EddieBohan-party	unknown-#EddieBohan-dob	unknown-#EddieBohan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	174	I wish to share time with Senator MacSharry. I welcome the Minister of State at the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, Deputy Noel Ahern. I agree with the comments of the Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children, Deputy Brian Lenihan, and most of what has been said by other Senators.Publicans, whom I represent, do not agree with under age drinking and do not serve under age people. For years my organisation and the Vintners' Federation of Ireland have been pushing for the introduction of identification cards. For some reason this has not happened. The small steps taken to date are not working because the voluntary ID cards are being forged, creating many problems. While I favour the introduction of ID cards for everybody as a way of solving many of the problems of under age drinking, it would not solve them all.Publicans are not the only people with a problem. As was pointed out, kids are going into discos and clubs with liquor, such as naggins of vodka, in their handbags and pockets. They then order orange juice or coke and mix their own drinks. When they go outside drunk, the proprietor of the establishment, whether a publican or club owner, gets the blame for serving them alcohol.The other problem is that teenagers have too much money. Most of them are working part-time in the service industry, particularly pubs, hotels and restaurants, where they get significant sums of money in tips – some as much as €100 a night. They do not know what to do with all this money and many spent considerable sums on drink. I will not blame parents for allowing their children to go out and get drunk. However, there is a trend by which young people drink alcohol, either at home or in groups at friends' houses, before going out. It is sad that many young people have consumed a considerable amount of drink before they even leave the house. In such cases, parents are responsible and should address the problem.Some pubs and clubs, especially the latter, consistently serve drink to under age people. The same people appear to be doing it all the time, yet the Garda does little about it, even though its members appear to be well aware of the problem. The Garda should clamp down much harder on this type of operation. If they consistently serve under age people, they should be closed down. I have no sympathy for publicans or anybody else who serves under age people.The supermarkets chains, which have off-licences, employ foreign staff, particularly Chinese. With all due respect to them, those Chinese people have no idea what age people are, whether they are 16 or 26 years of age, because they come from a different culture, are a different people and have a different look.Senator Norris spoke about the condition of O'Connell Street on a Monday morning. I agree 100% with him. For years the gardaí at Store Street station have had a terrible problem on O'Connell Street. Only a few weeks ago an application was made for an off-licence there. Everybody objected to it, including the Garda, but the District Court saw fit to grant the licence. That is ridiculous. If people are in a pub, at least one has some control over them. With an off-licence, under age people can get others to go in and buy drink for them. People who are of the legal age are going into off-licences with too much drink on them to buy drink which they are consuming on the street. Permission has been granted for another off-licence on Westmoreland Street. There seems to be no restriction on the number of off-licences granted and that is a major problem.I speak for publicans in Dublin and, I think, elsewhere when I say I have never seen a publican deliberately serve under age people to collect some money. I know nearly all of them and am glad to say I have been in many of their pubs. I am not saying there are not a few black sheep around but publicans are not the ones to blame.Somebody spoke about how much the sports organisations are doing for the youth, etc. I agree but GAA clubs, tennis clubs, rugby clubs and so on all have licences. They are not too fussy who they serve because it is really an open house. That matter should be looked into.

I had a long-winded and pre-prepared speech but as so much has been said with which I agree, I will make a few brief points.This is a huge problem of which we are all aware. As a result of public order offences in my home town of Sligo, I was the victim of unsolicited alcohol induced attack on no less than three occasions and was hospitalised twice. Perhaps more than many, I appreciate the problem is critical.There are many reasons for failure but there are no excuses. This is an area in which we have consistently failed because we have tried to deal with a huge problem with small solutions. While I acknowledge Ministers across the party divide have tried to deal with the problem over the years, it needs a more strategic approach. It is about culture. It is not about the publicans. As Senator Bohan rightly pointed out, no self-respecting publican would set out to sell alcohol to any young person to make money. However, if we expect publicans to be responsible and to carry out their duties, that is, to allow people of the proper age enjoy a drink in moderation on their premises, we as legislators must supply the means by which they can do that.As so many Senators have said, we must have a statutory, compulsory identification card for all citizens. I appreciate this might be difficult for older members of society due to modesty and other reasons but if we implemented such a scheme, the public would accept it in time in the same way as it accepted the 15 cent levy on plastic bags, for example. As in the United States, whether one is 16 or 60 years of age, one would be asked for one's identification card and turned away if needs be.I would be opposed to a change in the licensing laws. Unless we deal with the culture, the social problems leading people to drink and the reason the focus for young people is on going out and drinking, changing the licensing hours or laws will not solve the problem.Senator Henry spoke about date rape, spiking drinks and so on. While I agree that sometimes people have too much alcohol and use it as an excuse, there is a problem in this area. I mentioned in the House some weeks ago that I know of two families who had daughters raped as a result of these drugs. Something must be done in that regard.This is a cultural issue. It is not about changing licensing laws but about putting a compulsory national identification card scheme in place. It would have many other benefits. One's PPS number or health information could be carried on the card, as is the case in so many other countries. That is where the solution to this problem lies.

I appreciate the opportunity to speak on this issue. To know where we are going, but we must find out where we are at. We must start by being honest. As a society, we must say we are a nation which likes to drink. At any festivity or occasion, whether a World Cup in Germany or Florida, we are all flat out on the beer and that is socially acceptable.I was in Orlando during the 1994 World Cup and people from Holland and Ireland drank massive amounts. The recent World Cup was a disaster for people in this country. Those in Japan enjoyed it but people here were drinking from 7 a.m. They were in pubs and were drunk by 2 p.m. Marriages were on the brink by 6 p.m.

We can use them as scapegoats and blame them for drinking, but they do not have facilities to which they can go to meet their friends. All young people want to be with their friends or to be in groups where they gain a sense of independence.I passed through Carrickmacross one day and went into Supermacs. I happened to eavesdrop on ten young people who around 14 to 16 years of age. Approximately six of them were smoking – all female. One guy, who seemed to be the leader, was mouthing off, cursing, hitting young lads across the head and making derogatory comments to the girls. Two other girls sitting quite close to me were talking about the different concoctions they could make to get "pissed" more quickly – let us use the language they use. They were not talking about WKDs or alcopops – they mix their own concoctions.At a recent school prom, young people of 15 and 16 years of age spent €21 on a pint which included two shots of vodka, two shots of Bacardi and cider. One person spent €150 that night. That is the problem.I welcome these statements because alcohol abuse is a serious problem. However, we are faced with the question of how we should move forward. Young people must become involved in the debate through programmes in school, for example. Advertising campaigns could be directed at them to encourage them to participate in the debate. Donegal County Council established the first democratically elected youth council in the State. This was done through the schools. There is a shadow youth council in four of the county's electoral areas and there are plans to establish similar councils in the remaining electoral areas.Youths represent their peers on the councils and are able to discuss issues relevant to them. Young people will always say their parents do not know what they are talking about, what their issues are or what they need. The Minister should consider involving our four youth councils in the debate. He should fly to Carrickfin or Derry and request a meeting with the young people concerned who will tell him the reason they drink so much to enjoy themselves and there are so many alcohol related problems.I refer to the different fora at which young people can meet. The GAA must be commended in this regard. If one is good at hurling or football, one will get on the gaelic team and young people can meet their friends in a structured environment where they have role models such as the team managers or older players. However, there is an issue regarding where young people who are not good at various sports or not interested in sport can meet.Youth clubs were successful in rural Ireland in this regard in the past. I was a member of a youth club and it was great. I worked on a farm all day and was able to meet my peers at the club. I was not subjected to advertising campaigns for various products and so on and became involved in the local youth club where my father, the local priest and a few volunteers worked as supervisors. However, nowadays, young people have no interest in youth clubs because they want independence and to be treated as adults when they turn 14 or 15 years.An area should be set aside in every parish and town where young people can meet their friends and feel safe. They could be supervised by youth workers who will know whether they are behaving responsibly. Young people use places like Supermacs in Carrickmacross to congregate and they are not supervised. However, while many of them want to participate in society and enjoy themselves, they do not have a forum in which to do so.Bullying and suicide are also significant issues among young people. I mentioned the guy who was hitting another guy around the head while hurling abuse at some girls in Carrickmacross recently. Suicide is discussed regularly, but there is no place for a young male to go to talk about his problems. A young person who is in trouble or in dire straits will not go to his or her parents all the time and if he or she feels trapped, he or she may express himself or herself in a pub or at a disco where he or she experiences peer pressure to drink.That is the reason new outlets must be created for young people to express themselves. The Minister should travel to County Donegal to meet the representatives of the youth councils who will discuss the issues which are important to them such as transportation and bullying. They do not mention drink as a problem and say they are reacting to the lack of trust and confidence in them on the part of adults and the lack of responsibility they feel. The issue should be turned on its head and we should stop looking for scapegoats.I disagree with my colleague, Senator Higgins, who blamed parents for these problems. While I do not have a child, I would find it difficult to be a parent in this day and age. I do not blame parents because their children are out and about. It is not possible to know where they are all the time because they have a little independence. I agree, however, that drinks companies must take responsibility and legislation must be enforced.We are reacting to the problem in this debate. Young people seek space and want to be trusted, but we do not respect them. When I was speaking to a Portuguese man earlier, I asked him about drinking patterns in his country. He said the Portuguese were not like the Irish and that we were all drunkards. While he was joking, he pointed out there were outlets for young people in Portugal. There are societies and sports clubs in the United States, for example, in which young people can participate, but we do not provide for young people in Ireland.Any Government worth its salt would appoint a Minister for youth and separate the office from the formal education system. A Minister for youth could examine all the non-formal aspects of a young person's development and address issues such as bullying, date rape, depression and suicide. This proposal must be taken seriously.

Teenagers are forced to be independent and cannot cope. They are given mobile telephones and significant amounts in pocket money when the one thing they crave is security. We are shirking our responsibility by making them live the lives of adults, even though they are not mature or skilled enough to handle various situations in which they find themselves.Certain children try to attract attention to themselves by consuming large amounts of alcohol. Their lives are damaged by parents who will not say "No" or "Stop". They are allowed out of their houses and feel they can do what they like. Our children will not thank us for the excessive freedom we have given them. I know many young people who believe their friends are the most important part of their lives, but their friends are just as inexperienced as them and they lead each other along. It is high time communities recognised what is happening and looked out for both our youth and elderly people.Society accepts unsociable behaviour because no one will stand up. However, parents should be the first to stand up. Neighbours and friends must not be afraid to bring problems relating to their children to the attention of parents who, in turn, must accept the concern expressed to them by members of their community. This breakdown in parental control forces the Garda into a position in which it does not want to be. Gardaí want to be part of the community. They want to prevent crime and steer people in the right direction. This cannot happen if parents do not play their part. The problem should be addressed in the home and should not end up in the Garda station. Control is not a restriction, it is a safe way of allowing our children to grow up. Why can we not practise it more? Our children will inherit the world we create for them.

She is a very affable individual and I enjoy being her colleague.Alcopops are alcoholic versions of soft drinks normally associated with children. They are also known as FFABs, fruit flavoured alcoholic beverages. They arrived first in the UK in the form of alcoholic lemonade, but they are now being marketed in most countries – including Belgium, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Italy, Portugal, Spain, Sweden and Ireland – in Europe. Designer drinks are mainly wine based or spirit based, but some of them contain ciders. They are normally considered stronger than alcopops but, like alcopops, they are sold in trendy bottles and given names thought likely to appeal to children and teenagers.Both types of drinks have caused much controversy and have come under sustained attack, not only from alcohol control groups but also from politicians, educationalists, the police, the media and some alcohol retailers, for encouraging underage drinking and alcohol abuse. In Scotland, for example, 4,000 alcohol retailers refuse to stock alcopops. Perhaps we have reached the stage where voluntary restraint is needed in this country. We have seen what it is possible to achieve in terms of introducing legislation from the considerable success of smoke-free zones and the penalty points system for traffic offences. Voluntary restraint should be the first thing we look at in this regard.In Italy, as in the UK, the tax on alcopops has been increased as a disincentive to young drinkers. In Sweden, the state alcohol monopoly refused to stock such drinks at first but was forced to retract its decision as it was in breach of European Union rules on the free market. I was pleased with the decision of the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, last week. I was also glad to read that he would have preferred to raise duty on so-called alcopops by even more than 35 cent per bottle. He was precluded from doing so by law.Anyone on the streets of Dublin, of my home town of Thurles or of any provincial town or city will notice the hordes of drunken people at weekends. Violent crime is on the increase and it seems to be linked to alcohol consumption. What was interesting in the recent "Prime Time" debate on teenage drinking was that very few young people were able to give concrete suggestions on how to tackle the problem. It is definitely a problem because the emergency and counselling services seem to be overrun with the fallout from this disastrous love affair with alcohol.People will have to start taking responsibility for their actions. Our society has a dangerous passion for alcohol, which is deeply rooted in our collective psyche. Other countries have longer opening hours and cheaper alcohol, but there does not seem to be the same level of alcohol consumption among their citizens. In this country, the pub is the bedrock of the social scene and therein may lie the problem. If Santa Claus visits a rural village, he uses the local pub as a base even if there are five halls are available.We have to face this problem as a nation and consider how we treat alcohol. I am not suggesting that the winners of the county final should go back to the pub for tea and sandwiches. We love chat, craic and the informality and friendliness of the pub scene, but we must strike a balance. The pub scene often leads to long boozing sessions which result in somebody getting drunk or, worse, becoming aggressive.What I like about pubs is the sociable atmosphere. One can settle down for an alcoholic drink or mineral and have an amiable conversation. This has become increasingly difficult in Dublin city centre with the advent of the massive trendy pubs that charge outrageous sums of money and pump out loud, intrusive music in order that people will drink more. This goes against the essential character of Irish drinking houses and we are being pushed into binge drinking. Relatively speaking, Ireland, as a society, is a teenager; it suddenly got a job, started making good money and, buoyed up by previously unknown economic spending power, went over the top with drink. This problem is part of the country's growing-up process. I hope that things will improve as maturity settles in.What makes us Irish? What gives us our identity? Where do we fit in the modern multiracial, multireligious and multicultural world? The answers to these questions should not revolve around excessive drinking.I pay tribute to the very many responsible vintners throughout the country. Unfortunately, there are a few black sheep who think that the only criterion for selling drink is that the customer be tall enough to put money on the counter.
#SheilaTerry	unknown-#SheilaTerry-party	unknown-#SheilaTerry-dob	unknown-#SheilaTerry-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	183	I welcome the Minister. He has been here frequently and is paying much attention to us.The subject with which we are dealing is of great concern to everyone. It is certainly of great concern to me because I am particularly concerned about our young people and their future. There will be a serious alcohol problem in the country in a few years. How will we deal with it? If we do not deal with it as a matter of urgency, it will, as has been the case to date, get worse.Irish teenagers are among the highest ranking in Europe in terms of alcohol consumption. This is not a statistic about which we should boast. What effect is it having on their lives? Last week's "Prime Time" programme showed how alcohol is affecting them and how it can result in their getting involved in assaults of various kinds or reaching such a state of drunkenness that they end up in hospital. Alcohol misuse can lead to suicide and also to unwanted pregnancies.Apart from the damage being done to young people, the cost the State will incur in terms of treating their alcoholism and treating those who are hospitalised will be considerable. One in four people arriving in accident and emergency units is there as a result of an injury or an attack due to alcohol.I will not mention many of the criminal offences relating to this problem because other Senators have already done so. These offences pose a serious problem for everyone. We are not tackling the problem or treating it as a serious issue. Perhaps we all ignored it when we were concentrating on drugs as the most serious issue. I am not trying to minimise the damage hard drugs do, but we have forgotten the problems that arise because of alcohol abuse. I would like the Government to tackle the drink problem in the same way it is continuing to tackle the drugs and tobacco problems.We have done very well in trying to raise the awareness of the damage tobacco can do. That has worked for a large group of people. Unfortunately, younger people still smoke but many people in the 30 to 40 age group have heeded the warnings and have given up. If we could apply the same warnings to alcohol, we could send a message to our young people to avoid abusing the drugs available to them.There must also be far greater law enforcement. The Garda must tackle misbehaviour on the streets. If people are drunk, causing trouble and a danger to themselves and others, they should be picked up by the Garda and prosecuted. They must be held responsible for their behaviour. We cannot ignore the problem.People have a huge responsibility. Any parent who ignores the fact that his or her children go out at night with a lot of money knowing they will spend it on drink is behaving irresponsibly. As a mother of four sons, I know that parents are under huge pressure. I also know what it is like to try to control children and their spending. Many parents are unaware of what their children are doing. They do not see them returning home under the influence of drink.Many school principals testify that alcohol is a huge problem in schools. Secondary schoolchildren work and spend their money on drink. In many schools Mondays are impossible because children do not attend or if they do, many still suffer from hangovers. The serious problem of too many children working too many hours during the school week must be addressed.Publicans have a huge responsibility in this area. On the radio this morning a gentleman said they took their job responsibly and would not serve drink to those who had consumed too much. However, it is too easy for young people to ask others to get them a drink. They are also clever in getting older friends or siblings to procure drink for them in off-licences which should have their names imprinted on cans and the bags used to carry drink they sell to children. It would be a means of tracing back drink procured by children.Young people should be required to present identity cards in pubs. This works well in the United States where the rules are strictly enforced. The same rules should apply here.Promotions involving free drinks should not be allowed. From what my son has told me it is clear many students only join societies to avail of the free drinks available at parties. There are many ways to tackle the amount of drink made available to young people, much of which is provided free to encourage them to drink even more.The association between sport and alcohol must be addressed. Nowadays, unfortunately, too many young people are spectators rather than participants in sporting activities. As such, they associate with the drink companies which advertise sports. There has been a failure, especially at a time when more money is available, to provide sports facilities in communities to get young people involved. In my area young people who participate in sport generally do not drink as much. For example, because they may be involved in a match on a Saturday or Sunday morning they are more careful about their drinking at weekends. We must get children involved in sport at a young age. It would be a good lifestyle for them and take them away from the serious drinking in which, unfortunately, so many are becoming involved.

Even more significant is the number of Senators who have offered to speak. No doubt one of the reasons for this is the "Prime Time" television programme we all watched. It was shocking, especially the depiction of the number of young females – someone's sister, wife or daughter – brought to hospitals, lying on the floor unconscious. It says something about us as a community that we had to wait for a television programme to tell us of the extent of the problem. I have no doubt we knew of the problem, yet we did not want to speak about or highlight it, nor to admit that there was a problem.People are seeking solutions. There is no point in attempting to apportion blame in one direction, because if we do so, we become sectional and possibly dilute any good we do as legislators or leaders. We can have all the legislation and constraints we wish, much of which is needed, but we must get back to fundamentals as to the reason society has developed in this way. I know that even to talk in this way will mean others accusing one of being old fashioned, of not living in the present and pursuing an ideological or religious agenda that is no longer relevant. However, the longer we do this the longer we delay the possibility of resolving the present difficulties.We talk of giving independence to young people. There is no independence in a 12 or 13 year old out of their mind from alcohol. It is, rather, a case of dependence on alcohol, peer friendship and acceptance by society by following others. We must first get right the use of terminology. There is no independence in ruining a young person's life. Anybody aware of the development of young people who start using alcohol over a period of five or six years will know that, by and large, they seldom master it. Those of a more advanced age possibly have a better chance of being moderate in their approach to drinking, only engaging in it socially. However, that opportunity does not present itself to young people because they lack maturity. That is the reason it is important for this Legislature to talk about fundamentals, even while disagreeing.In recent times, radio and television programmes have often touted some type of liberal approach to life. I heard two very fine people on "Today with Pat Kenny" yesterday pointing out what has happened to Ireland, as a society, as a result of the abuse of alcohol. They had all the statistics and they were idealistic in the manner in which they made their presentation. I do not wish to criticise Pat Kenny because he was acting as a facilitator and compere on the show. The arguments he was putting forward suggested to me that the young children are setting the agenda for the parents.I listened to Marian Finucane's programme this morning. Her two guests were Brenda Power, who tends to talk a great deal of sense, and Emily O'Reilly, who was also talking a lot of sense this morning. They were discussing Christmas gifts and what it is children enjoy about Christmas. They both made the same point, namely, that we must go back to the drawing board because we have got it wrong. Marian Finucane summed it up by suggesting that there was an absence of spirituality at Christmas. These three very wise people have come to the conclusion that we have squeezed spirituality out of Christmas and we have put in its place the need to buy gifts costing €100 or pay €3,500 for trips to Lapland. None of these bring any great sense of contentment to young people.If we transpose what was stated on the radio to the subject we are debating here, the same rule applies. If we do not have values and a sense of spirituality and if we do not have a conscience, then we will be victims of every promotion – whether it is sponsored by a syndicate, a brewery or whatever else – that comes our way. We must be prepared to discuss the problem, but not in a jocose way. Irish comedians tell more jokes about drunkards than about any other subject. We all laugh when we see them being impersonated on stage and we think it is funny. However, there is not a person in the Chamber who has not walked down the streets of their town and seen a misfortunate wino sitting on the road who has no future and is seen as being no different to a sack of refuse awaiting collection. We must stop making excuses and clouding the issue.It is very easy to lay the blame. Let us look at what young children must contend with. Those of us who grew up in less affluent times do not realise how lucky we were. Both our parents were not out working, we could come home in the afternoon and there was someone at home to talk to. Children come home from school now and there is nobody there. They go out with their friends, who are all of a similar age, and there is nobody to provide them with an anchor in life.Religion was another anchor. It is very easy to pick out the black sheep among the clergy and they form a tiny percentage. It is terribly wrong to tar every priest, brother or nun with the same brush. We have undermined the church. I am not condoning any of the things for which it was responsible, but we have done damage to ourselves as a society by undermining all those structures which existed. Members of the clergy may have had failings, but we were taught what was right and wrong. We did not always do what was right, but at least there was a marker there. That authority is gone.Teachers who gave their talents and their time – very often outside of school hours – have become a target. These people who were pillars of society have, in some ways, been taken out of the equation.Some gardaí have stepped out of line and what happened? The whole force has been attacked. These are the people who have maintained our peace and security. They came between us and violence and anarchy and now they are taken out of the equation. There is very little left.While I do not wish to criticise the media in general, there are sections of it that have a lot to answer for. Good news is no longer news; bad news is headline material. Various parts of the very section of corporate society that could have done something for us – the media – are competing with each other for sensational headlines and they often ruin people's reputations the process. However, I acknowledge that there are some very good and responsible journalists.There is only one way to tackle this problem and that is with a task force comprising media interests, parents, publicans, etc. I participated in debates on this matter on two occasions during the lifetime of the previous Seanad. I do not know for how long I will be a Member of this Seanad, but if we are still here in three or four years we will be obliged to return this debate. We are not prepared to look at the fundamental issues involved. If there is a genuine partnership of concern, we can bring about some solution.

#JohnPaulPhelan	unknown-#JohnPaulPhelan-party	unknown-#JohnPaulPhelan-dob	unknown-#JohnPaulPhelan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	186	I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Browne. I was somewhat surprised that this item was given the heading "Statements on the high level of alcohol consumption by young people" on the Order Paper. I believe that alcohol consumption is a problem for all members of society. While it is manifest among younger people, the fundamental problem of alcohol consumption affects all age groups. A more appropriate heading would have been achieved if all the words after "alcohol consumption" were deleted, because the problem is alcohol consumption.As the Acting Chairman stated, I am here to give the view from the coalface. Alcohol is seen as a social lubricant. Senator Ó Murchú is correct when he says that in order to be part of the gang and to be accepted by one's peers one must do what they do. From a young person's point of view, I believe that is the problem we face with alcohol.There have been a number of attempts by successive Governments to tackle the problem of the abuse of alcohol by younger people. It has been discussed in schools, but there is evidence to suggest that much of what is said is disregarded by younger people once the teacher has left the classroom.Last week there was a debate in the House after the introduction of the budget. A number of Senators expressed their delight at the increase of 35 cent in the price of alcopops, as if this would have an effect in terms of reducing the problem of alcohol abuse among young people. Nothing could be further from the truth. When one enters into a nightclub, one pays one price for a drink before midnight and another – it rises by €1 or €2 – after midnight. An increase of 35 cent in the price of alcopops will have no effect whatsoever on the consumption of these products by younger people. The Government should seriously examine the issue of banning alcopops completely. As a younger person, I know that many of my friends and I would not check the change we get from the bartender after buying a round of drinks.When people were starting to drink alcohol for the first time 20 or 30 years ago, or even more recently, alcopops did not exist and the traditional spirits and beers which were available were harder to drink. The taste of alcopops, which is similar to that of minerals or soft drinks, makes it easy for people to drink large quantities of them. If it is serious about this matter, the Department must look at the possible outright banning of alcopops.We must also look at another measure in the area of alcohol consumption which was taken by the previous Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform. I refer here to the extension of pub opening hours. There was no clamour from any sector of society to extend pub opening hours, but the then Minister proceeded to do so and, as a result, made alcohol even more widely available. The Government should consider making a U-turn on the extension of pub opening hours. There was no great desire among the general public to see the opening hours change and the Government should reconsider the issue.I read a recent publication by the Association for Health Promotion which stated that the key to any solution to the problems with alcohol would involve controlling access to and the availability of the product. If we are to look seriously at resolving the problem, we must consider both the availablity of alcohol and the possibility of overturning the decision to extend opening hours. We must also consider the licensing laws in general, the rise of superpubs in most urban areas and the gradual demise of smaller local pubs in many towns, cities and rural areas. That is an issue at which the Government must look.When I was researching this topic, I found that the Australian Government has put in place a very innovative solution. It charges a lower excise tax rate on low alcohol beers, which is something to which the Government should give consideration.I am particularly interested in the issue of national identification cards, which is important in the context of the general debate. I do not doubt that there should be a national ID card. However, it should not be only for younger people; it should be for everyone. Everybody in the State already has a PPS card. It would not take much to put a photograph and a few more pieces of information on that card and make it into an national identification card. This should be done immediately.Although the vast majority of publicans enforce the licensing laws, there are a number of publicans who do not do so. We need to permanently remove licences from people who are proven to have not enforced the licensing laws. I did not agree with everything Senator Ó Murchú said, but he was right when he spoke about the attitude towards alcohol and drunkenness that exists in this country. People's attitude to alcohol is far too lax and it needs to be somewhat strengthened.Although I know Senator Ó Murchú was not trying to talk down to people, young people must be involved somehow in the process. There is nothing worse for a younger person than looking at a crowd of middle-aged men and women who appear to be trying to dictate the way one should live one's life. If younger people are going to live up to the new rules which will be put in place, they must be involved in the process. There is a danger that we will be seen to be talking down to younger people.We need to encourage younger people to take responsibility for their actions. We need to ensure that the Garda and other State authorities enforce the laws that already exist. We need to reverse the decision that was made regarding the licensing laws and we need to involve younger people in the process of trying to find some solution to the problem of excessive drinking among their number.

I welcome the open nature of this debate, which is a sort of brain-storming session.We are discussing a serious social problem which involves people's spending power, peer pressure and the perennial teenage desire to demonstrate one's adulthood at an ever earlier age. As everyone knows, the law is routinely flouted, with long-term, and sometimes short-term, consequences for health, education and law and order. That is as true for those who have just passed the age of 18 as for those who have not yet reached it.I am afraid, for better or worse, that the authoritarian culture of the past is gone and young people must be taught responsibility. One of the best ways parents and others can do this is by setting an example of moderate drinking. I am of the view that any serious business one undertakes, including driving, is not compatible with anything more than a very moderate intake of alcohol. Not many Members would like to face Vincent Browne, for example, having had several pints.I have always believed that the saying – it is one of my favourite quotations and I do not mind if I receive a Falstaffian response in respect of it –"Ireland sober is Ireland free" has a great ring to it. I was horrified at the suggestion of my dear friend and former colleague Anthony Cronin that the city fathers should remove the statue of Father Mathew from O'Connell Street. This would be a posthumous poetic triumph for the literary generation of Patrick Kavanagh, Flann O'Brien and Brendan Behan, but it would be a terrible symbolic surrender to the drinking culture. I refer here to that culture in the sociological, rather than the artistic, sense.Obviously we need to encourage alternative forms of socialising, entertainment and sport. There needs to be more in the way of health promotion. Most of the health promotion relating to alcohol is to do with dangerous driving, but a broader approach must be taken. I would wish to see an emphasis on the longer-term damage young people can do to themselves through excessive drinking. I am sure we are storing up serious problems for the future.I am not convinced about a ban on advertising because a great deal of this involves promoting the merits of one drink as opposed to another. We have tax incentives based upon the amount of horse power in one's car. There is a much heavier tax if one's car engine is over 1,900 cc and so on. There is merit in the suggestion of a tax gradation on drinks. Even at the cost of revenue to the Exchequer, the tax on soft drinks should be lowered. A Garda identity card would obviously be important but that depends on enforcement.Changes in social habits can be achieved. We have seen this autumn the dramatic effect of the penalty points system. We might have said that plastic bags were part of our culture, but we have managed to change that. We can adjust to many things if the will exists. The licensing laws need to be looked at. Licences, particularly those in Dublin, are rather restricted. This leads to enormous crowds of people in bars who have no room to move and this, in turn, contributes to greater aggression. It may sound paradoxical, but there may be a case for liberalising the licensing laws. I am not saying it never happens, but one rarely hears of big fights outside pubs in small villages because there is adequate space and a more congenial atmosphere. I agree with the previous speaker that the licensing laws should be reviewed with a view to fine-tuning them.
#DrMauriceHayes	unknown-#DrMauriceHayes-party	unknown-#DrMauriceHayes-dob	unknown-#DrMauriceHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	188	I agree with most of what the previous three speakers said, although I would not want to follow Senator Ó Murchú down every cul-de-sac he presented to us. I agree that this is a cultural issue and a matter of social change with which we must try to grapple. There is no point in dumping on young people, this is a problem for society. What is happening, as Senator Mansergh said, is that childhood and adolescence is being compressed and that people are becoming adults more quickly. What they are doing is trying to be like adults. They want to do what they see adults doing. We cannot achieve progress unless we can effect some change in the values of society as a whole.The other morning I was sitting with a group of solid businessmen who had been to a dinner the night before. Each of them came arrived at the table and sort of boasted about their hangovers, their sore heads, etc. A subtle sense of values is transmitted through what people say. Young people go to drinking establishments because that is where the "buzz" is. Rather than condemning that we should be trying to think of what alternative buzz we can offer. Does it have to be through alcohol and the pub or are there other ways? I saw a programme recently about how former Kilkenny hurler Eddie Keher was developing this type of thinking. We should support efforts in that regard.Another frightening matter is the purchasing power that young people have at present. Advertising and drinks firms are concentrating on that. I do not entirely agree with Senator Mansergh that advertising simply extols the virtues of one brand over another. Cigarette manufacturers have been spreading that hairy yarn for years and none of us believe them.Worst of all is the sponsorship of sporting occasions. I find it a crisis of conscience to have to go into the Guinness All-Ireland Hurling Final. It is appalling. I happen to be trustee of a GAA club, and not Rostrevor, a matter to which a former Member of the House previously took exception. I was approached by members of the club last week and informed that they were seeking a change in the deed of arrangements so that they could accept a large subvention from a drinks firm. They are not doing that for nothing. This is one area on which we could ask people to concentrate. There should be no association between sport and alcohol and no aggressive advertising of such a connection.We also need to deal with this issue on a health and educational front and encourage young people to think of the danger to their bodies. They are taking a drug that is addictive and, in may cases, quite destructive. It is a very difficult proposition to interest young people in what is going to happen to them in 40 years. The distance between gratification and retribution is great and this creates a problem for almost every health and educational programme. Nevertheless, we need to involve society as a whole in the educational process. As other Senators stated, we need to engage young people and involve them in the process. There is no point in talking down to or lecturing them.There is a great deal to be said for exploring the way in which people socialise, what brings them together and what gives them a buzz. If that is alcohol, we must explore whether that can be dealt with in a sensible and moderate way and whether there can be alternatives to it. It is through this process, more than through denunciation or absolute prohibition, that we will perhaps help to deal with this problem.
#EamonScanlon	unknown-#EamonScanlon-party	unknown-#EamonScanlon-dob	unknown-#EamonScanlon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	189	There has been much discussion in recent weeks about the chronic alcohol problem this country is facing. However, precious few solutions have been offered. Scanning the newspapers or listening to local radio in my area, the north-west, one would believe that all crime is drink related. Practically every court case we read about or hear about on local radio involves a drink related incident.Ireland had the highest increase in alcohol consumption according to the interim report of the strategic task force on alcohol, which was published last May. Between 1989 and 1999, alcohol consumption per capita in Ireland increased by 41%, while in ten other EU states there was a decrease. In 2000, pure alcohol consumption per capita in Ireland reached 14.2 litres, compared to an EU average of only 9.1 litres. In the last six years, the consumption of spirits alone has increased by over 50%. There has been a staggering increase of 100% in the consumption of cider. The increase in the consumption of spirits is apparently due to the new designer alcopops, which are targeted at the young adult market.These drinks should be banned completely because young people can drink them without even knowing they are drinking alcohol. That is very unfortunate and is causing serious problems. The abuse of alcohol by young people should also be a focus of concern for parents. Heavy fines should be imposed on older people who purchase alcohol for people under 18 in pubs and off-licences. The purchase of alcohol by adults on behalf of young people is irresponsible and damaging behaviour which should be made unacceptable in our society. The crisis level of alcohol consumption has resulted in increasing numbers of children of school-going age developing behavioural problems which endanger their health, education and future and inflict stress and hardship on their parents and families.The adverse effects of alcohol abuse are not confined; they affect the entire population. The areas particularly affected are the accident and emergency services, in-patient and out-patient care and the ambulance service. Binge drinking has the greatest effect on general hospital services and accounts for many admissions to accident and emergency units, particularly on weekend nights. The incidence of binge or recurrent heavy drinking is increasing, particularly among the young. It imposes a heavy burden on hospital services which is difficult to quantify in terms of cost and the availability of limited health care. Many of these patients are admitted for observation or treatment, not only because of injury but also because of the adverse effects of excess alcohol on the liver, heart, brain and other organs.Binge drinking also adds greatly to the cost of the ambulance service because of the large number of weekend night admissions with acute alcohol problems. It places a serious burden on hospital services, contributes to the waiting list for elective medical and surgical treatment and occupies hospital staff in a disproportionate amount of work. The effects of binge and heavy drinking on the health services should be seen against the wider background of the effects of alcohol abuse on society. These include accidents, drownings, violence, crime, poverty, poor health, mental illness, family disintegration, unemployment, intimidation and a reluctance to walk the streets in certain areas.The adverse effects of alcohol abuse are not confined to drinkers and their families, but affect the population at large. We are too permissive about alcohol abuse. The Government and local authorities, the professions, industry and the commercial sector, sporting organisations and the media are all culpable in this attitude. However, these institutions are simply reflecting the attitudes of the public in general. We need a more mature approach to this issue. We need an effective public education programme, aimed particularly at older children and young adults, which will not demonise alcohol but teach them to understand its benefits in a mature and affluent society.Drinking in public places, such as streets and parks, should be forbidden. Better control of advertising and inspection of nightclubs must be considered. Great improvements could be made in these areas. Plain clothes gardaí should visit these discos and nightclubs. The law provides that young people should not be served alcohol but they are. Nobody seems to know how they are obtaining drink. There is a function in that regard for the Garda, which could take a more proactive role.
#MauriceCummins	unknown-#MauriceCummins-party	unknown-#MauriceCummins-dob	unknown-#MauriceCummins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	190	The abuse of alcohol is one of the most serious challenges facing society at present. The "Prime Time" programme brought this problem into the living rooms of houses in middle and upper class areas throughout the country and showed what is happening in the streets of our towns and cities. People knew and accepted that the problem existed in the streets of Dublin but they were not aware it was so bad in the small and large towns throughout Ireland. The programme really confronted them with the drinks culture and the devastation that has resulted from the abuse of alcohol.I have listened carefully to the debate and the fact that so many Members have contributed so eloquently to it demonstrates the concern that exists. We are addressing the concerns of our constituents and neighbours in contributing to this debate. Something will have to be done and it must involve all the agencies concerned. We do not need another committee to sit for months or years to solve it. People involved in the drinks industry, the health sector, the Garda Síochána and the emergency services must be brought together to advise us, the legislators, on what to do so solve this problem.I have nothing but praise for the Garda. The television programme clearly showed what its members have to endure in the streets at 2 a.m. and 3 a.m. when drunken blackguards come out looking for a fight. The violent behaviour in our streets at that hour of the night is absolutely appalling. While we are sleeping, gardaí are dealing with these thugs. There is no question that the Garda Síochána requires additional resources, particularly in the towns and cities. It is frightening to realise how small is the number of gardaí available to deal with these problems at night. Additional gardaí have to be called out to deal with violent incidents. There are not enough gardaí on duty at night.Senator Bohan mentioned identity cards. This issue is raised every year. Why do we not have an identity card system? Why have the cards not been issued? Who is objecting to them and what is the problem with having such cards? A standard identity card will not solve the problem, but it might help. There should be an analysis of how much the abuse of alcohol is costing the health service and the accident and emergency services and of the pressure it puts on personnel in accident and emergency units. Dealing with the ravages of alcohol abuse must be costing the country a fortune. There is also the cost of security and cleaning up the mess created when pubs and clubs close.The drinks industry is a powerful lobby and it must accept responsibility. Its members know there are bad eggs in the industry; there are bad eggs in every system. However, it is up to the industry to expose the members who are serving alcohol to underage people and to deal with the off-licences who sell drink to young people and the adults who buy it for them. Young people obviously have more money to spend than ever, which is probably the reason they can go out and get stoned at weekends.

The Government amendment is predictable, but it is also unfortunate and unworthy. I draw the House's attention to the election promises of both Government parties. Fianna Fáil's promise stated: "We will continue our policy of implementing significant increases in direct school funding." That should be noted, as in reality there was a reduction. It also stated: "We will build on the unprecedented investment we have made in school buildings to ensure every school attains modern standards within five years." The Progressive Democrats' promise stated: "We will ensure that every primary school reaches and is maintained at an acceptable, explicit national standard within three years [there is a fair bit of outbidding there] and that the primary school building capital budget will be increased to over 200 million within three years."With what have we been presented? Cuts. It is strange that out of the Government's education budget only €147 million is allocated to primary school improvements. We can dress that up any way we please, but that is why I find it difficult to stomach the Government amendment. I am not sure the Minister of State would have been party to such an amendment.There is a 4% reduction in the Estimates which, allowing for building inflation, is a 10% cutback in real terms. Building in almost 400 primary schools has been frozen as a result of these cutbacks. Those schools were listed in a survey in The Irish Times last week and 40 of them are in County Galway. The Department announced on 4 April 2001 that funding was in place for 30 schools nationally for work from the architectural planning stage. On 5 November 2002 work on only 17 of those schools had advanced to any degree. Who is telling lies or being deceitful? The figures do not add up.For example, when Deputy Donie Cassidy was still a Senator, he announced in Coralstown national school, Kinnegad, with the co-operation of the then Minister, Deputy Woods—

A deputation, headed by the then Senator, visited the then Minister's clinic and the good news was announced in a blaze of glory afterwards. It is strange that this school is not among the 17 in respect of which progress has been made. How can boards of management, parents and pupils in the other 398 schools in need believe anything that emanates from either the Minister or the Department?I hope a new beginning can be made and that when the current Minister says he wants to see transparency, we will see transparency. We should have no fudging or dressing up in the lead-in to an election; we should get definitive answers. In the past five years Opposition Members in this House and in the Dáil asked the Minister to tell boards of management what progress could realistically be achieved by schools in need.The INTO has identified 78 schools as unfit for habitation, stating that staff and pupils in those schools were under threat from unhygienic, damp conditions, overcrowding and, in some cases, rat infestations or worse. That is the reality. A school in my constituency received promises which have come to nothing. I am talking about Moyglass national school where nothing has happened despite a firm undertaking in writing from the Minister's office that this school had been given the go-ahead and work could commence immediately. Some 40 schools in County Galway – the second highest population centre after Dublin – are in urgent need of attention.With regard to the schools listed during the term of the previous Government, the findings of a further survey carried out by the INTO are a damning indictment of inactivity during the past five years when times were prosperous and work could have been done. The then Minister, Deputy Woods – I said this to him in his presence – did nothing and allowed those schools to deteriorate even further, a process that will probably continue in the immediate future.Of the 75 schools surveyed, 66% had inadequate toilet facilities – many of them have outdoor toilets – 50% have inadequate handwashing or drying facilities, 40% do not have adequate heating, 43% either have no drinking water or have water that is unfit for human consumption, 47% have rotten windows and doors, 71% have an inadequate or unsafe schoolyard and most do not have the basic facilities of a general purpose room, a principal's office, a staff room or a room where extra tuition can be given to support disadvantaged children. Teachers supporting the disadvantaged are teaching in corridors.We are supposed to be one of the richest countries in Europe, but we have Third World conditions in some of our primary schools. Are these conditions considered to provide equality for all our children? I ask the Minister of State to ensure that somebody brings forward a plan to address this position. The Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Dempsey, promised a modernisation plan five years down the road with a reduced budget. I demand that the Department of Education and Science give a realistic estimate of the time it will take to complete these projects. We must prioritise them if necessary. The projects must be completed and those concerned should be assured that their needs will not be ignored.A sore point is that some schools can jump the queue in terms of being granted project approval. Some schools are put at the top of the list on making an application. Parents groups and school management boards who gathered shillings and pence to fund such projects have noted other schools jump the queue in terms of being granted approval for projects. That position cannot be allowed to continue except in an emergency.Why is asbestos still leaking from roofs in some of our schools? Ballymana national school outside Loughrea is one of the schools listed. Why has the problem of overcrowding in a school, where teachers and pupils have to work in a converted cloakroom off an adjoining toilet, not been addressed?I ask the Minister of State to ensure in fairness to the children concerned that the position which has prevailed for the past five or six years, and which will be accentuated in the next year or two, will not be allowed to continue. Thousands of children are in school in cold conditions and are hungry, but the Government pays no heed to addressing their needs. The Minister of State is a responsible person and she has a responsibility to change the position. This must be done.
#BrianHayes	unknown-#BrianHayes-party	unknown-#BrianHayes-dob	unknown-#BrianHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	201	It gives me great pleasure to second this motion on behalf of my colleagues in the Fine Gael group. I commend Senator Burke on publishing this motion on behalf of our party and putting the case eloquently to the House. I welcome the Minister of State at the Department of Education and Science, Deputy de Valera, to the House. She is a capable Minister and I wish her well in the Department. She has a capacity to get through the bureaucracy and sort out problems. I hope this is the issue which she will devote her time to sorting out in the coming years.This is the most important issue to be debated in Private Members' time for one straightforward reason. If ever lies were told, people having been told given assurances before the last election, it must be in the area of primary school buildings. We all accept that there has been a substantial increase in funding in all sectors of education over the past five to ten years, and that is welcome. The primary school sector must be given priority, primarily because all children have an opportunity to go to school.Lies were told in a myriad of constituencies in advance of the general election and communities were told that certain schools would be sorted out in the context of decisions that were made. The Minister of State at the Department of Education and Science, Deputy de Valera, and the Minister, Deputy Dempsey, must defend the gross deception that was perpetrated on these communities by the former Minister, Deputy Woods, who, in the most gratuitous and offensive way, tried to buy votes on the back of promises made that cannot now be fulfilled. That is why this motion has been tabled. It highlights the deception, lies and the con job perpetrated on the people in advance of the general election. This was done in the most vulnerable communities who need a decent standard of education. This deception must be highlighted.Six weeks prior to the general election the number of school projects put on the architectural planning list increased enormously to 400 – the number prior to then was less than 100. Communities in the 42 Dáil constituencies were told they would get the projects they demanded because a general election was taking place. I come from a parish in Tallaght where two of the Minister of State's colleagues, who are Deputies in a party that supports the Government, went around 1,700 houses and told the people ten days in advance of the election that the refurbishment programme which a school had been seeking for ten years would be delivered. Those people in my parish have been on the streets since the election because of the lies that were told. The spoof and con tricks have been exposed because there is no money available to provide for such school projects.The Minister of State must take responsibility for this on behalf of the previous Minister, Deputy Woods, who made these commitments to aspiring Deputies in the 42 Dáil consitutentices. As Senator Ulick Burke correctly pointed out, this is not an isolated case. This happened in a systematic political campaign where the most marginal constituencies were highlighted by the former Government as the constituencies to be delivered on in terms of the refurbishment programme. We are left in the appalling position where those of us on this side of the House must highlight the deception that took place and urge the Government to proceed in terms of delivering the best possible programme for these schools. What is the way forward? In terms of the new economic circumstances the Government faces, it is time that, once and for all, we should deal with the 400 schools on that list.If that means using some of the proceeds of the national lottery to complete the refurbishment programme, let us do so. We did it before, as the Minister of State knows, between 1987 and 1989 when some of the proceeds of the national lottery were invested in the health services. The Government should invest part of the proceeds of the national lottery in education so that the refurbishment of schools can be completed. This has been an ongoing matter of contention between the Government and the people. I would support such a move and would like to hear the Minister of State's view on it.The amendment to the motion states that the Government wants to advance what is described as public private partnership projects in primary school areas as speedily as possible. What is meant by that? I am not aware to date of examples where schools have been built with private sector funding. I would not oppose it on any ideological basis, and there may be one case.If so, let us see it. I am not aware of any example in the primary school sector. I would like to see the refurbishment of schools advanced as speedily as possible. Delivering this for the 400 schools on the list will take a huge amount of revenue over the next few years.As a result of the deception of the people and the lies told by the Department of Education and Science through the Minister in the general election, there is a case for removing responsibility for school refurbishment and expansion from the Department. People no longer believe the Government because of its spoofing in advance of the election. There is a political as well as a public argument to be made for taking responsibility for this area from the Department of Education and Science and allocating it to an independent body which would monitor the 400 schools in question to ensure their refurbishment programmes are advanced over the next four years.This is an issue of huge concern in my community. More than ten days ago, we took to the streets in my parish because of the anger felt in the community. We will continue to do this until such time as our legitimate concerns our met. I appeal to the Minister of State to accept the substantive motion in the name of my colleagues to ensure that we deal with the accommodation needs of these 400 schools over the next three to four years.

Over the past 20 minutes we have listened to highly charged and emotive language, allegations of lies and other wild and, in many cases, unfounded allegations. I will do my best to resist and not respond in kind. I will deal briefly with the queue jumping syndrome to which Senator Ulick Burke referred. I am familiar with the plans the Minister and Minister of State have in place to deal with that effectively. I will also deal with the culture of publishing lists prior to elections, a culture which has prevailed over many decades and during the watches of successive Governments.

I am sure the Minister and the Government would love to divert massive resources to deal with the schools on the list, but it is a matter of making choices. I want to outline a few principles to the House, and the Opposition in particular, about making choices and prioritising.We must face a few unpalatable facts. It has been grudgingly acknowledged during the debate that overall funding of the Department of Education and Science has increased by 94% between 1997 and 2002, from €2.9 billion to €5.6 billion. It has practically doubled and that is a fact. Even with a global economic slowdown and the impact that has had on the economy, the Government has protected and sheltered education from some of its worst effects. There can be no doubt about the Government's commitment to the improvement of the school accommodation programme. The commitment will be delivered upon.

This has been one of the ongoing bones of contention for teachers. I know because I had 12 years of it when I taught in an inner city school. The funding has been almost doubled. No one can dispute that this is a spectacular expansion in the education capital programme and the primary capital programme in particular. The facts speak for themselves.The position of the Government is clear. It is determined, as demonstrated over the past five years, to continue the school building programme to meet new, growing and diverse needs—
#UlickBurke	unknown-#UlickBurke-party	unknown-#UlickBurke-dob	unknown-#UlickBurke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	216	Diverse is the word. There is no water nor are there proper toilets in some schools.

That determination is unflinching and I can give that commitment to the House.Notwithstanding that, it is acknowledged that there will be a slowdown in the rate of expansion of the building and refurbishment programmes over the coming year. We do not deny it. At the same time, the need for the refurbishment of existing accommodation is growing and we also acknowledge that. We do not deny the existence of lists in this regard.As for transparency, I hope I have the opportunity to outline the many initiatives taken by the Minister, the Minister of State and the Department to transform the culture which has been pervasive for decades and for which the party of the Senators opposite was equally culpable when in Government

The slowdown in the expansion of the schools building and refurbishment programme is due to economic factors. Reality must prevail and we must cut our cloth to suit our measure. Given our overall economic position, the Minister and the Department have done very well to bring forward a programme that is expansionist but at a slower rate.A number of Senators referred to the INTO list.

We accept that there is an increase in the number of schools on the list, but there is an historical reason for this which must be taken into account. It is easy to suggest that the capital programme for primary buildings should be raised to €250 million per annum for the next five years.

I thank God that, as a result of action on the part of this Government, the primary education sector moved away from Cinderella's world many years ago.Provision for many of the core initiatives to copperfasten and underpin the great programmes in primary education will be increased in the coming year.

#MauriceCummins	unknown-#MauriceCummins-party	unknown-#MauriceCummins-dob	unknown-#MauriceCummins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	228	I listened in awe to Senator Fitzgerald trying to defend the indefensible. To paraphrase a song from a Gilbert and Sullivan operetta, I have got them on the list. The following ten schools in Waterford are on the list to which I refer: Naomh Mhuire, Ballygunner; Scoil Lorcáin, in St. John's Park, Waterford; St. Paul's Junior School, Lisduggan; Gaelscoil Phort Láirge, Ballygunner; Ballyduff National School, Kilmeaden; Butlerstown School; Knockanore National School; Scoil na bhFiodh, Kilmacthomas; and Holy Cross School, Tramore.Money was promised like snuff at a wake prior to the general election. These are not allegations, but facts and realities. Fianna Fáil candidates visited these schools and stated that money would be available immediately. It is good to see members of the boards of management of these schools going on local radio and telling newspaper journalists about the false promises that were made and the false hope that was given to schoolchildren and their parents. They are being told that leaking roofs can be fixed, but for many years we have only had patchwork funding of primary schools.The budget may be more than €5 billion, but only €147 million is being spent on capital projects in primary schools. That is not sufficient and more money will have to be provided. However, the Government has decreased the amount of money available for capital projects in the budget. Despite the State's wealth, this is the way we treat our schoolchildren and the teachers who are trying to teach in substandard schools. I compliment the Minister for saying he will not tolerate queue jumping. He must honour that promise, but it will not be sufficient. He should not tolerate what is happening and should demand more money. A budget sets priorities. It is obvious that primary schoolchildren, their parents, teachers and the boards of management are not on the Government's priority list.I could say more, but I would only be repeating what my colleagues stated. The lack of money for primary schools is not a localised matter, it is one that affects the lives of people throughout the country. It is something the Government must tackle and the sooner the better. Pious platitudes will not solve the problems in our national schools.
#SiledeValera	unknown-#SiledeValera-party	unknown-#SiledeValera-dob	unknown-#SiledeValera-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	229	In asking the House to endorse the achievements of the Government in addressing the accommodation needs of primary schools, I assure Senators that the programme of capital investment in the primary sector will continue and that the allocation of €147 million for 2003 will enable us to consolidate the very considerable progress that has been made over the last several years. Admittedly, in view of current economic realities and the tightening of the financial position, the rate of progress in 2003 will be somewhat slower than we would have liked.Contrary to what has been said by the Opposition parties here and in the Dáil, neither the Minister, Deputy Dempsey, nor his immediate predecessor have ever underestimated the scale of the task facing us or the length of time required to address the many accommodation problems in primary schools. As a result of under-investment over the course of decades, many schools are in a poor state of repair and require substantial funding for upgrading to meet modern requirements. There is no point in pretending that it will be possible to improve the accommodation situation in all schools overnight and deal with emerging needs at the same time.Capital expenditure on primary buildings in 2002 will be €172.6 million. As a result of the Government's commitment to funding educational infrastructure, in excess of 120 major capital projects in the primary sector have recently been completed or are under construction. Many of these projects will continue in construction into 2003.I want to dispel a misunderstanding that has arisen in relation to the 400 major primary school projects in architectural planning that are listed on my Department's website. These projects were not included in the 2002 construction programme. Because they are major projects, they have to go through a detailed process of architectural planning which can take a considerable period to complete.The starting date for construction of any major school building project depends on factors such as its size; the complexity of the architectural planning; land acquisition, where necessary; sorting out title to the property; the period required for the granting of planning permission and obtaining a fire certificate; the outcome of the tender competition and the procurement of bonds; and insurance and tax clearance by prospective contractors. The financial commitments to be met from building projects already in construction are also important factors in determining the number of projects that may proceed at any given time. It is my Department's intention to release the projects in architectural planning to construction on a phased basis over a number of years.All applications to the Department of Education and Science for capital funding are subject to a detailed process of prioritisation. In brief, priority is given to the following broad categories of projects: new schools to cater for substantial increases in enrolments in rapidly developing areas where no other primary school exists; accommodation which is urgently required for children with special needs such as autism or speech and language disorders; the upgrading and refurbishment of special schools; the replacement or refurbishment of very poor buildings, including old prefabs – an example might be a structurally unsound building; and the provision of accommodation which is necessary to facilitate agreed amalgamations. While the primary responsibility for health and safety in school buildings rests with school management authorities, naturally the Department will assist schools in fulfilling these obligations.In addition to the capital grants made available to schools under the grants scheme for minor works to national school properties, amounting to €18 million annually, a further 1,700 grants for national schools have been sanctioned this year, amounting to €61 million. About one third of these grants were in respect of health and safety works to school properties. The remaining grants were for temporary accommodation and the purchase of essential furniture and equipment.Many of the specific issues raised by the INTO and in the media, for example, hand washing and drying facilities, heating, replacement of windows and doors and water supply, are more appropriately addressed using the devolved grant. This grant empowers schools to deal directly with such problems without the need to get approval from my Department. The vast majority of schools now deal with these minor works and do so very effectively.The INTO regularly refers to "rat or mice infested primary schools". Rodent problems, as they would in any domestic, industrial or commercial setting, are more likely to arise if pest control policies are inadequate and where there is a poor maintenance regime. The most structurally sound buildings can suffer rodent infestation. It does not follow that rodent infestation, where it occurs, requires the construction of a new building or that dealing with such a problem must await construction of a new building. It may be colourful and headline grabbing to make such references, but the responsibility for dealing with such problems rests with local school management, which we provide with annual funding for this purpose, over which it has total discretion.It is important that school management authorities carry out routine maintenance in accordance with the guidelines issued by the Department and utilise public moneys given to them in a proper and effective manner. To assist schools, the Department issued detailed advice in the form of a manual on school maintenance. The manual was recently placed on the Department's website for ease of reference and gives clear, practical guidance on the typical maintenance issues likely to arise in primary school buildings. It is designed to assist boards of management in fulfilling their responsibilities in relation to the upkeep and improvement of school premises. It is also intended to ensure capital grants given to all schools on an annual basis under the devolved grants scheme are properly expended.Despite the increase in the level of funding in recent years, there is a corresponding demand which reflects an historical deficit. However, it is not realistic to expect that all problems relating to school accommodation can be addressed immediately. The Government remains committed to continuing the work it has started and consolidating the substantial progress that has already been made in order to ensure the needs of schools are met over time. The process of investment in educational infrastructure begun by the previous Administration will be continued, as outlined in An Agreed Programme for Government.To meet our objectives the Minister will look closely at the potential for using public-private partnership mechanisms and the concept advanced in the programme for Government of a multi-annual programme, the schools' modernisation fund, to be financed through the National Development Finance Agency. The Government acknowledges that much more needs to be done to tackle poor accommodation in primary schools and, within the constraints of financial resources, we intend to continue with a phased programme of construction works over the lifetime of the Administration. For the information of the House, the Minister intends publishing his expenditure proposals for primary school buildings in the new year. The Department's website will be updated at regular intervals from that point on.In order to ensure the long-term planning of capital provision through a precise and detailed identification of accommodation needs in schools the Department has undertaken, on a pilot basis, a comprehensive inventory of the accommodation of 115 primary and post-primary schools in County Kildare. The information gained from the survey will be placed on a geographic information system – GIS – database. The Department is undertaking a detailed assessment of the pilot phase of the inventory to determine more precisely the nature and extent of the nationwide survey.Acknowledging the accommodation needs of primary schools, the Government has hugely increased the level of resources made available for primary buildings in recent years. Redressing past under-investment will take time, but the Government is determined to ensure the needs of schools are met on a phased and equitable basis.In tandem with the improvements being made in physical infrastructure the Government is committed to continuing to improve the pupil-teacher ratio at primary level. With regard to the appointment of additional teachers, most Senators will be aware that the mainstream staffing allocation of a primary school for a particular school year is outlined in a circular issued to all boards of management by the Department. This staffing schedule is agreed following discussions with the education partners. The number of mainstream posts sanctioned for a school is determined by reference to the staffing schedule and the enrolment in the school on 30 September of the previous year. Therefore, all boards are aware of the actual staffing position for their school in any school year and may appoint the number of teachers warranted by reference to the staffing schedule.

The purpose of the board is to allow for the independent consideration of appeals, under certain criteria, against the mainstream staffing schedule issued to schools. The criteria were outlined in Circular 19/02, which issued to all boards of management in August 2002. The appeals board operates independently of the Department. Its decisions are final and communicated directly to the relevant board of management.The Government has significantly improved the pupil-teacher ratio at primary level from 21.7:1 in the 1997-98 school year to 19:1 in the 2001-02 school year. An Agreed Programme for Government contains commitments to continue to reduce the pupil-teacher ratio in our schools and progressively introduce maximum class size guidelines which will ensure the average size of classes for children in junior classes will be below the international best practice guidelines of 20:1. We are also committed to implementing changes to retention and support policies which will assist schools in areas of significant disadvantage in recruiting and retaining teachers.Social inclusion represents a key priority for the Government.

The NAPS approach is based on a continuum of provision from early childhood though adulthood, with the focus on preventive strategies, targeting and integrated community responses. Within this strategy we have set ourselves challenging and ambitious targets under the key headings of school literacy, adult literacy and school retention. These are designed to bring about an education system that allows all our citizens to realise their full potential.Due to the very high importance attached to tackling the problems of educational disadvantage the Government provided for the establishment of a statutory committee on educational disadvantage under the Education Act, 1998, to advise on the policies and strategies to be adopted to identify and correct educational disadvantage. This committee brings together experts from across the community of education interests and will be a very important resource in planning to ensure real progress is made in this area.The level of investment provided for in the current Estimate enables us to maintain existing services and make further progress in the primary and post-primary sectors with increased provision for resource teachers and special needs assistants in primary schools; increased provision for school retention initiatives generally, including the school completion programme, involving in excess of 370 primary and post-primary schools in 82 clusters with a budget in 2003 in the order of €23 million, up from €15.4 million in 2002; the Giving Children an Even Break programme which applies to 2,320 primary schools and involves the appointment of more than 200 additional teachers to ensure maximum class sizes in junior classes in those disadvantaged schools with the highest proportion of disadvantaged pupils will be 20 – the expenditure for this programme, combined with the resources dedicated to the Breaking the Cycle project, the support teacher project and the disadvantaged areas scheme, will be over €36.7 million in 2003; continued support for the home-school-community liaison service in all primary and second level schools with designated disadvantaged areas status. In addition to these schemes and initiatives, there is a wide range of other supports, including those for Traveller children, children of non-nationals and other vulnerable groups.The Government's support for primary education is unprecedented. Our record in relation to improvements in the pupil-teacher ratio and improving school accommodation speaks for itself. Our commitment to combating educational disadvantage cannot be questioned. Over the next five years the Minister and I will continue to use the resources voted by the Oireachtas to maximise the benefit to children in primary schools by meeting our commitments in these areas. I commend the amended motion to the House.
#FeargalBrowne	unknown-#FeargalBrowne-party	unknown-#FeargalBrowne-dob	unknown-#FeargalBrowne-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	234	I thank the Minister of State for coming to the House. I wish to declare that I was a primary school teacher before I became a Senator. I may still be a member of the INTO, although I am not too sure. Maybe Senator Fitzgerald could advise me on that.Primary education is beyond doubt the foundation stone of the education system and of the continued social and economic progress we have experienced in recent years. The Department of Education and Science has a dreadful record. If it were a business, it would have been bankrupt years ago. A child born in 2002 will go to school in 2006, so the Department has four years advance warning to cater for that.In recent decades the Department has made an absolute mess of teacher numbers. When my sister went to college in the 1980s, there were far too many teachers graduating and friends of hers had to drive forklifts in London because they could not get work as teachers. Then Carysfort was closed, admittedly by a coalition Government including Fine Gael. In the 1990s when I was in college, there were too few teachers. The Department is now trying to ram through a large number of postgraduates to bring up the numbers.In trying to do some corrective work, the Department, in its wisdom, decided to appoint a large number of resource teachers. All of us, particularly Senator Fitzgerald because he is a teacher, welcome the appointment of resource teachers but there is no point in it if they are being taken out of mainstream teaching, particularly if there are not enough teachers to fill their positions. That is happening.There is the ludicrous case of teachers teaching in cloakrooms. When canvassing during the general election campaign, I made it my business to call to every school in every parish. The stories I was told were horrific. The Department needs to learn lessons. It gets plenty of advance warning. It needs to study the census figures carefully, identify the trends, find out how many children will be going to school in a certain year and ensure there are enough teachers. It should not create additional posts if there are not enough teachers to fill them or if they are being created at the expense of mainstream teaching, as is happening.I do not understand the anomaly in the system where secondary schools receive two and a half times the capitation payment received by primary schools. Primary schools have the same expenses as secondary schools and the anomaly should be rectified immediately. That anomaly also forces small schools to choose between a part-time secretary or part-time caretaker.We need to look at small schools and at one teacher schools. When the Minister for Health and Children was Opposition spokesperson on education in 1997, he gave a pledge before the general election that he would ensure all one teacher schools remained open. While that might sound good in theory, I have great difficulty with it. I hear stories of teachers in one teacher schools with only three or four pupils in a class and they might also have a resource teacher. Colleagues of mine in an urban school in Carlow have had 35 pupils in a class. There is no equality of treatment in that regard.I understand the need for one teacher schools on islands and in remote parts of the country. However, where there is a cluster of one teacher schools, the Department should consider amalgamating them. Children miss out as well from a social point of view. If a pupil is on his or her own in class for eight years of primary school, what social skills will they develop? They miss out on basic things such as being in a school band, being involved in a football or hurling team and so on which, even leaving education aside, is important. In addition, a pupil could have a bad teacher and be stuck with them for the first eight years of their educational life. That could have a dramatic effect on them. They might even end up as a Senator – who knows?
#LiamFitzgerald	unknown-#LiamFitzgerald-party	unknown-#LiamFitzgerald-dob	unknown-#LiamFitzgerald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	235	It happens to some.
#FeargalBrowne	unknown-#FeargalBrowne-party	unknown-#FeargalBrowne-dob	unknown-#FeargalBrowne-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	236	I jest. The last Government's biggest crime was the way it mistreated teachers and dealt with the voluntary aspect of teaching. The then Minister, Deputy Woods, downgraded teachers and made them feel bad about themselves. The last straw for teachers who gave up a lot of time voluntarily after school hours, invariably unappreciated by parents, was the way the Government annihilated them. The situation became farcical when those hired to supervise in secondary schools got paid more money than the amount teachers were looking for originally. There are questions to be answered in that regard.I compliment the religious orders. But for them, many schools would not have been built and maintained. We live in a multi-ethnic society and we will face severe difficulties in schools in the coming years, if not already, when we will have children from different backgrounds, nationalities and denominations. We need to look at the role of the religious in education and at whether it is time for the State to take over schools completely. How can we accommodate the needs of a modern multi-ethnic society? It is a serious question to which I do not have the answer. We should have a debate in the House at a later stage on that issue.The Minister of State referred to rodents in schools. I am thinking of a school in Carlow with a dedicated principal who ensured through vigilance that there were no rodents in the school, but her reward was that work on the school was deferred. There are two ways to look at this. Does a principal let a school become run down because it might help their case? Some have done so and the schools were refurbished far more quickly.Teachers welcome the publication of the lists but they would like to know how schools are selected. What is the criterion? Is it purely political? What are the conditions? The Minister of State might include that on the website to let schools know how they are chosen. Most teachers are reasonable people and they would like to know when they can expect something to be done. To say sometime in the future is too vague. They would like a timeframe, whether six months or one or two years, because it would give them something to work towards.Another issue which arose when I was going around the schools was the various agencies involved in the Department. It is time to set up one agency to look at school building projects. As far as I am aware, three different agencies are currently involved. We need one good unit with standard practices and standard specifications for classroom sizes which could be used as a template. Obviously, variations could be made for different schools. It would speed up the whole process.The least we owe young people and teachers is a decent environment in which to work. With a so-called healthy economy, it is a disgrace children are being taught in classrooms in which one could not swing a cat. There is no space for art. We have made much play of ICT, information and communication technology in schools, but some classrooms do not even have space for a computer. Even in those which do have a computer, it is a distraction to children because there is not a corner in which to put it. These are serious issues.I thank the Minister of State for coming to the House and I hope my contribution will add something to the debate.
#MichaelPKitt	unknown-#MichaelPKitt-party	unknown-#MichaelPKitt-dob	unknown-#MichaelPKitt-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	237	I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy de Valera, to the House and wish her well in the Department of Education and Science. I compliment her on the work she is doing in the area of adult education. In the last Dáil I was chairman of the committee on education and one of the issues we addressed by way of report was literacy levels. We sought funding for adult education and the situation improved. I hope the Minister of State will be able to build on that in her term in office.Like my colleague, Senator Fitzgerald, I welcome our increased commitment to school building and accommodation. Since 1997 there has been a fourfold increase in funding for primary school buildings. This is a huge issue and every Senator has spoken about it. While we have done well in terms of the appointment of additional teachers and the pupil teacher ratio has been reduced, there is a crying need for more investment in primary school buildings. It was a major issue during the general election campaign, as other Members and I found to our cost. The condition of primary school buildings was mentioned at every public meeting.I am glad progress is being made and delighted the Minister has confirmed on the Department's website that 400 schools building projects are at architectural planning stage. A total of 40 are planned for County Galway, with five in the city and 35 in the county. With the exception of Dublin, the county has the greatest number of schools awaiting sanction for building projects.The Minister of State reiterated the Department will publish the expenditure proposal for school buildings in January and the relevant schools will be advised at that stage. That is welcome. Like many previous speakers, I am a teacher by profession.

#MichaelPKitt	unknown-#MichaelPKitt-party	unknown-#MichaelPKitt-dob	unknown-#MichaelPKitt-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	239	When I was teaching, there were no remedial or resource teachers or classroom assistants and the school psychological service had not been established. These issues were addressed during the years and 2,900 additional teachers, for example, have been appointed since 1997 at an annual cost of €116 million. The Government has done well, but I take Senator Browne's point that many of those teachers work in substandard conditions. I am amazed that professionals such as architects and engineers are still required to draft plans for prefabs, which is ridiculous. Recently, I came across a case where an architect was required to submit a planning application for a 50 square metre prefab. Such structures are needed quickly if remedial or resource teachers, classroom assistants are appointed or the psychological service is extended to new schools.When former Deputies Donal Creed and Gemma Hussey served as Ministers in the Department of Education and Science, they introduced a successful initiative which provided for low cost buildings. This was maintained by the Leader of the House when she served as Minister for Education. I have seen classrooms which were built in the 1980s as stand-alone projects at a cost of £8,000 or £9,000. Architects and engineers were not needed as the school was only required to submit three quotations to the Department, which would then select the contractor before proceeding with the project. This approach should be adopted rather than using professionals for every small project.I am afraid a similar pattern could emerge through the use of public-private partnerships. I would like to learn more about PPPs because transparency is necessary. The Minister for Education and Science stated he would try to address the primary school buildings issue in the same way he addressed group water schemes when he took up office as Minister for the Environment and Local Government in the previous Administration. He used a simple formula because the administration of the schemes was a shambles with people in rural Ireland paying charges for water while those living in cities did not. He streamlined the scheme by funding applications in the order they were submitted to the Department and I have every confidence he will do likewise in addressing the backlog of schools building projects, which is causing a significant furore throughout the State.I hope the 40 schools identified by the INTO as unfit for habitation will be permitted to go to tender and that their boards of management will be notified when that will happen. I am sure they are included in the list of 400 schools building projects on the Department's website. While extra teachers have been appointed and the issue of schools projects is being addressed, the building programme must continue and should be simplified as much as possible. There were major cutbacks in the education budget in 1987, but the then Minister, now Senator O'Rourke, was able to provide funding for schools building projects, school transport and so on and other Ministers have done so in the meantime. Decisions need to be made to ensure funding is provided for schools buildings projects.I congratulate the Minister for Education and Science and the Ministers of State at his Department on their work. They have a good grasp of what is required. The amendment states what the Government intends to do, but I hope they take on board the issues that have been raised in the debate in order that urgent work on school buildings can be fast-tracked. The boards of management of the schools involved should be notified as quickly as possible regarding when they can expect the contracts for the projects to go to tender and work to commence and be completed. The Minister intends to do this. I wish him and the Department well. I thank the officials in the Department in Tullamore with whom Members have many dealings. They try their best to make progress and update us on different applications for school improvements.
#BrendanRyan	unknown-#BrendanRyan-party	unknown-#BrendanRyan-dob	unknown-#BrendanRyan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	240	In supporting the motion tabled by my colleagues in Fine Gael I am anxious not to behave like a typical Opposition Member bashing the Government for the numerous things it has not done. It is particularly difficult to bash the Minister of State at the Department of Education and Science, Deputy Brian Lenihan, because of his agreeable nature, similar to that of his late father and aunt, who is Leader of the House. Questions arise, however, because some schools are in appalling condition, as pointed out by the INTO and parents' groups, following five years of unprecedented prosperity.This is either a resource or management issue. I was a member of a board of management in a good school that my son attended. It was categorised as disadvantaged which proved to be an enormous advantage for the school in terms of funding. It was run by a superb principal and the parish priest was chairman of the board of management. He had the good sense to allow the principal to do his job without interfering and gave him as much support as he could, but he was in a state of perpetual frustration with the Department because of delays and uncertainty.The parish priest had no problem providing the 15% local contribution for the school's building projects, but he had a problem servicing the overdraft for the 85% of funding that the Department was supposed to pay. It often took the Department two years to do so. One of this good, but naive, man's learning experiences during my term on the board was his discovery that the tabling of a parliamentary question in the Dáil had a remarkable effect in terms of prompting the Department to release funds for projects that had been completed. The hint of a parliamentary question produced an accelerated response. However, it should not take a Member of the Oireachtas raising such a delay in either House to have the State honour its part of a contract speedily, which involved 85% of the funding for one project in this school.The legislation that provides for the charging of interest when bill payments are late should be extended to include boards of management of primary schools. The clear implication of the Minister of State's comments is that it is the school's fault if it is unsatisfactory, rat infested or has inadequate washing facilities. Such schools exist and the INTO has identified them. Some years ago I remember describing the real conditions in the school my daughters attended, which was also classified as disadvantaged. I do not know if the presence of my children caused that classification. They had to bring their own toilet paper to school. The response of the Government was not to wonder about schools and schooling, but to try find out which school my children attended so it could rap the authorities there on the knuckles. The board of the school, which was well run, told me it did not have the funds and could not afford to pay for toilet paper.After five years of unprecedented prosperity, why have such problems not been remedied? It is a question of management and resources. It is not sufficient for the Department of Education and Science to say that it is essentially a matter for the school in question if prima facie breaches of health and safety legislation appear to exist. If a local school is failing in its duties in that regard, surely somebody has a responsibility to remind it of its obligations. Has the Department of Education and Science engaged in a vigorous campaign to remind the managers of primary schools of their obligations under the health and safety legislation?There is some ambiguity on the part of the HSA regarding its role in the education sector. Some people working for the HSA imply that they do not have much responsibility in that respect, particularly for pupils. The HSA has been reported as saying that it has no role in rail safety other than in terms of the workforce of Iarnród Éireann and that the safety of the passengers is not part of its brief. Does it hold a similar view in respect of primary schools?It is an issue of management and of reminding schools. At the very least, if parents connected with a school and the union representing teachers in that school have a legitimate concern regarding health and safety, the Department of Education and Science should tell them specifically "Your problem is with the board of the school. Deal with it." The issue is instead being fudged because boards of management in schools say it is the Department's problem and the Department says it is the schools' problem. As a result, parents and teachers end up in a state of total frustration.It would have helped if the previous Government had not reversed the decision of the rainbow coalition to introduce regionalisation in the administration of education. If a person lives in Dingle or Castletownbere and is obliged to deal with the Department of Education and Science in Dublin, that, in itself, is an inhibition to serious dialogue. It is difficult because people, names, etc., change.One fundamental issue concerns the priorities of the current and previous Governments. It is the apparent unwillingness to devote resources to fixing the unglamorous problems, such as putting decent surfaces on all our roads and making basic buildings available for our schoolchildren. The Government is preoccupied with prestige projects such as motorways or other matters in west Dublin to which I will not refer. I associate that kind of preoccupation with the more unsavoury Third World countries, which cannot think through what prosperity should be used for and cannot take decisions that do not have an immediate, spectacular and visible effect. If one fixes all schools to a minimum standard, people will not notice. If one resurfaces all the roads, people will not really notice. However, the building of a spectacular motorway is deemed to be great, although it may not do much good. I am concerned that the Government is engaging in decision-making that prioritises what looks good over what does good.
#DrMartinMansergh	unknown-#DrMartinMansergh-party	unknown-#DrMartinMansergh-dob	unknown-#DrMartinMansergh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	241	I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Brian Lenihan. I also welcome the Opposition motion in that it gives us the opportunity to discuss a very important issue, to which I attach the highest priority in terms of expenditure and investment decisions. The motion refers to broken promises, although the Government is only six months into a five year term. One will only be able to judge if the promises are kept towards the end of that term.Expenditure on both primary and secondary school buildings has moved on to a totally different plane. I was looking at the Books of Estimates for the mid-1990s and expenditure amounted to between approximately £30 million to £40 million for both types of schools. Such expenditure now amounts to almost €150 million for primary school buildings and €184 million for secondary school buildings. An important priority is to maintain expenditure at that much higher level.There is a huge backlog which obviously did not arise this year or last year or even during the term of the previous Government; it arose much earlier. It relates to school buildings from, in some cases, the lean times of the 1930s and 1940s and, in others, to the 19th century. Even schools from the 1960s or 1970s are not necessarily built to the standard of those constructed today.I had the privilege earlier this year, and in a different capacity, of opening a new school in Swords, County Dublin, which accommodates about 100 pupils. I was absolutely astonished by the high standard of the building. There is no doubt that the building unit of the Department of Education and Science is capable of doing a magnificent job. Those of us familiar with what it did ten or 20 years ago will note that its standards have improved in the interim. However, people involved with schools that are not of the same standard as the one I opened want their schools to be upgraded to that level. Expectations have legitimately risen a good deal in recent years.Senator Ryan argued that the country's unprecedented prosperity should have resulted in a solution to problems regarding school buildings. However, we have many problems in many different areas. Pensioners wanted a better deal and families wanted more child benefit. A very good argument was made for increasing overseas development aid. There were housing needs and infrastructural needs related to the tackling of congestion. It is inevitable that the Government cannot devote all the resources to one problem.As my party's finance spokesperson, I feel the most important consideration in ensuring that we have resources for schools is that we consolidate our financial position and have confidence in the progress we have made and, in the difficult circumstances – both national and international – in which we find ourselves, in our economy. That is the best way to guarantee progress.At a parliamentary party meeting, I noted that the Minister for Education and Science accepted and decided to work with the Estimate with which he had been presented. I accept that all Ministers would, perhaps, like to be given more money. We should ensure that this happens, but we should indicate that Members on all sides regard this issue as a matter of high priority. We must also ensure that we do the maximum in terms of the making of future decisions. At elections those associated with schools try to squeeze the maximum commitments and approvals from the Government. While I do not blame them, it takes time for the Government to deal with commitments and proceed with other projects.The system is bureaucratic and time consuming. In the long term some kind of devolution in decision making will be desirable. We are criticised for being an over-centralised country. The Department should consider decentralising its basic functions to county level. Politicians will give reasons, political and otherwise, for not proceeding on that basis. For example, they will argue that with a population the size of Manchester it is better for the country if resources are centralised. However, it is worth debating the dependency culture this kind of arrangement engenders. It creates much frustration among parents, teachers and managers. It is not the most efficient system.I agree with the criteria laid down by the Minister of State and her views on rat infestation. Is my house rat infested because the cat brings in a rat every other week? Nevertheless, some conditions must be addressed. I visited many schools in recent months and there is a big programme of work to be done. A Member of the House is president of the ICTU and a former president of the INTO. I am, therefore, confident that any new national agreement will contain a strong commitment from all the social partners to accord this the highest priority.

It is a sick Government that has allowed this to happen.A dozen schools in County Longford require major refurbishment. I hope they will not be long fingered by the Government. I support the motion. The Government's decision is a blatant attack on our children and education system. It should call it a day on serving the people.
#SheilaTerry	unknown-#SheilaTerry-party	unknown-#SheilaTerry-dob	unknown-#SheilaTerry-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	251	The Minister of State will be aware of the problems affecting a number of schools in the Dublin 15 area. I, therefore, condemn the cuts to the school building programme this year. Spending on the programme is to increase by  4%, which is less than the rate of inflation in the building industry. In addition, the 1% increase in the lower rate of VAT will affect the programme. The increase will be wiped out by inflation and the additional VAT. It means that many more schools will wait longer for work to be done while those a long time on the list will have to continue waiting. The Minister of State will be aware that in the Dublin 15 area representations were made to all the general election candidates from Scoil Thomáis, Laurel Lodge and the Sacred Heart School, Huntstown, which has several prefabricated buildings. I hope they will be included in this year's programme.How long are schools expected to remain in prefabricated accommodation? When funding is granted to new schools, many of them initially rely on prefabricated buildings to be replaced in perhaps a further five years. That does not make good economic sense. It would be better to adequately fund the schools in order that they can have a permanent structure. The Educate Together school is located in a prefabricated building, as is a school in Clonee, where I hope work will commence in the coming year.Many schools are in a condition we should not expect our children to put up with. Some teachers conduct their classes in corridors or the principal's office. That is not a very proud record to stand over.

#JohnPaulPhelan	unknown-#JohnPaulPhelan-party	unknown-#JohnPaulPhelan-dob	unknown-#JohnPaulPhelan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	256	I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Brian Lenihan. I am pleased to speak on this important motion. I do not wish to repeat what has been said, but suffice it to say there are huge levels of anger among the general public about cutbacks in expenditure on primary education. County Kilkenny is no exception when it comes to those levels of upset in the community.I am fortunate to have been taught in a very progressive national school and proud to be a member of its board of management to which I was appointed two years ago. There is a lot of work done during the year to raise funds for school expenditure. Not every community is lucky enough to have such an active board of management or such good fund-raising structures in place.I was particularly disappointed by the cutbacks announced. Schools in County Kilkenny which have been affected include Carrigeen national school in south Kilkenny on the edge of Waterford city and in an area which is booming. Before the general election the local Fianna Fáil candidate promised that an extension to the school would be granted in 2003. That will not happen now.Church Hill national school, Cuffesgrange, County Kilkenny, was given a commitment by another Fianna Fáil candidate before the general election that its extension which it needed would materialise if he was returned to the Dáil. It went so far that the principal of the school distributed literature to the pupils requesting their parents to vote for the Fianna Fáil candidate concerned because he was the best man to deliver the extension. That was an abuse of position and pupils were used in order to gain votes.Worst of all was the commitment given before the last general election to fund a new school for the disabled in Kilkenny city. Government party candidates gave a commitment that it would happen in 2003. It will not happen now and disabled students are the worst hit.A new school is required to service the greater Kilkenny area. The national school in The Rower was given a commitment before the general election by another Fianna Fáil candidate, but I do not see it included in any of the published lists.It was proposed to merge the two existing national schools in Thomastown, County Kilkenny, and build a new school. The site had been identified and commitments were made by the previous Government that if it was returned to office, the site would be purchased and the school built. Now we are told that it will not happen. The level of outrage and anger among the general public on this issue is immense.My colleague, Senator Terry, at the end of her contribution made a point about expenditure on temporary accommodation. Earlier this year Deputy Paul McGrath asked a parliamentary question which was answered by the Minister of State, Deputy O'Dea. It concerned the amount spent annually by the Department on temporary primary school accommodation. I was very surprised to discover that last year €6 million was spent on prefabs. In 1999 the figure was €2 million and in 2000, €4 million. It indicates a very short-term attitude which is not acceptable in this day and age. The Government should not be expending such amounts on what are short-term solutions to much more long-term and fundamental problems. It is a waste of money.I take exception to what was said by a previous speaker. As he has left the Chamber, I will not mention his name, but he was making excuses that constituents look for commitments from their politicians before a general election. He was more or less putting the blame on boards of management in communities and saying they were somehow responsible for the backtracking by the Government on this issue. Boards of management are entitled to ask questions to ascertain when work will be done or, as we now know, not done on their schools. If a commitment is given, they are entitled to see it acted upon.Every time I speak in the House I mention the fact that there is a lot of cynicism about politicians. When people see politicians saying one thing and doing something else, it does us all down. Strong commitments are given before elections which are not honoured afterwards. That is a disgrace. I support the motion.
#JoeOToole	unknown-#JoeOToole-party	unknown-#JoeOToole-dob	unknown-#JoeOToole-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	257	I am delighted to speak on the motion which I hope will become a resolution. I compliment Senator Burke for bringing it before the House. It is both important and timely. I welcome the Minister of State and wish him well on his promotion. The two issues for which he has responsibility, children and education, both tie in with the motion. It would be very fair of a Government to state, "We have no money, we made a mistake, we were wrong" and come out with its hands up on this issue. During the general election I watched the number of commitments made to school groups that their schools would be looked after. This is a short-sighted decision about a soft target. If it were not for the INTO, this would not be a national issue. The INTO co-ordinates action and ensures politicians and parents are briefed.During the last general election in a constituency I know of a school was informed that it would not get its planned extension. It was overcrowded for years and its prefabs were very old. As there was no general purposes room in the school, even though it was very progressive, it could not do anything. The school in question is not located in the Dublin area or the Minister of State's constituency. When the Taoiseach visited the constituency, the school decided to raise the matter with him. It intended to mount a protest when he arrived. A Fianna Fáil candidate in the area went to the school principal and said that if it did, it would never get the extension built. That was conveyed to the parent who was secretary of the school parents' committee. The school principal rang me – at that stage I was still in INTO – and I said that cannot be, a candidate would not threaten. I told him to ring the candidate. He did so and the candidate said exactly the same thing. As a result, they did not carry out their protest when the Taoiseach was there. They were afraid.This happened in Ireland in 2002. In the general election Fine Gael lost a seat in that constituency and Fianna Fáil won an extra seat. I am not saying that the two matters are related, but it is appalling. Of all the parties in the State, Fianna Fáil would be strongly supportive of the right to free expression. The Minister of State, Deputy Lenihan, would have as strong a view as myself on it and would defend it to the limit. We might disagree with people arguing with us, but we would defend their right to say it. I thought it was so completely wrong that that should happen in an age when we are trying to create a questioning, challenging new generation. That is an anecdote to prove a point about the frustration people are experiencing throughout the country on this issue.The irony is that the school curriculum at primary level is the most progressive in Europe. There is no doubt about that. It is the only country, as the Minister of State will be aware, where the parents, the teachers' organisation, the employers' organisation, the Department inspectorate and the Department planners sat down and organised and agreed a curriculum. The curriculum was agreed by all parties the day it was published. It had never happened previously in any country in Europe. There are Ministers for Education around Europe who would give one of their fingers to get that kind of co-operation and support.To make that work, however, we need space in schools. We need heat, light, comfort, general purpose rooms and space to move, to have sport, physical education, creative work, art work, etc., on wet, cold and wintry days. That is not happening.There are many schools in rural areas which have been badly run down in many ways. What tends to happen is that parents in that area say they will send their child to the much more comfortable school in the town nearby. That is going on all the time and it is actually supporting the decline of rural communities.Unfortunately I missed Senator Burke's speech, but he must have made reference to the fact that his county, County Galway, is probably the one which has suffered most in this series of cutbacks. It is a large county with many rural areas and it has suffered very badly.What is going on is wrong. We did this previously in 1987 and it took us years to pull back. The then Minister, a certain Deputy O'Rourke, went to great pains in 1988 or 1989 to double the building programme in order to get us back on track. It took about five or six years to deal with the schools that had lost out in the two-year cutback. We were just about getting there, and just in a position where the Department of Education and Science was saying there were no more lists of schools, and now this has happened. It is wrong. It is regressive. It presents us as a Third World country in modern Europe. It is anathema to those of us who participated in the European debate. It is appallingly embarrassing to show European colleagues the state of some of the schools. There are no other words to describe it.There are fundamental issues here. This was handled very badly during the election and I agree completely that this gives a very bad impression of politics. It was used politically and then abused politically. I am not standing on moral high ground here. I just think that is wrong and, irrespective of who was in Government, I would still say so. The issue should not be used that way.We should have a clear consensus on this matter. I know the Minister of State, Deputy Lenihan, would not have a different view on it. I certainly know that the Leader of the House and I agree, having discussed it on many occasions in good times, bad times and in between times.This is something which we always set out to do right and we have failed. This is a step backwards and a generation will suffer. They will never be in fourth class, fifth class or whichever class again. By pulling it back in the way the Government has done it we are losing out. The reason for this country's revolution in economic terms over the past ten years has as much to do with all that has come out of the education system as anything else and now we are losing out badly.I know I have gone over my time and I apologise for doing so. I support the motion. I am delighted to have had an opportunity to contribute to it. I do not want people to come back at me, defending against the criticisms I made. I have said what needs to be said. I hope that the Government will change its view on this or at the very least give a commitment that the next budget will put right in spades what they have put wrong this time.
#MaryORourke	unknown-#MaryORourke-party	unknown-#MaryORourke-dob	unknown-#MaryORourke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	258	I am happy to say a few words on this matter and, indeed, to follow the contribution of Senator O'Toole. No doubt we could all do with a great deal more money for all sorts of projects. That is the way the world goes. The allocation for 2003 is €147 million, a considerable amount of money. There is no point in saying that there will not be a penny spent on primary schools and many schools will lack this and that.I fully understand that the list of schools which need to be addressed is long and that the amount of money concerned will not satisfy all who wish to be considered under this allocation in 2003. Notwithstanding that, the allocation of €147 million is considerable. It will enable more inroads to be made on the primary school building projects.I note with interest that the Department is putting all its material on the website so that every school can see where it is on the list. The Taoiseach stated in the Dáil the other day that there would be no more queue jumping for schools which are seeking an allocation. That is a sound idea. Queue jumping leads to jealousy between schools because some say they are getting funding and others are not, and pupils move to the school they think is better served.I remember distinctly that in 1988 – Senator John Paul Phelan and those Senators who are really young may well say that it is a long time ago – I had £12 million for primary schools.

When I went into the Department the cupboard was bare anyway.I know that many schools, particularly at second level, had the flat roofs and the poorly constructed buildings of the late 1970s. They were a disgrace because problems developed within ten years and huge maintenance money has now to be spent, either on their complete refurbishment or reconstruction.I remember when we embarked on this because, as Senator O'Toole will also remember, times were pretty bad. When I hear people talking about cutbacks now, I say that they do not know real cutbacks. We would say to the schools that we would give so much money towards four properly built classrooms, not flat-roofed ones, and they could get their own architect. Several parents have written to me over the years saying they have our four really good classrooms, which suffice and which have facilitated great work.I strongly resent the huge fees paid to architects. I do not care if there are architects here or in the public gallery.

#MaryORourke	unknown-#MaryORourke-party	unknown-#MaryORourke-dob	unknown-#MaryORourke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	266	I strongly resent the percentage of money which is given to professional surveyors, architects, second teams of architects, etc. It takes a huge amount of money out of the budget for primary school building and in many cases good jobs can be done neatly and well with much less expenditure. There is no need for that kind of money to be spent. It is different when building science laboratories, technical drawing rooms and domestic science rooms, which require special accommodation and equipment. That is quite understandable. The accommodation is simpler and much easier to build in primary schools, but devoting lots of money to huge teams of architects is counter-productive and eats into the primary school budget. The team at the Department of Education and Science now, headed by the Minister, Deputy Noel Dempsey, and also comprising the Ministers of State, Deputies Síle de Valera and Brian Lenihan, will, together with Department officials, do its very best with the budget available for 2003.Having hopefully put matters on an even keel, they will then work towards a five-year budget. This is a very good idea because when work starts on schools, much of the budget for next year is actually for the final payment on schools started in the current year. It is difficult, therefore, to quantify how many school projects can be financed from that sum of money. If a five-year rolling budget and accompanying programme can be achieved, there will hopefully be an eventual end in sight for what in many cases are inferior primary school buildings.

If you want a contrast, just go across to the other side of Adare to the St. Nicholas school, which is located in a building over 600 years old. The then Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Martin, promised them a new school in 1999 but they are still waiting. I see from the list on the Department's website that the school has not even got to the architectural planning stage. The 70-plus pupils deserve the chance of a new building because the structure they are in is primitive. That is symptomatic of many schools around the country.The Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, deserves at this stage the title Mac the Knife. The title used to be applied to another Minister years ago. The amount of money earmarked for capital expenditure on schools this year is static. If we take construction inflation into consideration in addition to general inflation, there is a cut of 10%. The school building unit of the Department does tremendous work with limited resources, but in many cases it is merely applying a sticking plaster in trying to remedy defects within existing schools. Thousands of children are going into school wearing their overcoats in terrible conditions in the winter. It is a shocking indictment, considering the excessive expenditure of the past few years, that those circumstances exist. Now we are in the situation of having to claw back revenue.What is the future for many of those schools? We recently had published on the Department website the entire list of schools at different stages of architectural planning and so on. Some schools are not even on the list. Like other Senators, I could provide a list of these schools in my own county. It is totally unfair, and there remains much to do.The capitation grant is, I think, €101 per pupil for primary schools and €230 for second level schools. Much of the funding for schools is now raised locally. There has been a huge increase in the cost of insurance and heating oil. In many cases very good committees are getting together and trying to raise funds, but many of them are finding it more difficult as time goes on.This motion is very timely. A debate on the same subject is taking place this evening in Dáil Éireann. The Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Noel Dempsey, has been telling that House about all the fine things the Government has done. If the Government did not keep harping back to 20 years ago, when my party was in power, I do not know what it would have to talk about. It keeps harping back to the times of 1983-1987 and what the Fine Gael-Labour coalition did in different circumstances.

I thank my colleagues in the Fine Gael Party and the other Senators who spoke. It is an important debate and I hope that by moving this motion we can in some way help to make progress in what is an appalling situation for children and parents also.The Minister of State, Deputy Síle de Valera, talked about giving children an even break and about the appointment of 200 additional teachers, particularly in disadvantaged areas. I remind the Minister, whether she is aware of it or not, that between 30,000 and 40,000 pupils at national school level are being taught by untrained teachers. It is an unbelievable figure. It is a disaster for so many that they will go through some of the most important years in their education being taught by untrained teachers. I do not know what the Minister of State or the Minister, Deputy Noel Dempsey, intend to do about that. We know all about the improvements he listed.It was a pity that the Minister of State, Deputy de Valera, did not address the motion before the House. She ignored it. The only aspect she mentioned was the increased amount of money provided during the good times by the last Government. The sad reality is that we have a core base of schools in a deplorable condition in which we expect our children to be taught and our teachers to teach. The conditions are unbelievable. They have been listed many times before.Senator O'Toole pointed out that there are 40 schools in need of repair in County Galway. Promises were made in the run up to the last election. I mentioned, in the absence of the Leader of the House, what her colleague, Deputy Cassidy, did by way of promoting himself prior to the election. I am sure the Leader of the House was particularly glad that was put on the record.

#UlickBurke	unknown-#UlickBurke-party	unknown-#UlickBurke-dob	unknown-#UlickBurke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	274	That type of activity was duplicated so many times around the country, and we were all victims of that deception. We do not want the Minister of State simply telling us and the parents that she has a list of 400 schools on a website. We want the Minister of State to be full and frank with the boards of management of schools and to give them some guidelines as to when work will start. Nothing else will satisfy people and it is the least the Government can do in the immediate future.I also urge at least that the funding of €147 million be increased to something like €250 million so that work on the core disaster areas of about 40 national schools will be allowed to go to tender straight away. The schools have been identified, but the sad reality is that students are still attending them.The Minister of State clearly laid blame tonight on the boards of management for their inactivity. She told them to familiarise themselves with the new manual she has produced dealing with the patch and mend work that will take place in schools and how best to utilise the funding, which is no more than crumbs falling from the table. There is a new manual, but the Leader of the House is unaware of it. The guidelines are to be brought to every board of management, each of which will be free to discuss how it can patch and mend its school. This reminds me of the crisis some years ago when new machines were provided to patch and tar the roads. Now there will be a parallel machine to patch and mend schools. If our response to the need to give children an even break is that they must continue to receive their education in these schools, the Government will stand indicted.

#JamesBannon	unknown-#JamesBannon-party	unknown-#JamesBannon-dob	unknown-#JamesBannon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	277	I welcome the Minister of State. Given the time of year, an analogy between the story of Scrooge in A Christmas Carol and the Government's penny-pinching in the health services would not be out of place. These cutbacks are impacting on the lives of the ill and their carers. Following the post-election scandal of broken promises, the health services throughout the country are in a Dickensian state. Basic care is being jeopardised and we are returning to an era where the rights and needs of patients are no longer paramount; they have been sacrificed to dubious remedial action to cover the miscalculations of the Minister for Finance. For every progressive step taken we are taking two steps backwards.My locality faces a Christmas during which only one ambulance crew will be on duty to cover the greater Longford and midlands area between 6 p.m. and 8 a.m. for the duration of the medical technicians' strike, which started last Monday. This dispute centres on current working arrangements and means the five midlands ambulance stations – Longford, Portlaoise, Tullamore, Athlone and Mullingar – are manned by one crew and an off-duty on call crew between 6 p.m. and 8 a.m. County Longford will be worst affected because, having no 24-hour casualty service, it is obliged to rely on the Midlands General Hospital in Mullingar.The Midland Health Board has stated it is unable to meet the demands of the emergency medical technicians, EMTs, who are striking in pursuit of their claim in respect of the removal of the current on-call arrangements. EMTs provide a 24 hour ambulance service with up to three duty crews in each station. Between the hours of 6 p.m. and 8 a.m. there is only one duty crew per station plus an on-call off-duty crew who are paid only €2 an hour – Dickens did not know the half of it.This industrial action is not about money or double time payments. The technicians merely want a commitment from the Midland Health Board to remove the on-call arrangement currently in place. It is unsatisfactory that a person must work a 32 hour shift – as in the case of EMTs in the midlands – working from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m., then on-call to 8 a.m. and having to turn up for work again the next day. That is ridiculous in this day and age. There is much concern among the public about what is happening in this regard in the midlands.SIPTU, which represents the approximately 80 EMTs involved in strike action, recommended as far back as 1993 that the on-call service should be removed from the rota system. Of the 75 technicians polled on the elimination of the on-call service, 67 returned papers. A total of 64 voted in favour, two voted against and there was one spoiled vote.The level of activity covered by the on-call service as estimated by the Midland Health Board is 6% between the hours of 6 p.m. and 8 a.m. Under an alternative roster system crews would be brought in on an overtime basis in the short term, but in the long term it would necessitate the recruitment and training of eight additional EMTs, which would reduce dependence on overtime and give a continuous service. It comes as no surprise to hear that the Midland Health Board cannot afford to finance these changes from its current budgets. The elimination of the on-call arrangement would require the provision of additional funding of approximately €1.4 million.This strike comes at a bad time for the Midland Health Board. It has overspent on this year's budget by almost €3.5 million, as outlined by the financial review for the first nine months of this year, with under-funding, the medical card scheme, the winter vomiting bug and the settlement of the national accident and emergency dispute responsible for its financial losses. Ambulance crews provide an essential life saving service. Without their rapid intervention patients will die or, at the very least, suffer undue delay in receiving treatment.Unfortunately, what is happening in the midlands is not an isolated incident. It is symptomatic of the general state to which the country has been reduced by the Government. Hospitals and related services have seen cutbacks that have left the morale of health workers at an all-time low. These essential health care personnel work in intolerable conditions. What is their reward? The answer is derisory salary levels and appalling working hours. I appeal to the Minister of State to take action to resolve this dispute as quickly as possible.

It would be remiss of me not to respond to some of the points raised by him. He said morale of health workers was at an all-time low. I wish to mention a few figures which will put the position in perspective.When the Senator party's was in Government five years ago, the annual spend on the provision and delivery of health services the length and breadth of the country was shy of £3 billion. The Government recognised that money was required to ensure an adequate level of service. We have done a lot and recognise there is a lot more to be done. We have put approximately three times that amount –€9 billion – into the health service. We have extended services—

They are represented by SIPTU. The dispute centres around SIPTU's demands for the elimination of the on-call arrangement through the provision of additional duty crews. The board's emergency ambulance service, which is in place from 6 p.m. each evening until 8 a.m. the following morning, consists of normal duty attendances and on-call emergency rosters. The effect of the withdrawal of on-call emergency roster arrangements by EMTs is being met by arrangements with the Department of Defence to provide the necessary backup cover to duty crews each night for the duration of the industrial action
