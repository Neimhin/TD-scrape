I have also received notice from Senator Kieran O'Donnell of the following matter:The need for the Minister for Finance to provide an update on the review of whole-of-life assurance policies. I have also received notice from Senator Lorraine Clifford-Lee of the following matter:The need for the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport to make a statement on the need for a slip road to be built at Donabate to provide access to the M1 motorway. I have also received notice from Senator Victor Boyhan of the following matter:The need for the Minister for Health to confirm if the 12 hospital beds at the National Rehabilitation Hospital, Dún Laoghaire, are now open and fully available for rehabilitation services. I have also received notice from Senator Brian Ó Domhnaill of the following matter:The need for the Minister for Finance to consider the introduction of legislation to provide for a separation between the commercial and retail arms of all regulated financial institutions operating in Ireland to protect retail customers against the effects of future bank failures.

An uncompleted school in County Carlow was promised facilities over ten years ago, but it is still waiting. Those involved in the school in Bagenalstown feel very let down by the Department of Education and Skills, especially in the light of all the promises made in the national planning framework on its release last week. In 2006 Presentation De La Salle in Bagenalstown was promised funding for a PE hall. The Government has been in power for seven years, but the school still has no PE classroom for nearly 700 students. It is the only school in County Carlow without this vital room. An outdoor general purpose area is being used for PE classes, but it is unsuitable when it rains and the students cannot exercise. There has been a lot of talk recently about rising obesity levels and how each young adult needs 30 minutes of exercise each day, but the students feel salt is being rubbed into their wounds because on a rainy or freezing winter's day they cannot go outside and have the recommended amount of exercise they are told they need for their health. The best time to use the general purpose area is in the summer, but the school is closed then. On any one day in this excellent school more than 11 prefab rooms are in use to ensure students are provided with an education. The staff and management are doing their level best, but they are really feeling the pinch. How can we say we value a child's education if we fail to provide proper facilities to inspire learning? The school is included in a building programme for the period 2019 to 2021, but it has not heard anything about the appointment of a design team or plans. Student numbers have risen from 350 in 2009 to 692 today, with further projected increases to 720 in 2018-19 and 745 in 2019-20. Where will the school put the extra students? The conditions in which the staff and students find themselves are demoralising. Are there plans to proceed with the project? The Government likes to launch ambitious plans, but it often fails to follow through on them with action. That is clearly evident in the fact that five new schools announced in 2013 have yet to be delivered. Every year since the number has increased. Furthermore, sites have not yet been found for the new schools announced by the Government in its school building plan for 2015. The Minister launched a new programme, but sites have not yet been found for the schools he thinks will be built. How can those involved in one school in Bagenalstown have faith that the promises made will be kept?  Already the schools which were scheduled for completion by the collapsed company Carillion are unfinished or lying idle with no staff. Parents and students are wondering what will happen at Tyndall College in County Carlow. Where does Presentation De La Salle sit in the Minister's ambitious school plans? Will he or someone acting on his behalf meet the board of management and the principal? The school has tried on numerous occasions to have a meeting with him, but it has net been successful and no one from the Department has visited it. What is the position on the school project? Can the Minister understand the urgent need for the PE hall, given that in 2018 the school has over 700 students? It is demoralising. We are very lucky that there are two excellent secondary schools in Bagenalstown, one of which was known as the vocational ETB school and is now called Coláiste Aindriú. The Minister needs to make sure what is in place is fixed for the students in the school.Why is the Minister building new schools when other schools do not have the conditions they should have?
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	23718	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-02-20 00:00:00	Business of Seanad	2	I will give a bit of context to the Senator's question. Since 2011, despite very difficult economic conditions, my Department has built 200 new schools and provided 120,000 new school places. We are providing school places at a rate of 20,000 per year because we are in the fortunate position of having a demographic bulge going through our schools. We are working very hard to meet needs but these needs are growing continuously and we need to plan ahead. The 2016-2021 plan to which the Senator referred, and in which her school is included, anticipates the needs of the future with a rolling programme which develops according to those needs. The Senator referred - rather critically - to having a national framework which looked forward ten years but she should support this process as it allows us to plan for the things that will be needed in the future, like laboratories and PE provision which we simply have not been able to provide on a stand-alone basis in recent years. I am pleased to tell the Senator that we have committed to the school in Bagenalstown which she mentioned, and we have committed to include a PE hall in the new build. We will not follow through on the very strict approach there has been to PE halls. Presentation De la Salle is a co-educational school which has had a significant growth in enrolments, from 470 to 691 pupils. We have provided additional accommodation for the school on a temporary basis across a range of needs such as home economics, science and woodwork, but the long-term plan is to construct a new school. A school site visit by my Department's architectural staff has taken place as part of the preparatory work which is required to initiate the architectural planning process for the project. The next step includes devising the schedules of accommodation for the purposes of the schools project brief, and this process is in train. When the schedules have been finalised, my Department will be in further contact with the school authorities and, as I said, pending construction of additional accommodation my Department has provided temporary accommodation to cater for its interim needs. The fact that a long-term planning process is in place shows that we anticipate the needs of schools, such as the one in Bagenalstown referred to by the Senator, and that we are in a position to plan. Every school would love its needs to be met yesterday but we are managing a tight capital budget at a time of a rapidly growing population and growing pupil numbers. We have to manage it to the best of our ability. I hope the information is of some help to the Senator.

There are 700 students with no PE hall and this is unacceptable in 2018. It does not matter what plans the Minister puts in place, our existing schools have to be fit for purpose but some of them are not. That is a major issue but the biggest issue is the lack of communication between the Department and the school, although I welcome the fact it is addressed in the plans. Can the Minister give a commitment to have more meetings with the school and communicate better with the board of management and the principal? The parents do not know what is going on with the Department nor does the principal, which is unacceptable and unfair. I ask the Minister to get in contact with the school to let it know what is happening.I ask that he will liaise with it.
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	23718	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-02-20 00:00:00	Business of Seanad	4	I take the Senator's point but as the reply states "a school site visit by my Department's architectural staff has taken place". The next step is the drawing up of the project brief and there will be further communication with the school.

#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	23718	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-02-20 00:00:00	Business of Seanad	6	There is a process in place. On the wider issue, it is important we try to give a better view of the future for all the projects because when people see a school appearing on the list they tend to think that is an automatic commitment that it will be built-----
#JenniferMurnaneOConnor	unknown-#JenniferMurnaneOConnor-party	unknown-#JenniferMurnaneOConnor-dob	unknown-#JenniferMurnaneOConnor-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-02-20 00:00:00	Business of Seanad	7	Yes.
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	23718	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-02-20 00:00:00	Business of Seanad	8	-----but that signifies it is entering into a planning phase at that stage and there is a process that follows that. We can communicate better; the Senator made a fair point in that respect. Efforts will be put in place to try to manage that better and in that way people would have a clearer view of the path ahead. This is an important project for the school. On the Senator's point about whether we are neglecting matters, a fair balance has been struck. Of the roughly 120,000 new places, a little more than half of them have been in new schools and the rest have been in existing schools, either by way of expansions or refurbishments. There is not an emphasis just solely on the new growth areas to the exclusion of others. There is a balance in the approach taken by the Department to ensure all needs are accommodated. Apart from these major programmes, there are other programmes that try to support existing schools. A positive aspect is that we can look forward in the future to growing provision to meet the needs in areas such as digital science, physical education and so on, which I believe most Senators would agree are areas for which we need to be planning.

#RoseConwayWalsh	unknown-#RoseConwayWalsh-party	unknown-#RoseConwayWalsh-dob	unknown-#RoseConwayWalsh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-02-20 00:00:00	Business of Seanad	11	I thank the Minister for coming into the Seanad to address this important issue and hopefully provide some much needed clarity to parents and those involved in Educate Together schools. While my question relates to Castlebar Educate Together national school, I am aware of difficulties and commonalities in Tuam, Tramore, New Ross and Trim. Many parents believe the Minister is trying to fix a problem that simply does not exist. All five schools have demonstrated pre-enrolment numbers for 2018-19 to accommodate a full stream and have expressed frustration and anger at the prescribed barriers to further development being applied by the Department of Education and Skills so late in the school year. These schools never opened to remain as half-stream schools and some opened with more than 13 students. Castlebar Educate Together national school and New Ross Educate Together national school were two of those. At no stage in the establishment of any of the five schools currently in this situation did the Department of Education and Skills suggest to Educate Together that they would remain as "half-stream and non-developing schools" as was outlined in recent correspondence. This correspondence appears to directly contradict the agreed terms upon which these schools opened. At no time did the Department of Education and Skills say that numbers were to be capped at 13 - this was always a minimum requirement. The decision now means parents are faced with splitting up their families. One parent I spoke to this morning has two children. One started in an Educate Together national school last year and had a most enjoyable experience through the year. His second child is due to start school in September and he has been told there will not be a place if the numbers continue to be restricted. This simply does not make sense.  The uncertainty attached to carrying out a review will obviously influence the decision of parents as to where to send their children for the next school year. In a letter from the Department of Education and Skills it was stated that national demographic exercises are to be carried out at primary and post-primary levels to identify areas of demographic growth, but this has already been done and submitted to the Department by Educate Together. Why would the Minister seek to have the same work done again? When is this duplicate report due to be completed and when will its recommendations be implemented? This is also a question about choice both for parents who want their children to attend a religious ethos school and those who prefer a non-denominational educational setting.Most of all, it is about obtaining clarity for the parents. Without it, it will be impossible for them to make the proper choices about their children's education. The programme for Government states:We need a dynamic and innovative education system that reflects the diversity of Twenty First Century Ireland. We will strengthen parental choice and diversity in our school system, reflecting the need in modern Ireland for new forms of multi-denominational and non-denominational education, while also safeguarding the right of parents to send their children to denominational schools that offer a distinct religious ethos, should they so wish.I know that the relationship between Castlebar Educate Together national school and the other national schools in the area is healthy, productive and inclusive. The schools were set up in urban areas where there would be no effect on existing schools. That the State must intervene and force parents to choose a religious education in order to "preserve a balance among all schools in an area and to ensure that one school is not expanding at the expense of another" is not the rationale one would expect in a democratic republic.
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	23718	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-02-20 00:00:00	Business of Seanad	12	I thank the Senator for raising this matter. It dates back well before my time to 2012 and the report of the advisory group to the forum on patronage and pluralism in the primary sector which recommended that demand for patronage diversity be met in areas with a stable population by divesting patronage of existing schools where there was evidence of parental demand for change. In that context, in 2012-13 my Department undertook surveys in 43 areas. The surveys were carried out as part of the patronage divestment process put in place by the former Minister Ruairí Quinn. In 28 areas, including Castlebar, a sufficient demand for more choice was established. The divestment process was always conditional on property becoming available from existing schools. The establishment of Castlebar Educate Together national school as a four classroom school has its origins in the report which indicated a size of at least half a single stream school, comprising four classrooms, being required to accommodate parental demand in the area. As part of the patronage divestment process, a school could be opened where a school building became, or was due to become, available as a result of an amalgamation or the closure of an existing school. In some areas, in responding to demand for diversity where existing patrons were unable to make school properties available, the Department also included an examination of properties held in public ownership. That was the background in Castlebar where a school was suggested but deemed to be unsuitable. In that case, a property owned by Mayo County Council - Marsh House - was obtained from it and the Department arranged for refurbishment works to be undertaken to facilitate Castlebar Educate Together national school to operate from there and provide four classrooms and ancillary accommodation for it. It is a general policy of the Department that schools, irrespective of their location, have to operate within their available accommodation and manage annual pupil intake accordingly. The initial establishment of Castlebar Educate Together national school as a four classroom school and the need to be cognisant of managing the available accommodation have been reflected in my Department's engagement with the patron body of the school. When the school raised the issue of expanding its enrolment, my Department invited Educate Together to submit a case to it in that regard. Expanding the enrolment of the school would mean that the accommodation currently provided would no longer be suitable. A case has been submitted by Educate Together to further expand Castlebar Educate Together national school and four other schools under the patronage of Educate Together which opened as part of the patronage divestment process. As outlined by the Senator, they are New Ross Educate Together national school, Trim Educate Together national school, Tuam Educate Together national school and Tramore Educate Together national school. The case is under consideration within the Department. The Senator has indicated that my Department is carrying out a nationwide demographic exercise and asked if it is duplicating the work done by Educate Together. The work is being done by the Department based on the very best databases available in the country. It is looking at 314 separate planning areas and using up-to-date data for child benefit payments, school enrolments, preschool enrolments and other matters. It is a very sophisticated forecasting.The Department sits down with the local authorities to assess the projected levels of property or housing development in their areas so it can factor them in. Therefore, this is not a question of Educate Together providing data and the Department seeking in some way to duplicate it; this is a planning exercise carried out in all 314 planning areas. I was speaking to Senator Murnane O'Connor in this regard. The exercise is designed to ensure we anticipate areas of need, plan for the new schools in the areas of expansion and have a patronage exercise whereby parents would decide what would happen in the event of what I describe. I fully agree with Senator Conway-Walsh that we need to respond to the changing nature and make-up of this country. We are doing so in respect of a range of issues. We are reforming the admissions legislation. My intention is that religion will not be used as a criterion for selection in the vast majority of schools. I am making a new provision whereby children who do not want to participate in religious instruction in a denominational school will have clear programmes. These will be stated in the admissions policy. I am seeking to introduce a parent and student charter, which will involve legislation. Let me return to the issue of patronage. The initiative of 2012 to divest based on amalgamations and closures has proven to be a very inflexible model. It has generated only ten cases in the relevant period. I am considering a new approach to try to encourage patronage transfer. The original proposal of the patronage group was to see patronage transfer from existing schools to new schools. The new approach I am proposing would see live transfers so a school would transfer from an existing patron to a new patron without requiring closure or amalgamation. We hope this will be an easier system to adopt. It will be done through surveys by the local community-influenced education and training board. On the substantive point, my Department is reviewing the requests from Educate Together. I have given the background. I note the point the Senator made. Generally, the Department's policy has been not to provide for the growth of a very popular school that is growing very rapidly if there are empty places in neighbouring schools that are not so popular. That restriction has been based simply on the money available. We do not have the ability to build schools when there are empty places elsewhere. That has been the general policy; it is not a special policy to disadvantage Educate Together in some way. As I stated, we will review the submissions made to us.
#RoseConwayWalsh	unknown-#RoseConwayWalsh-party	unknown-#RoseConwayWalsh-dob	unknown-#RoseConwayWalsh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-02-20 00:00:00	Business of Seanad	13	When will the review be completed and when will the recommendations be implemented? The Minister said, in reference to transferring patronage, that we must be honest and admit the system has not worked. We must also be honest and admit that the Educate Together schools do appear to be working. They are demand led and they are what families want in the areas in question. This speaks for itself. In Article 42 of the Constitution, it is provided that the State shall not oblige parents, in violation of their conscience and lawful preference, to send their children to schools established by the State or to any particular type of school designated by the State. On legal grounds, these restrictions would need to be lifted with immediate effect, and buildings should be provided to allow the schools to cater for the growing demand that exists under this inclusive school model. I accept the Minister's point that nobody wants to see a school left without pupils, or the number of pupils being reduced, but the areas in question were specifically picked as urban areas in which there are sufficient numbers of children to do as proposed. Whatever review is to be carried out needs to be carried out in a very timely way, and the recommendations need to be implemented. Within the review, it is crucial that the Minister speaks not only to the local authority and other bodies but also to the parents and families who are most affected.
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	23718	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-02-20 00:00:00	Business of Seanad	14	There is a huge surge in demand for non-denominational schools but we must begin from a starting point where 95% of schools are denominational. The State honours its commitment to provide free primary education through that structure.The constitutional provision is that no child should be forced to take religion in their class. There is not a provision, however, which states every parent should get the school of their choice. Such a provision, unfortunately, would be unworkable. I fully acknowledge the quality of the Educate Together model. I also commend the Foras Pátrúnachta and the Gaelscoil model, as well as the education and training boards' community and national schools. These are all multidenominational models with different approaches and are excellent in their approach. I strongly commend them. Virtually every new primary school which I and my colleagues before me have built has gone to non-denominational patrons. There is no question about parental preference. The model that is driving this is transfer of patronage. The old model through amalgamation, divestiture and selling off has proved difficult to deliver. Complemented by a new model, we are hoping we can get greater progress. On the specific situation concerning the schools which developed under that model, I will look at the case being put forward. I cannot say when that review will be completed at this point. The Department will have to see the demographic numbers in each area, as well as issues around feasibility of accommodation solutions and the nature of available space elsewhere. Ideally, we would like to see patronage transferred to new patrons, including in areas such as these. I thank the Senator for raising this issue. I know it is an issue of particular concern to parents which we are taking seriously.
#KieranODonnell	unknown-#KieranODonnell-party	unknown-#KieranODonnell-dob	unknown-#KieranODonnell-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-02-20 00:00:00	Business of Seanad	15	I thank the Cathaoirleach for allowing this matter to be raised in the House. This long-standing matter came to my attention when a constituent came to me about a whole-of-life assurance policy he had taken out ten years previously when he was 80 years of age. It was a policy of around €100,000. When he reached 90 years of age, the policy was reviewed. By this stage, he had paid 1.3 times the value of the life cover into the fund. He was informed by the insurance company that if he did not continue to make annual contributions to this whole-of-life policy, it would have no value and the policy would die. When he was buying the policy, his impression was that he would pay into it over several years and there would be an investment element to it. Effectively, it would come to a point where it would have an investment value which would link in with the life cover. In the main, these policies are held by people of a more mature age. People are under the misapprehension that they are buying an investment product with life cover. Instead, it would appear to have all the aspects of a rip-off. Suddenly, before they know it, it becomes purely a life cover policy whereby, if they do not continue to pay exorbitant premiums every year, their policy dies. Someone could have a life cover of €100,000 year but, if they lived to a ripe old age, could have paid €200,000 into the policy. Will the Minister of State commit the Department to undertake a review around this area?In this particular case, he would have gone to the Financial Services Ombudsman but got no satisfaction of any degree. There are three aspects. Where does the review stand, how does the Minister of State believe it can be addressed and what does he think of the Financial Services and Pensions Ombudsman's remit with regard to people having recourse to the Financial Services and Pensions Ombudsman, where substance would be placed over legal form? In reality, policies are being sold with all the benefits for the insurance company and all the losses and risks for the person being insured. Surely that is not fair.
#MichaelWDArcy	unknown-#MichaelWDArcy-party	unknown-#MichaelWDArcy-dob	unknown-#MichaelWDArcy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-02-20 00:00:00	Business of Seanad	16	These products are designed to cover policyholders for their entire lifetime or for as long as the policyholder wishes to continue to pay premiums. To decipher that, there is, in effect, no such thing as a whole-of-life policy in that the policy is reviewed every five years. That is the net effect of what is happening. A consumer who has made a formal complaint to a financial institution and is not satisfied with the outcome may go to the Financial Services and Pensions Ombudsman to have it investigated independently. The ombudsman is independent in the performance of his statutory functions. A role of the ombudsman is to investigate, mediate and adjudicate complaints about the conduct of regulated financial service providers. As the Senator may be aware, the Financial Services and Pensions Ombudsman Act 2017 which commenced on 1 January 2018 established the Financial Services and Pensions Ombudsman. The legislation provides the FSPO with various powers to determine jurisdiction of a complaint. Complaints of conduct against a financial service provider must be about conduct which occurred during or after 2002. Although the sale of a product prior to 2002 is not a bar in itself to investigation by the ombudsman of conduct which occurred after 2002, it is important to note that the legislative provisions governing the power of the ombudsman to investigate such complaints are complex. Section 51 of the Act prescribes a period of six years for the making of a complaint to the FSPO that does not relate to a long-term financial service. Complaints about long-term financial services can be made to the FSPO within whichever of the following periods is the last to expire. One is six years from the date of the conduct giving rise to the complaint, so if one found out about this circumstance at a certain stage when someone was getting older and the premiums raised so much that it was obvious that the person could not continue to pay his or her premiums, it would be six years starting from that period. Another is three years from the earlier of the date on which the person making the complaint became aware or ought reasonably to have become aware of the conduct giving rise to the complaint. A third is such longer period as the ombudsman may allow where it appears to him or her that there are reasonable grounds for requiring a longer period and that it would be just and equitable in all the circumstances to extend the period. It should be noted that the long-term financial service should not have expired or otherwise been terminated more than six years before the date the complaint is made. It should also be noted that the ombudsman must be cognisant of the provisions of section 52 of the Act which prescribe that he may decline to investigate a complaint where, in his opinion, the conduct complained of occurred at too remote a time to justify investigation. As I have stated, the ombudsman is independent and each complaint is dealt with on its own merits and there may be a number of aspects to this. Officials in the Department of Finance are examining whole-of-life policies as they present, by their nature, atypical customer protection issues which may not become fully apparent for many years. This examination has only recently commenced. Once this examination is complete, the Department will provide technical advice to the Minister on whether legislative change should be considered. It will then be a matter for the Minister and Government to make policy decisions.

Based on my experience with these policies, I think legislative change will be required. These policies are being sold as whole-of-life. As the Minister of State said, there is a review every five years. An element which is not pointed out is that people, particularly older people, pay an exorbitant premium, with many taking out the policies, traditionally known as section 60 policies, to pay for inheritance tax on their deaths to ensure that beneficiaries are not caught by liabilities.Suddenly, they find themselves in a situation where the amount they have paid into the fund is far in excess of the value of the policy. Legislation must be introduced to provide for such situations. If people take out such policies which are deemed to be whole-of-life policies, they must get to a point where if they have paid an amount into the fund that is higher than the value of the policy, they should not be required to make further contributions.

For example, there are people with policies worth less than €100,000 who have paid in over €100,000 and the premium is now €10,000 or €12,000 a year. There is a substantial case to be investigated and my Department has recently started to look into the matter. It has to consult stakeholders. I tried to get a date on which they would come back to me on it. I did not get one, but I am requesting that it be done before the summer in order that these matters can be brought to a conclusion and decided on by the Financial Services and Pensions Ombudsman. I have an issue with the mis-selling of products. I am not saying this is the mis-selling of a product, but none of the people I have met knew or understood that every five years there would be a review and a ramping up of premia as they got older. The difference in premia for people aged between 75 and 80 years and those between 80 and 85-----

#LorraineCliffordLee	unknown-#LorraineCliffordLee-party	unknown-#LorraineCliffordLee-dob	unknown-#LorraineCliffordLee-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-02-20 00:00:00	Business of Seanad	21	My Commencement matter concerns a slip road onto the M1 at Donabate. The villages of Donabate and Portrane are situated on a peninsula in north County Dublin and have a combined population of approximately 9,000. There is significant ongoing development and approximately 4,000 new housing units are planned in the not too distant future. The construction of the national forensic hospital on the St. Ita's Hospital site is well under way and it is thought it will be operational at the start of 2020. Over 500 staff will be employed in the new hospital. The largest building in Ireland is the Tesco distribution centre in Donabate. It measures 78,000 sq. m in size on a 40 acre site. Over 1,000 employees are based at the distribution centre from where goods are distributed across Ireland and Europe. There is a significant volume of traffic in the area because of the centre and the large population living on the peninsula. This trend is set to continue once the national forensic hospital is fully operational and the extra 4,000 housing units are built in the area.  Around the time the Tesco distribution centre was built ten years ago, it was envisaged that a slip road would be built close to it at the top of Turvey Avenue. That project should be looked at again as the slip road was not constructed at the time. There is significant pressure on the M1 slipway at Hearse Road.There are significant tailbacks there at particular pressure points. This M1 slipway off the top of Turvey Avenue, as was envisaged at the time, should be seriously considered now. As it will just be a slip road and not a bridge, the outlay will be very much contained. Not only would the population of Donabate and Portrane benefit from this, commuters from Rush, Lusk and Skerries feeding into the current slip road onto the M1 would be diverted through this before they hit the roundabout at the top of the Hearse Road. It is a simple piece of infrastructure that would have a significant positive impact on people's lives there. Fingal County Council received €8.5 million at the time of the development of the Tesco distribution centre. That money should be used to relieve the pressure on the local population. While speaking about the infrastructure on the peninsula, I also mention the severe lack of pedestrian footpaths and cycle lanes in the area. I welcome that the new distributor road, which has just started construction, will have cycle lanes. However, once the cyclists come off the distributor road onto the Hearse Road, they will be met by a large volume of traffic on what is in effect a country road. Cycle lanes should be introduced on the Hearse Road and around the peninsula in general. A large population now lives there without adequate footpaths for pedestrians. The lack of cycle lanes on the Hearse Road makes it very dangerous for cyclists and causes considerable tailbacks on the Hearse Road. That will intensify when the distributor road opens and when the extra population arrives on the peninsula. The population cannot grow as rapidly as it is currently growing in the area without proper infrastructure being put in place. I appeal to the Minister to consider introducing such an M1 slipway which would have a massive impact on the area for a very small outlay. North County Dublin is the fastest growing area in the country and we need proper infrastructure.
#ShaneRoss	unknown-#ShaneRoss-party	unknown-#ShaneRoss-dob	unknown-#ShaneRoss-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-02-20 00:00:00	Business of Seanad	22	As Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, I have responsibility for the overall policy and funding of the national roads programme. The planning, design and implementation of individual national road projects is a matter for Transport Infrastructure Ireland under the Roads Acts 1993 to 2015 in conjunction with the local authorities concerned. Within its capital budget, the assessment and prioritisation of individual projects is a matter in the first instance for TII in accordance with section 19 of the Roads Act. Donabate is served by the M1 Lissenhall interchange which connects to the R132 and R126. A major upgrade of this interchange was completed in 2013. The improvement and maintenance of regional and local roads in the Donabate area is a statutory function of the local authority in accordance with the provisions of section 13 of the Roads Act 1993. While any proposal on the construction of an additional slip road to serve Donabate would be a matter in the first instance for Fingal County Council, as the road authority concerned, it would also need to be considered within a wider transport planning framework. In this context the National Transport Authority’s transport strategy for the greater Dublin area, GDA, sets the overarching policy framework for transport infrastructure development in the region. This strategy examines the future national, regional and local road network as part of its consideration of a strategy aimed at addressing urban congestion and improving the efficiency and sustainability of the urban transport system in the GDA. The strategy sets out principles for road development in the GDA, including that alternative solutions such as public transport provision, traffic management or demand management measures cannot effectively and satisfactorily address the road proposal or are not applicable or appropriate together, that each proposed road scheme is consistent with the strategy and Government policy, and that each scheme does not diminish in any significant way the expected beneficial outcome of the strategy. As part of a corridor options appraisal, the strategy considers the measures needed to meet travel demand on the economic Drogheda to Dublin city corridor. While the strategy does refer to the need for a distributor road around Donabate, it focuses primarily on public transport options and improved rail services.This is reflected in the national development plan launched last week, which makes provision for the delivery of priority elements of the DART expansion programme, including the electrification of existing lines. This is to include electrification of the rail line to Drogheda.

It was first announced in September 2015 but we are still waiting for it to happen and as such, with respect, I have to take what the Minister says with a pinch of salt. He is the Minister with responsibility for transport policy. This slip road, which was supposed to be delivered ten years ago, could be easily delivered now. I ask the Minister to review this project with a view to including it in the transport framework and to liaise on this matter with Fingal County Council and the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, who also has a role to play in the delivery of this slip road. North County Dublin and, in particular, Donabate, is absorbing a lot of the housing need of Dublin and we need adequate infrastructure. Along with the much-promised DART expansion, we need this slip road delivered to ease the pressure in Donabate.

I raised the first of these last week, the prospective sale by Permanent TSB of €4 billion of a non-performing loan book to unregulated vulture funds. I put on record my objection to this prospective sale. I note the Taoiseach's comments during Leaders' Questions in the Dáil, when he intimated the sale may not be to vulture funds but rather another national bank. I would like to hear more about that and I would welcome an elaboration by the Taoiseach. However, I urge the Government to take on board and enact the Fianna Fáil Bill relating to vulture funds, which would ensure all banks acting within the State are bound by Central Bank regulatory standards. We cannot have a position where one family's mortgage is governed by one set of rules while the mortgage of the family next door is not.These are not merely figures on a balance sheet. Families, small businesses and farmers will be affected by the sale. At present, the Central Bank cannot govern unregulated banks. Therefore, consumers who have loans that have been categorised as non-performing are in a very vulnerable position. The Minister knew there would be an outcry and that is why he flagged this matter to the Cabinet last week. I call on him today to use his powers as a shareholder to object to the sale during his powers of consultation. The second item I wish to raise today is the supervised drug injection centre on Merchant's Quay. Last week, I learned that the centre will be opened in Dublin. It is one of the first such centres in the country and is located in the heart of the constituency of the Minister of State at the Department of Health, Deputy Catherine Byrne. I call on her to come in here and tell us what assurances have been given to the local community to ensure that the centre does not become a hub of anti-social behaviour and does not have an adverse influence on the residential hinterland. Dublin South Central, and in particular the south inner city, seems to be a dumping ground for such services. Would the centre be opened without objection or concern in the leafy suburbs of Ballsbridge? We all know that the answer is no. Communities and schools located close to the centre are concerned about health and safety. I ask the Leader to arrange a debate on the matter in this House, without delay. I ask the Minister of State to update the House in a few months on how the facility is being managed, maintained and operated. The third item I wish to raise is cancer care. I have raised the issue on previous occasions and I shall do so again today. We have an excellent record in cancer care and we are on our third national cancer strategy, which is something we should be very proud of. However, I am truly disappointed to learn about the cases of misdiagnosis at St. James's Hospital, which is my local hospital. As we know, this matter will be highlighted in tonight's episode of "RTÉ Investigates". My heart goes out to the patients who are dealing with the consequences of misdiagnosis. I have first-hand experience of the top-class service given in St. James's Hospital as my father was a patient for 15 years. I cannot fault the professional care that he received. It is awful to learn that the care given at the hospital has deteriorated. As I have previously mentioned, patients at the hospital who were in remission did not receive quarterly scans. As a result, they did not get the quick diagnosis and treatment that they deserved. I have also raised the issue of the increased waiting times for people who have received a diagnosis of cancer but have been unable to start chemotherapy treatments in a timely fashion. These delays, the delays in commencing treatment and the delayed scans have caused a great amount of fear and upset for patients and their supportive families. I call on the Minister for Health to attend the House today to show us how he has prioritised and committed to ensure that the cancer strategy is implemented properly nationwide. I urge him to give us a detailed report about what he knows about the cases of misdiagnosis at St. James's Hospital.
#JoanFreeman	unknown-#JoanFreeman-party	unknown-#JoanFreeman-dob	unknown-#JoanFreeman-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-02-20 00:00:00	Business of Seanad	28	I wish to bring one issue to the attention of Senators. I want them to think of instances of overcrowding in everyday life. It could be on our buses, on the Luas or in our children's classrooms. While we object to such overcrowding, and it is uncomfortable to say the least, I want Senators to imagine an overcrowded psychiatric ward. I mean a ward where there is enough space for 44 people but, in fact, 50 people have been crammed in. These are people who are in St. Luke's psychiatric unit in Kilkenny. Those residents are not people who attend school, who are in receipt of education or who travel from one space to another. These are people who have enduring illnesses and are in very serious and deep distress. They are crammed into a situation not only where there are not enough beds but where one patient had to sleep on a mattress that had been placed on the floor. Not only am I thinking of the patients, I am thinking also of the staff who must work in these units. The psychiatric nurses who work in Waterford and Kilkenny have decided to commence an industrial dispute and not to operate non-nursing duties. I applaud them for doing so because we will never ever see an improvement unless people stand up, complain and go on strike. I remember my mother going on strike when I was growing up. Every now and then she would down tools, walk upstairs and read a book on her bed because she was disgusted by something that her husband or children had done. Everyone in the household would then scurry around the house to do something that delighted her again so that she would come back and be a mother to us.This is what those poor unfortunate psychiatric nurses in Waterford and Kilkenny are doing now. They are saying that enough is enough. The HSE talks about the recruitment and retention of staff. Perhaps it should just stop complaining and making excuses and look at the real problem, which is the redeployment of staff there, the use of agency staff, overtime and the reliance on the goodwill of overstretched permanent staff. It is that alone. The psychiatric nurses, both men and women, are asked at the end of a long shift to stay on for longer and it is their goodwill, resilience and care and love for humanity, particularly for the patients in their wards, which make them stay and look after them further. We have to stop this. Once again, I am glad to support the psychiatric nurses in Waterford and Kilkenny. They have my undivided attention. If they would like me to visit to see their desperate situation, I would be happy to do so.

Like my colleagues in the Civil Engagement group, I came to the Seanad from the world of activism. In my case it was ten years on Greenpeace ships combatting nuclear weapons and nuclear waste in the Pacific, Atlantic and Indian oceans. At that time nuclear power was an incredibly expensive and centralised way of producing power and it was marred by waste disposal and nuclear material proliferation issues. Sadly, all these concerns remain and the plans for the new reactor at Hinkley Point make a lie of the small government image of the Tory Party in the UK. Nuclear power is incredibly expensive, difficult to secure and still has all the attendant waste disposal issues of the past. In fact, it is such an expensive way to make power that one must wonder if the UK Government has other reasons for pushing such projects, such as providing new materials for weapons that should be confined to the dustbin of history. However, that is a discussion for another time. My primary concern in raising the issue today is the news that local authorities will be opening public consultation on our reaction to the plans for the new plant, one that is only 500 km from our capital city and which would impact on our entire economy and society in the case of a serious incident. What particularly disturbs me is that recent legal challenges to the plan with regard to its compliance with the Espoo Convention succeeded not because of the intervention or activity of the Irish Government but because of complaints lodged by Norwegian and Dutch citizens. Now, it will be up to Irish citizens to step up to the plate and have their concerns heard, without any signal of support from the Irish Government. Irish Governments, both Fianna Fáil led and Fine Gael led, used to have a proud record of vocal opposition to the dangers posed by Sellafield and other UK nuclear facilities in the 1980s and 1990s. That led to significant improvements in the operation of those facilities, but now we appear to have lost our voice. Will the Leader explain why that is the case? Will the Irish Government put forward a submission in this regard? With the UK about to leave the EU it has indicated that it is also leaving the EURATOM Treaty, its last link to a common approach on information and safety with regard to nuclear power. We will have to find our voice again on this issue sooner or later, and I believe the time is now.
#RoseConwayWalsh	unknown-#RoseConwayWalsh-party	unknown-#RoseConwayWalsh-dob	unknown-#RoseConwayWalsh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-02-20 00:00:00	Business of Seanad	31	I wish to express my support of Senator Grace O'Sullivan's comments and concerns about Hinkley power plant. It is very important that submissions are made. Perhaps we should consider making a submission from this House on such a serious situation. We can discuss that in an informal way, but it is very important that the voices of Irish citizens are heard. I doubt that there would be much deviation from any of the submissions that would be made. Today I wish to speak about the sale of the recent sale of mortgages to vulture funds.I have spoken about this many times, as I am a member of the Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, and Taoiseach. These are the very same vulture funds which have continuously refused to appear before the committee saying that they are adhering to the code of conduct of the Central Bank of Ireland. The most recent round of sales by Permanent TSB is shocking in its scale of €4 billion. There has been a lot of reaction in the Seanad and across the political spectrum but very little firm political commitment to solving the problem. Let me stress that legislation is needed as well as political pressure. In terms of political pressure, the Minister for Finance, as the majority shareholder, can tell State-owned banks not to permit further sales to vulture funds. Practical legislation is also required and in 2015, the Fine Gael and Labour Party Government failed to put in place the proper regulation of the vulture funds. Its legislation centred only the middle man or the credit servicing firm. That has given rise to all kinds of issues where the owner of the credit gets off the hook, but my Sinn Féin colleague, Deputy Pearse Doherty, attempted to make sure that the owners of the vulture funds were fully regulated but our amendment was voted down on Committee Stage in May 2015 by both the Fine Gael and the Labour Party, with the members of the Fianna Fáil Party not turning up for the vote. A Programme for a Partnership Government states: "We will provide greater protection for mortgage holders and tenants and SMEs whose loans have been transferred to non-regulated entities (‘vulture funds’). (Year 1 Action)." This commitment is classed as a "Year 1 action", but I do not see much evidence of any major progress so far since the programme was signed up for. The same promise is contained in the confidence and supply agreement, which Fianna Fáil has signed up to. Will the Minister for Finance come to the Chamber because I wish to ask him what the Government plans are to deal with the vulture funds in the long term? The issue is that long-term products are being sold to short-term entities which want to make a quick buck, and many millions of bucks. As a result, the vultures are not interested in sustainable solutions but in cashing in, one way or another. Until this is done, many homes, businesses and farms will be under threat of maverick action by these vulture funds. If there is a write down to be done, it needs to be with the homeowner. Giving a write down to vulture funds is absolutely nonsensical and it is an exploitation of Irish citizens.
#GeraldNash	unknown-#GeraldNash-party	unknown-#GeraldNash-dob	unknown-#GeraldNash-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-02-20 00:00:00	Business of Seanad	32	I voice my support for Senator Grace O'Sullivan's expression of concern on Hinkley Point C plant. It certainly used to be the practice that successive Irish Governments would engage very actively on matters pertaining to nuclear power, nuclear energy and the location and development of nuclear reactors in the UK. I recall back in the mid-1990s, when my former colleague, the then Minister of State, Emmet Stagg, had responsibility for energy matters, that he directly represented the views of the Government at an oral hearing in Cumbria on developments in the UK. That is something we should encourage. The concerns of the Irish public should be communicated directly to the British Government on Hinkley Point C at a bilateral level and multilateral level in the context of the European Union. May I request a debate on the recently published Project Ireland 2040? This is a pivotal set of proposals that will dictate jobs and investment and the provision of public services in the country, not just for the next 20 years but for the next 30 to 40 years. It is my firm view that the plan is not sufficiently resourced. Since the publication of the plan we have read that the dedicated resources amount to approximately €115 billion, but when one scratches beneath the surface, the dedicated resources amount to about €91 billion, nothing near the €115 billion that we have been fed by the strategic communications unit that now seems to operate hand in glove with the Fine Gael press office. In reality, if the Government decided it was not going to introduce the type of tax breaks it is talking about, we would have the additional resources we need to provide the type of schools, hospitals and other public services that we need.We would have the additional €15 billion to €25 billion that is required to ensure the Irish people get the public services they demand and are entitled to expect in a decent republic. Since Friday, we have been treated to an orgy of public relations stunts from the Fine Gael Party in the guise of the strategic communications unit. I went to the cinema on Sunday evening to watch a great Martin McDonagh film, "Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri". When I was going home, I expected to see three billboards outside Drogheda telling me how great the national planning framework is for Drogheda.

I want to speak more forcefully on the issue of newspaper articles comparing the metro to a Luas or a tram. Those who know their onions with regard to transport will be aware that the Luas carries between 6,000 and 8,000 passengers per hour and unfortunately is interrupted by traffic, whereas the metro will be able to carry 20,000 passengers an hour and will not be interrupted by traffic.

It will carry 30 million passengers per annum. The estimated level of demand for metro services is 17,000 passengers per hour. As I have said, it will have a capacity of 20,000 passengers per hour. This project is not just about connecting the airport, Swords and the greater Fingal area to the city; it is also about increasing the flow of people to and from the city. It is now proposed that the metro will extend right across to the south of the city as well. This will lead to much greater connectivity. Enough land has been zoned near the town of Swords to facilitate the addition of the equivalent of a town the size of Balbriggan. There is a proposed metro stop adjacent to the zoned land. In addition, a metro park and ride facility will be available for that whole area and indeed for Louth and east Meath. As I have said, Swords could cope with 33,000 new houses, or 100,000 people. That is what the land is zoned for. Dublin Airport had 30 million visitors last year and 32 million visitors are expected this year. We need to give them connectivity. Dublin Airport is one of the few airports in Europe, and perhaps the only airport serving a capital city, that does not have a rail connection straight into the city centre. This project is a win-win-win. Dublin Airport has been a super success story under this Government and its predecessor and we want that to continue. We do not want to see it lost. The most recent cost-benefit analysis that was done on the metro project showed that for every €1 that is spent, we will get €2 in revenue. My message to the naysayers who do not know the difference between the tram, the Luas and the metro is "build it and they will come". For once, can we put facilities in place in our city and in Fingal before and as houses are built? By putting them in place years later, we leave our people with a poorer quality of life.

It concluded its work in January 2017 and made several key recommendations which, in its qualified opinion, were necessary in order that the rising spiral of insurance premiums could be tackled once and for all. I am disappointed to say that, over one year later, we are still waiting for key recommendations to be put in place in several areas. One concerns the establishment of a database of uninsured drivers who were involved in approximately 2,700 accidents in 2017. As insured drivers know, we are all paying for uninsured drivers. It is shameful that one year after it was made we are still awaiting implementation of the recommendation of the expert group that there be a database of uninsured drivers. As the Leader will agree, this is a very serious issue. People are at the end of their tether with year-on-year increases in insurance premiums. I ask him to use his good offices to ensure the recommendations of the expert group will be implemented immediately in order that people will see some reduction in their premiums, rather than being fearful of year-on-year increases.

A couple of things must be remembered in that regard as there are two sides to the story. Some people over-extended themselves and owe money which they should be required to pay, if they have it. However, we should not forget the circumstances in which the credit in question was extended to many people. They were extended credit at a time when loans up to 110% of the value of their property were available and in a vastly overheated property market. The banks were chasing people to take out loans. We have not forgotten the letters that arrived unsolicited through our letter boxes offering us cheap credit here, there and everywhere.

I am fully in favour of a reasonable, rational approach to working out how ordinary owners of small and medium-sized enterprises and homeowners can be properly protected. The public should be informed of the nominal value of the loans being sold and the consideration received for them, particularly in the case of banks which were aided by public money. In other words, there should be a clear indication of the extent of discounting------

I hope that whatever accommodation is reached by the two parties to the confidence and supply agreement will facilitate the public in being entitled to know the extent of the discounting taking place.

With it, three more nuclear power plants are planned in England. It is, therefore, time for the Government to act. Like everyone else, I will speak about Permanent TSB and the 20,000 family home loans which will be sold to vulture funds and banks. I spoke about this issue a number of months ago and Deputy Bernard J. Durkan has proposed legislation on it to the Minister. There is the proposed sale of €4 billion worth of residential mortgages at discount prices which would cause chaos for the families concerned. Customers rang Permanent TSB yesterday to ask if their mortgages were being sold. They were told that they would receive letters if their mortgages were sold. The courts are not able to cope with these cases and it will cause chaos if the vulture funds get into the market. Cases are being adjourned because judges to do not want to put families out onto the street. I attended the courthouse in Trim a couple of months ago when 90 cases were adjourned. None of them was dealt with. I recently dealt with a person whose mortgage had been taken over by a vulture fund. The lady concerned who had a young family had offered to pay €500 a month. It had not been accepted and the house was sold for €80,000. She then had to be housed by the local authority and the taxpayer has had to put up €700 a month under the housing assistance payment, HAP, scheme. We bailed out Permanent TSB in one shape; it will flog everything and the taxpayer will have to come along and dish out again.

Like many other mothers throughout the country, her mother knew about the effectiveness of downing tools to get a reaction. Unfortunately, it has taken such a decision to get a reaction. This is not about seeking an increase in pay but about their conditions and the conditions faced by vulnerable patients. I commend the Oireachtas Library and Research Service for producing the document I received in the post this morning. I am sure everyone else received it, too. It is entitled, Spotlight: Homecare for Older People - Seven Policy Challenges. I spoke to those who work in the service and they told me that they set priorities each year. Prudently and wisely, they foresaw the need to carry out research in the area of home care and produced this document which sets out the challenges this House and the country will have to address. It is a developing sector, with a year-on-year increase of 20,000 people over the age of 65 years. The sector is largely unchallenged and lacks a national policy framework. We need to deal with the issue.There is discussion of the matter and the Government has plans to put home care services on a statutory basis or an equal footing to hospital and nursing home care services. Will the Leader ask the Minister to update us on the public consultation process taking place on home care services and home care packages for elderly and disabled persons, in particular?
#JohnDolan	unknown-#JohnDolan-party	unknown-#JohnDolan-dob	unknown-#JohnDolan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-02-20 00:00:00	Business of Seanad	84	I wrote to the Taoiseach yesterday following the welcome decision made on 30 January that the Government would ratify the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities. Following that decision, there was a statement from the Minister of State, Deputy Finian McGrath, indicating that by mid-February a resolution would be passed in the Dáil to give effect to the decision and that by the end of February the instrument of ratification would be deposited with the United Nations. I am not being fussy about a couple of days, but after the 11 years we have had to wait, it is important that we keep the pressure on. I am certainly asking the Leader to do anything he can in that regard. I hope the resolution will be before the Dáil on Tuesday or Wednesday of next week. There is no question but that all entities and parties in both Houses in the run-up to the last general election showed their agreement with ratification of the convention. We have already heard Senator Joan Freeman talk about the related issue of mental health. Let us be clear: it forms part of the convention and is relevant for people with all manner of disabilities and conditions. Apart from those who have a primary issue with mental health, there are many people with disabilities whose mental health can be vulnerable at times. Sadly, memory serves me well on the issue of the nuclear plant in the United Kingdom. There is a correlation between it and clusters of critical illnesses and disabilities among children in the north east of this country. I use the word "correlation" but will say no more than it. Concerns arise about these matters. I appeal to the Leader to give any support or encouragement he can to ensure the Government will keep moving on the issue of ratification of the convention.

Not only do I support it, but I would also like to have a debate, with the Minister for Health or the Minister for Education and Skills, on the campaign to have defibrillators placed in every primary and secondary school throughout the country. In my village of Stepaside a defibrillator is located on an outside wall between the pharmacy and the general practitioner's surgery. It has been used three times in the past year to save lives. The more we have defibrillators available, the more lives can be saved. This is a key issue on which those of us in the Seanad can lead. I call on the Leader to arrange a debate on it.

We will hear all of the technical debate on Basel II, the impairment of our balance sheets and the ratio of loans to assets in the banks. As it has come down the road from the European Union, we cannot be oblivious to it. We were quick to deliver NAMA to large enterprises, banks, large developers and everyone else it suited at the time. Why can the common person not have a NAMA? It is the common-sense way forward. Certainly, the banks have to look after the balance sheets, but they could be dealt with through a special vehicle to deal with all impaired loans. That is all. I simply wanted to comment on that matter. The national development plan was unveiled last week with great fanfare, press and photo shoots, but I missed the exact details. All I heard was about Ardee and Drogheda from Senator Gerald Nash, but I missed that part of it. The amount of infrastructure to be built and planned is immense, as is the related detail.I have one query for the Leader. There are 60 blocklayers and 27 plasterers in apprenticeship schemes. Who will build everything? Unless the infrastructure is virtual, how will it be built? It is not possible. We previously discussed apprenticeship schemes. They were supposed to be ramped up, but that has not happened. The issue has been talked about for the past two years. We will have to tackle the issue head-on or it will not progress.  We met representatives from the Association of Irish Local Government, AILG, today. The Leader has worked hard on this issue. Nearly 60% of councillors are now worse off than they were before the new deal on pay and conditions was implemented. It is hard to fathom. They are the figures supplied by the AILG. I know the Minister of State, Deputy John Paul Phelan, has done a lot of work on this and intends to do a lot more. The sooner we can make progress with this the better for everyone.

I agree with Senator McDowell that the public deserves to know the full extent of non-performing loans across all of the banks, not just those which were bailed out but also those which are regulated by the Central Bank. Many issues around banking have failed to be resolved. The problems we are encountering now will occur again because everything is cyclical. The banks are dealing with the provision of loans in exactly the same manner as they did ten years ago just before the boom. All of the national newspapers are subscribing to this because they are all advertising loans and houses. The same thing is beginning to happen again. Why are some banks offering clinics at 7 a.m. or 8 a.m. on a Saturday where people can order mortgages? Why are banks beginning to write to people again? There is a need to scrutinise what has occurred and what we can learn from it. There is also a need to look at our education system and educate people before they take out a mortgage about the consequences of default. A regular mortgage in my county of €200,000 over 30 years at the current variable rate of about 3.6% would result in interest payable of €130,500. The banks are fleecing the ordinary consumers who they are there to serve. The taxpayer has bailed out some of these institutions and will do so again. As sure as tomorrow is Wednesday this will happen again. We should consider this issue in an outside-of-the-box manner. Why should an ordinary consumer without any financial expertise be able to walk into a bank and subscribe to or receive information from it about a product which is significantly financially lucrative for the bank? Should that not be done through an independent intermediary with no links whatsoever to any financial institution which is independently regulated by the regulator? There is a need to re-examine this issue because we will be back at square one. I ask the Leader for a debate with the Minister for Finance on this general issue and other issues around banking.
#ColmBurke	unknown-#ColmBurke-party	unknown-#ColmBurke-dob	unknown-#ColmBurke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-02-20 00:00:00	Business of Seanad	89	Like Senator Devine, I would like to thank the library service for the very comprehensive document it produced on elderly care. I have previously stated that the number of people aged over 65 now totals 637,000 and by 2030 the figure will be over 1 million. That is why we published the national plan for our health service. We currently have 2.6 beds per 1,000 of population, whereas the average in the OECD is 4.3.Some 51% of people who occupy hospital beds are aged over 65 so we need to plan ahead and build hospitals. The Government has just published the national development plan which includes a comprehensive programme for building hospitals. From 1978 to 2008, no new hospital was built even though the country was flush with money, whether that was false or otherwise. Three new hospitals are being built at present and a further seven will be set in progress in the next three years. In respect of elderly care, I have published a Bill relating to home care providers. One can serve ten years in prison but on the day one comes out, one can set up a company to provide home care without being scrutinised or cross-checked. We debated the Bill but I ask the Leader to allow it to come back into the House for Report Stage. With a growing elderly population there will be a greater demand for home care. At the health committee last Wednesday we learned that there were 29,000 people in community hospitals and private nursing homes and the number will be approximately 42,000 by 2030 so we need more home care and we need proper regulation of the sector.

On the sale of 20,000 mortgages to vulture funds, I wonder if people have forgotten that "eviction" is a dirty word in this country. It is unconscionable that a Government would collaborate in any way in the selling out of the people of Ireland to foreign mercenaries, which is basically what is happening. Not only did these monstrous groups avoid paying tax they also, as Senator Butler pointed out, landed the taxpayer with the costs of rehousing people, leading to the laughable situation where the Irish taxpayer is paying for evictions. It is something we need to look at. The National Housing Co-Operative Bill is on the Order Paper and I gather Deputy John McGuinness will be introducing a revised version. It is something we must face. We have to face down the Department of Finance, which has behaved in an appalling manner in this situation, and the ECB. It is a moral outrage that the ECB should be pushing to have Irish people evicted from their homes as these are the blackguards who got us into this mess by forcing us to buy out bondholders at 100% when they were sold at 5% or 10%. A group of Senators from different groups had a very positive meeting this afternoon about the decision of RTÉ to cease terrestrial broadcasting of political commentary programmes such as "Oireachtas Report" and move it all online. In a country which has a very patchy broadband network, this is ridiculous. RTÉ should be reminded that it is a public service broadcaster and if it treated any other programme in the way it treats "Oireachtas Report", it would have virtually no people watching. We will be having another meeting next week and it it hoped to invite RTÉ to send a representative. It would be very good if Seanad Éireann could show a united front in regard to this. We should not migrate from terrestrial broadcasting but should include online broadcasting as part of the service. If we can stick together on this we can get somewhere. We faced RTÉ down on the attempted cessation of long-wave transmission, which is of such benefit to elderly Irish people in England.

It involves 20,000 mortgage holders and people's family homes. We are talking of vulture funds buying those loans when we have a housing crisis, people are homeless and we are trying to make sure families stay in their homes. This proposed selling off of those loans cannot happen. It is a scandal. I will fully support making the case to the Minister that it does not happen. He needs to come into the House to talk to us about this. The other issue I wish to raise is a local one.

There were 50 patients in the psychiatric unit in St. Luke's Hospital last weekend. There are only 44 beds in that unit and six people were accommodated on couches in the television room. That is unacceptable. It is not right for the patient or the staff. I spoke about this issue to a representative of the community health care organisation, CHO, area 5, which is the Carlow-Kilkenny CHO, at a recent meeting of the Joint Committee on Future of Mental Health Care. I asked what plans they had to put extra beds into the unit, as the Carlow-Kilkenny CHO area has increased as it now also takes in Tipperary. We have fewer beds and more patients. I was told by the representative of the CHO area 5 that there are no plans to put in extra beds. She told me it would not happen again, it had only happened a few weeks ago, but last weekend the same thing happened. The families concerned feel powerless and see this protest as the only way to get help. This does not only involve the staff in the hospital in Kilkenny because psychiatric staff in Waterford are also protesting to highlight the lack of resources at their facilities. Michael Hayes of the Psychiatric Nurses Association told my local radio station, KCLR, this morning that the association's members believe that both patient care and staff safety are being comprised. How can we in 2018 justify that this is happening, that we have psychiatric nurses protesting because patients cannot get the beds and care they need? It is not good enough. Admissions are rising, waiting lists are growing and nobody has the resources to deal with the issue. The HSE needs to be held to account for this. The mental health sector needs money. Mental health is an issue that affects all of us and we need to prioritise it. I will be giving my full support to the psychiatric nurses in Kilkenny and Waterford. The Minister needs to come to this House to address this issue.

I publicly support the Green Party's desire to have microbeads outlawed or banned. I understand there is legislation that could come before the House in early course. I have done some research in this area recently. I am only sorry I did not focus on it sooner because it is such a serious issue. I went into a local convenience shop yesterday evening and bought a few healthy options to make a smoothie, not that the Members need to know what I am eating. I bought about €10 worth of items because it is a convenience shop. The only item that did not have a plastic package was the avocado. That is remarkable. Such packaging is convenient for the retailers. The retailers are trying to do us a service by providing us with food but we need to radically rethink the way we are operating in this area. I do not believe any of us necessarily need any of that plastic. We have seen a good deal of coverage in the media recently about how damaging plastic is to the environment. Many supermarkets have plans but I do not believe they are strong enough, considering the seriousness of this issue. It is very difficult for consumers to go into a shop and buy food without coming home with a load of plastic. Much of that is made up of a variety of different types of plastic. Senator O'Sullivan would be in a better position to speak about this. Many different plastics go into the production of any one plastic item that one brings home. Therefore, they are difficult to recycle. It is an ever-increasing problem. The interesting study on fish life in the far reaches of the north-west Atlantic, carried out by NUIG, found that the fish there have a huge quantity of plastic in their stomachs, and we are consuming that fish.It is a very serious issue. It is a bit like other issues I speak about in that it will take more than just one approach to deal with it. We are going to have to lead on this. I am contributing to the problem. We are all contributing to it, for example, when we buy bottled water. All of those things have an effect. Plastic must be recycled. We need to start to think more seriously about how we are going to help the environment. I would appreciate a debate on the issue. It is something I have already requested. No doubt the Leader has sought to have such a debate. We need to have a debate on the environment and all parties need to take an interest in the environment.

I ask the Leader to bring the Minister for Finance to the House. There is an elephant in the room, namely, the Bank of Scotland (Ireland), which has thousands of mortgages here and it has been fined in England for its seriously unbecoming behaviour. The bank has left this island with our mortgages and we have not seen it since. A vulture fund now takes its place and nobody knows what is going on and where, how and who owes what to whom. The vulture fund also got massive write-downs and I want the same write-down because I am one of its mortgage holders. I cannot find my mortgage or anything to do with my deeds. The problem is greater than that of PTSB but it is a problem for us all. The reason the banks do it is because they get away with it. People are very frightened of debt and of going up against the power of banks, but the banks do not have any power if we are not there or we take them on. I mentioned that in the previous Seanad and said people should take their money out of the banks and put it into the post office and a Labour Party Senator told me that I was out of order and that there would be a run on the banks. The Senator could not see an alternative and considered what I said an appalling thing. I never forgot it. However, that is a debate for another day. I would like the Minister for Finance to come to the House because I would like to outline my concerns about Bank of Scotland (Ireland), which left this island with the mortgages of thousands of people and the vulture funds got massive write-downs which were not afforded to us.

Some of those figures were published in two newspapers over the weekend. The difficulty is that one can never quite tell to what exact period of time they refer. There is a slight variance in the two publications that I read in the Sunday newspapers yesterday in that regard. My understanding is that the National Treatment Purchase Fund's latest figures up to the end of January 2018 show that 52,319 children were waiting for an appointment with a consultant. That is a seriously large figure. Looking closer at the figures I am advised that 15,807 of them are waiting more than one year. The next category of 8,726 children are waiting a longer period, over and above 18 months. That is a really shocking revelation. I accept there were complications and there may be reasons for some of them but at a time when we are talking about prosperity and the country getting back on its feet again, we must focus specifically on all waiting lists but in particular those affecting children. At some time in the future, when the Minister is back in the House talking generally about health perhaps we could have a segment of the debate on children and the length of time they are on waiting lists and what can be done in terms of increasing the appointment of consultants, bed capacity and whatever is needed. Let us get some guidance and hard information. The figures have been discussed on the radio today. It is important that we would have some clear facts. Perhaps the first thing I will ask the Leader is to ascertain the current position as of the end of January so that we can compare the figures and then perhaps when the Minister is next in the House a segment of his engagement with us can deal specifically with children and waiting lists.

There is absolutely legitimate concern over the proposed sale of the loan book. We had a debate on this on the Order of Business last Thursday. It was initiated by Senator McDowell. All of us share a common concern. All of us want to see the people expected to be affected treated fairly and properly. Nothing has happened yet. Permanent TSB has not consulted the Minister for Finance. It is duty-bound to do so.

If Members had listened to the contributions on the Order of Business in the Dáil, they would have heard the Taoiseach outline the Government's position. Deputies Michael McGrath and Micheál Martin have put forward their proposal. The Sinn Féin Party put forward its proposal and suggestions. It is important there is cross-party support to protect those involved. We, as Members of the House and legislators, have a duty to be informed of the facts regarding what is possible, or otherwise, under the law. There is a code of practice that gets transferred on, and protections are in place.

I will endeavour to facilitate to have it, if I can, on Thursday. If I cannot, I will inform the House tomorrow. It may not be possible to have it this week, but I will endeavour to have it on Thursday. Senator Ardagh also raised the issue of supervised injecting centres. I am not familiar with the exact location to which she referred. It is the first of its type and will alleviate a problem for those most vulnerable in our society. Senator Ó Ríordáin, when Minister of State, and the Minister of State, Deputy Catherine Byrne, were involved in drawing up the legislation and its passage. The tendering process was examined by an evaluation group comprising the HSE, HSE social inclusion, academic experts, the Garda, Dublin City Council and an external public health expert. Merchants Quay will also be appointing a community liaison worker to conduct an external evaluation of this first pilot project. Its aim is to help the most vulnerable and bring them off the streets to inject in a supervised area. I understand the frustrations of the residents about which Senator Ardagh spoke and that there may be a school near the location. There needs to be consultation about this. Communication is critical in the matter. I am happy for the Minister to come to the House. It is important, however, that it is not just about the leafy suburbs versus elsewhere. We had a similar debate about the location of a wet centre in Cork city. It worked out well. I understand the frustrations articulated by the residents involved. It is about communication with those involved, and being good neighbours is critical. Senator Ardagh raised the issue of tonight's "RTÉ Investigates" programme on St. James's Hospital. It was distressing to hear Aoife Hegarty's report on "Morning Ireland" about the misdiagnosis cases in the hospital and the people affected. It is important to give patients confidence and to ensure our health service is safe. St. James's Hospital and the HSE will outline in tonight's programme what they have done and will do to ensure an appropriate follow-up. I have not got all the information regarding the matter. It is important, following tonight's programme, that a further statement is issued by the HSE with regard to patient safety, how the diagnosis was missed and how we can reassure patients in the future. The issue of cancer care is an important, delicate and sensitive matter, as many of us know from our own family situations. It also affects friends, neighbours and people in our communities. We cannot afford to make mistakes in this area. I will certainly have the Minister come to the House for a debate on this issue, following the "RTÉ Investigates" programme. It is important to highlight we have a good national cancer strategy and outcomes from cancer treatment are good. BreastCheck has worked superbly throughout the country. The concerns raised by Senator Ardagh, however, are important and I will come back to her again on a different date, following the "RTÉ Investigates" programme. Senators Freeman, Devine and Murnane O'Connor raised the issue of the strike by psychiatric nurses in Waterford and Kilkenny. Coming from a family of nurses, I recognise the importance of our psychiatric nurses in our health care system. This evening is a sad occasion in Cork for the family of Oliver Bradley, a psychiatric nurse of long standing, who is lying in repose. I pay tribute to him for his work. This dispute has been well-documented. The issue is around staffing, development of bed management protocol and measures regarding staff dealing with pressures of services. I agree with Senator Freeman that no patient should be in an overcrowded ward, especially in the case of those suffering from mental health issues.There is an important point to make here. The management, the HSE, in charge of the issue in Kilkenny and Waterford should have the opportunity to engage and to negotiate but should also be able to be in charge of the management and operations within the unit. I am not familiar with all the issues. The Mental Health Commission regulations operate in our hospitals and are the parameters which we should look for and work within. I am sure the Minister and HSE will be able to do that. It is important there is a resolution to the dispute. As a member of a trade union, I recognise the importance of the union and the right to strike. I commend our psychiatric nurses and workers for their work. It is about protecting the most vulnerable and providing a service of care. I appeal to all sides to come to the table and work this out. Senators Grace O'Sullivan, Nash, Conway-Walsh, Butler, Reilly, Dolan and Norris raised the issue of Hinkley Point. The potential future development of nuclear power plants in the United Kingdom is a source of worry. We should stand united in our opposition to it, notwithstanding that we do not have any direct involvement in it as a State. As Senator Grace O'Sullivan said, at double the distance of that from Dublin to Cork, 240 km, it is quite close. I commend the role of the NGOs and those who advocate in the context of the potential harm and misuse of nuclear energy and the potential damage it can cause. We have seen the outcomes of that across the world. The important point here is that there is a call for submissions which ends on 17 April and there is an obligation on those who have a view on it to make a submission. The remarks of Professor John Sweeney from Maynooth University are worth looking at and noting. He says that the UK has a blind spot to Ireland regarding nuclear energy. I hope that one of the Ministers, Deputy Coveney or Deputy Naughten, will take that up on behalf of the Government. It is important to highlight the potential dangers and it is our obligation, as a State and a Government, under our international obligations to do so. We are a member of a number of international organisations where we have an opportunity to raise concerns about the activities of, and potential damage caused here by a such a plant. I support Senator Grace O'Sullivan in that call. We have not changed our position as a country but I would be happy to have the Minister come to the House to debate it. Senators Nash and Davitt raised the national development plan. We will debate that in the House next week. I am sure all Members will join in the welcome for the plan and the spend of €116 billion across our country, north, south, east and west. It is a good day for all our people and our country. Nobody in this House will object to the plan or will be negative towards the Government in regard to it. Unlike other plans, Project Ireland 2040 is about our people and delivering for them. I know Senator Devine would agree with me on that.

There is €1 billion for rural development under the Minister, Deputy Ring's Department. We will have that debate next week. On the issue raised by Senator Reilly, I would be happy to have the Minister, Deputy Ross, come to the House to address the matter of Dublin Airport and the appointment of a regulator. Senator Gallagher raised the issue of insurance. The Minister of State, Deputy D'Arcy, has responsibility for it. The report from the second phase of the cost of insurance working group under the chairmanship of the Minister of State was published in January. It contains 15 recommendations and 29 associated actions.I am happy to continue the debate we had in the House on that. I will not go into the entire reply other than to say that insurance costs in some cases are coming down. The point made by Senator Gallagher is a very important one. Senator Devine and Senator Burke raised the issue of the library service research on home care for older people. I would be happy to have a debate on it. It is a very important issue. As Senator Burke said, we are living longer. There are more people over the age of 65 and there will be more again by 2020. I am happy to have that debate in the House. Senator Dolan raised the issue of the ratification of the UN convention. The debate in the Dáil is happening in the next number of weeks and I am happy to have a debate in the House as well. I think the debate is coming up in the Dáil.

It is a very important issue. Senator Richmond raised the issue of defibrillators and his support for Senator Swanick's Bill and for Deputy Noel Rock in the Lower House. Senator Davitt raised the important matter of the pay and condition of councillors. We will have that debate in the House next week. I will defer to that. Senator Burke raised the issue of new hospitals. He is right that it is 1978 since the last new hospital was built. The national development plan provides for the construction of six new hospitals which I am sure all Members will support, Senator Devine in particular. We will have that debate as part of the debate on the national development plan. I missed Senator Norris's meeting today on "Oireachtas Report". I hope all of us can work together to ensure the coverage of the Oireachtas is not downgraded by RTÉ in its movement from terrestrial to online broadcasting. It is an issue on which we may not see a marrying of minds but it is important we continue to advocate for it. Senator Noone raised the issue of microbeads and plastics. I support her on that. The Bill is moving towards conclusion in the Lower House. Senator Boyhan raised the issue of the National Treatment Purchase Fund and the requirement for a debate on it. It is an important issue on which we should have a debate. I remind the House that under the budget last year, the allocation for the National Treatment Purchase Fund was €55 million, which was more than double the 2017 allocation, which was €20 million. In view of that significant increase, it is hoped we will see progress on waiting lists, but notwithstanding that, I am happy to have a debate on the issue of health. Senator O'Donnell asked for a debate on banking in general rather than just on Permanent TSB. I will be happy to try to facilitate it. If Senator Devine will allow me to endeavour to have the Minister come to the House this week, I will do so. If not, it will be next week. If she can defer her motion until I come back to her with an answer, I will be happy to allow it. I will not divide the House. If the Senator cannot defer it, I will endeavour to get a Minister but we should not just have any Minister to the House. We need the Minister for Finance himself.

These two EU decisions involve agreement to share three kinds of information in order to combat terrorism and serious crime. The information to be shared consists of DNA, fingerprint and vehicle registration data. Under the Prüm decisions, legislation for sharing DNA and fingerprint data is the responsibility of the Department of Justice and Equality and was passed in 2014. I understand that following protracted technical testing and arrangements, the sharing of those data will commence in the coming months. Responsibility for vehicle registration data, VRD, rests with my Department. The Bill before the House deals with the sharing of vehicle registration data in accordance with the decisions. In practical terms it means that if an Irish-registered vehicle is used in a serious crime in another EU country, the authorities there will be able to search Irish data to find the registered owner. Likewise the authorities here will be able to use the system to find out quickly the owner of a vehicle registered elsewhere in the EU if it is used in a serious crime here. Under an agreement between the EU and Iceland and Norway, these countries will participate in the Prüm decisions. The Bill has been carefully drafted to give effect to the EU requirements. We can discuss the specific details as we go through the Bill. In summary, the Bill does the following: allows searches of Irish vehicle-registration data by the appropriate authorities in other EU member states, Iceland and Norway; allows us to search the vehicle-registration data held in those countries; specifies who may conduct these searches; makes provision for data protection, including monitoring of data shared under the decisions; and makes provision for procedures for handling complaints and corrections where errors are made. All of this complies with EU requirements under the decisions. Ireland is facing infringement proceedings for delays in implementation of the Prüm decisions. I had intended to introduce the Bill earlier, but it has proven to be a complex matter and it was essential that we got it right.The Prüm decisions are an important tool in fighting serious crime across Europe and as such they benefit us and our fellow Europeans. I know that there is concern at EU level that we are behind in implementing these important measures. The fact that we are soon to be sharing DNA and fingerprint data is an important step, but it is also essential to get this Bill passed urgently so that we can proceed to sharing vehicle registration data as well.  Once the Bill is passed my Department will be able to move quickly to implementation. While there are several technical steps which must be passed, including testing of the system's use, I believe we can pass these rapidly. This is because the vehicle registration data is already being shared over the same network as will be used by Prüm under the entirely separate EU cross-border exchange directive which involves data to investigate serious road traffic offences.

Housing is a key priority for Fianna Fáil. It is the biggest issue in the country. Whether one is in Dublin or outside Dublin, in rural or urban areas, housing is a key priority and a key issue. The Government has been out of touch on this issue. Numerous strategies have been proffered by the Government but delivery has been sorely lacking. It is the people who are suffering as a result of Government inaction and the inability to grapple with the issue in a coherent fashion. We have had numerous strategies but none has delivered. Fianna Fáil has put forward a number of Bills over recent years in an attempt to help the Government deal with the issue. The Vacant Housing Refurbishment Bill put forward a strategy to deal with vacant units over commercial premises which would have delivered 4,000 units in a quick manner, but the Government has not seen fit to act on it. The Government is out of touch. There were comments as recently as last week from Ministers saying rents are okay if one goes to the north side of Dublin or outside the more fashionable parts of the capital. Rents are not okay. They are completely unaffordable. People are living in desperate conditions to keep a roof over their heads. The Taoiseach suggested people get gifts from their parents to afford a deposit for a house. He also said our rates of homelessness are low by international standards and that has been shown to be completely false. Ordinary people cannot afford to put a roof over their heads, whether it is people who want to buy their own homes and who traditionally would have been in a position to do so or people who want to rent in the private market or from the council. Council housing is virtually non-existent. The population of the country is increasing rapidly and we do not have enough private rented housing, social and affordable housing, or council housing to meet this demand. People come to my office daily and into my constituency clinics right across north County Dublin who are living in desperate situations. It is back to tenement times with people living in overcrowded, dangerous houses. They are afraid to say anything to their landlords for fear they will be given an eviction notice and would have no place to go. I have been speaking to families who are rearing their children in hotel rooms and it is having a detrimental effect on the health and well-being of children. Their developmental outcomes are being seriously hampered and they will not be able to make it up as time goes on if their housing situation is not addressed. There is a vital gap in children's development, and if certain milestones are not hit when they should be, they will never be hit. The result is seriously to stunt a whole generation. I call on the Minister of State to look seriously at this and to redouble his efforts. The efforts the Government has been making have not been making an impact. I will refer to the proposed sale of the Permanent TSB loan book to vulture funds. In the proposed sale, 20,000 loans will go into vulture funds. It is not fair to say they are people who are not engaging. Many people have engaged and they have split mortgages. The people who have not engaged are perhaps unable to engage because they are suffering from severe mental health issues and are not able to cope with their situations and the homeless situations their families are facing. I call on the Minister of State to look at this and work with Fianna Fáil and other parties in the Houses to ensure 20,000 families are not plunged into homelessness, which would add to the problem.
#ColmBurke	unknown-#ColmBurke-party	unknown-#ColmBurke-dob	unknown-#ColmBurke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-02-20 00:00:00	Business of Seanad	158	I welcome the Minister of State to the House. I welcome the funding that has been provided for the Cork area over recent months. I make no apologies for putting pressure on both the city council and the Department in that respect. The Minister came to this House to announce a €39 million budget for seven projects. We will have 134 houses built by the city council. The Boyce's Street project, which has just been approved, will have 51 houses. Those developments have been in the past three months alone and are welcome. Contracts for 50-odd houses in Carrigaline were signed yesterday. I welcome the progress that has been made. We face major challenges in housing. We will be rolling out the national development plan. One of the problems in this country is we are building small pieces of the jigsaw at a time when we should be building all the pieces. I live within ten minutes' walking distance of UCC. Development is very welcome, but an adequate supply of housing is not being built in the areas around UCC and CIT. I was at a meeting last night in my own area where a four-storey building that will be used as student accommodation is going up alongside bungalows in the middle of a residential area. This is what I am talking about. There is inappropriate planning when we are trying to put the jigsaw together and it is far more difficult. The situation is similar with building hospitals. We always have young staff in training and students who will be in and out during their time in training and we do not build accommodation for them. In the UK there is accommodation for nursing staff and junior doctors on the hospital grounds. We are not doing that. In the area around UCC, there are an awful lot of houses that were built for families but are being occupied by students. We need to have more joined-up thinking about when we grant planning for development, whether for a hospital or academic development. We should also make sure that we have land set aside for the building of accommodation. One of the other problems I have is there is a whole cohort of people who, no matter what we do, will not be accommodated because of the way the cost of housing has developed. Someone gave me the breakdown of the €39 million for the 134 units which will be built by Cork City Council. My understanding is each housing unit will cost €291,000 on land the city council already owns. I am concerned that the cost of housing seems to be far higher than any other European country. I accept we have increased the standard of regulation and everything else, which is very welcome. There is a cohort of people who will qualify for local authority housing but we have to deliver it in a timely manner. There is another cohort who will qualify to borrow from the financial sector, from banks or building societies, and will be able to buy. There is also a big group of people in between who are working extremely hard and renting but have no security of tenure where they are.I have raised the need to introduce long-term leasing like there is in other European countries. The sooner we start doing that, the better. I can rent a premises for commercial use with a 20-year lease and five-year rent reviews. I have security of tenure, knowing full well that the landlord cannot put me out on the street. This is a matter we need to look into in the private rental sector. There is nothing worse than a young family, with four young children going to the local primary school, being told by their landlord to move out because the lease may be up or the property is being sold or refurbished. The family then must find accommodation reasonably close to their children’s primary school but cannot do so. That insecurity needs to be dealt with. We should now look seriously at long-term leasing and do much more for residential accommodation. I spoke to a developer recently who bought nine apartments in Germany for €450,000. He does not have to furnish them as it is the tenants who must do so. The developer in question is getting 8% return on his investment with rent at €6,500 per annum per apartment. Accordingly, the tenants have to borrow far less but have security of tenure. While they may have to borrow to furnish the properties, at least it is manageable. We need to examine continental-style letting. No matter how much money we make available, there will be a cohort which will not fall into any category regarding access to finance. We need to give security of tenure to people. We must ensure young families are not forced to move and, therefore, cannot get anywhere to live within a ten-mile radius of where their children attend school. It is a serious major challenge with which we have to deal.

We all understand adequate housing is one of the most basic human needs and, consequently, one of the most important human rights. Last week, thejournal.ie published an in-depth analysis on whether it was cheaper to pay rent or get a mortgage in the State. The article brought up some stark realisations. In Dublin 7, where there is a mix of housing options, the average monthly repayment on a mortgage for a one-bedroom accommodation is €782. However, to rent a similar property, tenants will pay €1,432, an 83% difference. A two-bedroom home in Kildare will have a mortgage repayment of €534 a month, while rent prices are 90% higher at €1,015 for the same type of property. The average monthly repayment on a mortgage for a three-bedroom house in Cork city is €914 with corresponding rents running 32% higher at €1,203. In every instance and every scenario, renting was at an inflated cost to paying a mortgage. Accordingly, the likelihood for first-time buyers and those seeking affordable housing is they will be caught in the rental trap. Paying bloated rents as a portion of one’s income is particularly prevalent in urban centres where many young people have relocated for work in recent years. Despite the initiation of rent pressure zones, there are major issues with the increase caps being simply ignored or landlords using different loopholes in terms of suggesting they are refurbishing properties to justify the increases. Has the Government any proposals to deal with this? The Government has previously committed to the notion of an affordable rental scheme in 2014, yet it remains a notion as no detail has been announced. All the Minister committed to was that a pilot would be started at some undefined point. Will the Minister of State expand on that? Rental prices have spiralled out of control and will only spiral further if action is not taken soon. Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council has been consulted on such a scheme. Will the Minister of State give further details about this? In the Government’s proposals for the sites identified for affordable housing, no building has taken place yet. Some do not even have planning permission. The full details of the affordable housing programmes have yet to be developed. It is becoming abundantly clear these housing units will not be delivered in 2018. When does the Minister foresee these units will actually be ready to be delivered? Regarding the proposals around a help-to-buy scheme, in instances where it is subject to expert scrutiny it has been proved to simply increase house prices rather than alleviate the cost. Incentivising the private sector to meet affordable housing demand through subsidies, tax breaks and low-cost loans just does not work. I am concerned the council loan scheme proposals allowing prospective buyers to breach Central Bank rules will lead to them buying overpriced homes. While the 2% rate will be of benefit to some, in reality it does little to improve affordability. It can simply tie people to mortgages on bloated housing prices without tackling the realities that the prices are bloated in the first place. Sinn Féin has been articulating a need for affordable housing for some time now. We would deliver 4,500 affordable homes in year 1 and 9,000 affordable homes in year 2 with an appropriate mixture of rental and purchase homes determined by local housing needs. These homes would be delivered as part of mixed-tenure and mixed-income estates on public land. The proposals were recently detailed in a Dáil motion. I commend Deputy Eoin Ó Broin for his work on these proposals. Will the Minister of State reconsider the steps taken by the Government to provide affordable housing and propose more robust schemes which will truly make a house affordable for first-time buyers?

We used our first Private Members’ business to successfully pass a motion on disability and housing. Will the Minister of State update us on what is happening around the issues of disability and housing access, and proper planning in our housing infrastructure for disability? There was a specific commitment in the motion that there would be regular reviews of the Government’s progress around the delivery of adequate and sustainable housing for persons with disabilities. I noted that, in the first half of this debate, the Minister of State indicated he would be interested in having a specific discussion on that matter. Will he confirm if it is his intention to bring in a specialised discussion on housing and disability? We have persons with disabilities who have been in a housing crisis, unable to find suitable housing for a long time, even before the recession and deeply intensified since then. Civil Engagement has also raised other issues such as Traveller accommodation and lone parents who are increasingly at risk of homelessness. The latter group find it difficult to find private rental accommodation.In many cases, they are concerned that if they join the housing assistance payment, HAP, scheme, they may find themselves being taken off or moved to the bottom of the housing list. They are thinking of what will happen in the long term in bringing up their child. We spoke previously about the housing issue. I will recap what I said about a vacant site tax, rather than starting from scratch. In this House we proposed the introduction of the measure and asked that the rate of the vacant house tax be increased from 3% to 6%. However, we were told by the then Minister that this would be inappropriate and would present a danger to property rights, yet only a few months ago the Government raised the rate of the vacant site tax to 7%. I was glad to see it being raised, but can we get to a position where constructive proposals from all sides, be they from those who have proposed innovative social measures or those who are bringing rental cost proposals to the table, will not automatically be rejected but listened to and taken on board? That needs to happen. I regret, however, that the Government has not taken on board or co-opted our proposals for the removal of some of the exemptions. There are far too many exemptions that allow somebody, for example, to paint a property black or in other ways to obscure it such that it will no longer fall into the vacant or derelict house category. People can get around the pressure exerted by using such exemptions and loopholes. Tackling the hoarding of land must be a priority.  A key focus of our group is the issue of rent protection, in respect of which we proposed a number of amendments to housing legislation. There has rightly been outrage across the Houses at the recent decision to sell a number of mortgages to vulture funds. Given that we recently had the debate on whether AIB shares should be sold, it is particularly ironic and harder to listen to concern being expressed from the Government side when the power the Government had in the case of AIB was not exercised effectively. However, I want to focus on an issue that is not touched on enough. As well as the terrible damage vulture funds may cause in increasing homelessness by causing families to lose their homes, there is also the question of the kind of landlord vulture funds wlll become after they come into possession of the houses in question. The capital gains tax waiver was introduced to effectively invite vulture funds to buy up large portfolios of properties from the National Asset Management Agency. They are the landlords who are waiting until they have the capital gains tax waiver in place to sell on the properties. They will seek to sell them with vacant possession and will ratchet up rents to seek to do this. There are concerns about the kinds of landlord we are encouraging into Ireland and their practices. That issue needs to be tackled.  I had hoped to speak about the HAP scheme and social housing. I want to highlight one issue-----

The concerns about the scheme have been aired at length, but I have a major concern about leases which are being included in the social housing solutions. However, they are not a long-term solution. There was a concern in 2008 when houses that could have been bought for €120,000 or €200,000 were instead leased for perhaps a figure of €80,000 or €100,000. Many ten-year leases will expire soon. If we are depending on the private market to fix this problem, we are in a dangerous position. Will the Minister of State confirm what his approach is to social housing and rental cost housing? How does he plan to ensure we will not be held hostage when leases expire in the next few years, as we want to ensure families can have security and send their children to a school right through a six or 12-year period?

It was the Minister, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, not the Minister of State, who was in Limerick recently when close to 100 houses were opened. I compliment the Minister and the Minister of State on that achievement. The Minister of State was involved in the planning stages. It was a very good news story to see people who deserved a house being accommodated. I pay tribute to the housing staff in Limerick City and County Council as one group they very much considered in the allocation of housing was single men. The issue of housing provision for single men needs to be highlighted because it tends to be forgotten by many local authorities. Single men are the forgotten group. Obviously, families take precedence, but some single men are living in deplorable conditions. The issue of housing provision for families and people with disabilities has been referenced. It is important when houses are being allocated that we look across the spectrum and take into account the needs of people with disabilities, families, single men and women, many of whom have fallen on hard times and cannot afford to buy a place of their own. Some local authorities are seeking to secure on a ten-year lease houses that have been lying vacant. I would like such leases to be for a longer period, if possible, because a number of the houses have been lying derelict for a long time.  There are also former local authority houses that are privately owned which have become vacant and the local authorities cannot do anything about them. They are lying derelict and some of them have become a litter dump with people dumping rubbish in the front of them. The local authorities cannot clean them because they are privately owned. It would be helpful if many of them could be cleaned and a measure could be put in place to allow the local authorities to take them over. There are at least 20 such houses in private ownership in my area. They would make very valuable properties for people in which to live and it would help to address the housing crisis. That is another issue that needs to be examined. There has been great positivity or a number of moves in the right direction. Modular housing was opened in Limerick recently. A number of families moved into them at Christmas time and since. It has been a positive development.  During the period I served on a county council a number of pre-1960 houses that had been joined at the roof were knocked because they were a fire hazard. There are still a number of such properties that need to be considered. Local authorities may have made submissions on this issue. Some of the properties have been lying derelict for the past ten to 15 years and should be prioritised. There is a commitment in the Ireland 2040 project to regeneration throughout the country. For a long time we tended to knock houses, but that was not the right solution. I was delighted, therefore, when the Fine Gael-led Government started to revamp houses. In old local authority estates there was one road in and one road out, but that day has gone and it is a welcome good news story as the model did not work in a number of estates. The knocking of houses took the heart out of a community. People are now seeking to move back into the local authority estate from which they were moved. It is a positive news story when people seek to go back from where they came. The more emphasis that can be put on the taking over of private houses which are derelict, the betteer and the more we will see the heart being put back into the community.
#MartinConway	unknown-#MartinConway-party	unknown-#MartinConway-dob	unknown-#MartinConway-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-02-20 00:00:00	Business of Seanad	165	I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Damien English, for whom I have great regard as he knows his brief inside out, upside down and from every possible angle. That is commendable as it is something that cannot be said about everybody, including us at times. The ministry he holds suits him because he has a genuine passion for housing provision.There are a few people in this House who have a genuine passion for housing. There are such people across the board, to be fair. Two in particular come to mind, namely, the Minister of State who is present, Deputy Damien English, and Deputy Bernard Durkan. We must consider the obligations of the State to ensure people have affordable homes and can aspire to owning a home. The value of our society is reflected in how we meet these obligations and how we treat people and respect people and create a sense of ambition among them. Much good work has been done, particularly in the past couple of years. We have been in a position to do good work in this period. It cannot be forgotten that in the ten-year cycle from, say, 2011 to 2021, we will have started with the seesaw totally weighed against us but will have slowly and surely seen it rise because of the sacrifices of the Irish people, the good, difficult, challenging Government decisions, and a bit of faith. To a degree, the housing crisis was exacerbated during the recession because we simply had not got the money to build houses. That was a great pity. Not only does one have to keep building houses but one also has to maintain them. We all know from our own houses that if we do not paint them for a few years, they deteriorate. It is not rocket science. The same principle applies to local authority housing. Therefore, we must maintain, improve and modernise the existing housing stock while at the same time building and acquiring more houses, which is equally important. There are many initiatives that the Government has launched in this regard. Some are working better than others. There is nothing wrong with launching schemes and putting a few euro into them. Some schemes work better than others; that is the reality. I have more experience of rural areas, although there are some very urban areas in my county. Practically all the calls I am receiving at the moment are about housing, particularly in the Ennis area. There is considerable demand. If one uses daft.ie to find a property to rent in Ennis, one notes the number of properties available to rent is in single figures on many days. There are schemes that I would like to see the Minister consider. One involves turning shop units that will never be shops again into housing units. The units will not be shops again simply because retail practices have changed. Shopping is now often online and oriented towards multiples and bigger towns. There should be a 100% tax allowance and a grant to turn former shops into residential units. There are thousands of such units all over the country. This should be done. It should come up in the next budget. There should be a five-year plan whereby many of the shop units that have been closed for the past ten years could be turned into residential units. There has to be a financial incentive for older people living in big houses to consider putting a flat on the ground floor. While we all want to see people building on their own land, which is great and welcome, we need people living in towns. Especially when people get older, it makes more sense to live in a town. We need to deal with another problem associated with buying properties, namely, gazumping. I have said here before that we need legislation urgently to deal with the scourge of gazumping. I had a client last week who had a booking deposit paid on a property in Dublin where he and his wife - two teachers - were going to live but who got a call from the real estate agent six or seven days after having paid it and having started to make plans to inform him that a bid €15,000 higher had been made. The couple were asked whether they could match the higher bid and were told that, if they could not, the booking deposit would be refunded. It should simply be against the law to sell a house to a client within six months of the acceptance of a booking deposit from another client on the same property. If it were against the law, people would feel the day on which they paid the booking deposit was the day they got their house. If things do not work out within six months, it is reasonable to put the property back on the market. These matters need to be examined. We have very good schemes. I have spoken to the Minister, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, about one of them, namely, housing aid for older people. There are many cases in which a grant of €20,000, €30,000 or €40,000 is paid to install a downstairs bathroom or renovate a room to create a downstairs bathroom. Consider the circumstances that obtain where the beneficiary of a grant unfortunately passes away six months after receiving it and where the house has gone up in value significantly. If somebody gets a grant of €40,000 to build a bathroom that enhances the value of the house and then passes away, his or her estate should pay 50% of the grant back if the death is within a year of receiving it. It should pay back 40% if the death is in year two, 30% if it is in year three, 20% if it is in year four, and 10% if it is in year five. After five years, it is reasonable that the State would write off the amount completely. If a scheme such as this were introduced in respect of housing aid for older people, it would be beneficial. The vast majority of old people will live healthy lives requiring no repayment. The scheme I propose would create another income stream for the State. At the other end, it could put more money into the scheme. By and large, with some exceptions, the scheme for housing aid for older people is extremely good. It allows people to renovate their homes. There is a lot happening in the housing market in respect of social and affordable houses. We have come quite a long way towards putting a fundamental plan in place that will see thousands upon thousands of houses built over the coming years. We have a responsibility to ensure anybody who is working can legitimately expect to buy his or her own home and that anybody who qualifies for social housing can expect that, with a reasonable period, he or she will get a social house. An older person who, based on his or her health, expects he or she will need to build a downstairs bathroom or bedroom should be able to have that expectation met in a reasonable period. I credit the Minister for the great work he is doing. We are all with him. Dealing with the housing crisis should really involve an all-party effort.

A suggestion made by Minister of State, Deputy Catherine Byrne, at one of our parliamentary party meetings was that we should not take away people's social welfare benefits if they allow family members to move back into their home. I do not know whether this subject has been raised since the Minister of State came into the House. If, for example, my daughter moved out of my house and then needed to move back to my home with her children, I would not lose my benefits if the Minister of State's suggestion were taken on board. It would not cost me money to take family members back into my home. There would be some sort of incentive to allow this to happen so families would not find themselves living in hotel accommodation. We all know this accommodation is just not suitable for children. This really needs to be examined to alleviate some of the problems. With regard to the lease-and-repair scheme in the action plan for housing, what was the uptake? Why did people not regard it as a good idea? There are several houses in Athlone that have been left empty after the passing away of an elderly person. People cannot afford to do them up to make them habitable and obtain the required BER certificate. Under the lease-and-repair scheme, one could borrow up to €40,000 from the local authority. Is it that the local authorities are not pushing the scheme enough and are not advertising it or trying to sell it? There are very many houses in my home town that could be dealt with through the scheme.I raised a suggestion with the then Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government, Deputy Coveney, when he was in the position. It related to giving incentives to shop owners to convert the area upstairs over shops. I grew up in Connaught Street in Athlone over a pub. When I was a child, every business on the street had a family living overhead and it did us no harm. It might have made me cheeky on occasion - I was known to be lippy - but it did not really do me any harm.

The street was our playground. Everyone knew everyone else and everyone looked after everyone else's children. I realise times are different but there is no reason there could not be schemes to encourage shop owners to convert the upstairs part of a building to allow accommodation for single people. That is another issue. Many people are looking for single accommodation, whether they are separated or whatever. This accommodation would be perfect locations for them. Other people are getting their businesses re-evaluated for rates. They find that they are being rated on the upstairs part of their business. I know a girl in Athlone who has a business. Since the upstairs part of her building is empty, she is being charged a higher rate for it. If there was an incentive for her to do it up and turn it into a couple of apartments, then it would be a good idea. It might alleviate the problem and take some single people off the housing list, which is what we want to do. They are some suggestions. I would like if the Minister of State gave me an answer on some of them.

I thank you for the chance to answer some of the questions, a Leas-Chathaoirligh. Some of the issues were raised by speakers on a previous day in January while others were covered today. I do not have all the answers, but if there are any questions I do not answer I will forward any details to individual Members. I will try to provide the answers in order as best I can. Senator Clifford-Lee, who is not here at the moment, spoke about it being a key priority for Fianna Fáil. It is fair to say that it is a key priority for everyone, no matter what his or her party or background. Certainly, as a Government, it is a key priority for us. It is priority number one. That is why at the early stages when the Government was formed the Rebuilding Ireland - Action Plan for Housing and Homelessness strategy was put together. The idea was to focus the minds of all Departments and Government and to make housing the number one priority. Much work went into that and all political parties contributed. All political parties are represented on the Committee on Housing and Homelessness. The committee worked hard and came up with suggestions, many of which are in the document. It is fair to say that some political parties want to go further. I accept that, but I imagine the majority accept all that is in the plan and simply wish to push it further. That is acceptable as well. As a Minister of State in the Department, along with the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, anywhere I go I try to clarify that this is our party's number one priority. Everyone is committed to trying to resolve housing. We try to press this as hard as we can. I wish to emphasise that local authorities are a key part to solving housing and dealing with it. I thank local authorities for their efforts during the past 18 months in putting the teams together. Now that they have the resources again, they are back in the business of delivering housing solutions. That is what they are best at and that is what they should be doing. It is something they wanted to do but they did not have the teams to do it. Senator Martin Conway touched on how Governments - at least Governments I was part of - wanted to tackle this earlier, but the resources were not always available. Thankfully, they are available now. Apart from that, policy decisions were made by previous Governments - those not led by Fine Gael - that removed the power of local authorities in the delivery of social housing. That has had a major impact. It has taken us some time to put the teams back together, get local authorities focused on delivering housing and getting money into the system. That is all coming together now. That is why we should see more housing solutions this year and in the coming years as well. People will judge and say that the housing action plan is not moving fast enough. Previously in the House I referenced the connection with the Action Plan for Jobs. Likewise, the first year of the existence of that plan, people began to doubt whether it was working because they could not see all the jobs coming on-stream. The Action Plan for Jobs was a five-year plan. It put in place numerous changes in the first 18 months that delivered hundreds of thousands of jobs over five years. Likewise, Rebuilding Ireland is a five-year plan. A total of €6 billion of taxpayers' money is the minimum committed, and it has increased as we have gone along. It will take five years to tackle this. We said that in year one, or over 18 months, we would make changes that would deliver housing in year two and year three. That is now happening. Over 7,000 new homes came into the system last year. These included new homes that were direct build, purchased, acquired, leased and voids coming back into the system. These 7,000 houses were not available the previous year and are now in social housing. They are helping people to get houses. In total, 26,000 housing solutions were found for different people through all the housing schemes. Some were short term and some were long term, but it is all progress. I am the first to admit to everyone here that it is not enough - I accept that. We have to keep pushing further. Thousands of people are still living in emergency accommodation and we have to deal with that. We will not rest in our Department - likewise Senators will not rest here, no matter what party they are from - until that is dealt with. We have to get those people affected into permanent accommodation and houses. We know that. That is our end goal and we are committed to doing it. That applies to every party, to one and all. Senator Clifford-Lee raised the Vacant Housing Refurbishment Bill. My understanding is that it is still being discussed at committee. We have taken certain provisions from it and we have implemented them straight away. I brought through some exemptions recently on vacant properties. They were in that Bill. We acted on that Bill. We take on board good ideas when we can and we move on them as quickly as we possibly can. Some of that work is ongoing. We are not convinced that other provisions can be fully teased out the way Fianna Fáil is suggesting. However, we are working on it with that party to try to see how we can make it better, if we possibly can. Progress is being made on social housing. Last year, over 4,000 people left an emergency situation in a house or home. That is progress. It is not enough when there are thousands, including children, still living in accommodation. No one, no matter what the party or Department one is in, wants to see children raised in hotels, bed and breakfast accommodation or emergency accommodation. That has to end. Thankfully, we are making inroads. This year, ahead of us, we will see an additional 8,000 social housing units coming on board. It should help us to get people out of hotels and into permanent housing. We know the numbers are still far too high and we have to move as fast as we possibly can. Many supports have been put in place to try to make it a little easier on those families and children in emergency accommodation. It is not satisfactory and it is not enough. The idea is to try to help a little while we try to build the new homes as quickly as we can. The question of Permanent TSB and vulture funds was raised by several people. No proposals have come forward yet in respect of who is buying that loan book. This was discussed again in the Dáil today. People keep referring to vulture funds. That question is not even on the table yet. Who or what is going to buy up these loan books? Loan books are sold on a regular basis by different banks throughout the world. What is important is that people are protected in their homes regardless of who owns their loans. Those protections are there and they are the same whether it is Permanent TSB, Bank of Ireland or some other bank or fund. People are protected the same way. They do not change no matter who buys a person's loan. I want to be clear on that. We work a great deal with people to keep them in their homes. In the past, I have heard those from Fianna Fáil referring to tens of thousands of people being forced out of their houses or losing their houses. That is not true and the figures do not back up the claim. There have been housing repossessions in recent years but the figure is not in the tens of thousands, as suggested by the way Fianna Fáil people talk. It is unfair to say that. It is scaremongering and such talk is making people afraid. The majority of people are protected in their houses. We help them to work through their mortgages. We have put supports in various Departments to make that happen as well. We will continue to do that. We know that in the context of the housing problem, it is best to keep people in their homes if we possibly can. We have made many changes to the mortgage-to-rent scheme to make it more of an option for people to stay in their homes when there is an unsustainable mortgage and we will continue to do that. That deals with Senator Clifford-Lee's concerns. Senator Colm Burke referred to funding in Cork. I have been in Cork numerous times. There has been some progress but it is still not enough, something I imagine Senator Burke would agree with. Senator Burke is pushing hard, as are all the political representatives in Cork. We want to try to do more there. Cork City Council and Cork County Council have been given specific targets on social housing, affordable homes and local infrastructure housing activation fund sites. The funding is there to back it up. Part of our job in the Department is to drive the activity and to work with local authority members to make it happen even more quickly. That is what we are trying to do. Over 720 projects will deliver 12,500 houses throughout the country for social housing. About 3,600 of them are on site at the moment.We want to make that happen even faster and asked the local authorities at the recent housing summit to double, if not treble, that pipeline. We want them to really increase activity across all of their sites and will work with them on doing that. Project Ireland 2040 is exactly as Senator Colm Burke outlined in terms of looking ahead and filling in the full jigsaw, rather than just putting in one piece here and one piece there. Under Rebuilding Ireland, we will get back to delivering over 10,000 social houses per year and the commitment thereafter is to build approximately 12,000 per annum, which is similar to what Sinn Féin wants. Its members are arguing for a minimum of 10,000 units per year and we agree with them. That is what we are trying to do but it will take a little time to get there. I wish we could do it faster but we cannot. However, we will get there and are committed to delivering the number of units that Sinn Féin, Fianna Fáil and others are seeking. We are on track to do that. Project Ireland 2040 is about that as well as being about overall long-term planning. In terms of student accommodation, specific plans are in place in my Department, working with the Department of Education and Skills, which will deliver a lot more on-campus and close-to-campus student accommodation. Some of the projects are going through the planning system at the moment, with varying levels of success. There have been objections to some developments in Cork and other areas, which I understand. However, that is what the planning process is all about - analysing the proposals and working them through the system. I am glad to say that since we announced Rebuilding Ireland over 9,000 student accommodation units are being worked on and are coming through the system. We are committed to delivering over 20,000 such units over the term of Rebuilding Ireland. That is in play and can happen but we must also make sure we get the planning aspects right.  The cost of housing is an issue. The current regulations guarantee a better build but we are still trying to work on the costs. While it compares quite well internationally, that does not make houses any cheaper. We are constantly working to see how we can keep the cost of building houses down. We can intervene a lot in terms of the price of sites by making public lands available and funding ancillary infrastructure but it is important that we also keep an eye on the price of building actual houses. I am not familiar with the figures for the houses in Cork to which Senator Colm Burke referred but, in general, social housing units cost €200,000 or more to build, depending on their size. That is quite expensive but one is getting quite a strong family home for that price. Long-term leasing is being considered in the Department. Senators made specific reference to the Berlin model and in our rental strategy we are specifically trying to find new ways to encourage investment in the rental market that will give greater security, increase supply and improve the overall level of service for tenants. Many more people are choosing to rent and we are looking at new models for build-to-rent schemes and are making some progress in that regard. In that context, the German model is also being considered.  Senator Warfield raised a number of issues, including the disparity between mortgage and rent levels and he is correct in that regard. We all recognise and agree that current rent levels are not sustainable. That is why our focus is on increasing the supply of housing. It is predicted that the market will build about 23,000 new houses this year having built approximately 19,000 new houses last year. This new supply of houses will help all of the different housing sectors, including both social and private. We had thought that we would be doing well to get 20,000 units built this year but it looks like we will go beyond that. However, we need to build on that and get to a stage where we are delivering 28,000 houses by the end of the Rebuilding Ireland term. We will then commit to building approximately 30,000 units per annum thereafter.  As I said, Project Ireland 2040, the national planning framework is about making sure we have the housing supply coming on stream so that we can deal with the costs of housing and rents in the long term. We cannot fix the problem overnight but we will get a handle on it. I agree with Senator Warfield's point about mortgage repayments being more sustainable but I disagree with his view of the help-to-buy scheme. Experts have not said that it has contributed to an increase in the cost of housing. The scheme has helped thousands of people to buy a home who could not do so prior to its introduction. The aim of the scheme was to encourage the market to deliver homes for a cohort of people for which it was not providing housing. If one analyses the data closely, one will see that there are starter homes being built now that were not being built 18 months ago. I disagree with Senator Warfield on that point and would argue that the scheme has been a success. However, I accept his overall argument. The Senator also asked about the affordable rental pilot scheme being developed by Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council in conjunction with the Respond Housing Association and I will forward details on that project to him. It is but one pilot scheme and we would like to see a lot more such schemes, as would Senator Warfield and his party. The idea is to provide State-owned lands to bring forward more of those projects. We have asked the local authorities to look at those concepts and to bring forward proposals for their own lands. Likewise with affordable housing, the Minister, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, will announce the details of a scheme in the coming weeks. It is well designed and well worked out and there is ample opportunity to build over 10,000 affordable houses in the coming years. We hope to do more than that using State-owned lands. We have identified approximately 50,000 acres of public land which will be used for private, social and affordable housing. We look forward to working with all parties on that as time goes on. I must also disagree with the Senator on the home loan product which does not encourage people to buy houses they cannot afford. Affordability is carefully assessed and there are caps in place. The product is attractive because people will know what their interest costs will be over the term of the loan, that is, 2% fixed for 25 years or a little higher for 30-year terms. People can budget for that which is a major factor when people who are trying to buy a home that they can afford. When interest rates increase, people find it harder to budget and manage their repayments. Our scheme can work in that context but we will not use it to enable people to take on debt they cannot afford. I can assure the Senator of that.  Senator Higgins raised a few issues relating to housing for people with disabilities and the disability strategy. I touched on that issue at the end of a previous debate with Senator Dolan but would be more than happy to take part in a specific debate on the issue in this House. Tomorrow we are due to discuss a few issues related to that area but if the Senators wish to schedule a specific debate on housing, I would be more than happy to participate. There are strategies in place which have been extended out to 2021. Each local authority has been asked to bring forward its plans to provide accommodation for people with various disabilities in the present as well as to provide an estimate of what they will need in the future. In the past, such accommodation was provided in response to demand but we want to see a certain percentage of all new local authority accommodation being appropriate for people with disabilities. That is happening now and we have commitments from most local authorities at this stage. I am happy to analyse this with the Senators to see if the provision being made is sufficient. There are lots of different schemes to contribute to the costs of adapting accommodation which are being utilised in some cases but we can push them out more if necessary. A lot of disability groups are involved in various housing projects and we are happy to do more in that space if we can. In some ways, it is about bringing a focus to this, which I know Senator Dolan will do and further discussion in this House would be helpful in that regard. Senator Higgins also raised the issues of a vacant house tax and a vacant site levy which are two different things. We had a discussion in this House on a vacant house tax recently and the Government made changes to the vacant site levy in the recent budget. The scenarios are different but both need a lead-in time. A decision was made to introduce a vacant site levy a couple of years ago. There was a lead-in time on that and it kicks in this year. People will be charged a levy on their properties this year. We are recommending an increase, based on discussions here and the Lower House, from 3% to 7% but that is different from a vacant house tax. The latter is being analysed at the moment but the constitutional advice is that there must be a lead-in time before any such tax is introduced. In other words, before we tax someone's house we must give him or her a chance to bring it back into use.  We are making changes to the Traveller accommodation budget. I am not happy that the money is not being spent. I met the chairperson of the national Traveller accommodation committee again today. We have set up an expert panel to examine how we can change the system and the laws to make sure that we spend the money allocated for Traveller accommodation. In my view, some local authorities are not pulling their weight in this space and are not providing enough Traveller specific accommodation. We must deal with that and will do so.  Concern has been expressed in this and the other House that the HAP scheme is failing, but 32,000 people are on that scheme and the majority of them seem quite happy with it. I accept that it does not work for everybody and that there can be problems, as with any tenancy. However, there is a misconception that participation in HAP prevents people from transferring to permanent social homes but that is not the case. In the last year, approximately 1,000 people who were in HAP tenancies moved to a permanent social house. There is a belief that if one is on HAP one will be left to one side and never considered for permanent housing but that is not true and the statistics do not back up that argument. I am happy to discuss that further with the Senator if necessary. The Senator raised a number of other issues which I will not be able to deal with today.  Senator Byrne made reference to a development on Lord Edward Street in Limerick, which I visited before work began. I am glad that it is now finished and was delivered on time. That was a brownfield site that was brought back into use along with some new properties as well. That is the kind of scheme that we want to do more of and I am glad that it worked in Limerick. I know that Senator Byrne drove that project. She also made reference to single person occupancy accommodation. We have asked the local authorities, at the design stage of housing projects, to bear in mind those on their housing waiting lists. Housing waiting lists include people with disabilities, older people and single people. Indeed, approximately 45% of most local authority housing waiting lists are comprised of single people who do not need three or four-bedroom houses. What comes forward in the plans should reflect the need that exists.  In terms of housing waiting lists more generally, I am glad to say that the figures have come down by about 4,000 over the last year. We can count that every year using the same criteria and can check the movement in that regard.

We are really trying to focus on vacant properties and I would point out to Senators McFadden, Byrne and others that there is a range of schemes in place in that regard. The repair and lease back scheme had a very poor uptake, which was very disappointing. I thought that scheme was well designed and that it could have been a great success. We have made changes to it to make it more attractive, including reducing the length of time to which property owners had to commit, which was a minimum of ten years. Some property owners felt that they could make more money in other ways and good luck to them. Others felt that the housing was in the wrong area. Only nine or ten have fully come through the system but there are approximately 800 applications in the system at the moment that are being assessed.The new scheme will work better and deliver that because it is major plus. It will help to bring vacant properties back into use. The scheme was designed for people who have vacant properties but no cash to do them up. Once people had committed to making properties available for social housing, they could have up to €40,000 spent on each property. In most cases, only €20,000 was needed. Some people do not have the cash, but others do. Those who have the cash will do their own work. We would like to encourage them to come back into the system. This scheme is there for that. It is also specifically designed to help those who own units located over shops on high streets and elsewhere. It is an ideal scheme. I agree that local authorities have not had the time or resources to push the scheme. The Minister, Deputy Murphy, and I have asked them to push it hard. I ask every political party to push it hard to all local authorities because it is a no-brainer, yet the uptake is too low.  We recently made exemptions to the planning code for properties which are vacant or are located over shop units, which includes office accommodation or shop fronts. We have made it easier to turn such properties back into housing without planning permission or contribution levies. We are working with the sector to bring those properties back into use because we want that to happen, as does everybody here. It is not true to say that there are 200,000 vacant properties; the figure is a lot less. We want to bring those properties which are vacant back into use as quickly as we possibly can.
