This time last year this committee met in Belfast. We all know what happened a number of weeks later but it was nothing to do with us. We are very aware of the challenges that present in urban Belfast and want to have an open conversation about them. I invite the witnesses to make their presentation and then the committee members will respond with observations and questions. Hopefully we will have a good, open and frank discussion.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-11-21 00:00:00	Challenges in Urban Belfast: Discussion	1	Thank you very much indeed. It is great to be here. The coffee we had upstairs was wonderful. Like many others, we had a very high-octane political education from the taxi driver from Connolly Station, in language that was neither parliamentary nor church. I thank the committee for the invitation and I do not say that in a clichéd way. We really are delighted to be here because we belong to an all-Ireland church. There is sometimes a perception that the Presbyterian Church is largely a northern church. That may be true in a strictly numerical sense but we do have congregations in Cork, Galway, Limerick and Dublin. We are an all-Ireland church and the all-Ireland dimension matters a lot to us. It is in our DNA, so to speak. This is not simply a case of some northerners coming to Dublin. We are an all-Ireland church and therefore the engagement with folks here is very important to us.  We will try to be relatively brief on the topic before us today and then we can have a discussion, in parliamentary language. The challenges in urban Belfast are numerous. The issues facing the city are, at times, acute but they are not confined to the city. One of the issues we are particularly keen to tease out is that some of the issues that present themselves most acutely in the city are actually part of a set of wider needs within Northern Ireland.  As a church delegation we come to the challenges of the city with a pastoral and compassionate heart. Although it is blindingly obvious, it is worth saying that we are not political analysts or social commentators. We are not even politicians. We leave that work to the people here. While we are happy to offer comment on political matters, even tricky ones, we are not in the business of telling political leaders what to do. Politicians are mandated, within their parties and by their constituents, to take decisions. We are not going to tell them what to do. We might say that we would love them to do this, that and the other, lobby them and lean on them but it is important to us, both theologically and practically, to acknowledge the vocation which political leaders have.  It is also worth saying that the Presbyterian Church is the largest Protestant church in the North and as part of that wider faith community, plays a major part in the life of both urban and rural communities. There is a mountain of research which shows that, for example, at least 75% of the total youth work in our communities, including the statutory youth work, is done directly by the churches, through youth clubs, organisations like the Guide movement or the Boys' Brigade and so forth. We make a similar contribution to work with mothers and toddlers and the elderly. Crucially, the work we seek to do within our communities is not dependent on people coming to church or being connected with our local church. We do it for the welfare of the whole community, whoever they are and wherever they come from. The basic point I am making is that church life plays as important a role in the life of the urban communities of Belfast as it does in other parishes throughout Ireland, irrespective of whether people have religious views or Christian commitment. We are quite close to the ground and it is from that perspective that we are making our comments today. This committee has had discussions with many groups and individuals over the last few years. Indeed, we have even read some of the transcripts of previous meetings and are grateful to those who make those transcripts available. With that in mind, we are not going to repeat what members already know. Perhaps I can set out some parts of the scene in parts of loyalist /Unionist Belfast. I have lived with my family on the interface of the Ardoyne for over 25 years. Therefore, what I am saying and sharing with this committee is not a mere textbook or academic perspective but a lived one. It may surprise members to hear me say that the experience of living on the interface has been and continues to be an immensely satisfying and worthwhile one.  There are many good news stories from in and around Belfast. While we must talk about difficult things, we recognise that many good things happen in urban Belfast. Just in case members are ever tempted to become a tourist and come to Belfast, I can do no better than to quote from the "Lonely Planet" guide, which states:Once lumped with Beirut, Baghdad and Bosnia as one of the four 'B's for travellers to avoid, Belfast has pulled off a remarkable transformation from bombs-and-bullets pariah to hip-hotels-and-hedonism party town.The sort of place that Members of the Oireachtas would want to come to.The city's skyline is in a constant state of flux as redevelopment continues apace. The old shipyards are giving way to the luxury waterfront apartments of the Titanic Quarter, and Victoria Sq, Europe's biggest regeneration project, has added a massive city-centre shopping mall to a list of tourist attractions that includes Victorian architecture, a glittering waterfront lined with modern art, foot-stomping music ... [which my colleagues know well] in packed-out pubs and the UK's second-biggest arts festival. In discussing the challenges of urban Belfast we would not like members to think that we live in some sort of war-weary downtrodden area. That is not the case, however one cannot miss the constant media coverage of protests, flags and an increasingly disillusioned urban population in the traditional Unionist heartlands of east Belfast, the Shankill Road and other parts of the city. Three hundred yards from my front door there have been and continue to be daily parades and protests since mid July, which must be policed at a cost of approximately €50,000 per day. The bill to date this year totals more than €6 million. A further €50,000 will be spent today and another €50,000 will be spent tomorrow and so on. It is all too easy to wish that this would simply go away and normal life would resume as soon as possible. That is to fundamentally misunderstand the underlying issues that are symbolised in these events at the interface areas. Members will hear more of that later on this morning. Central to this disaffection is a deeply perceived loss of identify in these communities as a result of the political developments of the past 15 years since the signing of the Good Friday Agreement. If an individual perceives that he or she does not matter, and I am sure this has happened to us or in our families, depression or worse is likely to set in. Likewise if a community feels it is regarded as worthless or feels ignored or that others have been or are still being treated better than they are, then inevitably there is a cost to the whole of society for that perceived disaffection and disillusionment. This is important. Everybody pays for the disaffection of the few. This is arguably the biggest single challenge facing the areas in which we work across urban Belfast. We might talk about what can be done and who might help. While disaffection is being played out on the streets of urban Belfast, that disaffection with the outcomes of the Good Friday Agreement is shared across the province much more widely than we might like to think. That connects with the point I made earlier that we are as a church in every parish in the land and whilst we are talking about the challenge of the city we have our radar right across the province. Inevitably the general picture of community relations in the city has worsened in recent months. Much good work is being done across the communities on the ground but the environment in which community relations work is taking place seems to us to be steadily deteriorating. A good example of this wider context was given by Willie Hay, the speaker of the legislative assembly in Stormont on Tuesday. I just cannot allow Members to make a contribution and to be so offensive that, coming from senior politicians, it is unbelievable.The point I make is that the quality of public discourse seriously impacts on what happens on the streets. If there is aggravation at the most senior levels of political debate, one cannot expect local communities to be hugging each other. That is a point that members might want to pursue and we would be happy to do so. There is a very important role for members of this committee to help raise the standard of public discourse in the North. I am sure members are well aware of the annual peace monitoring report published each year by the community relations council. The 2012 report showed that the highest achieving group educationally in the North were rural Catholic girls, whereas the lowest achieving group was urban Protestant boys. This is on page 107 of the 2012 Peace Monitoring Report. There is a significant educational challenge to help this group of disillusioned, disempowered Protestant boys but that cannot be done in isolation from the wider educational framework, which is complex. My colleague, Rev. Trevor Gribben is the expert on educational matters and he will take the issue further. It is easy to make the assumption there is an educational fix that can be pulled out of somewhere for these things. I do not think we would share that view.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-11-21 00:00:00	Challenges in Urban Belfast: Discussion	2	I am a minister of the church. I have served in the inner city in Belfast. My first parish was in Strabane in the far west and then I served in north Belfast and Newtownabbey. I now work and lead up, together with others, the central secretariat. I have key responsibility for education, both north and south of the Border. I interact with governments in both jurisdictions. I will give a perspective on the unique educational challenge for what has been coined in many reports as "Protestant working class boys". To use that shorthand could appear out of context to be offensive, to describe a person as Protestant, could be seen as sectarian, working class as an old fashioned term and boys as a gender issue but every report that has been done objectively by academics and other educationalist over the past number of years, as Very Rev. Dr. Norman Hamilton has hinted, that for whatever reason the most challenging educational environment in the North is in the inner city among Protestant working class boys. What is the reason for that? Much research has been conducted and many of the conclusions when drawn together bring two key factors into play, first the decline, as happened in many cities of traditional industry such as shipyards, the rope works and so on. They were located in the city and for a whole variety of reasons, which I hope are now in our past and from which we have on, tended to provide employment for one section of the community. They tended to be Protestant working class from east Belfast and such areas. In the late 1950s and early 1960s, as across the western world, those traditional industries began to decline. One might say quite rightly that has happened all over the place, but other places in the United Kingdom, Ireland and throughout Europe have moved on and people have coped with that decline of traditional manufacturing industry. Why are the Protestant working class boys the most educationally disadvantaged in inner city Belfast? The reason is that as those industries were in their steepest decline during what we euphemistically call the Troubles began in the late 1960s. Communities that needed 15 to 25 years to turn around from a focus on traditional industry did not have the same opportunities as other parts of the United Kingdom.There should have been investment in those communities, along with other working-class deprived areas in Belfast. Much of the money in question was used to deal with the Troubles and the impact of the Troubles. Those communities never got a chance to reinvent themselves. There was a low level of respect for education. Many people knew they would get a job in the shipyard at the age of 14 because their fathers and grandfathers had worked there. The educational aspirations in such inner-city communities were low. The nature of the sectarian issues in Belfast meant that such communities tended to be in working-class Protestant areas. What has happened since then? We went through a period of ceasefires which led to the Good Friday Agreement 15 years ago. The communities to which I refer, which were affected by low self-esteem, massive unemployment and a lack of value being placed on education, also suffered from the blight of loyalist paramilitaries allegedly defending them against republicans but in practice oppressing them in many ways. This meant that those communities could not develop. As a result, 30 or 40 years after the decline of traditional industry, there was still massive unemployment, a lack of self-esteem and low levels of desire for education. When the Good Friday Agreement came along, it offered hope and a new beginning. Where are we, some 15 years later? As Dr. Hamilton said, there is a sense in those communities that the hope I have mentioned has not been delivered on. There is a sense in working-class Protestant communities in inner-city Belfast that the Good Friday Agreement did lots for "them" - middle-class Protestant communities further up the road and Nationalist Catholic communities - but little for "us". The Good Friday Agreement is seen by those people as not having delivered. I would like to refer the committee to two recent reports. In 2004, a task force of the Northern Ireland Department for Social Development published a survey, Renewing Communities, which drew attention to the fact that Protestant working-class areas of inner-city Belfast had been diagnosed as having low educational attainment, low aspiration and apparent acceptance of economic inactivity. That was especially true among young Protestant males. In March 2011, Dawn Purvis, who was an MLA for East Belfast at the time, brought together a group that produced an excellent report on educational disadvantage in Protestant working-class communities. The report, which was published in March 2011, contained many recommendations and was well received. It emphasised the need to invest in early years education in order to increase the level of educational aspiration. It recommended that schools be given a greater degree of flexibility to allow them to move away from an enforced common curriculum at secondary level, if necessary, and develop vocational courses. It called for the issue of academic selection to be dealt with in some kind of working compromise. To put it bluntly, there has been a lack of delivery of some of those practical things. The level of educational aspiration among the Protestant community in some areas of inner-city Belfast means that education is not valued. This is reflected in some parts of the Catholic community as well. There is a need for a massive investment in early years education so that this can be turned around. I will give an example. The 2011 report recommended that a co-ordinating group be established. Most Protestants in Northern Ireland tend to go to controlled schools. That sector has never had a sectoral group to share good practice, to build ethos and to build identity. The Council for Catholic Maintained Schools has worked to build ethos and share identity in that sector, but there has not been an equivalent group in the controlled sector. Two or three years after the establishment of such a group was recommended, it is still not in place.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-11-21 00:00:00	Challenges in Urban Belfast: Discussion	5	The report in 2011 which is seminal has not, sadly, been delivered on the ground. One of the factors that leads to what can almost be described as depression in certain loyalist-Protestant working class communities in Belfast is that they do not see a difference. They do not see the so-called peace dividend affecting them. The reality is that it has affected all of the community and working class communities have benefited but on the ground they do not see this. Because I work in education I am illustrating from that point of view. For instance, some of the big ideological disputes ongoing in education over academic selection, a common funding formula and a definition of shared education are at a level where accommodations and agreements are not being made between politicians that can be delivered on the ground. Politicians have every right to have their party political viewpoints, but the art of politics involves accommodation, compromise and bringing solutions that work on the ground. There are too many pieces of legislation blocked in ongoing debates in the Executive by whoever it might be. Where co-ordinated intervention between Departments is needed on behalf of ordinary communities in the inner city, it is not happening. While politicians will debate and discuss accommodations, compromises are not arrived at quickly enough to actually make an impact. There is a generation of young people, 15 years on from the Good Friday Agreement, who had hope held out to them, but it is not being delivered on in reality. I could tell the committee in great detail about some of the things that need to happen in education, but I will not go any further. I wish to touch very briefly on the issue of shared education. The concept of shared education is being developed in the North and all of the churches are very supportive. I am sure committee members have followed the debate. It is different from integrated education which takes place in one school in which people from two communities are educated together in a proportion of 60:40 proportion either way. The concept of shared education recognises the reality that most people in the North are educated either in schools that are predominantly populated by Protestant or Catholic children. It helps those schools begin to journey together. I illustrate two small rural primary schools in a small village which has been scarred by the Troubles where every Friday all classes are taught as if they are in one school and children mix naturally in the classroom. One might say, "So what? That is not a big step forward." For that community, it is massive. That new concept has a big part to play in Belfast. Why? The answer is because people still tend to live in single identity communities. By definition, the local primary school is predominantly Protestant because all of the houses around it are lived in by people who are predominantly Protestant or Catholic. How can we move forward in developing the concept of shared education? Again, I have to say it has not been rolled out quickly enough. Shared education projects in Northern Ireland are funded by the American Ireland Fund and American philanthropies. They are not mainstream and not funded from the budged for the Northern Ireland Executive. Developing the idea of sitting together in a classroom with people from the other side and seeing their humanity will be a big factor in stopping the behaviour that results in throwing stones at the other side. These initiatives need to be rolled out. Education is the key, although it is not the magic solution to everything. Schools are not to blame for where we are in Northern Ireland, but schools and good policy can be part of delivering for the future.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-11-21 00:00:00	Challenges in Urban Belfast: Discussion	7	Like the Very Rev. Dr. Hamilton and Rev. Gribben, I thank the committee for the invitation to appear before it. We appreciate the opportunity to be here.  Last year I was Moderator of the church. I have ministered in north Belfast and Newry and now minister in north Down, but unlike my colleagues, I am a Southerner as I am originally from Monaghan. My family roots are still there; my mother, brothers and so on still live in Monaghan. I have a real concern, from the Southern perspective, that people here continue to engage with the issues of the North. It is very important that they do so. I am a little concerned that there is a sense that apart from a few issues, everything is okay, as people are not killing each other. I am concerned that, at whatever level, the eye will be taken off the ball and in regard to reconciliation and developing real peace in our communities, that people will fail to see that this still needs to be a priority in so far as the Government in the South is concerned. I am concerned about this but appreciate that what the committee is doing is a source of real encouragement to the process in terms of the need to continue to engage. From my personal background, in so far as implementation of the Good Friday Agreement is concerned and how it impacts on legislation and in so far as minorities in the Republic are concerned, there should be a real concern to cherish all the children of the nation, if I can put it that way. Sometimes in the past - perhaps, it is still the case today - Presbyterians and Protestants felt it was best to keep quiet and not to cause particular problems. One needs to be very aware to make sure that is not happening and that people really feel they are part of the State. In counties Donegal and Monaghan and other places there has been concern about how educational funding will be rolled out.We fully appreciate the need for rationalisation in the delivery of school and similar processes. I do not think there is any intentional discrimination, but sometimes in the outworking, it seems that at the point of delivery people do not believe they are receiving the support they need. I want all of us to reflect on how minorities can always be appreciated and valued equally within the State. This has an impact on how reconciliation takes place in Northern Ireland. As we know, things can roll over and, perhaps, be misused or misunderstood.  I appreciate the opportunity to be here and I am happy to continue the discussion.

Somebody said, "If you don't know your history, you don't know anything." Last Sunday week I attended a remembrance service in Boyle, a ceremony that has been celebrated for the past ten years. I come from a town of 3,000 people; some126 young men from it died in the First World War. These young men were never remembered until this remembrance service began. Some 400 people from County Roscommon and 50,000 from the island of Ireland died in the First World War. Some 700 Nationalists from west Belfast joined the Connacht Rangers in Boyle for obvious reasons. Those who died were forgotten, but they are part of a shared history we should remember. My family comes from Cullyhanna, a Nationalist area in south Armagh, but those who participated in the First World War are part of our history. I wish to raise two issues. First, there is a huge clamour to have a truth commission in Northern Ireland. What are the delegates' views on the proposal that there be a truth commission? Do they see it as positive, or are there issues with which they have a difficulty in that regard? Second, when we were in Northern Ireland last year, we visited the Skainos centre on the Newtownards Road where we witnessed an address by Mr. Martin McGuinness and Mr. Peter Robinson. Nothing could have been more perfect on the day, but less than one week later the flags protest broke out. I understand, as the delegates have pointed out, that there is an underlying issue. However, could the flags protest have been managed in a better way? What caused it to manifest on the streets of Northern Ireland? Is there an urban-rural divide with the Orange Order?

#JackWall	unknown-#JackWall-party	unknown-#JackWall-dob	unknown-#JackWall-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-11-21 00:00:00	Challenges in Urban Belfast: Discussion	13	I welcome the reverend gentlemen. In my town of Athy, County Kildare we have a Presbyterian church and there is a good active community there. Many matters need to be addressed in Belfast and throughout Northern Ireland, but I see the main issue as education. I was delighted to hear the three reverend gentlemen talk about education here. I would see it as a lost opportunity in the North for generations if all of the other issues in the North had to be fixed before education became a priority. It is a priority for all the young people of Belfast. I have visited the city on numerous occasions and been disappointed to learn of the state of education services within the city. Perhaps the reverend gentlemen might be able to give us an overview of the attitude of families to education. In the South the strength of the education system comes from the family seeking the best for their sons and daughters. This follows through in the mechanisms of parents councils, parents associations and everything else. What is the position in Belfast in that regard? Irrespective of the obstacles and problems in society, one would imagine that the strength of families in seeking the best for their children would overcome these issues. Another factor that comes across strongly in visits to Belfast is the lack of public representation in areas in which there are poor education services. These areas seem to lack public representation; there are no representatives in the Northern Irish Assembly residing in areas in which these educational problems are to be found. Is this an issue? How strong is family support in these areas to ensure young people will have an equal opportunity to do the best for themselves? That is the key issue. If we can ensure education is the priority, many of the problems will be overcome. Education will improve many aspects of life in Northern Ireland.

I am delighted to welcome the reverend gentlemen. It is nice to see them again and follow on the discussions we have had in the past 12 months. I listened attentively to their contributions and believe there must be recognition that disadvantage does not just affect young Protestants. There are social and economic problems across Belfast which affect people of all persuasions. Part of the problem for working class unionist or Protestant communities is that for years their political leaders have been telling them that their life is shite and that they are worse off than others. If one looks at the deprivation statistics, the most deprived areas in the North are Nationalist, but there are other ways to monitor disadvantage. I am very concerned also. I know that there are young people who are growing up not just in dysfunctional families but also in communities that need help and support. I was glad when the Reverend Trevor Gribben mentioned children's early years which are critical. We tried to get Unionist leaders in the Northern Ireland Assembly to understand it was far too late to wait until a child was five years old for early intervention to start, but we could not persuade them. It was very frustrating to hear Unionist leaders say intervening at the age of five years was time enough. It is not. Early intervention starts before a baby is born, in supporting the family unit, whatever form it takes, and giving people the skills to be good parents and to help prepare their children for an educational environment. If a child can never learn to play, it cannot learn how to learn. We have schemes such as Sure Start and Home-Start, but I could not persuade the Health Minister to understand the validity and importance of schemes such as these. The problem of social disadvantage will never be fixed unless we start at a very early age.  The 11+ transfer test is another issue. Unionists wish to see this test remain and the figures were cited. How do we square the circle? As the examination did not work for hundreds and thousands of young people, why is there a fixation with maintaining the system? For young people who have struggled through seven years in primary school, to be branded a failure before they move on to post-primary level does not help the perception of their place in society. Reverend Gribben said he had significant details. If there is a written submission on the issue, I would like to see it. Disadvantage runs across communities. In this regard, we would like to hear the ideas of the Presbyterian Church. The Very Reverend Dr. Hamilton said they were not here to tell us what to do, but we would like to hear their ideas on how the Executive should act to tackle disadvantage, including their proposals to target on the basis of objective need.I agree 100% that if a person gets off to a bad start, not only does it affect possible educational attainment, it also has an ongoing impact on mental health. It is very difficult for a person to take his or her place in society if his or her educational attainment is so low that he or she cannot find a job, of which the mental health impact can be very damaging. I would like to make a suggestion that we invite representatives of the Fermanagh Trust because the work it has done is far above that done in any other area, of which I can give an example. There were protests outside a school a decade ago because it had a Catholic dinner lady, but the school is now involved in shared education with its neighbouring schools. It has been an absolutely huge success. The Fermanagh Trust is leading the way, but it has received good support from the bishops and others. The trust tells a brilliant story. We must understand that unless we get the right policies in place to help the children coming through, they will not be able to go to school and learn. I would love to see the figures the delegates have for the level of achievement at school, particularly Protestant boys in rural areas. The relationship any of us has with education is key to how we attain it. That seems to be lacking; when people are told for years that they are never going to come to anything, it is a self-fulfilling prophecy.

I call Deputy Brendan Smith who will be followed by Deputy Seán Conlon.
#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-11-21 00:00:00	Challenges in Urban Belfast: Discussion	17	I welcome the reverend gentlemen and thank them for their presentation, even though it presents a grim picture, as has been said by colleagues. The same message was given to us in east Belfast 12 months ago. Listening to Reverend Hamilton in particular, the situation seems to have deteriorated rather than improved in the meantime. He has mentioned that 75% of youth work is organised by the churches. Is there a difference in participation levels, depending on the areas involved? Is there a particular difference between more affluent and less advantaged areas? I presume the state provides some support for these programmes of youth activities that the churches organise. I compliment the churches on doing what is very necessary and important work. I wholeheartedly agree with Deputy Jack Wall on the difference education can make. He made these points forcefully when we were in east Belfast. Up until the late 1990s, the State had very poor provision for early and preschool education. From the late 1990s onwards, there has been massive investment in the preschool sector which is now run both by community-based organisations and private providers and it is working extremely well and very effective. When one speaks to teachers at primary and second level, they will always refer to advantage in terms of a child having an opportunity to participate in early childhood education. Reverend Gribben mentioned the report by Dawn Purvis in 2011 and a specific set of recommendations on what needed to be done. We can have all the policies in the world and the best of intentions and reports, but we need intervention. Have the Assembly, the Ministers with responsibility for education - there are two - and the Executive undertaken any pilot project providing for a new method of education and training? Has anything happened to try to tackle the particular problems in these areas? In the past we had the RAPID programme that was targeted at some particularly disadvantaged areas to try to bring together the local authorities and health and education services. My knowledge of it is that it depended on who provided the leadership, but in areas in which there is an all-government or all-agency approach to the issues facing young people, there has been a good outcome, depending on the leadership given by the statutory agencies or the lead agency involved. Has any such project been undertaken in Belfast or other disadvantaged areas? I compliment the delegates once again on their presentation.

Like Reverend Patton, I am from County Monaghan and fascinated by what he has said about the experiences of rural communities. On the deprivation experienced by people in east Belfast, the lack of a connection between young people and their political leaders and the lack of economic opportunities which is probably based on a lack of educational attainment, what can be done to address this problem? On what Reverend Gribben said about shared education, I would like to share our experiences in the past 20 years south of the Border. Many years ago we had a Reverend Turtle in Ballybay, County Monaghan who thought it was very important for minorities in communities to have their own schools and a strong sense of community in order to give them a strong sense of identity. In the past 25 years, through sport and education through the VECs, the communities concerned have come together. We have a very strong Presbyterian community in Ballybay and the mid-Monaghan area and church numbers are growing. That is a positive sign that it does not matter in which jurisdiction people are; their church can be strong regardless. As Reverend Hamilton pointed out, it is a very strong all-Ireland church. Just like in Belfast, the members of the Presbyterian community in County Monaghan are strongly involved in community activities which are valued by all members of the community. What can be done about the lack of connectivity between the political classes in Belfast and the young urban Protestant community? In terms of the peace dividend, what can be done to develop economic opportunities for everyone across Northern Ireland and in the Border counties? It is not just about a disconnection in Belfast; it also happens in peripheral rural areas north and south of the Border. What can be done to make sure people feel connected to the peace process in order that they can believe it is of benefit to them and their families and that they can be worthwhile members of society?

We raised these issues during our visit to Belfast.  The church has been very strong in the pastin Ireland but huge changes have taken place. There are now more stakeholders involved in education such as community schools, vocational education schools and so on. What concerns many here are the rationalisations, as Reverend Patton mentioned, but I often think that if something is not broken, there is no reason to try to fix it. In that respect, minority education services are very important in order that all children can be cherished equally. This will be very important when it comes to making major changes in schools, particularly smaller schools. Reverend Hamilton referred to Catholic girls in rural areas and Protestant boys in urban areas. If we take out the words "rural" and "urban", in the past girls have done very well in education when compared with boys, but perhaps this has not been shown in the levels of attainment, promotion and advancement. In this state there are a large number of female teachers in the primary education system. When it came to the points system for third level education, we devised a system, HPAT, as the procedure to be used where someone wants to study medicine.There have been arguments for and against that and whether it discriminates against girls and so on. Whether one argues for or against changes to the education system, the bottom line is that the disadvantage exists. My query relates to how the witnesses can deal with that. How can the witnesses involve more people in the way that, for example, the vocational education system or community schools do, more so than in the past, when the church had a strong involvement in education? I like the concept of shared education, to which the witnesses referred. Will the witnesses explain how they see the roll-out of that proceeding from now on?

The witnesses referred to the consequences of social deprivation. I maintain that we have social deprivation in the South and that it is equally bad and, in many instances, possibly worse. I believe the problem is sectarianism added to social deprivation. That becomes an excuse or the reason for anger or expressions of anger and so forth. If we are to deal with the problem, several issues must be dealt with. We need to break down sectarian divisions and so forth. Education is of major importance in generating a tolerance, an understanding and a methodology for being able to argue and debate a given point. Employment or a lack of employment is a major problem. People without jobs or education have major difficulties and they should have the opportunity to get the necessary employment. All of that is a contributing factor. The witnesses referred to the disconnect between working-class Protestant areas and the Good Friday Agreement or the Assembly or whatever. The disconnect can take many dimensions but the most important dimension is a lack of political leadership. There is a problem if there is no political leadership or representation. This committee had an excellent meeting in the Andy Tyrie Interpretive Centre on the Newtownards Road approximately one year ago. It was an excellent meeting with the leadership of one section of the UDA. The four brigadiers from Belfast were at the meeting. It was a progressive meeting but one thing that came across clearly was that, in the Protestant working-class or loyalist areas, there are what are described as former combatants, but they do not represent their communities in an electoral sense. However, across the divide in the nationalist areas former combatants are now Sinn Féin activists who are embedded and ingrained in their communities. They are giving leadership and representation to their communities. This was described in the committee once by Jackie McDonald. He noted that he was before this committee looking at MPs, Deputies and MLAs, all elected representatives from the nationalist communities and many of them former combatants. However, they do not have that on the other side. It seems to me that that deficit must be addressed, but the only people who can address it are the people within the community prepared to give the necessary leadership. These people need to have the opportunity to become representatives for the common good. That needs to be looked at but it can only come from within. I have always had the view that the role of the churches in generating and sustaining sectarianism has been questionable. That is my personal view. I note in latter years the fantastic efforts being made to break that down, and that is to be welcomed and encouraged. However, the role of the church should not be underestimated when it comes to mitigating sectarianism in a community or communities which have become victims of a sectarian system that has prevailed for a long time. We need to address that. I welcome the commitment and the efforts of the witnesses. I do not have a gloomy picture because there are many positives in what the witnesses have said. It is easy to be critical and gloomy but we should be challenging instead. We should challenge where we believe things are not going right. We are in a far better place - indeed, a very good place - compared to where we have come from. There are still difficulties to be resolved and those difficulties are resolvable. There is a role for people from within working-class communities in representing those communities, but I do not detect it at present in the light of our visit to the Newtownards Road or the several occasions on which people have come from those working-class areas to appear before the committee. They did not have an electoral mandate but it is essential that they work and get an electoral mandate. This is because along with having an electoral mandate comes responsibility and with that responsibility comes an opportunity to address the grievances and perceived wrongs, whether real or otherwise, in the Protestant community. That is the way out of it.

It is a positive message that needs to be sent out. It is part of all that is going on in the background which people throughout the island do not hear about, but it is going on every hour of every day. The witnesses referred to disillusion. Part of the difficulty has to do with perception. A Queen's University of Belfast professor gave us results from a survey on the perceptions of Nationalists and Unionists, especially young people and their perceptions of the Good Friday Agreement and what had come out of it. On the Unionist side there was disillusionment. People took the view that things were going backwards and not improving, while on the Nationalist side people believed there had been improvements. The reality was rather different in terms of jobs, poverty and so on. The greater amount of disadvantage was still in the Nationalist rather than the Protestant areas, but the perception was rather different. Part of the difficulty is that people were talking it down in their own community and talking down the potential of change. The witnesses referred to the Good Friday Agreement and the potential for a new beginning and the hope that came out of it. However, part of the difficulty in the process is that there are parties within the process that are in government at the moment that did not agree with the Good Friday Agreement or with change. To some extent, they are still fighting the battles from earlier years. The are still trying to stop change. In terms of politics and politicians, how do we find a compromise between people who want things to stay the same and those who have a rosy view of a utopian past and about how great things were and who want things to go back to the way they were? We know from talking to people that things were not rosy or great in the past. There is potential in the future for things to change. Reference was made to disadvantage and the traditional industries and so on. I could bring the witnesses around areas of this city where things are a good deal worse than Belfast in terms of disadvantage, poverty, drugs, crime and inequality. These are problems throughout the island, not only in the North. The sectarian nature of the state needs to be tackled by all of us. Collectively, we need to come together and come up with ideas. It is about these things.There is also a need for role models. It struck me when I went into these Protestant, working class, Loyalist areas that they did not have the role models other areas had.  People talk about the lack of leadership. There is leadership, but, unfortunately, it is not a collective political leadership and it seems to come from one community and one political persuasion. I apologise for going on for so long.

I agree with Deputy Martin Ferris that the Loyalist side needs political leadership. In the past there was stronger leadership on the Loyalist side, but it did not grow. I have never been more impressed by a picture in The Irish Times than I am by the picture of the Lord Mayor of Belfast, Mairtín Ó Muilleoir, carrying out his civic duty, standing shoulder to shoulder with his Unionist colleagues to commemorate Remembrance Day. I am overwhelmed. I rang him to say we were quite ambiguous here about Poppy Day, even though probably all of us had family members who had participated in the two world wars, some of whom had died. He inspired me. I will never hesitate again on the issue of commemoration of the two world wars. My husband and I have visited the Somme. My husband is from County Leitrim and many people from his village died at the Somme. I compliment the Lord Mayor because he did his civic duty and did not back off. He gave personal example to me. I thought it was an example of what a good politician should do, not to be afraid of the people who might not be enthusiastic about what one was doing.

I failed miserably in calling for brevity, but there was a reason for this. We go to Northern Ireland and do a lot of outreach work. People are interested and members of the committee are passionate about making the North and the South better places in which to live. The delegates will have detected from members' contributions that they have thought about them and want to be part of this process.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-11-21 00:00:00	Challenges in Urban Belfast: Discussion	28	There are approximately 20 big items in the questions and if I were to spend ten seconds on each, no part of our response would be adequate. We would be very happy to write a paper on particular issues members have raised and to develop our thinking, we invite members to come and have a working lunch with us. We are not trying to generate work for the committee or ingratiate ourselves, but the complexity and importance of these issues are such that we cannot deal with them in 30 seconds. If it is acceptable to the committee, we would like to have an ongoing conversation in which we could explore some of these tricky issues in a more orderly way. We would even feed the members and be nice to them over lunch if that would entice them to engage in an ongoing conversation. On the basis that we could do this better over a period of time, I will make a few specific comments. Reverend Gibbon may comment on the issue of education, while Reverend Patton may also have something to say briefly. Research shows that across the province, over a long time, at least 75% of youth work has been done in Protestant communities within the church sector. In recent years there have been other very important contributors to youth work. Even in my own congregation in north Belfast, 150 young people will come through our doors this week. It has longevity and scale, but it is by no means exclusive. The flags issue is immensely complex, which is why I hesitate to make any real comment on it. Identity is at the heart of the flags protest. Does anybody care who we are? I am not justifying any action; I am just trying to give a perspective to understand the action. It is fundamentally about a sense of identity being rubbished or set aside. There is a very important conversation to be had about how both identities are properly reflected across the island. It is only fair to say a large section of the loyalist and Unionist community believe its identity is being set aside and not being replaced by something that is equally valuable to it. Perhaps our colleagues will have something to say on this.  The question of political leadership came up several times. I take Deputy Martin Ferris’s point-----

Would it be possible for him to sum up? We will meet again after the next session. We will meet informally and have an opportunity to talk then.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-11-21 00:00:00	Challenges in Urban Belfast: Discussion	30	I will speak for two minutes. There is a huge difficulty in getting people from these communities elected because the weight of votes does not lie in a constituency in these areas; it lies in what one might call the more suburban areas. There is a significant demographic and constituency boundary challenge to make what Deputy Martin Ferris wants happen. I agree that we need to elect people from the urban areas to the political leadership. Dealing with the past has come up in a variety of forms, whether the historic role of the churches or the involvement of competence in the political process. Specifically, we are not at all persuaded of the need for an international commission for truth and reconciliation because truth, or the search for it, can easily become a weapon to be used against others rather than as a mechanism for healing. Our preference is for an international commission for community healing, which is prospective, rather than a commission for truth, which is primarily retrospective. I know the argument about not heading into the future without having dealt with the past, but we think an emphasis on truth would prevent community healing, which is the future for our kids. I will leave it at that, having made the offer to pursue these issues with the committee in more detail.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-11-21 00:00:00	Challenges in Urban Belfast: Discussion	32	People traditionally walk out when I speak. We are used to this in the North also. It would be great if there were shared education practitioners down here. Michelle Gildernew would point towards the Fermanagh Trust for particular reasons. I commend the trust and encourage the committee to listen to it. The other two big providers in the area of shared education are the Queen's University shared education programme under Professor Tony Gallagher and the North-Eastern Education and Library Board PIEE scheme which deals with primary schools. These three together will give the committee a brilliant picture of the potential of shared education to change education and build reconciliation in Northern Ireland, if the committee takes cognisance of their work. Deputy Martin Ferris referred to areas in Dublin which were equally deprived as those in Belfast. I accept that fully. The point I wish to make is that owing to the impact of the Troubles, the opportunities to rebuild and rejuvenate whole communities following the decline of traditional industries were not seized and put back by 30 years. The work that should have been done in the 1970s and 1980s to rebuild communities could not happen and did not happen because of the Troubles. Therefore, they are much further behind. I fully accept that the churches have shown sectarian attitudes and that they have got it wrong. We share this with most people in society in Northern Ireland. As Dr. Hamilton said, as we try to move forward we need to be honest about this fact. Early years education is vital. The Dawn Purvis report contains super recommendations. People like Dawn Purvis, Pete Shirlow and Mark Langhammer are the experts and we are happy to listen to them. It is most important to build and incentivise leadership in education in inner city schools. It is much better to be a principal in a grammar school in the suburbs than it is to be a principal in a difficult secondary school in the inner city. We need to incentivise leadership in education in schools. The CCMS and our Catholic colleagues have been good at doing this, but it tends not to have happened in the controlled schools. We need to build capacity in schools in order that pupils and parents will want to go to these schools and will not want to flee them to go to schools in the suburbs. The issue of academic selection needs to be dealt with, but it will not be dealt with by confrontation. Sadly, I do not see a solution to the dispute coming in Northern Ireland in the next few years. We need to find ways of living with the reality and for both sides to stop the aggressive confrontational attitudes towards each other. We need to find a way forward to live with the reality of academic selection until we can get rid of it.

Between votes and other distractions, we are behind schedule. I welcome the representatives of the Community Foundation for Northern Ireland and look forward to getting their insight into the journey from prison to peace and efforts towards conflict transformation by way of bottom-up projects. The bottom-up approach is of particular interest to the committee in its deliberations. I am aware of some of the delegates' work, having recently attended a Prison to Peace conference in Armagh. It was an interesting discussion which gave me a taste of what they were seeking to achieve. I commend them for their work. The committee does not claim to have a monopoly of answers to any of these issues. Our objective is to have an open door policy which facilitates a variety of opinions and shades of opinions. We respect people's different viewpoints and try to provide a space for their expression. We hope the delegates will find a welcoming forum for their views today and we will also have input from members. I will not go through the advice on privilege which has been circulated to delegates. I am sure they will bear it in mind. I invite Ms Kilmurray to make an opening statement.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-11-21 00:00:00	Challenges in Urban Belfast: Discussion	35	I thank the committee for its invitation to attend the meeting and the Chairman for taking the time to attend our conference.  Before introducing my colleagues, I assure members they are not witnessing an attempted invasion. I am joined by Mr. Paul Gallagher and Ms Teresa Steward from Teach na Fáilte, an organisation which supports former INLA prisoners; Mr. John Howcroft from the North Belfast Community Development and Transition Group; Mr. Philip Deane from the Lisburn People's Support Project which supports former UDA prisoners; Ms Seanna Walsh and Mr. Kevin Mulgrew of Coiste na nIarchimí, an organisation which supports former IRA prisoners; Mr. Noel Large and Mr. Nigel Gardiner of EPIC which supports former UVF prisoners; Mr. Roderic Dunbar and Mr. Sean Curry from An Eochair, a body which offers support to former Official IRA prisoners; and Mr. Ciaran de Baroid, the Community Foundation for Northern Ireland's co-ordinator for the PEACE III programme. This broad representation reflects the membership of the Prison to Peace consortium. In addition, the Community Foundation for Northern Ireland is the lead partner in the conflict transformation programme with the bottom-up consortium, a range of groups north and south of the Border which comprise former IRA prisoners. The Community Foundation for Northern Ireland has been engaged in its work for many years. We began engaging with political ex-prisoners in 1995 with support from the European Union PEACE I programme and, subsequently, its successor programmes. One of the reasons we are very keen to link this work with the implementation of the Good Friday Agreement is the provision within the Agreement for proactive reintegration of former prisoners. We are also very conscious of the important role played by ex-prisoners in achieving and selling the Agreement before and at the time of the referenda, within their particular constituencies and broader communities. One of our concerns is that we seem to be going backwards to some extent since 2000, in the aftermath of the rollercoaster that was the drive to achieve and implement a peace agreement. We have seen the introduction of the historical inquiries team and other important measures, but, just as significantly, we have also seen an increased stereotyping of ex-prisoners as the ones solely at fault for the Troubles. We have tried in our work during the years with former prisoners, one the one hand, and, on the other, victims and survivors of the Troubles to emphasise that they are not two distinct categories. In fact, throughout Northern Ireland there are many people who were in prison and also were victims and survivors of political violence. The notion of positing one group against the other is misguided. We began with the aim of reintegration of former prisoners into society, in accordance with the wording of the Good Friday Agreement. In practice, however, the various groups have gone further than this and have been proactively involved in interface work and other aspects of peace-building. The impact of their efforts can be seen in the cross-constituency, cross-community contact made between groups.  Another area of work that has always been very much to the fore is our engagement with young people, our message being that there is nothing glamorous about a return to the Troubles. One of the projects the group has undertaken, with the support of the department of education at Queen's University and the subsequent endorsement of the Northern Ireland Department of Education, is the production of an education pack for schools exploring why people became involved in violence, what life was like for prisoners and why they now support the peace process. The objective is to discourage another generation from becoming involved in violence. There are two issues that remain of major concern to us. The first is that one of the issues preventing the reintegration of political ex-prisoners as full members of society is the retention of their criminal record which excludes them, for example, from employment in some instances, from obtaining insurance and consideration as adoptive parents. We have campaigned to put legislation in place to address this issue. In the meantime, people are being increasingly excluded by the unconscious application of legislation and policies on criminalisation. This is having a serious impact on former prisoners. The second point of concern relates to funding. The Community Foundation for Northern Ireland is an independent charitable trust which does not receive any statutory funding. In fact, since its establishment in 1995, we have been left to negotiate funding from the European Union, the support of which has been very generous but not the most appropriate to the work engaged in by the ex-prisoner groups. We are asking where the evidence is of any effort by the government to mainstream some of this work.

The committee wants to be helpful and we are anxious to hear their concerns. We have already had discussions in the committee on the criminal record issue which is affecting people who, for instance, apply for a taxi licence, house insurance and so on. It is an issue that needs to be addressed. The issue of historical crime is causing a great deal of concern at this time. We have spoken about this issue with Marian Price and, on the other side of the divide, Bobby Rodgers. What is the delegates' view on how we can seek to address the issue? Reconciliation and commemoration issues are important and of concern to the committee. It is important to remind ourselves that this is a powerful committee which can access areas not easily accessible to others. It is a stark reality that in the past two years no representative of the Unionist or loyalist parties has attended a meeting of the committee. Members of Sinn Féin and the SDLP have come down and articulated their case, but we have not heard the argument from the other side. The message must go out that we are anxious to hear from the Alliance Party, the UUP and the DUP. That engagement is happening via other channels, but these voices need to be heard at the committee.
#MartinFerrisSF	unknown-#MartinFerrisSF-party	unknown-#MartinFerrisSF-dob	unknown-#MartinFerrisSF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-11-21 00:00:00	Challenges in Urban Belfast: Discussion	38	I thank the delegates for their presentations. I share a good deal in common with them as I am a former political prisoner. I find it very annoying at times when people refer to people's past in terms of they having a criminal record. I do not accept that and I never will. All my actions, and I assume all the actions of people who were involved in and combated the conflict, were politically motivated. People who have been prisoners as a result of the conflict who wish to travel to America, Australia or to leave the country find they are prohibited from doing so and this is a major issue. In the current circumstances that prevail in this country, people who are still relatively young have to remain unemployed because they cannot access work outside the country in many areas as a result of their having been involved in the conflict. That was emphasised legislatively in this House in the recent past and as a result people cannot even get a job as a taxi driver because they have been former prisoners of war, POWs. In the Six Counties special political advisers were discriminated against because they had been prisoners in the conflict. I would strongly argue that in respect of the Good Friday Agreement, all the negotiations on it and the goodwill towards it, a great deal of convincing of people of its value came from the prisoners and former prisoners who worked within their communities to ensure it was acceptable across this island. I would like to think, and I expect Deputy Frank Feighan or any of the Deputies here would support me on this, that if Sinn Féin was in government down here and if I was part of the Sinn Féin team, either as a political adviser or as an elected representative, that there would be no doubt that my position would be accepted. I find it insulting that people like Mary McArdle and Paul Kavanagh have found themselves outside the pale as a consequence of opportunistic political reasons motivated by one party trying to embarrass another. I would like to get the delegates' views on that. I hope we will make a strong argument in favour of getting rid of the "records", as they are called. I think this committee should make representations to the Government regarding legislation that has come through that effectively categorises former political prisoners in the same category as child abusers, rapists and so forth. I think that is terrible.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-11-21 00:00:00	Challenges in Urban Belfast: Discussion	40	I am chairperson of Coiste na nIarchimí, a group that supports former provisional IRA prisoners. Ms Avila Kilmurray set the context for this very well and I will be as brief as possible but I want to cover a number of points on behalf of our constituent part in the Prison to Peace and Conflict Transformation from the Bottom Up network. This is the Joint Committee on the Implementation of the Good Friday Agreement and I was heartened by what Deputy Frank Feighan said, namely, that it is a powerful committee. I do not mean to be smart but 15 years on from the signing of the Good Friday Agreement, I have to ask why has it not been implemented and why a number of the promises made in it and in the St. Andrews Agreement have not been implemented. The Good Friday Agreement stated: "The Governments continue to recognise the importance of measures to facilitate the reintegration - I have an issue with the word "reintegration" - of prisoners into the community by providing support both prior to and after release, including assistance directed towards availing of employment opportunities, re-training and/or re-skilling, and further education." A Bill went through these Houses which denies work to republican ex-prisoners. A Bill, to which Deputy Martin Ferris alluded, went through Stormont which provides that somebody can be a Minister but cannot be a special adviser. There is a great deal of nonsense about this. I wish to comment on a few issues that were raised. We have written a fairly length submission to the Haass talks, the details of which I will not go into as it has been forwarded to them. The submission set out clearly the political, historical context of colonialism. We make no bones about that, that is where the conflict arose, but whether people can agree or disagree with actions, that is a different day's work.  Ms Avila Kilmurray prepared a paper which is very helpful. The number of republican ex-prisoners, and indeed loyalist ex-prisoners, vary from 15,000, as some people have said, to 40,000, as stated in some reports. The figure of 40,000 comes from the British Home Officer and that excludes the period up to 1971 where there would have been several thousand people involved. It is a massive number of people. As Ms Avila Kilmurray stated in her document, when the families are taken into account, we are talking about a constituency of more than 200,000 people. That is a massive constitutency of people affected by political imprisonment. "Reintegration" is not a word that republican ex-prisoners would use. We understand people use different language and that is their language. We would see ourselves as part of communities who have returned to communities. While we have certainly settled back in again, "reintegration" is not a word that republicans would use. I wish to comment on some of the issues mentioned. With regard to political imprisonment and conflict-related convictions - again, this is language we use, and it is not criminal- but conflict-related convictions - this is included in employers' guidelines. A committee in Stormont had to draw up guidelines for employers. They have not been adopted by all employers, although some have adopted them. Therefore, there has been some progress and that is the language used.  Anyone who has had a political conviction will have issues around employment, education, voluntary work, financial services even up to including pensions in that if a person is in jail there is not a continuance of his or her contributory pension. The issue of ageing poverty has arisen. Republic ex-prisoners, and I am sure the same applies to loyalist ex-prisoners, constitute an ageing population; they are in their 50s, 60s, and 70s. That is the reality of the numbers involved and of the issues. On the issue of travel, political ex-prisoners have been refused travel. I know some of this is outside the remit of this group but it should be lobby on this issue. The USA, Canada and New Zealand will refuse travel to political ex-prisoners. We met representatives of the Australian Embassy and we had a positive response from them. The irony, as we pointed out, is that the their founding fathers were political prisons and that argument was not lost on them. We had a good meeting and they have been very positive since it. Ms Avila Kilmurray has also touched on adoption and fostering. Licences are also an issue, people can be arrested again and it can be written on their licence without any due regard to any evidence. It is crazy and it is causing untold problems in the North. If there is evidence against people that is one thing, but where people are arrested and no evidence is shown, that is creating problems and giving succour people who are opposed to the Good Friday Agreement. Some of the issues on which I have touched are outside the remit of this committee but most of them are within it. I cannot understand some of the provisions of legislation that has been introduced in the past 15 years and neither can our group understand it. We are fully behind the process. The war is over. We are treated differently from former combatants. Former combatants are not asked where they were during the 1970s or 1980s - they can travel, but we cannot. We need to deal with those issues.  With regard to some of the things we have asked for in the Haass talks, and we are very clear about this, we have said that there needs to be an expunging of convict-related convictions. The war is over, it is over and let us deal with it. Not only are political ex-prisoners refused travel, their partners - we have documentation on this and we would be happy to pass it on to the committee - were refused travel because they were on the same ticket, children have been refused travel and in the last week grandchildren have been refused travel because of their parents or a parent having been sentenced as a result of the conflict in the North in the 1970s. That is the time to which the sentence date back. We are calling for the expunging of convict-related convictions. We are also calling for - dare I use the word - an amnesty. The expunging of records deals with those who have been in prison and an amnesty deals with those who may face prison. We heard the latest comments yesterday from the Attorney General in North which caused concern, but the reality is that there has been a de facto amnesty for British forces. Five of them went to prison and three of them are still in the British Army. There is a disparity in how former combatants are dealt with.  I wish finish on this note as I know others want to speak. There is a process called "DDR2", demobilisation, demilitarisation and reinsertion. It is used in most conflicts around the world. It is a process that is used before those involved proceed to elections and the working outs post-conflict. It did not happen here. I understand it did not happen here because the Good Friday Agreement probably would not have been negotiated had that been pushed but that is what is used in countries. There have been 550 plus amnesties granted since 1945 across the world. There were amnesties granted in this State after the Civil War. There has been a history of amnesties having been granted; it is not something new. There was a recent provision in respect of the UN which states in regard to amnesties that an amnesty cannot be a blanket amnesty as that is illegal but if an amnesty is tied into weapons being put beyond use and tied into demobilising armies, then it is that. There is detail on this. These are the hard questions. I know people say "amnesty" and then shy away from it but the reality is that the British state, the other side of this conflict, has had de facto amnesty.

I have a question or two for Ms Kilmurray in particular. The PEACE IV programme will soon come on-stream. The European Parliament has finalised its budget for the coming years in recent days. Reference was made to the lack of continuity for schemes depending on such programmes. Such funding will be critically important given the challenges facing governments in terms of funding. When we know the parameters of the new PEACE IV programme we should be in a position to support any programmes Ms Kilmurray puts forward for financial support. She indicated that from the mid-1990s the European Union has been supportive of different peace building projects. I recall very well meeting with officials from the European Commission at the time when Albert Reynolds was Taoiseach. There was a particular drive at that time to ensure that the European Union supported the peace process. Could Ms Kilmurray elaborate on the work of various groups with young people in terms of highlighting to them that there is no glamour attached to going back to violence? Such information would give an indication of the value of the work. Ms Kilmurray mentioned in her publication that the work of the civic forum could be valuable from the point of view of giving another worthwhile forum to various groups to deal with issues outside the mainstream dealt with by parliamentary assemblies. The most recent questions I asked in the Dáil about the establishment of a civic forum appeared to suggest that the process was not advancing. Perhaps that would change if Ambassador Haass and Meghan O’Sullivan produce a report to that effect. I do not know how the forum worked when it was in existence. Did Ms Kilmurray engage meaningfully with the civic forum when it was in place? It should offer good potential to various groups. We spoke earlier about loyalist groups that might not be well represented in political fora, at local authority, Assembly or parliamentary level. Deputy Ferris contributed on the point. Could Ms Kilmurray elaborate on her views in terms of the potential of the civic forum? We could provide support in terms of lobbying the Government and the British Government.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-11-21 00:00:00	Challenges in Urban Belfast: Discussion	43	The witnesses are very welcome. Ironically, we discussed the issue in January 2012. I will be taking the lift today because I broke my leg in this building following the last meeting. I will not take any chances today. Since the last meeting two pieces of legislation have been introduced North and South to further discriminate against political prisoners. Things seem to be moving backwards instead of forwards. It is a double whammy for women who spent their reproductive years in prison. Martina Anderson can be a Member of the European Parliament but she can never be a mother. She is a fabulous daughter who looks after her own mother but she can never know what it feels like to have a child of her own because of the discrimination against political prisoners. It is a huge injustice that any woman would not be given such an opportunity. Adoption and fostering need to be on a par with insurance. Unfortunately, for many women demographics are now working against them and time is against them. Fifteen years on from the Good Friday Agreement it is a sin that the situation is maintained. It is immoral and women in particular are being punished as a result.

She raised the issue previously of adoption for women who have been in prison and we do not seem to have followed up on it. Why can we not take it up and do something about it?

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-11-21 00:00:00	Challenges in Urban Belfast: Discussion	48	I will respond to Deputy Smith’s questions. PEACE IV is very welcome. For obvious reasons, at the moment the emphasis is largely on young people and unemployment. Some focus should be on issues relating to ex-prisoners. PEACE funding is best used for project work. It does not have to require a big budget. Core funding would allow the continuity of groups. That goes back to the Executive. The Community Foundation for Northern Ireland has written on a number of occasions to seek meetings with the First Minister and the Deputy First Minister but we have only received acknowledgements not meetings. My organisation has been acting as lead partner for the PEACE programme in terms of the prisoner work. We are getting to the stage where we are not going to do it anymore because we feel we are being used as a comfort blanket for lack of political decision making. I have mixed views on the civic forum. It is useful potentially as a form of participative democracy. As we heard at the end of the last session, there is lack of representation from a number of areas and a civic forum might be able to address that in an affirmative manner. It would be complementary to politics because a civic forum could look at some issues that it is difficult for the elected parties to address at the moment in terms of trying to tease out some ideas following the Haass report when it comes. I will ask Mr. Deane to say something about the work of groups with young people.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-11-21 00:00:00	Challenges in Urban Belfast: Discussion	50	No, there is no pressure. I am not winking at anyone; I have a twitch in my eye. Primarily, the decision made by Lisburn People’s Support Project, PSP, at the beginning of our involvement was that there was a need to de-glamourise the conflict. A large section of young people feel that in many ways they missed out on the conflict. There is an irony which suggests that in many ways it has been glamourised. The work we did in connection with the flags protest is a great example of what we have done. We were lucky in Lisburn that the trouble in Belfast did not spread but it took a lot of work to ensure that was the case. We asked young people about their plans and what they would do if they were pushed off the street. We told them a story about how things would develop. The difficulty with the prison experience and the conflict is that in many ways they have been romanticised. Every single television programme or film made about the conflict refers at some stage to the great camaraderie in prison. That is true, but nobody tells about what happens when the cell door closes and one is alone or one’s family is falling apart. To develop on the point made by Ms Gildernew, for a man fathering children is an issue as becoming a mother is an issue for a woman. We spend a lot of time de-glamourisng the conflict. In a similar vein, I was looking at phase two of the project and the work we have done for the progress report. I have run more than 17 programmes, 13 of them have been with women and young people. They were all based around the de-glamourisation of the conflict and the pitfalls in terms of getting involved. I tell them that getting involved in conflict might affect their ability to travel and ten years down the line such involvement might seem remiss. Many young people that were involved in the on-street protests will encounter a problem further down the line in terms of travel.We believe our conscious decision to work with young people to deglamourise the conflict and the romanticism behind it has been a great success. We think it is one reason the recent trouble in and around greater Belfast did not spread to Lisburn.

It might be helpful were the witnesses to provide formally to the joint committee a list of such barriers, which hopefully could then put it through the relevant Government structures. Do the witnesses perceive the difficulty in part to be that the process came out of the Good Friday Agreement and that different individuals were then involved in the parties that signed up to the Good Friday Agreement, namely, the two Governments? It probably is easier for such people, be they from the Conservative Party, Fine Gael, the Labour Party or whatever, to state another Government was in office at that time. One element of the agreement was that it was not something that was to stand still but instead was to progress and to develop. This is where the witnesses' role comes in, that is, with regard to the inclusive element to society and so on. While I am sure this is causing huge frustration to the witnesses' own organisations, so too is scrambling around trying to get payments. I note there is no funding stream and that was never worked out. How do the witnesses respond to those cynics in society who would say that 15 years on, it is time to pack up and move back to being a normal society? Some minority submissions that were received in respect of funding, PEACE IV and so on suggested that rather than wasting time on ex-prisoners' groups and so on, there should be investments in economic projects and positive things for society, mar dhea. How do the witnesses respond to that?

It is great that the witnesses have an opportunity to make a presentation before the joint committee and to identify the areas that clearly need addressing. It is part of the regular checking of the Good Friday Agreement to ascertain what progress has been made, particularly with regard to the more sensitive areas pertaining to it. While I will not enter a long dissertation, I refer to one area, having regard to the various funds that are available, whether it is under PEACE II, PEACE III or PEACE IV, namely, the retraining, upskilling, reskilling or personal development of individuals. What progress has been made in that general area? It appears to me that developments in the area of reintegration or greater participation in community activity, both economic and social, would be critical because quite clearly, in the event of significant educational upskilling, the potential to participate in a real, positive and meaningful way is obvious. I wish to hear what sort of progress has been made in this regard in general terms.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-11-21 00:00:00	Challenges in Urban Belfast: Discussion	56	My name is Paul Gallagher and I represent Teach na Fáilte, which supports former INLA prisoners. Many legacy issues have been talked about and the point has been made that if they are not resolved, one always will be an ex-prisoner because one will carry them with one all one's life - be they in respect of employment, travel, insurance or seeking to adopt. In response to the Deputy's question, they always will be there. Consequently, we have done a lot of work on advocacy and have been working with the Northern Ireland Civil Service in an effort to put in place various programmes and to introduce voluntary acts for taking on people who have records, as we call it, to the effect that they will not be taken into account before 1998. However, I wish to raise the issue about trying to sustain the work of Prison to Peace and not being obliged to try to apply for funding through the various bodies in a reactionary way and not to be pigeonholed into the peace programme, because we develop far more work than that and it now is well highlighted that the work should be mainstreamed. Moreover, while the vast majority of us may have come from the North, this is not a Northern problem. This is an Irish problem and members will be aware there are growing numbers of current prisoners in Portlaoise. There are a lot of legacy and residual issues that Prison to Peace has come through. We have good experience of going through a process involving models of dialogue, demilitarisation and disarmament and that process, as we know it today, has not ended and the skills relationships we have learned and built are required for the future. Our group, Teach na Fáilte, has done work in Portlaoise prison. We have been talking to prisoners and about issues on social justice, community development processes and about human rights. We think that collectively, Prison to Peace can go a long way if the work is sustained in dealing with issues that will arise in the future. We have seen the Good Friday Agreement, 15 years have passed and we think that sometimes it is slipping back, a lot of that stuff has not been implemented and we are present today to answer the joint committee's questions.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-11-21 00:00:00	Challenges in Urban Belfast: Discussion	57	Briefly, on Deputy Crowe's point, this is like the debate that was signalled yesterday by John Larkin, in that while one does not talk about issues, we need to talk about the real issues. If major parties - I do not simply refer to big house unionism in this regard - across the island do not accept there was a conflict, regardless of how they come to that point, then they will not deal with issues pertaining to the legacy of the conflict. Before one starts, the debate must get around that and while people will come out with different views, that is fine. Another issue with regard to funding is there is a massive disparity of approach to former combatants. British State forces have got somewhere close to £2 billion. While no one suggests they should not get it, it is £2 billion. When one considers the PEACE money for the large numbers involved, it is welcome but it is a pittance. Moreover, I agree with Ms Avila Kilmurray that it probably is not the mechanism that should be used for this. However, given the financial state of affairs, especially in this State, there is no money there to grab and it certainly will not be allocated to dealing with political ex-prisoners in this jurisdiction. It simply will not happen. As for the PEACE IV money that is available, there has been a lot of lobbying in Brussels to try to exclude political prisoners from it. The DUP and others have been over there lobbying extensively to try to get that stopped and this also needs to be challenged because this work must continue. If it is not continued, people will still try to keep those engagements. We would continue to work with all different groupings here, with all sections of society and all communities, because there are loads of different communities and loads of different issues. However, limitations arise when one does not have staff in place or does not have programme costs and so on. The other issue in this regard is there will be a gap between PEACE III and PEACE IV. There always has been a gap, there always are delays of a year, 18 months or two years. Where will that be picked up? In the North, the last time it was picked up by some moneys obtained from the Office of the First Minister and Deputy First Minister.Obviously, that did not transmit to the Southern groups because their remit did not extent that line on the map. These are real issues. At this stage, we are set to finish in May. We still are owed 23% of the funding and have been told we might know in February or March. That is not good enough. It will take us to the end of 2014 and PEACE IV will probably not be in place for another year to 18 months thereafter. These are only practical issues. I am sorry, but I will stop speaking after making this point.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-11-21 00:00:00	Challenges in Urban Belfast: Discussion	59	We are here to talk about the Good Friday Agreement. Would we have it if it were not for the support of the ex-prisoner community? The answer is, "Probably not." As an ex-prisoner, I ask, "Has the Good Friday Agreement delivered for me?" to which the answer is, "No." I was convicted in a special court in special circumstances. I now have a criminal record, as the British Government would state. The conditions alluded to for an amnesty have been met in that weapons have been put beyond use and the organisations have been disbanded - they have been stood down. At what point will I get what I voted for when I voted for the Good Friday Agreement - a bill of rights - which will tell me that I am a citizen? When do I stop being an ex-prisoner? I have been out of prison for almost 40 years and have not broke the law since. The point Ms Gildernew made is one that I, as a male, have never grasped as to the effect on those such as Ms Martina Anderson and I am sure there are many more like her. I am fortunate in that I am a parent and do not have to adopt. I had three at once and I am not going to through that again. From where do I get my rights as a citizen? I am asked to pay my taxes; I am told I can vote, but I cannot get what I want. If I want to take out insurance, I have to declare my past. I will have to pay an excess or else I will not have insurance. I am also denied employment opportunities. What is the point in re-skilling to do a specific job and someone turns around and tells me he or she is sorry but because of something I did at 22 years of age, I cannot avail of an employment opportunity? Has the Good Friday Agreement delivered for the ex-prisoner community? It is debatable, but in some ways, yes. On the fundamentals, a Bill of Rights would guarantee us full citizenship, something to which we are entitled. If I was a rapist and out of prison the 30 odd years I have been out of prison, I could write on an application form that I had no convictions, but my conviction stays with me and will never be spent. We are a special case. If we were convicted in a special court, we are a special case and that case needs to be looked at. As to whether the answer is an amnesty, expunging or deleting records, I do not know the answer to that question, but something has to be done. We would not be where we are were it not for the contribution of the ex-prisoner community, as well as members of the ex-combatant community who are sometimes overlooked and are living in fear. I cannot be judged again for the things I did but others can.  The HET was mentioned. Is there any trust in it after the revelations about the way that some persons had been followed with more vigour than others? There is still much to be done. A start would be a bill of rights that would guarantee me the hope of full citizenship, to which I, as a citizen, should be entitled.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-11-21 00:00:00	Challenges in Urban Belfast: Discussion	61	I want to follow through on many matters which have been raised. We do not have the correct reference frame to really understand this issue. We use restrictive terminology such as "ex-prisoner". We need to begin to put that matter in context and look at it through the lenses of poverty, social isolation, social injustice and, as Mr. Dunbar stated, rights. These all are important lenses through which to look at this issue. The figure Professor Shirlow threw out was 40,000. If we multiply that figure by five for dependants such as family members, children and grandchildren, we arrive at a figure of 200,000 persons within the communities on whom there have been secondary impacts in terms of their pension rates and reduced employment options. It does not stop merely with the prisoner but percolates into the wider community. We have never really measured that impact. It is no co-incidence that in the communities from which we come there are high levels of poverty and deprivation and people are effectively prisoners of the past. A high percentage of those who joined paramilitary organisations and became involved in the conflict went on to become prisoners, but there is also hidden discrimination against former combatants. We can measure some of the discrimination against us, but we are less successful in measuring it against our children that we know occurs. In terms of security forces files still held perhaps on persons in our communities, are they still used? In these terms, there are many perceptions. All of this occurs against the backdrop of communities that experienced the full spectrum of social injustice in terms of health and education services and unemployment. On the forging of frugal and regressive mindsets within the community that are being expressed, we have described it as a socioeconomic explosive placed in a political vacuum and primed with an identity fuse. Politics is not delivering at the grassroots and identity is used as a camouflage. Politics needs to start to deliver through providing for equal citizenship.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-11-21 00:00:00	Challenges in Urban Belfast: Discussion	62	I am from EPIC Belfast which supports former UVF prisoners. There are a couple of points to be made. In terms of what should have been implemented under section 10 of the Good Friday Agreement, on a personal level, I was released under the terms of the Agreement in October 1998. A few months after I was released, I received a letter from the tax office stating if I paid £9,000, I would be entitled to a bigger percentage of my old age pension when I reached pension age. As I had only been out a few months, I did not have £9,000 and there was not a hole in the wall from which I would get it. Even if I had had £9,000, I would only have been entitled to a pension of approximately 40% or 50%. That is what that means. I have been out 15 years, all but six months of which have been spent in full-time employment. Somebody could leave school at years of age and through no fault of his or her own might not be able to find a job and remain unemployed throughout his or her working life. At 65 years of age he or she would be entitled to a full old age pension, yet I could work - God willing - for the next ten years until I was near retirement age and still not be entitled to receive even a figure of 50%. Is there anybody in this room who would see this as anywhere close to being fair? That is only one aspect. In 2007 I was invited to Indonesia to work in its peace process after the 2005 tsunami. It was funded by US Aid and I worked in Banda Aceh. It was a great learning experience and eye-opener, but as those who funded it were part of an arm of government, I was not let travel to Miami, Florida to visit Disney World. I could help to build peace in Indonesia, but I could not go to Florida for a fortnight with my daughter to see Mickey Mouse. These are small issues that might not mean a great deal to members of the committee. Ms Kilmurray made a point on core funding. It is no mistake that much of the peace-building work, particularly in connection with ex-prisoners and ex-combatants, is not core-funded. It is not done by chance but by design. I worked on a cross-community project - Interaction - that used be called the Springfield Inter-Community Development Project, SICDP. Its work was of vital importance.It was particularly vital in the new millennium when politicians were unable to agree a way forward in terms of power-sharing in the Assembly. Many ex-prisoners and ex-combatants engaged in what we would call the real peace-building work on the ground. We filled the vacuum that would have been filled by people who wanted to take us backwards instead of forwards. That was never recognised. I am not here with a begging bowl by any means; I will wash cars if I have to. The point is that we do not know what will happen this time next year because we always have to look over our shoulders. Part of the problem is that one is not able to focus fully on what one should be focusing, namely, on how we can have positive impacts, especially on the young, in order to take people away from a road that many of us felt we had to go down years ago.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-11-21 00:00:00	Challenges in Urban Belfast: Discussion	63	A point raised concerned the business of the past and charges that might well be made against certain individuals at some stage consequent on certain revelations or forensic examinations, for example. There is no general agreement anywhere on how this should be dealt with in the North. Republicans and probably most individuals present have a specific view that whatever happened in the past happened. If the war is over, it is over. One is not going to get people to come forward to talk about their role in the conflict if, by doing so, they will end up in jail again. It is simply not going to happen; therefore, people have to be honest about it. I realise certain individuals among the victims community do not particularly want the truth; they want people like me to be put back in jail. If I have not served my time for everything in which I was ever involved, they believe I should be put back in jail. It is not going to happen in the sense that I can get up and talk about my activities in the IRA simply because I have been in jail. I can talk about stuff I was involved in that led to my going to jail. However, no one can talk about everything else that happened in the conflict if it means going back to jail. This is because there is no Statute of Limitations for what happened during the conflict. If people demand the truth about a certain incident, people like me will simply say they are not getting it on the grounds that we would be put back in jail. A section of society is crying out for what it regards as closure, but it cannot have closure if it means people are going to go back to jail. That is just the position for us. In addition, one must bear in mind everything that the state was involved in over the course of the conflict, particularly in the North. As Mr. Mulgrew stated, approximately five British soldiers went to jail as a result of killings. The state has always covered its own back.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-11-21 00:00:00	Challenges in Urban Belfast: Discussion	64	I am from the Community Foundation for Northern Ireland. I manage the two PEACE programmes that we operate. I have a point I believed somebody else might have brought up.  Mr. Curry has raised the question that is asked as to why everybody does not just go home, have a cup of tea and forget about the matter on the basis that it is 15 years down the line. He has referred to the questioning of what is the point in continuing with this work. The impact and value of this work on the ground are very often missed outside the areas in which it is progressing. There were three occasions in the past four years on which we could have slid back into serious shooting-related conflict in the North. The first was when the policeman was killed, the second was when the two soldiers were killed and the third which occurred more recently was when the flag protest occurred at the beginning of this year. When one is outside the communities, it is very easy to look at the television and see a terrible thing happening without being aware of the discussion around the table. What one does not see is the discussion around the table in our office in Belfast. The loyalist representatives said there was a massive demand in their communities for a backlash and to kill a few Catholics after the killing of the policeman and two soldiers. There was a very lengthy discussion around the table and people went back into their communities and said there was no support for the activities in the republican community. That message had to be brought back by representatives of the loyalist community. There is no point in the likes of Mr. Walsh, Mr. Mulgrew, Mr. Gallagher or Mr. Dunbar saying there is no support; the message has to come from the representatives of the loyalist communities. The latter representatives, because of their background and because they are former prisoners, commanded a lot of respect and had a lot of clout in their communities. When on two occasions they went back to those communities and said there was no support for the activities in question, the lid was put back on a very dangerous situation. On another occasion there was a rumour that the INLA was to attack an Orange Order march that would be passing Ardoyne. The response within loyalist communities was,"To hell it will; we will go up to Ardoyne and sort that out." Again, there was discussion around a table and the representatives from the INLA constituency assured the loyalist representatives that there was no truth to the rumour. The rumour had been circulated by the Northern edition of one of the more irresponsible newspapers in the country. People went back into their communities and said what had been rumoured would not happen. It was a case of calling a war and nobody coming, with the consequence being no trouble in Ardoyne. One saw what was happening on the street during the flag protest. At the Short Strand-Lower Newtownards interface, events were at the point where there was real potential for somebody to be killed. The sectarian element was developing. The former IRA, ex-combatant, ex-prisoner constituents sent 100 men to the Short Strand to stop the response or attack - whichever way one views it - coming from that community. Colleagues supporting former UDA prisoners did tremendous work at the interface. This is possibly the case with some of the UVF representatives, but I know the UDA representatives pulled it back. From the outside, people saw the trouble vanishing, but they did not hear the dialogue. There is a constant, simmering undercurrent in the North that can be ignited very easily by the smallest event. We are now in a set of circumstances in which there is a lid on a number of matters. There is much discussion and debate taking place and there is a lot of work being done by the people sitting around tables that are not seen. One can never prove the riot or killing that did not happen. I am outlining the battles people have all the time. There was no trouble on Shankill Road when there was trouble in east Belfast. People expressed their surprise, but they did not realise why there had been no trouble there, in Lisburn and the area Mr. Gardiner covers in Derry. They did not see the work done on the ground. Without the project groups, there would be a massive vacuum within working class areas. People on the island do not realise how important it is to maintain this work.

The group can come in an settle matters when things are about to implode. It can be difficult work and entails courageous action on their behalf. As regards the lack of funding, if this committee can make recommendations for the group we will not be found wanting in that regard. Perhaps the group can tell us what type of funding it requires from the State.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-11-21 00:00:00	Challenges in Urban Belfast: Discussion	67	I want to echo what Mr. Ciarán de Baróid said about the work being done. People are not aware of the phone calls we get at 2 a.m. or 3 a.m. to attend interface areas. Last year in Londonderry, an issue arose concerning the flying of regimental flags belonging to the Parachute Regiment. Negotiations took place over three and a half days which, on the eve of the Apprentice Boys' parade, had the potential to create major sectarian violence. The ramifications and fallout could have spread but my colleagues and I took that risky gamble to ensure that sectarian strife did not ensue in the streets of Londonderry. Deputy Seamus Kirk raised the question of retraining and upskilling. One can try one's best to work with limited resources. I have 49 ex-prisoners who are involved through EPIC. They have done their SIA security training in licensed warehouse duties. During Londonderry's City of Culture year they were able to get casual and sustainable employment for a year. The question is what happens thereafter. Are ex-prisoners going to be discriminated against? As it stands, the ex-prisoner consortium is a disparate group, but their community is also maligned and castigated by sections within the community.  It was stated that this committee has no representation from the Unionist and loyalist community. The Official Unionist Party and the Democratic Unionist Party are very good at castigating loyalism and those involved in the From Prison to Peace Partnership. The ladies and gentlemen around this table have taken risks to ensure that the peace process is kept on track. Mr. de Baróid alluded to the murder of two British soldiers at Massereene Barracks and the subsequent murder of two PSNI officers. It should be borne in mind that there have been 63 shooting incidents in Londonderry in the past few years, so all is not well in the garden. In Northern Ireland at present we have an issue concerning parades and flag protests. There is a major one planned for the end of this month. This is not scaremongering, but we also have a major dissident threat that exists right across Northern Ireland. Does it have the potential to destabilise the peace process? That is the question.  What will happen when we go away and there is no funding to run projects to ensure that our youth are brought to the fore, as Mr. Deane said? To quote from a residential conference held at the weekend, where to now?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-11-21 00:00:00	Challenges in Urban Belfast: Discussion	68	I will wrap up with a few points. Essentially, the political ex-prisoners have fallen through the fault line in terms of the inability to deal with the past. As a result, they have taken the predominance of the blame. The inability to deal with the past comes down to something this committee can take up between the British and Irish governments. There is a conflicting narrative whereby on the one hand it was described as an aggravated crime wave, while on the other hand it was described as a political struggle or war. Until that is dealt with, everything else falls captive to our inability to look at that. As regards dealing with the past, the Community Foundation for Northern Ireland is trying to look at some sort of shared history through prisoners' eyes. We have interviewed a lot of them. One of the things that comes out strongly is that they say their involvement was not over a particular incident or ideology, but was due to the circumstances they found themselves in. Particularly on the loyalist side, people said that political speeches created the conditions they found themselves in. As regards criminal records, I attended meetings from 2002 with the direct rule minister, Mr. David Hanson. We were seeking legislation and it was argued that we should go for a voluntary code of practice. Since 2007, we have been meeting with the head of the Northern Ireland civil service and have made some small gains, but there are still outstanding issues. Something has to be done about that. Mainstream government core funding is needed for essential office and running costs, as well as essential co-ordination. The Peace IV programme comes in with broader programmatic costs. Because of a lack of funding this time last year, we had two groups - one from the republican side and the other from the loyalist side - working voluntarily without wages. They were in danger of losing their houses. I went up to the civil service to say that we would erect a cross-community tent on the grounds of Stormont to shelter those who had been made homeless due to the lack of continuity in funding. That remains a major issue and will certainly come up again. It has taken many years of work and courage to get the Prison to Peace group working together. It is a model of what we hoped would emerge from the Good Friday Agreement. Ex-prisoners who had previously set out to kill each other were actually working together to maintain the peace process. I was talking to Jackie McDonald yesterday and he said that, given the current sensitivities and tensions, there are people within their communities who, if this work does not continue and is not more robustly supported, will say: "We told you. You took the risks. You put your necks out but they let you fall by the wayside." There are dangers involved in the practical situation on the ground, as well as in how communities will respond if this sort of work is not maintained somehow.

It gave me some perspective as regards numbers. It was stated that it is not just a Six Counties problem, which is correct. To turn it the other way, the solution is not just a Six Counties solution. The flag is also being flown for Cork. I know the good work that all the witnesses are doing to try to move things forward. This committee is trying to provide space for everyone involved. In two weeks time, we will have representatives from victims' groups here. I do not have to tell those attending the committee today about the complexity of moving things forward, but we try to keep it as simple as possible. We appreciate and respect the perspective of every group that comes here.The committee will continue with its outreach programme in Northern Ireland. We will be in Derry and Donegal in January with an invite back to Belfast later in the new year. The committee’s door is always open to the delegations. Civil servants will be examining today’s proceedings to identify the issues and concerns raised. This will influence future developments. I agree there are frustrations with the peace process 15 years in. However, it is still in its infancy and we have a long road to go. We certainly want to be with the delegations on that journey. If there is any way the committee can assist, our door is always open.

In many ways, their voices have been unheard. The voices that are heard have been sometimes hijacked for political purposes. I would appreciate it if the committee could pass our message on to them for us. Many of them do not want speak to people such as us. I have to point out that I am not a former prisoner - at least not yet. The main thrust of this group’s work is trying our best to ensure there are no more prisoners and no more victims. To quote a colleague, "It takes an awful lot of work for nothing to happen."

It seems to be running into severe difficulties, particularly at a time when we are talking about the peace dividend. The bridge would be the ultimate in symbolism and achievement as far as progress in the North is concerned in the 15 years that the peace has been building. A ballpark figure for the project’s construction is €10 million. The Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport has indicated he will support financially both local authorities North and South of the Border, Louth County Council, Newry and Mourne District Council and Down District Council, which are all interested in the project's going ahead. More importantly, the Special European Union Programmes Body, SEUPB, promised €17.4 million to the project. While the project has been in gestation for some time, unfortunately, several days ago the SEUPB secretariat indicated that because it was not possible to finalise the financial package, it would withdraw its offer of funding. While there has been some toing and froing, the door is still ajar. Significant efforts are being made to move the project on and get it over the line. While I am not a full member of the committee, will it consider sending a message to the SEUPB secretariat asking it to afford three to four weeks to allow the various bodies and agencies involved to make one final effort to pull the package together?
