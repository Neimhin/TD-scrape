#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-16 00:00:00	Prelude	0	Every Member of the House supported the Government's proposal to introduce penalty points, a system that would effectively save lives. This morning we had the unedifying spectacle of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy McDowell criticising both his predecessors, Deputies Dempsey and O'Donoghue. The Minister said that when he came into office the proposals for the penalty points system had still not been acted upon and that the failure to implement this system was a tragedy. Will the Tánaiste bring before the next meeting of the Cabinet proposals to sort this out and provide the necessary resources so that this scheme can be fully computerised, implemented effectively and thereby save lives?
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-16 00:00:00	Prelude	1	In the first instance, the Minister was not critical of any of his predecessors in this regard.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-16 00:00:00	Prelude	2	He certainly was, and rightly so.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-16 00:00:00	Prelude	3	It was the last Government that provided the resources for computerisation and it is regrettable that it is taking so long. I understand that computerisation will not be completed for almost another year. However, in advance of computerisation, the Government has proceeded to introduce the penalty points system on a manual basis. That is important. Lives have been saved. Lives are being saved.

#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-16 00:00:00	Prelude	5	It is very important that members of the Garda Síochána at all levels co-operate and enforce the policy. It is not a matter for representative bodies to decide not to enforce the law. The law must be enforced. This is about life and death. It is about safety. That is why we have proceeded.This morning the Minister for Transport will announce his planned extension of the penalty  points system and also the campaign to be launched this weekend. Easter weekend is a particularly dangerous weekend on the roads. There is a great deal of travel and, unfortunately, we have had too many tragedies in the past. There will be a special campaign in place this weekend, details of which the Minister for Transport will announce shortly.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-16 00:00:00	Prelude	6	The Tánaiste misses the point completely. First, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, criticised both his predecessors. He said it was a tragedy that this system had not been implemented. Second, is the Tánaiste not aware that there is a computerised system in operation in 16 local authorities for parking fines that works and that could be adapted for the penalty points system? Third, does the Tánaiste accept that in a situation where the streets, businesses and homes of Ireland are now unsafe not on a weekly basis but on a nightly basis she, as the Deputy head of Government, is presiding over gross incompetence in Government where failure to protect our citizens brought the comment from the President yesterday that Irish society should wise up? Is the Tánaiste prepared to bring a proposal before Cabinet to provide the necessary resources so that visibility of gardaí will be evidenced on the street, the citizens of this State can feel protected and we will not have unedifying scenes in the streets more akin to Dodge City in the 1880s than to modern Ireland?The Ceann Comhairle is going to pull me up on my comment that the President said we should wise up as a society. There was no derogatory intent. The President did comment that society should wise up. The Government is in charge, and I would like it to bring proposals before Cabinet to do that.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-16 00:00:00	Prelude	7	Over the past six years the resources provided to the Garda Síochána have been increased by about 60%. The vote in the justice area is up to €900 million. I accept that far too many of our citizens have become victims of serious, vicious, horrific crimes. That is why a number of Bills are planned in this area to give the Garda additional powers.

#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-16 00:00:00	Prelude	13	The Public Order Bill is on the agenda for the Dáil today. In addition to the Oireachtas making the law, it must ensure the law  is enforced, and it is a matter for the Garda Síochána at every level in the force to ensure that the law is enforced without fear or favour.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-16 00:00:00	Prelude	14	Is the Tánaiste aware that on 10 April the Minister for Education and Science told the House that he would make a decision "one way or the other" by Easter on the reintroduction of third level fees? I am sure I do not need to draw it to the attention of the Tánaiste that today, for some reason best known to herself and the Taoiseach, is the day the Dáil goes into recess for Easter. Has the Minister for Education and Science made a decision, and does the Tánaiste agree with it? Her party seems to be all over the place on it.I have a statement here from The Sunday Business Post of 29 September on the reintroduction of fees in which the PD spokesperson is quoted as saying that, given the option, they would go for it. Then I read at the weekend – I apologise for missing the Tánaiste on Saturday, but I am taking steps to catch up on it this weekend – that the Progressive Democrats are opposed to the reintroduction of fees. What is the position? Has a decision been made? Will the tens of thousands of young people in higher education be subjected to additional fees in the new academic term? Can the parents of the 40,000 or 50,000 young people studying for the leaving certificate plan for their introduction to higher education under the present regime or will that be changed? Will the Tánaiste clarify the matter for the House before it rises for the Easter recess?
#MichaelRing	unknown-#MichaelRing-party	unknown-#MichaelRing-dob	unknown-#MichaelRing-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-16 00:00:00	Prelude	15	It will be announced on Easter Saturday.

Maybe I will send him a copy of the script today and save him the ordeal of having to take time from this period of rest and prayer to watch me.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-16 00:00:00	Prelude	22	Another one.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-16 00:00:00	Prelude	23	We have established fewer review groups than did the Opposition. The out come of that review has not yet been brought before the Government so a decision on the matter raised by Deputy Rabbitte has not been made. Access to and the availability of a good education is essential for young people. We all share that view. I have no doubt that will be foremost in the mind of the Minister for Education and Science when he brings the proposals to the Cabinet shortly.

#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-16 00:00:00	Prelude	26	I assure the Tánaiste that this is a once-off occasion for me. I am not generally interested in off-colour videos. I understand that the Tánaiste told her conference that the Progressive Democrats are now opposed to the introduction of third level fees. If she can tell the people at her conference that she is opposed to third level fees she can tell Dáil Éireann.Where do the Progressive Democrats stand on the reintroduction of third level fees? From what the Tánaiste has said, I understand that the option is open again. Never mind the Minister, Deputy Dempsey, and another review group. That is like the tax on plastic bags. We do not pay attention to that. He is always one decision away from making a decision.

Maybe he should read my speech because I did not mention the subject at my conference. He was inaccurately informed. I am not here to answer for the Progressive Democrats, but the position Deputy Rabbitte outlined is the correct one.
#CaoimhglinOCaolain	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-party	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-dob	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-16 00:00:00	Prelude	30	Is the Tánaiste aware of the growing anxiety throughout the country at the consequences of the current strike by public health doctors, the threat of a SARS epidemic, the implications for the Special Olympics and the safety of the public generally? Her colleague, the Minister for Health and Children, in his responses to questions from Deputies yesterday, failed to allay those fears. I must conclude from his responses that adequate cover is not in place to address these concerns. What effective steps does the Government intend to take to address the major deficit in public health cover, particularly in the so-called out of hours periods of evenings, weekends and bank holidays? What steps does the Government propose to take in the context of a global threat from SARS and in view of the significant numbers of visitors we hope to host during the Special Olympics in June?
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-16 00:00:00	Prelude	31	The Minister for Health and Children dealt with this matter extensively in the Dáil last night. This strike is not justified. The salary increase involved is about 25%, which is substantial. We urge the IMO to return to talks. It is the public and patients who will suffer and this is not the way to resolve the difficulties with pay matters.
#CaoimhglinOCaolain	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-party	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-dob	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-16 00:00:00	Prelude	32	The Tánaiste has answered a question I did not pose. I did not ask about the detail of the dispute between the public health doctors and the Government. I asked about the implications for the deficit in public health cover that exists apart from the interface now created by the strike action. We are talking about evenings, weekends and other out of hours periods. This situation was highlighted long before this strike action. A cross-Border study was carried out which highlighted that there is a major discrepancy between cover existing in the North of Ireland and in the rest of the island. That is the concern people have. It is important that we ensure 24 hour cover 365 days of the year.  It is important that the Tánaiste answer the important questions I have posed about the SARS threat and the concerns of host communities throughout the country regarding the implications for the Special Olympics.Although I had not earlier asked the question, will the Tánaiste advise us what steps the Government intends taking to address the current dispute with the IMO?
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-16 00:00:00	Prelude	33	Deputy Ó Caoláin asked me what the Government is doing to resolve the dispute. The Government wants to see the IMO back in the talks process through the LRC or the Labour Court. That is the only responsible way of resolving the issues. It is grossly irresponsible for the doctors in question to exclude, for example, the Disease Surveillance Centre and other emergency activities because of this dispute. That is grossly irresponsible and I call on the doctors again to reassess the decision they made last weekend on that matter so that the lives of vulnerable citizens and patients are not put at risk.

#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-16 00:00:00	Prelude	35	I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 and 2 together.Ireland North and South: A Statistical Profile is a compendium publication featuring statistical data from both this State and Northern Ireland. It is prepared jointly by the Northern Ireland Statistics and Research Agency, NISRA, and the Central Statistics Office, CSO The 2002 edition was published electronically on the NISRA and CSO websites in January 2003. This updates the first edition published in book form in January 2001.The profile draws together social and economic statistics for both parts of Ireland. It contains eight chapters covering areas such as demography, the economy, education, health and transport and tourism. Each chapter includes information from both jurisdictions presented using tables, graphs and diagrams and with detailed supporting commentary.The publication focuses on those areas where comparable data are readily available. Differences between the two jurisdictions and issues such as data availability and definition mean that it has not been possible to produce comparative data for all policy areas. However it has been possible to provide closely comparable data on most important sectors. It is hoped that this profile will continue to be of value to Departments and agencies and to the cross-Border bodies established under the Good Friday Agreement.
#JohnGormley	unknown-#JohnGormley-party	unknown-#JohnGormley-dob	unknown-#JohnGormley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-16 00:00:00	Prelude	36	How much did this cost to compile and does the Minister of State think it was a worthwhile exercise? I note the difference between home ownership here and rented accommodation figures North and South. Can we learn something from the experience in the North in terms of housing? They do not seem to have the same housing crisis as we have in the South and rents seem to be more reasonable in the North.
#RoryOHanlon	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-party	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-dob	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-16 00:00:00	Prelude	37	Deputy, you are getting into an area that would be more appropriate to address in a question to the Minister for the Environment and Local Government.

#JohnGormley	unknown-#JohnGormley-party	unknown-#JohnGormley-dob	unknown-#JohnGormley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-16 00:00:00	Prelude	42	I am simply asking if there is something to be learned from the respective experiences North and South.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-16 00:00:00	Prelude	43	Given that the statistical data were being compiled by both bodies anyway, even though I do not have a figure for it, comparisons would not be a costly exercise. Whatever the cost, it would be a valuable exercise because it would compare a wide range of topics ranging from population and households, health statistics, industry, education, labour markets, agriculture, transport, tourism and the European Union. The profile gives valuable information on how the island has developed in recent years and even draws comparative population statistics going back to the time of the Famine.The Deputy specifically asked about household tenure and that area shows a distinct difference. The document sets out that in the Republic of Ireland, 47% of people own their homes outright, with a further 35% owning with a mortgage, a very high percentage in any European terms. Only 8% rent from a local authority, 9% from private landlords and 1% live rent free. That gives a total of 82% outright or mortgaged home ownership. In Northern Ireland the comparative figure is only 67%, although that is still much higher than other areas of Europe. Information is given on house prices that shows that house prices in both Northern Ireland and the Republic increased between 1995 and 2000. It demonstrates the number of people who want to own their own homes as opposed to wanting to rent.

#JoeHiggins	unknown-#JoeHiggins-party	unknown-#JoeHiggins-dob	unknown-#JoeHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-16 00:00:00	Prelude	45	The Taoiseach is already absent from the House on Thursdays but with increasing frequency he is not in the House on Wednesdays. We do not have the opportunity to question him – questions to him have now been postponed until after Easter. Could the Ceann Comhairle arrange that if the Taoiseach is not here on a Wednesday, he makes up for it by coming into the Dáil on other days so we can subject him to questioning? The position is not at all satisfactory.

#TrevorSargent	unknown-#TrevorSargent-party	unknown-#TrevorSargent-dob	unknown-#TrevorSargent-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-16 00:00:00	Prelude	49	What is the purpose in oral questions that deal with statistical facts if the questioning is so constrained? Would the Ceann Comh airle's office be able to outline the breadth of questioning available on statistical questions? We would like to ask many questions about the statistical profile. Does the Government feel there is any need to review policy when it sees the increase in car ownership compared to the North and how heavily reliant we are on the private motor vehicle according to these statistics? Is the Government reviewing any policy positions based on this information?
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-16 00:00:00	Prelude	50	It is important that when we have statistical information of the calibre presented to us by the Central Statistics Office that it should be used in Government policy. The National Statistics Board also compiles statistics and ensures they filter through into Government policy. Statistical information was very valuable to the national spatial strategy, as it is to education and pupil numbers and demographics. Statistics play a vital role in policy formulation and there are boards designed to ensure that is the case.

#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-16 00:00:00	Prelude	59	I agree with Deputy Kenny.
#TrevorSargent	unknown-#TrevorSargent-party	unknown-#TrevorSargent-dob	unknown-#TrevorSargent-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-16 00:00:00	Prelude	60	There does not seem to be any reason the House could not sit tomorrow to debate this Bill as the proposed recess to 7 May is sufficient and will not eat into people's time. In view of this, I ask the Government to reconsider its decision that the Dáil should rise today.
#CaoimhglinOCaolain	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-party	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-dob	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-16 00:00:00	Prelude	61	I object to the proposal to impose a guillotine on the Second Stage of this important legislation, which not only addresses the issue of the dual mandate but proposes to abolish the provision allowing for the direct election of mayors and cathaoirligh of local authorities. The Bill is inadequate and requires significant amendment. The proposal to rush through Second Stage today and proceed to Committee Stage tomorrow will truncate debate.The House needs more time to consider the detail of the major reform of local government that is not being addressed by the Minister for the Environment and Local Government in the Bill. It is unnecessary to rush to Committee Stage tomorrow and I join with other Members in objecting to the proposal to guillotine the Second Stage today. I therefore cannot support the proposed Order of Business.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-16 00:00:00	Prelude	62	The Bill deals specifically with the dual mandate.
#BernardAllen	unknown-#BernardAllen-party	unknown-#BernardAllen-dob	unknown-#BernardAllen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-16 00:00:00	Prelude	63	It also deals with other matters.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-16 00:00:00	Prelude	64	The dual mandate is the main issue addressed in the Bill. The reform of local government will be the subject of other legislation sponsored by the Minister for the Environment and Local Government. The Government is anxious to take Committee Stage during the Easter break to enable Report and Final Stages to be taken when the House resumes on 7 May, with a view to its implementation during May.
#RoryOHanlon	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-party	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-dob	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-16 00:00:00	Prelude	65	Is the proposal for dealing with No. 19, Criminal Justice (Public Order) Bill 2002, Report and Final Stages, agreed?
#GayMitchell	unknown-#GayMitchell-party	unknown-#GayMitchell-dob	unknown-#GayMitchell-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-16 00:00:00	Prelude	66	It is not agreed. I do not object to Ministers having drivers, but since security has been reviewed for former Taoisigh, is it time to review it for judges, Ministers and gardaí travelling to social functions? If we need more gardaí for criminal justice provision, perhaps we should review the use of Garda drivers.
#RoryOHanlon	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-party	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-dob	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-16 00:00:00	Prelude	67	This might be more appropriate to the debate on the Criminal Justice (Public Order) Bill.
#GayMitchell	unknown-#GayMitchell-party	unknown-#GayMitchell-dob	unknown-#GayMitchell-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-16 00:00:00	Prelude	68	The job could probably be done by civilian drivers.

#GayMitchell	unknown-#GayMitchell-party	unknown-#GayMitchell-dob	unknown-#GayMitchell-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-16 00:00:00	Prelude	70	The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform opened the question himself. Maybe we could have civilians to drive Ministers.
#RoryOHanlon	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-party	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-dob	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-16 00:00:00	Prelude	71	The Deputy has made his point which it would be more appropriate to raise during the general debate on the Criminal Justice (Public Order) Bill.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-16 00:00:00	Prelude	72	The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform claimed this morning that the Criminal Justice (Public Order) Bill was obstructed by filibuster in the House. The Bill was introduced on 3 April, just prior to the general election. After the election, it was restored to the Order Paper and Second Stage debate took place on 19 and 20 June and 11 December. The Bill was referred to Select Committee on 11 December and Committee Stage was finalised in a single day on 11 February. The reason it has not proceeded to Report Stage is that ministerial amendments were not ready on time. It is now to proceed on 16 April.
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-16 00:00:00	Prelude	73	The Minister should apologise.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-16 00:00:00	Prelude	74	It is important that the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform comes into the House to make clear that he was using a public forum to mislead the people that the Opposition had obstructed this minimalist measure—

#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-16 00:00:00	Prelude	77	—when in fact, the Opposition wanted to see this Bill enacted quickly. The Minister criticised the time we spent on the Bill on Second Stage when several Members from all sides—
#RoryOHanlon	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-party	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-dob	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-16 00:00:00	Prelude	78	We are discussing a time motion.
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-16 00:00:00	Prelude	79	It is important.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-16 00:00:00	Prelude	80	—wanted to contribute on Second Stage because the issue of public order breakdown is extremely serious. There was no filibuster on the Bill, which was not detained by the Opposition. It was untrue and unfair of the Minister to use the forum he had this morning to give that impression.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-16 00:00:00	Prelude	81	Hear, hear.
#TrevorSargent	unknown-#TrevorSargent-party	unknown-#TrevorSargent-dob	unknown-#TrevorSargent-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-16 00:00:00	Prelude	82	The Criminal Justice (Public Order) Bill is one which the Minister has acknowledged is not the most controversial of Bills. Of the 37 Bills he has promised, one has been enacted and the passage of this latest Bill demonstrates that the Minister is long on public relations exercises and very short on delivery. We should get on with business and enact quickly the Criminal Justice (Public Order) Bill. The other Bills should be brought forward and we should see action rather than PR from the Minister.
#CaoimhglinOCaolain	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-party	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-dob	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-16 00:00:00	Prelude	83	Sinn Féin will support the Bill and we see no reason it should not be moved forward. The Minister's remarks on the radio this morning were a slight on the Opposition's role in engaging in the areas of amendment. As Deputy Rabbitte has noted, the Mini ster misled the public and he has a responsibility to come to the House to put the record straight and to apologise to Members for what he has said.
#BernardJDurkan	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-party	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-dob	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-16 00:00:00	Prelude	84	The Tánaiste could apologise for him.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-16 00:00:00	Prelude	85	I am delighted by the support from all parties opposite. We should proceed to enact this Bill today as intended. I appreciate the support.
#JimOKeeffe	unknown-#JimOKeeffe-party	unknown-#JimOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#JimOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-16 00:00:00	Prelude	86	That keeps Deputy McDowell in his place.
#RoryOHanlon	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-party	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-dob	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-16 00:00:00	Prelude	87	Is the proposal for dealing with No. 19a, statements on the humanitarian situation in Iraq, agreed?
#JohnGormley	unknown-#JohnGormley-party	unknown-#JohnGormley-dob	unknown-#JohnGormley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-16 00:00:00	Prelude	88	No, we have already had a debate on the humanitarian crisis in Iraq and we do not need another. What we need is a debate on the Government's position on how Iraq should be governed. Does the Government support the United States administration or would it prefer a United Nations administration? Does the Government, for example, support the introduction of weapons inspectors because this, after all, was supposed to be a war about weapons of mass destruction, but we still have not discovered them? We know now that this was a war about regime change.Unlike Deputy Rabbitte, I listened to the Tánaiste's speech at the weekend when she spoke about neutrality. It is all very well talking about neutrality outside the House but we need a debate in the Chamber on neutrality. The Government is shirking its responsibilities. We need a real debate in the House now about the crisis in Iraq. The Government is hiding behind this proposal.
#GayMitchell	unknown-#GayMitchell-party	unknown-#GayMitchell-dob	unknown-#GayMitchell-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-16 00:00:00	Prelude	89	I am delighted to see that Deputy Gormley is coming around to my way of thinking that we should at last debate neutrality in the House.
#JohnGormley	unknown-#JohnGormley-party	unknown-#JohnGormley-dob	unknown-#JohnGormley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-16 00:00:00	Prelude	90	I have always said it.
#GayMitchell	unknown-#GayMitchell-party	unknown-#GayMitchell-dob	unknown-#GayMitchell-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-16 00:00:00	Prelude	91	We have had a debate on humanitarian aid and I welcome the debate this evening. I presume the Chair will, as part of that debate, allow Members raise their concerns about the future governance of Iraq because that has relevance to the question of delivery of humanitarian aid. On that basis we will not oppose the proposal. Instead, we support it and welcome the opportunity.
#MichaelDHiggins	unknown-#MichaelDHiggins-party	unknown-#MichaelDHiggins-dob	unknown-#MichaelDHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-16 00:00:00	Prelude	92	It would be entirely unrealistic to debate humanitarian aid without debating the structures, for example, whether the United  Nations will be the lead agency to enable non-governmental organisations and United Nations agencies to work in Iraq.I have considerable sympathy for and support what Deputy Gormley said. This is probably not the opportunity for it although we must seek a debate. The Government has consistently refused a substantial debate on Iraq in the House, especially on the issues of legitimacy, the concept of pre-emption and regime change. While people at their conferences can "guff" on about one principle or another, the principle of illegality was never allowed to be discussed in the House. I support what Deputy Gormley said because the Government's concession of a debate on humanitarian issues was used as a cover for those who did not want to come to a position on the fundamental issues of whether what took place was legal. That is a fact.Obviously we will not now have a debate on the fundamentals. I assure you, a Cheann Comhairle, that we will continue to raise this issue because issues of foreign policy should be discussed in the Chamber. People say they are in favour of discussing neutrality or whatever. The Government should discuss that in the House with other aspects of its foreign policy and should not ask us to respond to its bland statements after views have been exchanged at one Council meeting or another.
#CaoimhglinOCaolain	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-party	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-dob	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-16 00:00:00	Prelude	93	The House recently unanimously supported a motion on humanitarian aid to Iraq presented in Private Members' Business and endorsed by the Government. Is it not the case that we should now address the worrying statements issued by President Bush, Mr. Rumsfeld and others, not only on the situation in Iraq and the militarily imposed regime that is proposed for it, but also regarding Syria and the United States' real intent at this time in the region? The House needs to address that and the Government needs to outline its position in response to those statements. That should be the focus. Undoubtedly that is where the people's concerns lie.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-16 00:00:00	Prelude	94	Deputies opposite sought a debate last week on the Iraqi situation and because the Minister for Foreign Affairs is with the Taoiseach in Athens, it is being taken by the Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs, Deputy Kitt. Certainly there will be no difficulty with Members putting their views on record on the governance and reconstruction of Iraq or other issues in that regard.
#JoeHiggins	unknown-#JoeHiggins-party	unknown-#JoeHiggins-dob	unknown-#JoeHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-16 00:00:00	Prelude	95	There is no time to do it.

#RoryOHanlon	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-party	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-dob	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-16 00:00:00	Prelude	97	Is the proposal for deal ing with 19a, statements on the humanitarian situation in Iraq, agreed? Agreed.
#JohnGormley	unknown-#JohnGormley-party	unknown-#JohnGormley-dob	unknown-#JohnGormley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-16 00:00:00	Prelude	98	I will not call a vote.

#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-16 00:00:00	Prelude	100	No, it is not agreed. I can see no reasonable explanation for the House not meeting again until three weeks from today. There is no reason it cannot reconvene on 29 April. We have managed to sit for 32 days since the beginning of the year and for 16 of those, the Taoiseach chose not to honour us with his presence. He has managed to be present for half the sitting days – 16 – and during that time the guillotine was used on 31 items of business. That is unprecedented at this stage of the lifetime of a Dáil. I know the Taoiseach wants to stay out of the House as frequently as possible and whenever he can.
#NoelTracey	unknown-#NoelTracey-party	unknown-#NoelTracey-dob	unknown-#NoelTracey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-16 00:00:00	Prelude	101	That is unfair.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-16 00:00:00	Prelude	102	There is no justification for a three week adjournment of the House when a Minister went on radio this morning and accused the Opposition of filibustering and said he did not have enough time to introduce all the legislation he promised. There are many days when the House could be in session and when the Minister, Deputy McDowell, could put through legislation to deal with public order and crime.There are several other examples. It did not take the Government long to put through the Freedom of Information (Amendment) Bill to disembowel the original Act when it wanted to, but it cannot put through legislation to protect the safety of citizens when it is needed. There is no need for this three week adjournment of the Dáil and I propose to the Tánaiste an amendment to the effect that the House will reconvene on 29 April.
#TrevorSargent	unknown-#TrevorSargent-party	unknown-#TrevorSargent-dob	unknown-#TrevorSargent-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-16 00:00:00	Prelude	103	My party objects to the length of time the Government will suspend the Dáil. There is no doubt that the Government is most comfortable when the House is not sitting, but that is no excuse to have such an extended vacation when so many reports as well as Bills are due to be issued in the interim. The funding of third level education report, for example, is due to be issued when the Dáil is not sitting. It is important that the issue is addressed and that the Government clarifies its position. Many families are concerned that the Government is bringing back third level fees by stealth.For the Dáil not to sit gives more credence to the belief that the Government is acting not behind a pane of glass but a brick wall, that it is bringing forward measures the Dáil cannot debate, and that is the reason it is suspending the Dáil for this time. We support Deputy Rabbitte's call that the Dáil be recalled before the date the Tánaiste announced and that we have a properly  accountable Dáil without the long vacations of which people are rightly suspicious and contemptuous.

In the event of the situation in respect of Northern Ireland being clarified, it may be necessary to recall the Dáil for whatever reason. Will the Tánaiste assure me that if a recall is warranted, depending on the outcome of the closing stages of these negotiations, the Dáil will be recalled?

He may be out of order but he is accurate in what he has said. I support the proposal that the House should not adjourn for the period specified. There are so many reasons we could argue for an earlier resumption of business following the Easter recess, not least of all because of the raft of legislation the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform has to present to both Houses and the important rights-based legislation for people with disabilities.

#RoryOHanlon	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-party	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-dob	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-16 00:00:00	Prelude	135	That is not a point of order.
#MichaelRing	unknown-#MichaelRing-party	unknown-#MichaelRing-dob	unknown-#MichaelRing-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-16 00:00:00	Prelude	136	It is the only way to make my point. One could join—

#MichaelRing	unknown-#MichaelRing-party	unknown-#MichaelRing-dob	unknown-#MichaelRing-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-16 00:00:00	Prelude	138	—and have another day to do both.
#RoryOHanlon	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-party	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-dob	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-16 00:00:00	Prelude	139	I have called on the Tánaiste.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-16 00:00:00	Prelude	140	As I said, the Dáil will adjourn for two weeks plus tomorrow. During that period, at least four Bills will be discussed in committee, including the dual mandate Bill in which Deputy Ring has a particular interest. I have no doubt he will participate. During this session we have passed 15 Bills—

#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-16 00:00:00	Prelude	142	—and I do not believe the  break that is being proposed is excessive. If events in Northern Ireland, legislation or whatever warrant the recall of the Dáil, I have no doubt that a recall will be forthcoming. It is the Taoiseach's intention to stay in touch with the Opposition parties during the break if matters evolve in Northern Ireland.
#RoryOHanlon	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-party	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-dob	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-16 00:00:00	Prelude	143	Deputy Rabbitte has tabled an amendment to the Order of Business to delete "7 May" and substitute "28 April". Is the Deputy pressing the amendment?
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-16 00:00:00	Prelude	144	Yes. Deputy Breen can abstain.
#GayMitchell	unknown-#GayMitchell-party	unknown-#GayMitchell-dob	unknown-#GayMitchell-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-16 00:00:00	Prelude	145	I was asking earlier about the Criminal Justice (Public Order) Bill 2002. The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform is taking gardaí away from former Taoisigh and is reviewing this whole matter and putting more gardaí on the beat. I do not have any objection to Ministers having drivers, but if the Minister is looking at this issue, maybe it is time to civilianise that whole process and put more gardaí on the beat—
#RoryOHanlon	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-party	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-dob	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-16 00:00:00	Prelude	146	Does the Deputy have a question on legislation appropriate to the Order of Business?
#GayMitchell	unknown-#GayMitchell-party	unknown-#GayMitchell-dob	unknown-#GayMitchell-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-16 00:00:00	Prelude	147	The Criminal Justice (Public Order) Bill 2002 before the House is an attempt to curb the terrible crimes that are taking place, particularly among young males on the streets of Dublin. Will the Tánaiste use the opportunity of this Bill to maximise the number of gardaí available by not just reviewing Garda drivers and Garda security for former Taoisigh but also for Ministers and other office holders?
#RoryOHanlon	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-party	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-dob	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-16 00:00:00	Prelude	148	The Deputy is out of order.
#GayMitchell	unknown-#GayMitchell-party	unknown-#GayMitchell-dob	unknown-#GayMitchell-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-16 00:00:00	Prelude	149	Driving judges to courts and so on could be done by civilians—

#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-16 00:00:00	Prelude	152	That Bill has not gone to the Government yet so I am not in a position to give the Deputy a precise time.

Can the Tánaiste assure people with disabilities, and this House, that the Government will introduce rights-based legislation that will address the needs of people with disabilities both nationally and internationally? When will such legislation be brought forward?
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-16 00:00:00	Prelude	154	The two Bills in this area will be published in the next session.
#DenisNaughten	unknown-#DenisNaughten-party	unknown-#DenisNaughten-dob	unknown-#DenisNaughten-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-16 00:00:00	Prelude	155	In light of the virtual collapse of the penalty points system and the decision of the Garda not to enforce it, I wish to ask the Tánaiste about two pieces of promised legislation. Is she aware that 16 local authorities have a computerised system in place but that when it was put forward for tender, they were told that their proposal was far too comprehensive to be dealt with?
#RoryOHanlon	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-party	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-dob	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-16 00:00:00	Prelude	156	Does the Deputy have a question on legislation?

#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-16 00:00:00	Prelude	158	The penalty points system has not collapsed. Some 14,000 people have received penalty points already.
#DenisNaughten	unknown-#DenisNaughten-party	unknown-#DenisNaughten-dob	unknown-#DenisNaughten-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-16 00:00:00	Prelude	159	How many penalty points have actually been—

#DenisNaughten	unknown-#DenisNaughten-party	unknown-#DenisNaughten-dob	unknown-#DenisNaughten-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-16 00:00:00	Prelude	164	I asked about promised legislation.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-16 00:00:00	Prelude	165	The fines Bill will be published later this year. There are a number of Bills planned in the whole area of road traffic. Some of them will be published next year and I think there may be one later this year as well.
#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-16 00:00:00	Prelude	166	Does the Tánaiste share my concern that eight gardaí are working full time in the fines office, together with about another 50 gardaí—
#RoryOHanlon	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-party	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-dob	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-16 00:00:00	Prelude	167	The Deputy is out of  order. Does she have a question appropriate to legislation?
#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-16 00:00:00	Prelude	168	I am asking about the development of the agency to collect fines which has been promised by this Government for about six years. There are 50 gardaí working in Dublin collecting fines at a time when a local newsletter in my constituency and the Tánaiste's is warning about—
#RoryOHanlon	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-party	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-dob	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-16 00:00:00	Prelude	169	The Deputy is out of order.
#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-16 00:00:00	Prelude	170	—the availability of crack cocaine. Some 50 gardaí are collecting fines—

#SeanPower	unknown-#SeanPower-party	unknown-#SeanPower-dob	unknown-#SeanPower-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-16 00:00:00	Prelude	172	The war in Iraq claimed many lives, including that of an Irish man. I ask the Tánaiste if she would consider it appropriate for the House to express our sympathy to the family of Lance Corporal Ian Malone, who was killed in that war.
#RoryOHanlon	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-party	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-dob	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-16 00:00:00	Prelude	173	It is not appropriate to raise the matter at this time.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-16 00:00:00	Prelude	174	I think it is appropriate that we should express our condolences and our sympathy with the family of the late lance corporal. That has been done privately by a number of people in this House and it is a good thing that we do it here this morning. We have reached a level of maturity in this State where we can acknowledge that Irish people do fight under different flags and are no less Irish for that. I agree with the sentiments expressed by Deputy Power.
#EmmetStagg	unknown-#EmmetStagg-party	unknown-#EmmetStagg-dob	unknown-#EmmetStagg-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-16 00:00:00	Prelude	175	Can we include all of the people who died in this awful war?
#EamonRyanGP	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-party	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-dob	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-16 00:00:00	Prelude	176	I ask the Tánaiste, on behalf of the Taoiseach and the Government, to correct a serious error the Taoiseach made yesterday in speaking about the Moneypoint power station. He said it would be converted to gas but we have received confirmation that we are correct in saying that it is not being converted.
#RoryOHanlon	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-party	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-dob	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-16 00:00:00	Prelude	177	The Deputy should find another way of raising the matter.
#EamonRyanGP	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-party	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-dob	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-16 00:00:00	Prelude	178	It is important, on the Order of Business, that the Government clarify its position. I have tabled an adjournment debate matter because it is very important.
#RoryOHanlon	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-party	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-dob	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-16 00:00:00	Prelude	179	I suggest that the Deputy submit a question to the Taoiseach on the matter.

#SeymourCrawford	unknown-#SeymourCrawford-party	unknown-#SeymourCrawford-dob	unknown-#SeymourCrawford-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-16 00:00:00	Prelude	184	It is vital for this major industry—

#JoeHiggins	unknown-#JoeHiggins-party	unknown-#JoeHiggins-dob	unknown-#JoeHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-16 00:00:00	Prelude	197	I refer to the sudden loss of memory of the Tánaiste that she has been in Government for the past six years.

Some 37 Bills have been proposed, thought about or talked about. It is a question now of either talking the talk or walking the walk, or is it a question again of the Progressive Democrats punching above their weight?
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-16 00:00:00	Prelude	201	There is a long list here and perhaps I will circulate the timescale to the Deputy, but a number of Bills will be published in this area after Easter.

If it made that decision yesterday at Cabinet, will it be introduced by way of regulation or legislation? When can we expect to see the regulation or the legislation?

#TomHayes	unknown-#TomHayes-party	unknown-#TomHayes-dob	unknown-#TomHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-16 00:00:00	Prelude	218	This is very appropriate because the Dáil will not sit for three weeks. This dispute will escalate and will cause huge—

Many of us have based our political careers and established our reputations on the work we have done as local representatives. I have built my electoral base on the work I have done since I was elected to South Dublin County Council for the first time in 1999. Many of my colleagues have grave concerns about the abolition of the dual mandate and I admit that I have reservations about it. Most constituents who approach me with queries do not care whether the issues they are raising are of local or national significance. They do not care whether the matters relate to a local authority, a Department or the Government, as long as they receive an answer. Most issues that are referred to me pertain to local government matters. It is difficult to walk away from one's political base and the issues which make up most of one's work, and one must be brave to do so.We need to examine the work of local authorities in a realistic manner. In the short time I have spent on South Dublin County Council, the workload has varied enormously. Councillors now receive recognition of their work in the form of pay, but the money involved is small compared to the volume of work, which is growing rapidly. The issue of local representation will have to be reviewed as we go forward. While this Bill abolishes the dual mandate, future legislation will have to assist those who give a great deal of their time to serve on local authorities. It is no longer satisfactory to turn up for short periods of time as the work is becoming quite complex and detailed. Locally elected representatives have a duty of care in relation to the people they represent. I can only speak for my local authority, but there seems to be more and more briefing meetings. With the regular monthly council meetings, there are two area meetings each month as well as SPC meetings and gatherings of the IAP monitoring committee.Certain special projects also need to be dealt with from time to time. The development of a swimming pool in Clondalkin, which involves design and planning processes, will cost about €9 million or €10 million. The project has involved a number of additional meetings. It is planned to develop between 8,000 and 10,000 housing units in the strategic development zone in the Adamstown area, near Lucan, in the coming years. There are numerous special meetings in relation to the project.If one is to take on such a workload honestly, by giving the commitment that is involved to do one's job well, it is hard to find enough time to be a Member of this House and a member of a local authority at the same time. I am well aware that these issues apply to those who are not members of the Oireachtas. I regret, however, that my work performance on South Dublin County Council is not the same this year as it was last year, before I was elected to this House. I could not have sustained such a local authority workload as this House sits for three days each week, often at the same time as many of our meetings. I regret that as I have thoroughly enjoyed my time on the council. I have grave apprehensions about giving it up because I know that the people who will knock on my constituency office door on Monday or Friday mornings, in particular, will raise issues that pertain, by and large, to South Dublin County Council matters.It is with great reluctance that I support the abolition of the dual mandate. I am doing so, however, in the clear knowledge that it is for the better good, something I did not always believe to be the case. I opposed this measure for selfish reasons when I considered it first because I had the same political concerns as others. I feel vulnerable and exposed by not being a member of a local authority which, for many elected representatives, is the local centre of activity because it is where things happen on the ground every day. I feel the sense of vulnerability that exists among those who are walking away from the centre of activity.Before I share time with my colleague, Deputy Nolan, I would like to point out that this Bill has changed somewhat from the version that was brought to us originally. I compliment the Minister, Deputy Cullen, for introducing such changes, having listened to his party colleagues during a meeting that was not among the more pleasant he has attended. Members of the Minister's party were extremely concerned to ensure that they would still have real access to their local authorities so that they would be able to keep in touch with events in their local areas. The Minister took such concerns on board in the course of a heated and emotional meeting. People spoke in emotional terms about the big change that will have to be made by some members of my party and the House, who have spent in excess of 20 years on local authorities.I express my appreciation for the Minister, who took our concerns on board. Access to infor mation, which has now been guaranteed as a consequence of changes to this Bill and further regulation, was the primary concern that was mentioned. While I freely admit that such access is not the same as attending meetings and influencing decisions, it is a fundamental and important change for Members of this House. It is imperative that we know what is happening locally so that we can serve the needs of constituents who telephone, write, e-mail and call to us each day. I compliment and thank the Minister for taking on board the comments that were made to him brutally during a heated and emotional discussion. If we are to give up our council seats, we must continue to be able to meet the demands and needs of the people we represent.The changes and the amendments which the Minister has made and the regulations to follow will assist us in doing this.
#MJNolan	unknown-#MJNolan-party	unknown-#MJNolan-dob	unknown-#MJNolan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-16 00:00:00	Prelude	386	I commend the Minister for bringing forward this Bill. It is another step in the continuing development of local government since its establishment in 1898. We celebrated the centenary of local government two years ago. Much has changed in that time and particularly in the last ten or 15 years. It is not possible for any individual to satisfactorily carry out both the role of national representative and local authority member and if there was nothing else in this Bill, the Minister has done something in that regard.The Bill has not been popular within certain sections of both Houses of the Oireachtas but I am a supporter of the abolition of the dual mandate. Oireachtas Members will suffer a little because we will not also be local authority members but if proper access and structures are put in place by the Minister to ensure access for us on an ongoing basis to local authorities and their various departments, some of the effect of the legislation could be diluted.I have been a member of local authorities since 1974 and I have seen significant changes. Individuals who were members of county councils at the time of the abolition of house rates in 1977 say they saw a serious decrease in the effectiveness of their role as county councillors following that abolition. I was not a county council member at that stage.I congratulate the Minister for his proposal to set up a process to examine the area of local authority funding. Unless county councils and local authorities are given the right to raise finance they will not be as effective in the area of spending. It is like the old cliché which says that anything that comes handy is given away too handy. Currently 95% of local authority funding comes from central government and a large proportion of that is already earmarked by central government and the Department of the Environment and Local Government before it reaches local authorities.I do not see any difficulty in the proposal for the changing of previous legislation for the direct  election of mayors. We in this House elect our own Taoiseach and Ceann Comhairle. I do not think this proposal will make any great change because town councils will continue to elect their cathaoirleach or mayor as the case may be.The Bill is another step in the process of improving local government. While its main effect will be to end the dual mandate and amend the previous legislation for directly-elected mayors, it is an opportunity for the Minister to examine some of the shortcomings that exist in local government. It is important to separate the role of local government and the national Parliament. Every fair-minded Member of this House will acknowledge that it is becoming more difficult to carry out the role of local authority member and also be an effective Member of these Houses.Like Deputy Curran I have found that my effectiveness as a local authority member has not been as great as I would like it to be. When I step down as a local authority member and somebody else takes my seat, his or her commitment and resolve and ability to work for the people in Carlow will be far greater than mine because I must spend a greater amount of time in Dublin.The ending of the dual mandate has been supported by a broad range of interests over many years. As far back as 1990, the Barrington report stated that the joint membership between local government and national Parliament should cease. Representative organisations such as the General Council of County Councils have lobbied over the years for the abolition of the dual mandate and organisations such as the Chambers of Commerce of Ireland and the National Youth Council of Ireland have also supported this decision.The Council for the Status of Women has stated that the ending of the dual mandate would open up greater opportunities for women to enter local politics and, through that, to national politics. At present, less than 17% of local authority members are women. This Bill is another step on the road to improving local democracy.The Local Government Act 1999 debarred Ministers of State from becoming members of local authorities. The Local Government Act 1994 disqualified the Ceann Comhairle of the Dáil and Cathaoirleach of the Seanad from membership of local authorities and debarred Members of the Oireachtas from becoming chair or vice-chair of local authorities after the 1999 local elections. In that regard I do not see any merit in the case which Deputy Ring is proposing to take to the Supreme Court to test the constitutionality of this Bill. I am sure the Minister had checked out that possibility well before he brought this legislation to the Houses of the Oireachtas.In the White Paper entitled Better Local Government, published in 1996, it was recommended that further actions should be taken regarding membership of local authorities post the 1999 elections. It is also worthy of note that  the ending of the dual mandate is supported by all the major political parties in this House. In the previous Dáil the Opposition parties supported this aspect and I presume they will be consistent and support the Minister in this case also.It is becoming increasingly difficult for Members of the Oireachtas to remain efficient members of a local authority when one considers the number of committees and sub-committees that now form part of local council structures. The number of committees of which councillors are now obliged to be members has increased substantially over the past ten years. There are now additional groups such as county enterprise boards, Leader groups, local partnerships, county development boards and special policy committees. There are local voluntary groups of which county councillors are expected to be a part.Local government in Ireland celebrated its centenary in 1998 and has played a pivotal role in the development of Irish society. I would like to see this role enhanced and improved and this Bill is another step on the way. The Minister has a genuine and sincere commitment to local government and I know this will not be the end of the legislative process which he wants to put in place to ensure strong, vibrant local government.
#SeanRyan	unknown-#SeanRyan-party	unknown-#SeanRyan-dob	unknown-#SeanRyan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-16 00:00:00	Prelude	387	I wish to share my time with Deputy Shortall. This month is the anniversary of my 20 years on the local authority. I was initially co-opted onto Dublin County Council in 1983. Over that period I have derived immense satisfaction and experience from carrying out my duties over such a diverse range of areas. Apart altogether from providing a service to my constituents, which I always regarded as my priority, the county council was a great training ground for me.

#SeanRyan	unknown-#SeanRyan-party	unknown-#SeanRyan-dob	unknown-#SeanRyan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-16 00:00:00	Prelude	389	As I stated before we were interrupted, apart from providing a service to my constituents, which I always believed was my first priority, the county council was a great training ground for people aspiring to higher public office, whether as a Senator or TD. I can honestly say that without my experience and exposure to local authority work I would not have been elected to Dáil Éireann. The same goes for the vast majority of Members in this House. Having said that, I have no great difficulty with the ending of the dual mandate. The reality is that increased demands on Members of the Oireachtas, both in terms of deputations, committee work and scrutiny of European legislation, which will be an  ever-increasing requirement in the future, will make simultaneous membership unrealistic.The ending of the dual mandate is the main measure in the Bill. The other significant element is the discontinuance of arrangements already enacted in the Local Government Act 2001 for the introduction of directly elected mayors or cathaoirligh of local authorities throughout the country. What is the reason for this about turn? When the Local Government Act 2001 was passed, which provided for the direct elections, Fianna Fáil were considerably higher in the opinions polls. They could do nothing wrong. The Taoiseach was perceived to be able to walk on water. Fianna Fáil believed its nominees throughout the country could be elected mayor or cathaoirleach in virtually every local authority. That situation has changed, and changed drastically. This is the reason Fianna Fáil has changed its policy on directly elected mayors or cathaoirligh. It is no wonder people are cynical about politics and politicians, particularly as the previous Minister took such great pride in putting forward the benefits to be gained from directly electing mayors.When the 2002 Act was originally introduced it was argued that the provisions for direct elections were necessary to strengthen the elected side of local government in light of the discussions to end the dual mandate. Now the dual mandate is going and the counter balancing measure is also being scrapped. From my experience, I can confidently say that arising from this further broken promise by the Government, county managers throughout the country will now be literally able to do what they like. Whether we like to admit it or not, by and large, it was the Oireachtas Members who were prepared to stand up to county managers and ask them to be accountable for their actions.

#SeanRyan	unknown-#SeanRyan-party	unknown-#SeanRyan-dob	unknown-#SeanRyan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-16 00:00:00	Prelude	391	I hope the new generation of councillors who will come on stream arising from the co-options and local elections next year will be prepared to put in place the structures to ensure that everyone who is interested in public life will be able to go forward for elections from a level playing pitch. When I was a member of the county council I was not allowed time off to fulfil that duty. I had to try to slip out when my superior officer was not looking. I had to get some of my colleagues to cover for me so that I could slip down to the local authority to work on behalf of my constituents. That is the type of system that allows bureaucrats to look down their noses at elected members of local authorities. Major changes must take place in this regard. We must acknowledge the role and significance of local authorities but we must also give them the power and responsibility to enforce legislation at local level.Up to 70% of my work load was related to the local authority and, when not on the council, a substantial amount of this work will continue.  Accordingly, it is essential, if Oireachtas Members are to discharge their duties as public representatives, that they are entitled to full information about the activities of local authorities. The Bill enables the Minister to issue guidelines as to the manner in which local authorities will conduct their dealings with Oireachtas Members. This is not sufficient. I am calling on the Minister to publish these guidelines prior to Committee Stage of the Bill. I would have thought the Minister would have outlined the guidelines in his Second Stage speech so that we would be able to critically analyse them to see whether they go far enough to ensure the people we represent will get a fair hearing. The guidelines should be available for Committee Stage so that we will know the position and be able to table amendments. The guidelines should be given statutory effect.

#SeanRyan	unknown-#SeanRyan-party	unknown-#SeanRyan-dob	unknown-#SeanRyan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-16 00:00:00	Prelude	393	I am not suggesting that Members of the Oireachtas should take on the responsibilities of local councillors. However, major issues are developing on a daily or weekly basis that would be of interest to local TDs and public representatives. There should be a facility to allow Members of the Oireachtas to sit in at council or area committee meetings if they choose to do so. There could be a very important issue which would require the attendance of a TD or Senator. If a TD currently wants to see what is happening he must sit in the public gallery with the general public. A designated area should be allocated to Oireachtas Members other than the public gallery.The Minister, Deputy Cullen, stated that the Bill should be viewed as another step in the process of local government reform which has been moving progressively forward over a number of years. As I stated earlier, the Bill provides for the rowing back on legislation enacted in the 2001 Act. The reality is that the Government is not prepared to delegate responsibility for decision-making to any meaningful effect to local authorities. We have by far the most centrally controlled form of local government in the EU, and it is getting worse, notwithstanding the hype the Minister might wish to put out.The past six years of Fianna Fáil-Progressive Democrats rule have witnessed the serious undermining and erosion of local government. Significant powers have been shifted from democratically elected local authorities to managers and national authorities. This is a retrograde step. We must look to the reform of local government in the future. We must also look at the SPCs, which are an utter disaster. Local community-based representatives are losing enthusiasm in this area and we must look at the reasons for this.While I look at this Bill as a step in the development of local government, structures must be put in place at local and national level to ensure councillors can carry out their work prop erly. Given the enhanced legislation that is required of this House, we must be given the back-up to do this. How can we be expected to analyse legislation emanating from Europe when a Deputy, secretary and assistant has to carry out the work? It is about time the Government looked at the services it is providing to elected members at local level and the Oireachtas. What is being provided at the moment is an utter scandal and it is about time the Government acknowledged the role of the elected Member.
#RoisinShortall	unknown-#RoisinShortall-party	unknown-#RoisinShortall-dob	unknown-#RoisinShortall-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-16 00:00:00	Prelude	394	I thank Deputy Sean Ryan for sharing time with me. The Labour Party opposes this Bill because it believes it is a sham masquerading as local government reform. I do not oppose this Bill along the same lines as backbench Government Deputies that fear the ending of the dual mandate; I oppose this as I believe it will lead to weaker local government. It has been accepted for the past 25 years that local government is ineffective and lacks real teeth. While the Government seeks to end the dual mandate as a means of reforming local government, it will do nothing of the kind. Local government is powerless. Government in this country is centralised to a greater degree than in any other European country. There are no local powers in education, transport or health, services that should be dealt with at local level. While all those powers are centralised and we have a managerial system at local government level, local government will continue to be a joke. Local government is currently on its knees.We must admit that the people who carry local government at public representative level are, by and large, Deputies and Senators. They are doing this because they are full-time politicians and can pursue the city or county manager on issues that affect their areas. They have the time to do this and get around the obfuscation and evasiveness of many local government officials that give meaningless replies and sometimes refuse to answer questions. Most councillors, particularly those that are councillors only, simply do not have the time to pursue management on issues of accountability. Managers know that the vast majority of councillors do not have the time to pursue them and they can get away with obfuscation and a lack of accountability.Who is in a position to stand for election to local government when one bears in mind the considerable time, financial and personal demands this places on individuals? What person in a normal job can take off three hours on a Monday morning to attend an SPC or take an entire Thursday afternoon off to attend a local area committee meeting? It is not possible to do this if one is trying to hold down a normal job. We are increasingly seeing that those who stand in council elections are retired, working part-time or not working at all. I am not sure that it is desirable that we continue to build a framework for local government on people that can only give a part-time commitment. All parties came across  this in the last local elections in 1999 when looking among their members for people that would make good candidates. Most able people in decent jobs, the kind of people we should be trying to attract to local government, do not have the time to do the job. Why would they do it? It is a blooming thankless job. The hours are dreadful; one can expect calls at all hours of the day and is required to attend four of five meetings in one's constituency each week. What regular person has the time to devote to this?We need to move far beyond the current position and introduce decent local government reform. There are too many councillors and too many local authorities for this small country. Why can we not operate with five or six decent-sized councils covering the country? There should also be a second tier at town level so that major areas of population have urban district councils to deal with local matters. This would be a starting point. We need large-scale structural reform to reduce the number of councillors and make the position full-time. It is an interesting and important area. The job of councillor is full-time in practically every other European country. It should be possible to make a living and career as a councillor, particularly if we reduce the number of councillors. Why not make it a full-time job and allow people to devote time to working in local government instead of having the mishmash we currently have? If the Government continues with this Bill, it will severely weaken local government because of the calibre of people available to be councillors.There is an urgent need to reform the areas of responsibility of local government. I am a member of 11 other bodies within my constituency. I am a member of two drugs task forces, two area partnerships, a RAPID implementation committee, an education task force, two community development projects and a number of other groups, task forces and committees. There is a plethora of such organisations and it is difficult to keep track of them. We have such groups because of the weakness of local government. All of the issues dealt with by these bodies, ranging from education to drugs and community development, should come under proper local government. Some people would call these groups quangos and I know there is much concern abut the lack of accountability for the large range of different community groups, task forces and State agencies that have been established in recent years. It is impossible to keep track of them. Local government officials, health board officials and gardaí are increasingly spending their time attending meetings of these bodies, all of which hold monthly meetings. In my case, I have 11 additional monthly meetings to keep track of the community development area, something that should properly be under the remit of local government.There is a huge lack of representation for the public in the Dublin area. In the case of my con stituency, Dublin North-West, there are seven councillors representing that constituency. In practically every other county outside of Dublin, each constituency has a county council or a city council. In Dublin we do not have such a structure. If we are serious about local government reform we have to look at representation, and at how we can attract high-calibre people to make it a full-time job, reduce the numbers but let us not pretend this will bring about reform. It will do nothing of the kind.

#MildredFox	unknown-#MildredFox-party	unknown-#MildredFox-dob	unknown-#MildredFox-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-16 00:00:00	Prelude	400	I object to this Bill and the Government's intention to abolish the dual mandate on a couple of grounds. First and foremost it takes away my right to stand for election. It takes away the right of the voters to democratically elect me or reject me, as they see fit, or any other Member of the Oireachtas as a representative of their local community. It limits their choice of candidates, it discriminates against me, because of my job, and it implies that I am not a suitable person to represent my local community in a particular local forum.In the 20th amendment to the Constitution the people passed an amendment dealing with local government. Article 28A of the Constitution states:The State recognises the role of local government in providing a forum for the democratic representation of local communities, in exercising and performing at local level powers and functions conferred by law and in promoting by its initiatives the interests of such communities.At the time this amendment was passed, the democratic representation of local communities on local authorities clearly included Oireachtas Members. This Bill, if passed, will redefine the term "democratic representation", mentioned in Article 28A of the Constitution. It is no longer the concept that the people passed when voting on that referendum, if this Bill is passed.This Bill limits the democratic representation of local communities on local authorities compared to what now exists. Time after time Oireachtas Members have been returned as local authority members by the public to represent them. If the dual mandate system is so bad why  do the people re-elect us? I believe the decision should be left with the people. This Bill tells me as an Oireachtas Member that I should have no role in the promotion of initiatives and interests of my local community at county council level and I object to that.The Minister has proposed a number of measures to ensure Oireachtas Members will enjoy access to the local authority, after the abolition of the dual mandate. As far as I am concerned these measures are of no help.  At present Oireachtas Members who are not members of county councils have a certain degree of access to the county council, but this does not come close to substituting as a member of a local authority.My constituency includes Wicklow and east Carlow. Therefore, I have dealings with both Wicklow County Council, of which I am a member, and Carlow County Council, of which I am not a member. With all due respect to Carlow County Council, there is no comparison between my relationship with it and with Wicklow County Council. As a Member of the Oireachtas I am obviously entitled to make representations to Carlow County Council, but unfortunately this is and will continue to be a glorified pen pushing operation, similar to the measures being proposed by the Minister. There is no substitute for being a member of the local authority. No proposal will replace the ability to raise, and to vote on, local issues.The subject of the dual mandate has had its fair share of debate during the past two years. Just over two years ago the Local Government Act was passed and during that period the dual mandate section of the Bill was controversially dropped. As one of the Independents who then supported the minority Government I voiced my opposition to the Taoiseach at that time as to why I felt the abolition of the dual mandate was wrong. As a result the measure was dropped only to re-emerge now.The debate at that time centred on the fact that somehow the local government system is creaking because it is full of Oireachtas Members. My local authority meets on average six hours per month, less time per week than "Coronation Street". I would like to know how the banning of Oireachtas Members from participating in six hours of debate every month will reform local government? It will not reform local government.The idea of reforming the Dáil has also been suggested. I support that suggestion. We should reform the Dáil, sit for more days per week, sit for longer sessions, take a shorter summer recess and then, and only then, could we point the finger at the dual mandate and tackle it, at that stage, if it needs tackling.I have also heard charges that Oireachtas Members are double jobbing. Almost every member of a local authority is double jobbing. Most local authority members are employed in other sectors. Surely that is the purpose of serving local people and being in touch with people. Different employment sectors bring diversity to local  government and highlight the needs of local people whom we work alongside in our daily lives. Otherwise, we simply become a forum of civil servants who dictate to the people who elect us.As a citizen of this State it is my fundamental and personal right under Article 40 of the Constitution to be held equal before the law. If this Bill is passed, I am unequal. I can be a doctor, solicitor, teacher, farmer or unemployed person and run for my local authority, but God forbid that I should be a Member of the Oireachtas. I am asking that the Government request the President to test the constitutionality of this Bill, as I believe my constitutional rights are being affected.Nobody has given me a credible reason as to why I am unsuitable to serve as a county councillor. I was elected in 1999 to represent my local community because the public deemed me the best person for the job. I am willing to go forward again for election as an Independent and as a young woman but I am being denied this right.Most of the main political parties have said they are opposed to the dual mandate and they are entitled to hold that view. I put it to them that if they feel the system is inappropriate why wait to be forced off the county councils? Why not lead by example and make it a party policy to refuse to run sitting Oireachtas Members in the 2004 elections? Why not have the courage of their convictions and make a cross-party agreement, if that is how they feel? They should not force smaller parties and Independents to do likewise.I am proud to be a member of my local authority and I am also proud to be a Member of the Dáil. People in Ireland are lucky in that they enjoy access to their national politicians. That is not the case in most other countries where politicians and representatives are surrounded by handlers and minders of all kinds. If this Bill is passed, we are changing yet another way of life in Ireland. While the outcome of the Bill in this House is obvious, I hope on another day, in another forum, it will be thrown out.

I am now nearing completion of the first year of my second term as a TD for my constituency in south and south-west Kerry. I have worked tirelessly for my constituency as a councillor and TD. I do not consider this to be double-jobbing. I consider it a way to serve my constituents to the very best of my ability. If I could not represent my constituency at local level I would  lose touch with the people. The end of the dual mandate is unconstitutional. As I said on Kerry Radio, I agree with Deputy Ring that this Bill must and will be challenged. I could be a doctor and a TD, a barrister and a TD, but I cannot be a county councillor and a TD. This is absolutely unbelievable.The implementation of the Local Government Bill 2003 and the ending of the dual mandate is not in the public interest. Power and authority should not be taken out of the hands of the people, but this is what will happen if the dual mandate is ended. This system has been in place for more than 80 years and has served the nation well. How can we serve the people, as we were elected to do, if we are unable to serve on local authorities. It is ridiculous that Members of the Oireachtas will be cut off from their local authority. This Bill does not state adequately how I as a Member of the Oireachtas will be able to continue to represent my constituents on local matters if the dual mandate is abolished.Instead of weakening local authorities, the Government should strengthen them. At present TDs are not paid as county councillors. Does the Government realise the effect the ending of the dual mandate will have on the Exchequer in this era of financial cuts in every Department? This does not make economic sense when cuts are being made in the health service and people have to be treated on trolleys because of the shortage of hospital beds, when third level students must worry about the shortage of accommodation when they should be putting their minds to their studies instead. If the Minister for Education and Science reintroduces third level education fees, this finance would be put to good use to help the farming community and fishermen who are currently going through a terrible time. It could be used to provide better treatment for cancer patients, some of whom are currently receiving treatment one might expect in some Third World countries and some of whom must travel great distances to receive treatment that lasts only ten minutes instead of having facilities nearer to home.I would like the backbenchers who are missing from their seats to keep foremost in their minds, now that it is proposed to abolish the dual mandate, that the four Independents served the last Government for five solid years. I am glad the Minister is in the Chamber because I want to tell him that the record will show that we never missed a single vote in this House to keep that Government in place during that five years. I further say that at that time we got a firm commitment from the Taoiseach of the day that the question of abolishing the dual mandate had been put to sleep for good. For some unknown reason, whether it was to be better than the previous Minister, Deputy Dempsey, the current Minister has reintroduced it, despite the commitment that it would never again surface during our time in this House.It is ironic that the Tánaiste, who tries to come across to the people as prudent with the public finances, wants to bring in this Bill which will, without a doubt, put a further burden on the public finances. It is my view that the Progressive Democrats feel so threatened by the Independents that they insisted on adding the question of the dual mandate to this Bill. I pose one question to them and to everybody in the House today: is this a case of the tail wagging the dog? Are the Tánaiste and her Progressive Democrats colleagues ready to face the people and justify further demands on the Exchequer as a result of the introduction of this Bill instead of solving issues such as the huge rise in the cost of motor and business insurance where jobs are being lost purely because of the huge increase in premiums?It is a matter of trust. If the people do not want their TDs elected as local authority councillors they will not vote for them. Local elections are due to take place in 2004. Let the people decide by using their votes whether they want the dual mandate. Do not take away the rights of the people to have their say. What is the Government afraid of? Why not let the people decide? Does the Government think they are not intelligent enough to make a decision on such an important matter? Is it afraid to listen to the people? I have always listened to my constituents so that I can serve them to the best of my ability and I will fight for their right to decide on constitutional matters. I say trust the people, let them speak on this constitutional matter and let us not forget that we are all answerable to them. All the parties around me, Fine Gael, Labour, Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats, are now down on the Independents. They do not want us because they will have their backs to the wall at the next local election and at every general election. We stand on our record in this House. The four of us kept a famous Government, a better Government than the present one, on its feet for five years.

I too am opposed to the Bill. I am extremely disappointed by its contents, particularly in relation to the abolition of the dual mandate. It is totally undemocratic and a direct hit at Independent Deputies, not to mention the loss to the local government system.It is fairly well known why I am on this side of the House, but let me remind those who do not know. It is due mainly to the lies, cover up and conspiracy of the former Deputy O'Malley who would never have entered the doors of this House were it not for my late uncle who was then a member of the Fianna Fáil Party and got him elected on the day. Former Deputy O'Malley, together with the then Taoiseach, Jack Lynch, who had a fear of being disowned, collectively used the Arms Trial as a means of ejecting my late uncle, among others, from the Fianna Fáil organisation during the Troubles in the late 1960s and early 1970s. That is why I am an Independent  and a member of an organisation known locally as Independent Fianna Fáil. While the organisation in Donegal has four members on Donegal County Council, I am not directly affected. However, I understand the plight of single Independent candidates who will have no links to the local authority when this legislation is passed and, as a result, will no longer be able to retain a Dáil seat.

Where is the democracy in this Bill? If a candidate has the ability to represent his or her people on a local authority and in the Houses of the Oireachtas what right has the Government to take away this mandate?When the four Independent Members who propped up the previous Government stated that the dual mandate should not be abolished but that those holding the dual mandate should get only one salary they were told that such a move was unconstitutional. The Government then did what the four Independent Deputies proposed, even though it was alleged to be unconstitutional. However, I do not have a problem with the present situation.The abolition of the dual mandate will signal a very sad day for local government. We will be removing vast experience from every local authority. Having Oireachtas Members on county councils is a vital link and provides an inside track to what is available and how things can be achieved by each local authority. That inside track will no longer exist and instead we will have officialdom, dictatorship and a further undermining of the powers of politicians at local government level.This is a direct hit at Independent Deputies and at the four Members who held up the outgoing Government from this side of the House. I appeal to the Minister to reconsider his motives and to leave this vital link with local authorities.

On one rare occasion I was the sole representative of my political beliefs who walked through the division lobby in support of the Bill which, although emaciated, introduced the directly elected mayors and cathaoirligh of local authorities. That support represented the support of my party. We are now seeing the Government, yet again, doing a U-turn and rubbishing its own proposal.Nevertheless, I welcome this further U-turn on the dual mandate. The Government has, once again, come a full 360 degrees on this issue. While the ending of the dual mandate returns from the dead the direct election of mayors and cathaoirligh of local authorities is now to get the chop. Only Fianna Fáil could deliver such a performance, in which party political expediency makes a mockery of democracy. With respect to the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, he is probably the best man to do it for them.

To say that the legislation before us has had a checkered history would be a gross understatement. The former Minister's supposedly reforming Local Government Bill was long promised, from the start of the last Dáil in 1997, and only finally emerged in May 2000. It took more than a year before it was published and the Second Stage reached in June 2001. By then, the issue close to the Minister's heart, the ending of the dual mandate, had been shredded. This was not done, as the popular notion was promoted through the media, at the behest of the Independent supporters of the Government but by the Minister's own backbench colleagues. That is where the real pressure came from.The hot potato of the ending of the dual mandate was dropped and the Local Government Act 2001 proceeded to bring in directly elected mayors and chairmen, which was a welcome proposition. I supported it but it failed to introduce any real reform of local government. Now this Bill turns the tables once more. We are re-introducing the ending of the dual mandate and the directly elected mayors and chairs are out. It is like Lanigan's Ball, he stepped in and I stepped out again, an incredible situation. Is there time for the Government to change its mind again before 2004? It would not surprise me.I described the passage of the emasculated Bill on the last occasion as a legislative farce, the last act of which was the guillotine. The farce is back, however, for another short run in the Leinster House theatre. The dual mandate proposal is  being restored and the direct election of mayors and chairs dumped and we all know why.

I support the ending of the dual mandate and regret that the Minister is incorporating the amendment to exclude the direct election of mayors and chairs before we even have the opportunity to exercise the scheme through the electoral process.

We believe local government should be given strong powers and be invigorated by directly elected mayors who make decisions on behalf of the people.Within months of our election as TDs, all Green Party Deputies resigned their local authority seats. We have led the way by example. It  is not a bed of roses to lose that strong link to local authorities but it is the right thing to do and we are now free to concentrate on national issues. Our replacements on the local authorities are well equipped to take over and deliver on local issues at that level.The Barrington report on the reform of local government in Ireland 23 years ago argued that the only real powers at national level should be those of foreign affairs and defence and that local government should be given strong powers in all areas to deliver local services in a clear and accountable way. I am saddened that in the 11 years I spent on a local authority we had neither the financial autonomy nor the power to engage with local issues. The abolition of local rates 25 years ago cut off the life blood of financial support and left local government weakened.If we look abroad we can see how effective local government can be. I went to Aalborg in northern Denmark and met the local authority there. We met the chairs of the housing, health, education and policing committees. They have real power and responsibility and know their jobs. The chairs of the committees are paid, full-time employees who can deliver.Deputy Shortall mentioned having to sit on a dozen quangos to get anything done. I am aware of that experience myself. I was on 16 sub-committees of Dublin City Council dealing with everything from crime task forces to health issues to local development. I was sick to the back teeth of that and I want to see local government strengthened and made accountable. I am saddened by the plethora of quangos that has sprung up over the past ten years dealing with everything from housing to drugs.If the Government gives local government the power it will work. If we do not like those we elected, we can throw them out again. That is what I want to see – strong local government – and it saddens me that the Minister has taken out the reference to directly elected mayors.If we look at Pascal Maragall in Barcelona and Rudolf Giuliani in New York, the lesson from both models is that strong local government works. In 1999 we celebrated 100 years of local government but what was there to celebrate? In recent years we have stripped it of the powers it should have. We should look at Europe and the United States to see how strong local government can deliver and be accountable. If we give it the power it will attract people with vision and ability who can deliver but who avoid the insipid version we have now.Some Members complained about the strategic policy committees not working. Those have been the most dynamic bodies in local government in recent years but they must be made to work. There must be good chairs with agendas they can deliver on without getting bogged down about painting double yellow lines in Clontarf. We must put issues on the agenda and work on them. The SPCs could be made to deliver if we could get people of sufficient calibre to lead them.Local government is an emaciated shadow of the system in other countries. It is toothless, powerless, impoverished and cannot deliver. Abolishing the dual mandate is a step in the right direction but we must move beyond that and give real power to local government. If we want to get more gardaí on the beat in a part of the city, we could put a few cent on to the rates or use financial accountability and autonomy to make it happen. Currently we cannot even move a bus stop without going to the Minister or his representative. Local government deserves better and should be given the opportunity to make decisions and deliver on them.We should look at what Ken Livingstone is doing in London. He does not have much power but he is using the power he has effectively to introduce congestion charges. If we in Dublin were to introduce a congestion charge, we would have to go to 20 different agencies that deal with transportation, get the DTO's opinion, the Minister's opinion and wait 20 years for something to happen. The Minister should go further.

It is, therefore, a good thing to have a separation between local and national politics. It will act as a start in reinvigorating local government and I welcome it.

Different Members of the House, both Ministers and Deputies, have given sterling service to their local authorities and the national Parliament.

It is a case of the tail wagging the dog. We are all aware of the deep concerns expressed by Fianna Fáil backbenchers. I call on the President to refer the Bill to the Supreme Court to test its constitutionality.The Bill is an attack on our democratic institutions and represents a deliberate attempt to get rid of the Independent Deputies.

It effectively separates local government from the national  Parliament while it streamlines the role of local representatives and Dáil Deputies, with the Deputies continuing to play a local representational role with access to local authority meetings and council officials. In effect, they will have a hotline to the council. This link between the Deputy and the local community will be established on a statutory basis by imposing a statutory obligation on the authority to deal with the Deputy. I have never encountered anything other than courtesy, openness and readiness by the officials in Cavan County Council and Monaghan County Council in extending their total co-operation to me, for which I am grateful.The workload of local representatives has increased enormously in recent years in areas such as planning, infrastructure and environmental services. It is becoming increasingly difficult to serve two masters. It reminds me of the seanfhocal, "Ní thig leis an gobadán an dá thrá a fhreastal."  I am convinced that no one person can adequately or satisfactorily exercise the roles of local and national representative simultaneously. The Dáil representative is required to keep in contact with his constituents and is not entirely removed from local matters, which are dealt with through his constituency office and clinics.Apart from the separation of the roles of local and national representatives, the Bill makes no reference to the future reform of local government, the empowerment of local authorities, the funding of local government, improving service delivery and making use of new technologies. In addition, the future funding of local authorities is not addressed, which is a cause for concern. Local authorities comprising virtually full-time specialist councillors should receive adequate funding to ensure delivery of their various services.Many Oireachtas Members of local authorities are required to serve not only the council and its various committees, but also the newly created strategic policy committees, the vocational education committees, county development groups, health boards and Leader groups, in addition to the Oireachtas committees, all-party committees and other fora. Such a workload is excessive for any one individual. The complexity of these responsibilities requires enormous sacrifice and superhuman commitment.I regret that the provision allowing for directly elected mayors is to be abolished. Direct election would have given mayors a five year mandate to implement a programme during the council's term. Its abolition will only serve to diminish local authorities. There are several international examples of where elected mayors can be very effective.

However, on balance, I support the provisions of the Bill. I have listened with an open mind to what the Minster and his predecessor have said on the question of abolishing the dual mandate. As a Fianna Fáil backbencher, I have not made any public announcements on the proposal from the plinth of the House.I supported the legislation which made provision for the direct election of a chairperson or mayor of a local authority. A person directly elected to this position would be a major catalyst for change in the local government system in that he or she could initiative major changes and reform in the interest of all citizens. Sadly, this view was too idealistic. It put the cart before the horse as the measure was not accompanied by any real local government reform. It meant that the new mayor or chairperson would still have no real power, with the result that the expectations of the electorate could not be met. Indeed, the situation would have been made worse.Furthermore, councillors who know from experience how local government works were, by and large, vehemently opposed to the concept. I also understand that organisations such as LAMA, the Association of Municipal Authorities of Ireland and the General Council of County Councils opposed the proposal for various reasons. The Minister was obliged to take account of their views.I welcome the Minister's comments on the funding and reform of local government and I look forward to the publication as soon as possible of the reports he has initiated on these matters.

I received an executive summary of their report yesterday and the final report will be available on 28 April 2003. In recent weeks we have all seen the scale of the demand which clearly exists for modern stadium facilities. I am more than ever convinced that we need two modern stadia to cater adequately for this demand. In presenting their report, the Football Association of Ireland and the Irish Rugby Football Union have made a very valuable contribution to public debate on the issue. Both organisations are to be complimented on a very thorough presentation of the options available to them.The report reviews five potential locations for a modern stadium which are Lansdowne Road, the IRFU-owned site at Newlands Cross, Abbotstown, the former Irish Glass Bottle Company site and Sillogue. Over the coming weeks, my Department will carefully study the report in conjunction with the sporting bodies and will question all elements of the proposal including the costings. At the conclusion of this process, I will present my conclusions and recommendations to the Government in the context of my overall report on all options for the provision of state-of-the-art stadium facilities for major sporting events. The report will also incorporate my evaluation of expressions of interest received in the procurement of a privately funded stadium at Abbotstown. I do not intend to make any further statement on this matter until the Government has decided on the further action to be taken.
#SimonCoveney	unknown-#SimonCoveney-party	unknown-#SimonCoveney-dob	unknown-#SimonCoveney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-16 00:00:00	Prelude	442	The Minister will agree that last night's statements and proposals from the FAI and the IRFU were most welcome. I hope their work and professionalism will lead to the development of the 65,000-seat stadium the country wants and needs. It is important to note that this is a vindication of Fine Gael policy particularly as it relates to Landsdowne Road. As this process has been ongoing for some time, can the Minister outline the criteria on which the Government will base its decision regarding a new 65,000-seat stadium for the FAI and the IRFU? The public has a right to openness and transparency with regard to the criteria according to which the decision will be made. We are providing, in effect, for a national stadium for rugby and soccer, which are sports with huge support bases.The Government has demonstrated its incompetence in trying to put together plans for a national stadium and it has wasted hundreds of millions of euro on the Abbotstown project. That was taxpayers' money, but perhaps the Minister can clarify the exact amount. Can the Minister confirm that the failure to construct the Eircom  Park stadium for the FAI was due to the Government's interference? It is important to get it right at this stage and to support the initiative shown by the IRFU and the FAI to ensure that the quality, modern 65,000-seat stadium we all agree is needed is developed.
#JohnODonoghue	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-party	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-dob	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-16 00:00:00	Prelude	443	The principal criterion according to which the Government will make its decision is the need to provide a modern stadium suited to the playing of rugby and soccer. The question of GAA involvement has not yet been dealt with and it is an issue which has to be addressed. If the GAA enters the equation, the question of playing GAA games in the stadium will also arise. The FAI and the IRFU have provided us with a report on the position as it relates to five different sites and with an estimate of development costs. The estimate is transposed to each site rather than being confined to one which means that estimates of between €353 million and €397 million are exclusive of a contribution of €118.5 million from the FAI and the IRFU which is applicable to all sites.There is no question of neglect of its duties by the Government and I do not understand where Deputy Coveney is coming from in that regard. However, I appreciate the support I have received from Fine Gael, the Labour Party and other Members of the House with regard to the provision of a modern stadium. There is a perception, the origin of which I do not understand, that millions of euro have been wasted in Abbotstown. This is untrue. The fact is that the National Aquatic Centre at Abbotstown cost in excess of €60 million.

Studies were carried out and the money may well prove to have been properly and well spent. It is quite possible that the stadium will, in the final analysis, go ahead at Abbotstown. I have not identified a location as it is a matter for Government to make the decision. Suffice it to say, the analysis is due shortly from the sporting bodies concerned and it will be looked at in depth. The draft proposal has already been received and, once we have consulted the Office of Public Works, a memorandum will be prepared for the Government. It will then be a matter for the Government to make its decision.
#JackWall	unknown-#JackWall-party	unknown-#JackWall-dob	unknown-#JackWall-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-16 00:00:00	Prelude	446	I lend the support of the Labour Party to the provision of a stadium. Yesterday's statement from the IRFU and the FAI was positive. With regard to the time frame involved, the one thing we do not want to see is Exchequer cutbacks causing this project to be put on the long finger and dragged out as happened with the Eir com Park project. That might not have been due to Exchequer funding issues, but planning application problems resulted in a drawn-out saga and no progress was made. Is it feasible at this stage to place a timeframe on the investigation of the proposals and, if so, what would it be?On the previous occasion when the Minister answered questions in the Chamber, he ruled out the 23 consortia that had shown an interest in Abbotstown. Have any of these said to the Minister since that they were willing to change the format of their proposals or have they checked with him to see why he ruled them all out? It was strange, to say the least, that all 23 consortia were ruled out where this proposal was concerned.Where stands the £50 million that JP McManus proposed for the national stadium? Is that still in the wings for the new proposal or is it ruled out? Many people welcomed the proposal from Mr. McManus at the time but we do not know the intentions for it now.The Minister said the GAA may want to have games played in the proposed stadium. Where stands the GAA if the FAI and the IRFU take up the running on this? Obviously their criteria will weigh heavily when it comes to what takes place in the stadium. Have there been discussions with the GAA regarding the proposals put to the Minister? Is it intended that there would be such discussions with the organisation?
#JohnODonoghue	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-party	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-dob	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-16 00:00:00	Prelude	447	It is estimated, depending on which site is in question, that if the go-ahead were to be given this year, the stadium would be operational in 2008 or 2009. In the case of the majority of sites the completion date would be 2008. The expenditure on the stadium would occur over that timeframe with the majority of the spending coming in the latter two to three years so there would not be a major liability on the Exchequer in the immediate future.While the stadium has been estimated to cost between €353 million and €397 million, and that would be exclusive of FAI or IRFU contributions, it must be remembered that €71 million would represent VAT which would be returnable to the Exchequer. Between €85 million and €100 million would return to the Exchequer by way of taxes and welfare payments. The cost of the stadium over the timeframe envisaged is nowhere near what many predicted it would be. In terms of cost benefit, there is no question that it will be of major benefit to future generations of sporting people, especially young people.The issue of the GAA is more complex. The organisation was requested to make its stadium available for the 2008 European championship and it refused to do so. It also refused to make any recommendation to congress through central council. That was a major disappointment because it was being asked to make the stadium available on a once-off basis.The opening up of Croke Park would not resolve the problem because there would be over lapping fixtures, deterioration of the pitch, residents' objections and floodlighting problems. All these difficulties indicate that opening up Croke Park would not resolve the problem for the IRFU and the FAI.Their positions have become relatively untenable. The FAI has been told by UEFA and FIFA that it must provide all-seater stadia for home internationals. Lansdowne Road only has 24,000 permanent seats. That means 11,000 temporary seats must be brought in. UEFA and FIFA have indicated that they will not tolerate this any more. The IRFU is losing considerable sums of money and would make €2 million more per international if it had the additional capacity.Everyone is losing at present as a result of the stadium not being built. It is important that it be provided. All I can do is bring forward proposals to Government for which it is then a matter.

Does the Minister agree it is the direct fault of Government and that it has taken a direct initiative from sporting bodies to make it happen? Has the Minister a preference for a specific site? Lansdowne Road and Abbotstown appear to be the two preferred sites. Is the Minister satisfied with the proposed financial contribution from the FAI and the IRFU—

I am satisfied they would be able to raise that sum of money. I believe that, at a push, it might even exceed that, but that is for another day.We are engaged in an in-depth analysis of the report and we intend to bring forward a memorandum to Government after that analysis has been completed. We are examining the provisional report and expect the full detailed report on 28 April. I have outlined my personal preference but that is not the issue. The principal issue is the construction of a stadium. Once we go on from there, we will begin to make progress. I have complimented the IRFU and the FAI on the document they produced and the report. I asked  the bodies to produce it. It was not a question of us not initiating the report.The issue regarding Mr. McManus will be discussed in due course. There were no additional expressions of interest by the 23 consortia. Some may have contacted the Department since. I will communicate the results of that investigation to Deputy Wall.

Given the pressures affecting all areas of Government expenditure for 2003, to achieve funding of more than €44 million for this year was a considerable achievement.I will make the most effective possible case for adequate funding for 2004 for all the areas that fall within my remit, including the Arts Council. However, decisions on the amount of funding for the council in 2004 can only be taken within the context of the Estimates process and having regard to the state of the Exchequer finances at that time.
#FinianMcGrath	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-party	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-dob	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-16 00:00:00	Prelude	454	I wish to declare an interest under existing legislation. My brother, Fergal McGrath, is a former manager of the Galway arts festival and is manager of the Druid Theatre.Government funding to the Arts Council in 2003 was €9 million less than the target of €53.79 million outlined for that year in the arts plan and a reduction of 8% on the €47.7 million provided in 2002. In light of the devastating effect these cuts have on many arts organisations, will the Minister assure the House that funding to the Arts Council in 2004 will be re-instated to the level envisaged for that year or at least that envisaged for 2003, plus an allowance for inflation?On the appointment of the new Arts Council, under the new Arts Bill the number of members on the council will be reduced from 17 to nine. In these circumstances the make-up of the new council has never been more critical. Will the Minister, when making these appointments, take the opportunity to appoint an all-new council which avoids the traditional charges of geographical influences and which enjoys the confidence of the arts community, the Government and the public?
#JohnODonoghue	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-party	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-dob	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-16 00:00:00	Prelude	455	It will certainly be the objective to appoint an Arts Council which has the  confidence of the Government, this House and the public and the respect of the arts community.I have pointed out that the funding available to the Arts Council has increased substantially since 1997 and that this increase has been of the order of 80%. I accept that areas of the arts have suffered this year and I will certainly do all I can in the Estimates campaign in the autumn to convince the Minister for Finance that it is important to increase arts funding. Obviously, it is not possible for me to say at this remove whether my exertions will be successful but I will do my level best to ensure they are.It is important to note that the arts plan, which was prepared by the council for the period 2002 to 2006, projected a total spend of €314 million over the period of the plan. That represents a very substantial increase in funding for the arts. The difficulty I face this year, and which other Ministers in different disciplines face, is that there was an economic downturn, which meant that the funding available across all Departments was not as plentiful as it had been in previous years. In such circumstances, regrettably, the Arts Council had to suffer a cut in its funding although its funding still represented an increase of 80% since 1997. We will do everything we possibly can to ensure we have an excellent Arts Council and that it is resourced as well as possible.
#FinianMcGrath	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-party	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-dob	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-16 00:00:00	Prelude	456	I thank the Minister for his response and hope the commitment he has made today is realised. Does he accept that the arts are making a magnificent contribution to the community? In particular, I refer to artists who do much creative work and who lift the self-esteem of the nation. Does he value their work and will he make a commitment to ensure they will get the maximum support over the next four to five years? Does he value the role of artists connected with the disabilities sector and the role art plays in assisting both children and adults with disabilities?
#JohnODonoghue	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-party	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-dob	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-16 00:00:00	Prelude	457	I agree strongly with the views expressed by Deputy Finian McGrath. That is why it is so important that we have a vibrant and well-resourced arts sector. It will be of interest that we will bring forward amendments to the Arts Bill shortly, which I hope will be passed during the next session of the Dáil and Seanad. It is my intention to try ensure that we will have sub-committees attached, on a temporary basis, to the Arts Council dealing with at least some of the items mentioned by the Deputy.It is important that we recognise the role of arts in terms of disabilities and how the disabled can express themselves through art. In that respect, it is my intention to ensure that we have a sub-committee of the Arts Council dealing with education. This could also deal with the question of people with special needs. We should also ensure that the sub-committees of the council deal with other areas that require urgent attention, including the traditional arts and the arts in local auth orities, so we can deal with problems at the coal face.
#JohnODonoghue	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-party	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-dob	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-16 00:00:00	Prelude	458	Under my Department's arts and culture capital enhancement support scheme, ACCESS, grants totalling €45.7 million were approved, to be paid to 44 projects over the period from 2001 to 2004. Among the investments approved were large scale new infrastructural developments at regional, county or city levels, the redevelopment of existing facilities and venues, including new build, additional build or major refurbishment, and smaller scale projects at community or local level. Promoters of projects were required to demonstrate their ability to project manage and deliver their proposed developments, including the balance of funding needed to be raised by the promoters, within the time frame.As I indicated in my reply to Question No. 379 on Tuesday, 25 March 2003, only €5.575 million had been drawn down at that date. This rate of draw-down is significantly lower than had been advised to my Department at the outset and I cannot provide any assurance that funding will be available beyond the end of 2004. In this respect, it must be remembered that the responsibility for management and control of projects approved for funding under ACCESS rests with the promoters, not my Department.At present, the rate of progress of each ACCESS project is being reassessed to provide me with a comprehensive picture of where we are and how the position is likely to develop between now and the end of the scheme. When this assessment is completed I will consider what action to take. However, I would be less than honest if I did not say the prospect of funds becoming available for new projects is remote, given the time remaining for the completion of this scheme.
#DamienEnglishFG	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-party	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-dob	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-16 00:00:00	Prelude	459	What is the time scale for the reassessment? I see that the cost of many of the projects has increased rapidly due to inflation. One project with which I am familiar submitted for funds. It was valued at €5 million and got a grant of €3 million. Now the cost of construction of an arts centre is €9 million. If the Minister's assessment takes a year it will be almost the end of 2004 by the time it is completed. I ask that it be carried out quickly to see what the Government can do to help people move projects forward.A great deal of money allocated to the cultural development incentive scheme from Europe was returned because it was not claimed. We should have known that there would be problems. We should be pro-active and help groups. What are we doing to help them?What does the Minister intend to do about money that might not be drawn down? As he said, there is no guarantee that it will be available after 2004. That is unacceptable and I ask that a guarantee be given that that money be kept for the development of capital programmes pertaining to the arts. Can it be redeployed for schemes or groups that failed to get a grant? Will the Minister allocate a larger grant to the projects whose construction costs have increased? The money is to develop facilities for young people and others of all ages. It is important that we have facilities built in all towns. It would be a big mistake to withdraw the money now.Is the motive behind not guaranteeing that the money will be available in the future that the Minister does not want too many capital projects developed because they will have to be funded and maintained after their completion? Does it suit Government policy if some people fail to have their projects developed?
#JohnODonoghue	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-party	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-dob	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-16 00:00:00	Prelude	460	No. It would not suit Government policy if any of the projects failed. If that were the case they would not have been awarded grant aid in the first instance. The truth is that it is a matter for the project developers to come forward with their projects and ensure they are completed. It was made quite clear that the ACCESS programme would last until the end of 2004. As of now, I can give no assurance that any funding will be available after that date. It may well be true that some projects cost more than had been anticipated but neither I nor my Department can be blamed for that. Furthermore, I am not aware of any programme within my Department that led to money being sent back to Europe.The difficulty is that quite complex issues arise in any effort to reallocate funds that are not drawn down by a projected date. Deviations of this kind are clearly more likely to arise if a project is behind schedule. If this is the case, it is possible that it might not proceed at all because it might not be in a position to draw down the funds before the termination of the scheme. Then a reallocation of the same funds could not, in all probability, be drawn down for precisely the same reason. If another project was grant-aided now, there simply would not be time to complete the project.We have the same problem in relation to any new projects which might be funded as we have with old projects which could not proceed for one reason or another, and the time factor is all important. This is the difficulty we face. I am obviously only too glad to make payments to projects which make progress. We are only too  delighted to spend this money. The difficulty is that the projects promoted in many instances are beginning to look as if they will not make the cut.
#DamienEnglishFG	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-party	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-dob	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-16 00:00:00	Prelude	461	Does the Minister not feel it would be worthwhile to try to safeguard this money and guarantee that it will be available if it is not drawn down? Would he not fight to get that done? If the Minister was told tomorrow that a certain project could not manage to carry out its development, would he not seek to reallocate that money straight away to a project that could?
#JohnODonoghue	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-party	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-dob	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-16 00:00:00	Prelude	462	It is too late to make a new allocation at this point because a project would not be completed by the end of 2004. That is the opinion within the Department also. It is desirable to try to hold on to as many funds as we possible can, and I will certainly be only too delighted to do so, but I am not at all sure that it will be possible to do that because a specific time frame was laid down for the scheme. I fully support the concept of providing arts centres around the country. This was the whole idea of what was a wonderful scheme set up by my predecessor, Deputy Síle de Valera, and she is to be warmly congratulated on it. The difficulty is that, as with many projects of this nature, people may in some instances, not all, have been a little over-ambitious.
#JohnODonoghue	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-party	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-dob	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-16 00:00:00	Prelude	463	The Government has provided financial support totalling €69.84 million up to the end of last year to the Gaelic Athletic Association towards the redevelopment of Croke Park. In the context of the development of a State financed national stadium at Abbotstown, special funding proposals were made in April 2001 to the GAA on the basis of the intended usage of the stadium facilities by the association when completed. This element of conditionality of the proposal was clear from the outset and it was also understood on all sides that a formal legal arrangement between the parties would be required before giving effect to it.When the Government decided last September that it was not in a position to provide any Exchequer funding for a national stadium, the conditional proposal lapsed. As there was no binding agreement in place the question of dishonouring an agreement did not arise.At a meeting on 23 October 2002, the Government clarified the situation to the GAA and advised it that a revised application for funding  would be the best channel through which to seek further funding towards the redevelopment of Croke Park. The GAA, at the end of November 2002, submitted an application for an additional €39.5 million in funding for Croke Park. This application is with my Department at present. While, as I have already made clear on several occasions, there is no funding for this purpose available in my Department's Estimates for this year, I intend to bring the matter to the attention of the Government in the context of my overall report to the Government on the need for modern stadium facilities.
#JackWall	unknown-#JackWall-party	unknown-#JackWall-dob	unknown-#JackWall-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-16 00:00:00	Prelude	464	Was all the funding made available to the GAA in relation to the development of Croke Park drawn down through the Minister's Department of Arts, Sports and Tourism or was it just a straight Government grant issued through the Department of Finance? On previous occasions we have spoken about the opening up of Croke Park for other sporting events, and it is time the GAA made up its mind in that regard. Given the position of the development in Croke Park, however, which is practically completed, would the Minister not agree that this is the time for the Government to complete its commitment to the GAA in relation to that project, thus giving us one stadium fit for all sports? The GAA still has to address that option but I think we will see something forthcoming in that regard.It is a pity to be at this stage with a stadium that people from all over the world have come to look at and that people have really admired as being of such stature in world sport and not to have completed it. I know the Minister has said he will bring the issue to Government and I appreciate that. I know the intentions of the Minister are positive in terms of completing Croke Park but this is one opportunity that we should not let go begging. We want to move on and everybody in this House is fully in agreement with moving on to the provision of the national stadium that was discussed already. I ask the Minister if the Croke Park project is not something that can be completed and finished, thus allowing us to move on to the further development of sport.
#JohnODonoghue	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-party	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-dob	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-16 00:00:00	Prelude	465	In respect of Croke Park, €69.8 million has been allocated in funding to the GAA to date, of which €67.9 million has been paid. The €1.9 million which is outstanding to the GAA for Croke Park relates to the fact that, in line with my Department's procedures for sports capital funding, 5% of the total payment of each grant allocation is retained pending receipt of certification of completion of the fixed liability period of the project.With regard to organisations that are affiliated to the GAA and club level and so on, €68.3 million has been allocated since 1998. Obviously this is by far and away the highest proportion given to any sporting organisation in the country. In November 2002, the GAA made an application  to my Department for payment of €39.5 million. That money was to have been paid to the GAA in the event of an Exchequer-funded national stadium proceeding. As we all know, the Government decided in October 2002 not to proceed with an Exchequer-funded national stadium. Therefore, the commitment to the GAA fell.The application which the GAA has now made to my Department will be discussed in due course with the Government and a decision will be reached. We all want to see Croke Park developed to its fullest potential and all recognise the contribution the GAA has made to society. The difficulty relates to the monetary situation. Earlier today we spoke about difficulties in other areas, and at this point I do not have any funding available to me that I, in turn, could make available to the GAA for Croke Park. Any funding which I have available at present under the sports capital programme is for far smaller projects than that and for distribution across the country. There is a question dealing with that matter later.In short, the Government will discuss the application by the GAA in due course. I do not have any funding available in my Department to pay funds to the GAA this year. Normally, funding for Croke Park would come through the Department of Arts, Sport and Tourism.

Can we have the criteria in five-point form which we can show to the person on the street and say this is how the Minister will make his decision when he is picking the location and that it will be based on cost, traffic and so on? We do not want this veil of secrecy. Some day we will wake up and the Minister will have picked a location. Can we have the reasons a particular location will be picked? At the moment people are saying it will be an under the table decision.

It would be impossible for me to be exhaustive in regard to that this afternoon other than to say that in the provisional report which I received from the FAI and the IRFU, the lozenge-type table or graph presented in respect of each location was scored regarding given criteria. For example, the question of and the distance from park and ride facilities is one of the factors which will be taken into account. There were several others as well. There were other criteria which were not taken into account and which one might regard as relevant.

The purpose of this review is to establish what has been achieved under this programme over recent years with a view to identifying gaps in existing provisions and possible priorities for the future. Following this exercise an inter-agency steering group will be set up to devise a long-term strategy for the development of sports facilities and one of its first tasks will be to oversee the commencement of a national audit of local sports facilities.This group, which will include members from Departments and State agencies, will consider the range of facilities to be included in the audit. It will be important before commencing the audit that a clear method of classifying facilities is established to ensure a consistent approach is adopted. This will help establish an accurate and comprehensive picture on the availability of sports and recreational facilities nation-wide.As this will be an extensive and complex piece of work involving the obtaining of responses from a wide range of Departments, local authorities and State agencies, its completion will take a considerable length of time.

The Minister will be aware that such audits have been carried out in parts of the UK and are proving successful in targeting the age groups involved in sport and whether there is a correlation between schools and certain sporting activities. At the 2001 sports development conference in the Citywest Hotel, a presentation was made on the effectiveness of such an audit. The Minister previously indicated that Northern Ireland was carrying out a similar type audit and that it envisaged it would take five years to complete. Is the Minister in a position to indicate what steps he will take to ensure it will not take as long here? Will he indicate what methodology he will use? For example, will he look at sports in schools? The Department of Education and Science would be interested in the findings of this audit because they might help it to better plan schools building projects.In regard to the agency's terms of reference, are any mechanisms in place to ensure this audit will be completed more quickly than that in Northern Ireland given the limited resources which the Minister for Finance will give to the Minister?

I do not know how I can advance such an exercise more quickly here dealing with a larger jurisdiction. The difficulty which exists is that there has been no real study or review of the sports capital programme since its inception and that is the first thing which must be carried out.

Later on, we will deal with the criteria that have been utilised in order to determine which projects should be financed. It is of immense importance in terms of the audit which will take place after the review that certain matters are looked at, as Deputy Gogarty has pointed out. In that respect, the question of geographical location is of some importance as is the question of equivalence and of making a special effort in regions which are marginalised. Disadvantaged areas have to be taken into account in a special way. We also have to ensure that various disciplines and requirements are catered for. There is no exact science, nor could there be, but once the audit is completed we will have a clear picture of the direction in which we should go. I cannot say at this point how long it will take other than to say that we have initiated it.

Does the Minister not think that is pathetic? It would not take a year to go around this country to do an audit on facilities. What money and staff have been allocated to do it? Have the councils been contacted because I believe most local authorities have employed consultants over the last two or three years to carry out such an audit at local level? It is crazy to say it will take three or four years. It is fudging the issue.

The problem is that we are drawing up a new long-term strategy to deal with the provision of facilities around the country. It is not the intention, nor was it, to simply have an audit because that would not achieve anything. We want to ensure we have a strategic plan which is viable and which can be utilised for the benefit of the population at large. If Deputy English or Deputy Gogarty has a suggestion which would be of benefit to me in expediting the procedure, I would only be too glad to hear of it.
#JackWall	unknown-#JackWall-party	unknown-#JackWall-dob	unknown-#JackWall-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-16 00:00:00	Prelude	484	I have outlined on numerous occasions when this matter was discussed the importance of investigating the problems of and the lack of facilities in large housing estates. I note what the Minister said regarding disadvantaged areas but there is also a problem in large housing estates which lack facilities. I hope the  report and information received from local authorities will outline what facilities are available in these estates. Many of the clubs go in, cherry-pick the good players, take them away and leave everyone else behind. That creates major problems in these areas. As part of this report, I hope we will see what facilities are provided in large housing estates where there are so many problems.

It is important that local authorities participate in the audit. In that context, I am glad to report that Limerick City Council, Meath County Council and Fingal County Council have already carried out an inventory of sports facilities within their jurisdictions. However, other local authorities have been remiss in not doing so. In that respect, I call on local authorities to do so because it would feed into the central review and, subsequently, the audit and the strategic plan. It is important, when local authorities are drawing up an inventory, that they identify the areas mentioned by Deputy Wall, particularly built-up areas which are marginalised or disadvantaged. This is necessary to give young people in such places an opportunity, which they might not otherwise have, to participate in healthy sporting activities.
#JohnODonoghue	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-party	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-dob	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-16 00:00:00	Prelude	486	I propose to take Questions Nos. 10, 14, 26, 27 and 126 together.The Central Statistics Office is responsible for  the collection and publication of tourism statistics. Although tourism figures are not yet available from the office for 2003, tourism agencies and industry sources have indicated that war in Iraq and the outbreak of SARS are having a significant impact in certain markets, particularly long-haul markets. It is feared that 2003 may prove as challenging and difficult as 2002 as a result.As I anticipated when last answering questions in the House, the markets which are most vulnerable in a war scenario are long-haul markets such as the United States, Canada and Australia. The intelligence available from Tourism Ireland's market offices and local tourism trade is that consumers in many markets, particularly the markets I have mentioned, are adopting a "wait and see" attitude to their holidays this year. With the possibility that the military conflict in Iraq may be winding down, the consumer response over the next number of weeks will be crucial in terms of how the peak season pans out. In this context, it is vital that we are appropriately positioned to take full advantage of any upturn in consumer confidence which might lead to people making concrete holiday decisions. Tourism Ireland will gear up its marketing activities in its key tourism markets, particularly the US, Britain and Europe, in the coming weeks to capture any upturn in business.My objective from early on has been to be proactive and, with the tourism agencies, to support the industry in dealing with the emerging situation. I met the chief executives of the State tourism agencies before war began in the Gulf to ensure that a robust contingency plan is in place. I secured funding of €48 million for Tourism Ireland and Bord Fáilte's marketing programmes to bolster our international marketing efforts this year. This has enabled the agencies to deploy resources to optimal effect in key tourism markets. The 2003 marketing programme was developed with regard to the background of global uncertainty and is, therefore, capable of adapting to emerging market developments.As war became increasingly likely, Tourism Ireland established an internal response team which has met on a weekly basis to analyse feedback from markets, utilising Tourism Ireland's global office network which is located in 19 countries. The team's objective is to identify the best prospects available to the tourism sector and to review Ireland's marketing messages, mediums and programmes in light of market developments. A tourism industry response group, which has been meeting regularly, has been supportive of the approach adopted by the State tourism agencies. The industry is being regularly updated, through e-zines and other means, on developments in the marketplace and significant changes in Tourism Ireland's marketing plans. Such lines of communication are vital in ensuring a co-ordinated and efficient use of marketing resources, both from private and public sector sources.External shocks apart, the fact that a stronger focus on the European market is vital to the development of Irish tourism in the longer term has been identified as a key priority in An Agreed Programme for Government. In this regard, Tourism Ireland has stepped up its activities and targeted a significant level of resources at its campaigns in Britain and other key European markets this year. I will lend whatever support I can to Ireland's promotional efforts in Europe. In this context, I have commenced a series of promotional visits to key European markets, starting last month with a visit to Germany. I opened Tourism Ireland's new office in Frankfurt and launched a new marketing strategy for Germany which aims to increase business from what is the second largest outbound tourism market in the world, after the United States. While there is evidence that certain outbound European markets are feeling the effects of war in Iraq and the outbreak of SARS, experience suggests that such markets may prove resilient, particularly as Ireland continues to be considered a safe, friendly and close to home destination.Tourism Ireland is ready to step up its marketing campaign in the United States in the next few weeks as consumers there begin to make final decisions about their holiday choices this year. Ireland has suffered its share of the decline in outbound tourism from the US since 11 September 2001. The US is a vital market for Ireland, particularly in revenue terms. The war in Iraq has undermined the tourism sector's ability to capitalise on the restoration of key access routes from the US this year. If the military conflict winds down, however, there is an opportunity to crank up our marketing efforts there and to convert the consistently high level of interest in Ireland among US citizens into good tourism business. In that context, Tourism Ireland has identified key marketing initiatives which it will, if circumstances permit, deliver over the coming weeks and months, aimed at exploiting the best business prospects available.The tourism industry is facing its third successive year of external market shocks. We learned a great deal from the experience of foot and mouth disease and the events of 11 September. While there are similarities with previous shocks, the tourism sector in Ireland is now more mature and resilient, and has a proven track record in adapting successfully to unforeseen difficulties and challenges. With this in mind, I am confident that, working together, the industry and the Government agencies will overcome the most recent difficulties and will position Ireland to capitalise fully on the opportunities which lie ahead.

Does he not accept, however, that the signs and portents for the 2003 season are very bad, as a consequence of the war in Iraq, the spread of SARS and the global economic  decline? Does the Minister not accept that an emergency action programme is necessary if we are to salvage the tourism season? Does he agree that it is time for serious leadership? While I agree that the Minister should support the various promotions as part of an attempt to, as he said, "crank up our marketing efforts", does he not accept that something more, such as an emergency package, is needed from the Government? Does he agree, bearing in mind the importance of the tourism industry to our respective areas and to the country as a whole, that a special funding arrangement, supported by the tourism industry, should be put in place? The Minister should put in place emergency arrangements now so that their beneficial effects can be felt in the current tourism season.
#JohnODonoghue	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-party	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-dob	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-16 00:00:00	Prelude	488	I met tourism chiefs when it became apparent that there was to be a war in the Gulf. We had a fruitful discussion about how best to proceed in the event of war. A contingency plan was drawn up to ensure that the benefit of the 20% increase in marketing funds made available to Tourism Ireland this year could be maximised. A tourism review group, which is internal to the tourism industry, was established in Tourism Ireland to that end. The group will monitor the intelligence received from Tourism Ireland's 19 offices worldwide with a view to diverting marketing expenditure where necessary. It is clear that this plan was sufficiently flexible to enable Tourism Ireland to maximise the market's potential and I believe it is continuing to do so. For example, a very strong campaign has been under way for some time in Germany, the world's second largest outbound tourism market. If one does well in attracting visitors from Germany, it is normally a sign that one will do well in the rest of Europe. The US market has not been abandoned as it is intended to pursue a marketing campaign there to as heavy an extent as ever, if not heavier, if it is apparent that the war in Iraq is about to end.It is too early for me to say to Deputy Jim O'Keeffe with any degree of certitude that this will be a bad or a good season. There is increasing evidence, especially from the United States, that people make decisions about holiday destinations at short notice. I suppose this can be attributed largely to the global village that has emerged in recent years. Although I cannot anticipate what the future holds, I accept that the US market suffered in 2001 and 2002 and that the industry faced great challenges as a result. I am not blind to the fact that this will be a difficult year too, but I am aware that the industry has proven itself to be resilient and that there are major opportunities to be won.
#JackWall	unknown-#JackWall-party	unknown-#JackWall-dob	unknown-#JackWall-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-16 00:00:00	Prelude	489	How can the Minister align his comments about the German and European market with a recent newspaper report which stated that 81% of German and Dutch tourists are dissatisfied with what they find when they come here?  Their disappointment at the price of goods, such as alcohol, and services was the main factor that contributed to the findings of the survey. How is the tourism trade to overcome such an attitude from a market that is regarded as being as important as the United Kingdom market?Does the Minister not agree that due to the increased cost of goods and services we have allowed ourselves to lose the competitive edge so necessary for tourism and which helps to overcome the shortfall due to the loss of the American trade?When the Minister was in Germany did he receive any reaction from the German tourism operators about the findings that 56% of visitors to Ireland last year were disappointed with their holiday? Mr. John Travers, the chairman of Bord Fáilte commented on these figures at the seminar.
#JohnODonoghue	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-party	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-dob	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-16 00:00:00	Prelude	490	I am glad of the opportunity to address the issue which has been raised by Deputy Wall. He refers to a report of an address delivered at a recent tourism conference. Unfortunately, as sometimes happens when statistics are taken out of context, the report was not a completely accurate representation of the actual results from Bord Fáilte's latest survey of visitor attitudes which was conducted among overseas holiday visitors during the summer of 2002. It is important to state that the survey found that 94% of overseas visitors indicated that their holiday either matched or exceeded their expectations and only a small minority of 6% were disappointed overall with their holiday experience. When asked, almost eight out of ten visitors surveyed said that they would recommend a holiday in Ireland to a friend, with virtually the remainder saying that they would recommend Ireland with some reservations.I accept Deputy Wall's argument and since becoming Minister I have consistently spoken on the subject of the level of dissatisfaction from all markets with overall value for money in Ireland. Less than half of all overseas visitors last year were satisfied with the value for money on offer to them. This must be seen in the context that the main influence in the choice of a holiday destination for 50% of holiday visitors to Ireland is word of mouth recommendation from friends and relatives. While the primary items considered by overseas holiday visitors to Ireland to be of less than good value for money were the cost of eating out and drink and food in shops and supermarkets, there is also evidence of increased resistance to the cost of accommodation, car hire and extended coach tours.When I made this point on a previous occasion I was attacked from various sectors. The truth is that this crucial industry is now of prime importance to our economy and it is of immense importance that all those involved in it realise that competition from external sources is fierce and either there is value for money or there is not. The introduction of the euro has unmasked deficienc ies which might not have been spotted in the past. Everything is transparent now and people know whether they are getting value for money or not. Market share is lost if there is no value for money and we must ensure that is provided across the sector.

When will the outcome be known of his Department's promotional efforts in Germany to counter the downturn in the tourism industry? At what stage in the season will it become known? If information on advance bookings is available, will it be possible for the industry to assess the position with a view to either becoming more competitive, if that is possible, or taking some other measures?
#JohnODonoghue	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-party	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-dob	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-16 00:00:00	Prelude	492	To address the Deputy's latter question first, it is normally possible to give some indication a quarter in advance of the potential bookings for the season. I visited Germany recently and there is evidence from the German market that there will be an increase in numbers of German visitors to Ireland this year.The German market takes a total of 58 million holidays a year and our share was a mere 307,000 as at 2001. That is a very small share of a very large market. There has been evidence of a decrease in the number of German visitors to Ireland – arrested for the first time last year – from 1996 onwards. The challenge is not just to arrest that decrease but to increase the numbers of German visitors. We are making a big effort to achieve that. We have held nine road shows in nine different German cities. We are participating in international trade fairs and organising electronic and print promotion in Germany. Following meetings I have had with those who organise travel to Ireland I remain convinced that we will increase our share of the market from Germany for this year.

The question of competitiveness is one of the principal issues which the tourism review group has been asked to address. I await their recommendations with great interest.

Foreign visitors are becoming much more discerning. Given the contributions from other Deputies I assume the Minister is aware of the need to ensure that visitors receive a friendly welcome and are charged fair prices and receive value for money.Is the Minister aware of a recent report by CERT on the green agenda and the challenge for Irish tourism and hospitality? This report states that green tourism, although firmly on the agenda of global tourism business, was not necessarily on the Irish agenda and that we are playing catch-up. Besides friendly people and beautiful scenery, the most important factor for tourists considering visiting Ireland is our environment. Is the Minister aware that one of the consultants who wrote the report says that if we do not go green, the market will disappear?The EU EUROPA Enterprise Directorate has produced a report on the use of natural and cultural heritage to develop sustainable tourism. The report comments that the growth rate of alternative or green tourism at 8% well outstrips the growth rate of traditional tourism. The reasons given are more experienced travellers seeking new destinations, greater mobility in the EU, the tendency to take shorter, more frequent trips, an older but more active population, greater concern for the quality of the environment. I ask the Minister to give a commitment to the House that he will read this report if he has not done so already. Will the Minister give an undertaking to set up a task force in co-operation with the Minister for the Environment and Local Government to examine the issue of greening tourism and to enact legislation if necessary?

If there are solid suggestions for improving the environment, I am particularly susceptible to taking them on board. Under the tourism product scheme we have a scheme of grants to improve the environment and there are a number of applications which are being considered at present. I hope the war will end soon. I am particularly pleased in the tourism context that we did not take on board Deputy Rabbitte's suggestion prior to the Gulf War that we should give asylum to Saddam Hussein.

I welcome the publication of the plan, which has as its principal focus the racecourse sector and the creation of a new business model on improved income streams, development funding, training and general management and marketing support. I expect the strategy will play a key role in the continuing development and promotion of Ireland as a world centre of excellence for horse racing and breeding.In addition to the outstanding entertainment and enjoyment it provides for a large section of the Irish population, horse racing has a major impact on Ireland's economy and I will mention a few statistics which are not always properly recognised. Some 25,000 people, both full and part-time, are employed in the industry. The value of assets employed in the industry is €2.5 billion. Some 50,000 overseas visitors attend race meetings in Ireland every year. Total betting, off and on course, in 2002 was over €1.8 billion. In the context of managing such a large and complex sector, high-quality strategic planning is essential. In its strategy document, HRI has set out its vision on how Ireland's pre-eminent position in world racing can be maintained, employment sustained and a top-quality product available to the race-going public.HRI is open to receiving comments and views on the strategy document from all areas of the horse racing sector and beyond. I look forward to such a debate, to responding to the areas of the strategy which will require Government approval, for example, regarding the capital development plan, and to working with Horse Racing Ireland in the further development of this important sector in the economic and social life of our country.
#JackWall	unknown-#JackWall-party	unknown-#JackWall-dob	unknown-#JackWall-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-16 00:00:00	Prelude	502	I welcome the report, the contents of which augurs well for the industry. One of the great aspects of the horse racing industry in Ireland is the number of festivals there are. Apart from the major festivals such as Galway, Punchestown, Tralee, Listowel and so on, there is now a tendency for the small tracks such a Laytown-Bettystown, Sligo and Gowran Park to have a festival aspect to a number of fixtures. That should be allowed to continue because tourists are attracted to these areas during the racing festi vals. Does the Minister think this is a major tourist attraction for these areas rather than in the overall context? Is he satisfied that Punchestown is now out of trouble? Given its potential and the fact that it can be developed as a world horse racing centre, which will probably match the Cheltenham festival, does he believe it will go from strength to strength?
#JohnODonoghue	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-party	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-dob	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-16 00:00:00	Prelude	503	I agree with Deputy Wall that it is important that festivals are encouraged. In that respect, Irish racing has a good record. I agree that the Punchestown facility is improving in leaps and bounds and beginning to challenge Cheltenham in terms of its importance. For some time, it has been the most important national hunt festival in the country. Together with Fairyhouse, it is extremely important in terms of holding major racing festivals in the near future. There are other major festivals to which Deputy Wall referred.I am pleased the problems at Punchestown have been resolved. I would like to acknowledge the contributions made by all sides and the magnanimity with which everyone approached the problem with a view to resolving it, not just in the interests of Punchestown but in the interests of Kildare and the whole country. I sincerely hope that horse racing will continue to prosper at Punchestown and that it will be a centre of excellence for other horse-related activities.

I suppose I should say the icing on the cake is the horse racing.There were various rumblings under the surface at one stage in regard to personnel matters associated with Horse Racing Ireland. Is the Minister satisfied that all these issues are resolved and there is a unified effort to ensure horse racing develops fully in the years ahead, particularly over the next five years? Is he satisfied adequate funding is available to ensure development over the five years and, if not, has he any measures in mind to ensure such funding will be available? I suppose I should declare some interest in horse racing.

The fact that the off-course levy is now available to the industry is a major boost.

#SeanHaughey	unknown-#SeanHaughey-party	unknown-#SeanHaughey-dob	unknown-#SeanHaughey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-16 00:00:00	Prelude	509	I was speaking about reform of local government and the reviews the Minister has initiated. I must point out that in recent years powers have been taken away from local authorities. One such power is that of waste management. This trend will have to be reversed in the context of the reviews to which I referred and the reform of local government generally.I want to raise the question of the strategic policy committees to which other speakers also referred. In my experience the strategic policy committees are not working as originally envisaged. Management is not committed to the strategic policy committees and the outside groups and councillors are not working as well together as they should. In general, there is no evidence of real partnership in the strategic policy committees. The Minister is looking at the operation of these committees. I wish him well in this regard as I think they need to be reformed.The arguments in favour of the ending of the dual mandate include the introduction of new talent into the political system and that more  women and young people will enter it. It is suggested that Deputies will have more time for legislative work, including their work as members of Oireachtas committees. It is also suggested that all councillors will be more frequently available to undertake the increasingly complex and expanded workload of a local authority member.An argument against the abolition of the dual mandate is that Deputies may become disconnected from the electorate and become out of touch and I believe this to be a real danger. It has happened in other countries, as other speakers have outlined. Public representatives in this State are accessible and there is a danger that national legislators would become less accessible with the abolition of the dual mandate. This is a problem we will have to deal with as best we can.There is no doubt that the abolition of the dual mandate will be advantageous to the larger political parties. New talent will be brought into the parties, there will be more public representatives working on the ground and this should increase the party vote. There will be increased competition within the parties as opposed to between the parties. It is envisaged that this intra-party competition will bring out the vote. While this will probably benefit Fianna Fáil most, I believe it will also benefit other parties. We will have to wait to see what happens.There is no real demand for this change. It will take a long time for the electorate to appreciate the changes this Bill makes. Deputies will be contacted for many years to come regarding local authority matters. The electorate likes its Deputies to be councillors. The oft-quoted phrase of Tip O'Neill that all politics is local is very true. Educating the public on the effect of these changes will be a major task.Deputies will have more time for legislative work under these proposals. The Government will have to take this on board and facilitate the Oireachtas in its role of questioning Government measures, etc., and the making of legislation generally. There is no doubt this measure will have implications for Government and I hope it realises this. Neither is there any doubt that a logical outcome of the abolition of the dual mandate will be a higher turnover of Deputies at each election. This is inevitable and up and coming councillors, probably from the same party, will replace many Deputies. These are issues with which we will have to come to terms.Other measures will, no doubt, be proposed when this Bill becomes law. Electoral reform, the introduction of a list system, single seat constituencies, a decrease in the number of Deputies, a five day Dáil working week and the abolition of the Seanad will logically follow on from this Bill. I would like to hear the Minister's views in this regard. Is there a long-term agenda of which this is only one part?
#JohnnyBrady	unknown-#JohnnyBrady-party	unknown-#JohnnyBrady-dob	unknown-#JohnnyBrady-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-16 00:00:00	Prelude	510	I welcome this Bill. I am especially happy to endorse the proposal to end the dual mandate whereby councillors can sit in  the Oireachtas. Given the increasing indifference of voters to the electoral process, I am certain the provision ending the dual mandate will contribute greatly to political engagement. By affording more people the opportunity to become public representatives, this Bill makes a substantial contribution to restoring interest in the political process.Membership of local councils is, for many, the first opportunity to serve in public life. However, the presence of Oireachtas Members on councils is a major obstacle to the first engagement in politics. Ending the dual mandate is an imperative for broadening the political base. By broadening the base, I am confident the Bill will increase the number of women and young people coming forward into the political process.I found my role of councillor in County Meath vital to securing my base in north Meath over the past 29 years. I have seen massive changes in that time. While we often hear about the lack of finance available to local authorities today, I was a member of a county council when it had no money to spend and could not raise money. It is great to see the amount of money Government is now making available to local authorities. I do not believe the electorate's opinion of me will change because of the ending of the dual mandate. I applaud the confirmation by the Minister for the Environment and Local Government that he will introduce regulations to compel city and county managers to give existing Oireachtas Members extensive information on local authority issues and I hope this will happen. In my experience over 29 years, I could not do anything but praise the officials of local authorities. Unfortunately, the introduction of "Better Local Government" has not improved the service to councillors or to the people. Since the introduction of "Better Local Government", we do not seem to get the same dedication that we had with older officials. I hope the Minister of State will look at this area, as it is vital for councillors and Deputies.The number of women involved in representative politics in Ireland is low by international standards. Women are, in many ways, particularly suited to local representation. Their practical approach and affinity for community are vital characteristics for effective local representation.Ireland has a long tradition of strong local government. Ireland has the youngest population of all EU member states. According to the 1996 census of population, almost 1.5 million – 41% – of our population of approximately 3.6 million is under 25 years of age. The European average for under-25s is 25%. It is often said that young people are the future of Irish democracy. However, young people should also be seen in the present tense. The non-participation of young people is the greatest threat and challenge facing our democratic system in the new century.The turnout in elections has steadily declined in recent years to the point where the number  voting is a minority. Recent terms have been quite alarming. At 66.2%, the 1997 general election turnout was the lowest since 1923. The 1997 presidential election turnout of 46.8% was the lowest ever for such an election as was the 1999 local elections turnout of 50.2%. Evidence suggests the turnout of voters, particularly young voters, is declining across the world particularly in developed countries. What sets Ireland apart is the turnout of first time voters. A recently published analysis of electoral participation data in 1999 showed that among the 15 countries analysed, Ireland had the lowest turnout of first time voters.We in Fianna Fáil have tried to make ourselves more relevant to young people. Two themes that constantly come up as barriers to young people getting involved are voter registration and education. We have acted on calls to improve advertising and media campaigns to provide information and education. Two types of campaigns are identified as necessary – educational campaigns to inform people of how the system works and campaigns to encourage people to vote. The Referendum Commission has improved the position.Everyone wants to make an impact but too many young people in Irish society consider they have little opportunity to substantially affect Government policy. However, it is possible to achieve practical changes on issues ranging from protecting public health, safeguarding consumers, and preserving the environment, to establishing meaningful financial reform.At the heart of our plans for the Ireland of the 21st century is a new vigorous system of local government based on comprehensive and modern legislation and participation of the best statutory and voluntary organisations.
#JimmyDevinsFF	unknown-#JimmyDevinsFF-party	unknown-#JimmyDevinsFF-dob	unknown-#JimmyDevinsFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-16 00:00:00	Prelude	511	I thank Deputies Haughey and Brady for sharing time with me. I welcome the Bill. There are two types of government, central government and local government, both of which are equally important. In the past we have had a centralised form of government. In recent years local government reform has attempted to increase the range of functions of local authorities. This has led, inevitably, to a substantial increase in councillors' responsibilities and functions. They are obliged to make representations on behalf of constituents in relation to roads, housing, water, sewerage and so on. They have to attend monthly meetings of councils and sub-committees. The strategic policy committees take up a substantial amount of time. In that regard I agree with Deputy Haughey that the SPCs are not working as envisaged. The executive of my local council in Sligo has far too much of an input into the SPCs and perhaps the Minister would look at that issue.An increasing amount of time and responsibility are devoted to the preparation of local and county development plans. All of this has placed increasing demands on councillors and slowly a  councillor's job has changed and is approaching that of virtually a full-time representative. As a councillor of 12 years' standing, I have had first hand experience of the changing role in local government and have witnessed the increasing responsibilities that have come with the job. In that regard I commend the former Minister for the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Noel Dempsey, and the present Minister, Deputy Cullen, and the Minister of State, who have contributed to those increasing roles and have recognised the position of local authorities in our democracy.Since my election to the Dáil in May 2002 I realise my work here is full-time and I have taken leave of absence from my previous employment. The House sits three days a week. With the number of Oireachtas committees increasing, the range and diversity of the job is increasing also. As a result, it is becoming almost impossible to devote the time and energy required at local level and to make that compatible with doing a full-time job as a TD. As in my case, many TDs and Senators are members of local authorities and need to attend local authority meetings and meetings and sittings of the Dáil. Given the increased amount of legislation going through the House, a huge amount of time is devoted to it. In this session we have passed 15 Bills. For that reason, it is in the interests of our constituents to have one job per person. Either one does that job at local level or one does it at national level. In this way, one can devote one's energy and ability to that job.The second aspect of this legislation, which has been alluded to by Deputy Brady, is the very low representation of females and young people in political life. Ireland has 1.5 million people under the age of 25, constituting over 40% of the population, and has the youngest population in Europe. The number of young voters is decreasing. We had the lowest turnout of young voters in recent elections. Fianna Fáil has worked hard to increase interest among young people by engaging in an active voter registration campaign and by educating young people about public life and how the system works and encouraging them to vote. There is a danger that if present trends continue young people may feel further alienated from Government, either at national or local level. This would be a negative step.The abolition of the dual mandate will, hopefully, encourage more young people to get involved in politics at local level. The forthcoming local elections will be the first opportunity for young people, under this legislation, to get involved. I urge as many young people as possible to do so. This is an appropriate time given the increasing apathy among young people in relation to politics in general. Likewise the rate of participation by women in politics, nationally and locally, is very low. I hope this Bill will lead to greater participation.I congratulate the Minister on recognising that all politics is local. His inclusion of access for  Oireachtas Members to all dealings of their local authority will ensure they will be able to engage with local authorities, after the passing of this Bill, as well as acting as a vital conduit between local and national affairs.

One could argue for it if it made a proper attempt to reform local government. Weighing up all the considerations, I have come to the conclusion that I oppose this legislation. If the Bill ever becomes law, it will have a negative effect on the quality of representation at Oireachtas level and at local authority level. There is an expectation that the President may refer the Bill to the Supreme Court and, if so, I do not know what will be the outcome.Clearly, there is divided opinion in the Oireachtas about the merits or otherwise of the Bill. Opinion is divided on whether Members should be eligible to serve simultaneously in the Oireachtas and on local councils. Some Members have a passionate desire to retain their positions on local authorities while others would be relieved not to be members of local authorities. Others still, including a number of Fianna Fáil backbenchers, are opposed to the abolition of the dual mandate but will vote for the Bill. We have a strange mixture in the Dáil. Deputy Ring of our party is passionate in his desire to continue to serve on the local council and has said he will take the matter to the High Court if the Bill is passed. He has received promises of support and encouragement from Government backbenchers. Those same backbenchers could save themselves a great deal of money if they simply voted against Second Stage of the Bill, later this evening. In that way they would not have to support any High Court challenge.I do not know what the Minister is trying to achieve with this legislation. Could his party and the smaller party not make it a rule within their parties not to allow their Oireachtas Members to stand for the local authority? That would solve their problems. Other people can make up their own minds, or the electorate should decide whether they want Deputies to serve on the local authority.For a person to serve in the Oireachtas and on a local authority is no more a burden than serving in this House and holding down a job as a doctor, a solicitor or in business. That dual mandate is more strenuous than the dual mandate involved in being both a Dáil Deputy and a local authority member. I know that from my own experience. In my early years in the Oireachtas I was involved in my own business but found out after a short time that I could not do both, so I gave up my involvement in business but continued my mem bership of the local authority because I was well able to serve in both the Oireachtas and the local authority. When we talk about the dual mandate, we should include all dual mandates. I have no difficulty in being a Member of the Dáil and of the local authority. I was a member of two local authorities, Galway County Council and Galway City Council. It only helped me in my membership there and in my membership of the Oireachtas.What is the Minister trying to achieve with this legislation? Is it the result of a commitment to the Progressive Democrats or is there some other reason the Government desires to eliminate the dual mandate? A Fianna Fáil backbencher, Deputy McGuinness, believes the minority party in Government has too much say. He recently turned his talents to journalism and penned a good article in which he stated that it was extraordinary to see Fianna Fáil promote a Bill that will remove the most experienced politicians from a local government structure which is falling apart and needs to be challenged. I wish I had time to quote more from his excellent article.

My continued membership of the Oireachtas and the local authority has been of immense benefit to me in both the Dáil and on the local authority. A Deputy's experience in the local authority greatly helps him or her in dealing with Dáil and Seanad legislation. A Member of the Dáil or Seanad who is a member of a local authority is in touch with and has an interest in what is going on. If I were not a member of a local authority, I would not have the same interest in dealing with matters. The Minister of State knows that from my involvement on Committee Stage of various Bills relevant to the environment on which I am a spokesman. Similarly, if a matter comes up in the local authority, my experience as a Deputy is very useful to me at that level. The Minister and some managers might not always like that but that is not a valid reason for introducing this legislation. There is still no substitute for the common sense and experience to be gained from being a member of a local authority. That is why it would be a mistake to pass this Bill.The Government's change of mind regarding the proposed direct elections for mayors is an obvious indication that it is afraid its candidates in such elections would suffer the consequences of broken promises and widespread cutbacks since the general election. This Bill focuses on the abolition of the dual mandate but makes no adequate provision for how Members of the Oireachtas will continue to represent their legitimate interests at local authority level.As already stated, the Bill is unsatisfactory. It does not set out adequate terms on which Members of the Oireachtas can deal with matters of local interest for their constituents. It is essen tial that Members of the Oireachtas have access to the local authority regarding local issues. The Minister referred to access by local authorities and Deputy Brady referred to it a minute ago. The Minister said that should this legislation be passed, he would introduce guidelines at a later stage. Why does he not place all his cards on the table now? What are those guidelines? We are putting the cart before the horse. Those guidelines should be spelled out. In planning matters, local authority members have a statutory right to get a prior notice and planning application. Will that right continue to exist for Members of the Oireachtas to cover their electoral area when they are no longer a member of the local authority? That is just one example. These matters should be spelled out in advance.I have to ask whether this Bill is constitutionally sound. Is the Government prepared to publish the Attorney General's opinion, or would the grey areas found most likely strengthen the case for those who oppose the Bill? By taking democracy out of the hands of the people the Government is denying them the right to elect who they like to their local authority. Our Constitution provides that no person may at the same time be a Member of the Dáil and the Seanad. It states nothing about membership of a local authority and the Oireachtas. Is this Bill, therefore, constitutional? A person can be a Member of the Dáil and of the European Parliament but not of the Dáil and a local authority. I cannot see the logic of that.On balance, local authorities will be losing much valuable experience. It is useful to have Members of the Oireachtas on local authorities because the manager cannot then instigate a putsch. It is also useful to have members of local authorities in the Oireachtas when matters of legislation concerning local authorities are being discussed there. That is why I have been swayed in my opinion.It is interesting that the Government gave time to the three Independents supporting it to speak in opposition to the Bill. I was disappointed in Deputies Blaney and Cuffe who said they would be voting for the Bill even though they stood up in the House and slated it. They will be voting for the abolition of the dual mandate but they rightly said that the Bill was piecemeal and did nothing to reform local government. I wish they could have withheld their support to force the Government to introduce a Bill that would give proper reform of local government.

However, candidates should have a fundamental right to go before the electorate and allow it to decide whether or not they should be kept in two jobs. That issue should be put to bed. It is relatively straightforward. People should have freedom of choice.The Minister for the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Cullen, had a go at Deputy  Ring in connection with Fine Gael's change of position. One thing we can be sure of is that the previous Government took the position that we should have directly-elected mayors and pulled back from that because it felt it would be ceding power to other parties or Independents and would suffer a mid-term backlash. That was a fundamental error.Members spoke about the role of councillors. As far as I am concerned, councillors have no power. They have become lackeys of management. We can find out nothing from management about the council. I challenge any Member of the Dáil to tell me how many bank accounts his or her local authority has and the balance in those accounts. I would be surprised if anybody could tell me. I sought at our estimates meeting to find that out. I could find out only minimal information. We are kept in the dark. We have no power. We have two powers in theory. On the estimates every county council ends up fighting over €10,000 or over a local dogs' home and €60 million, or in the case of Dublin County Council more than €1 billion, is going down the tubes. We do not know what is happening. There is no accountability. If we had directly-elected mayors we could get people in who would be responsible. If this means reducing the number of councils to one per electoral area, well and good. However, until such time as we can put someone in the chair, be it an official or a politician, and question him or her like a Minister, about what he or she did with money allocated for the area, we will have no power in local government.In the context of the development plan, county councillors are afraid to put forward amendments lest they be accused of corruption. They can consult with An Taisce and with other vested interests and do something for them, but if they want to do something progressive for a community, they are afraid to do it in case they are charged with corruption. They follow the manager's thinking hook, line and sinker, and watch people going in and out of the tribunals every other day. If they vote against a management proposal the public may say they must have been corrupt. However, very often if they had not voted against management proposals right across this country, we would be in a far worse situation than we are in.Part of Kildare is in my parish. I wrote to Kildare County Council to make a planning representation on behalf of a constituent and received a reply informing me that my representation had not been made within five weeks and returning my submission because I had not applied in time. If that is the way county councils treat Members of the Oireachtas I want no part of this Bill. We have no power. The Minister should be serious and bring forward a proposal that gives us real power and does not turn us into yes-men and lackeys for a management that refuses to answer questions.

#DavidStanton	unknown-#DavidStanton-party	unknown-#DavidStanton-dob	unknown-#DavidStanton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-16 00:00:00	Prelude	522	The Minister, in his speech, said this was a starting point and that he would bring forward more change. It is a shame that he did not indicate any aspect of that change to the House or to the people. There was no hint in his speech of the changes he has in mind. The Tánaiste said this morning that there would be more legislation but she could not tell me when. That is not good enough.Local government is an institution which is fundamental to democracy and we should tamper with it very carefully. We have seen a U-turn on the question of the directly elected mayor. That proposal deserves serious debate and discussion. It is a good idea although there were problems with what was being proposed. The 1991 Barrington report proposed that we should have district councils. That was a very good idea but it has remained on the shelf since 1991. None of the Barrington recommendations has been implemented. A district council with a directly elected local mayor would personify what is needed for the people of the district. A mayoral candidate standing for election could articulate a vision for the town or the county. Whatever about county councils and corporations, town councils are virtually powerless talking shops. It is no wonder people do not wish to join them when all they get is hassle without responsibility.The Bill itself is flawed. It says a person who is a Member of either House of the Oireachtas is disqualified from being elected or co-opted to or being a member of a local authority. It does not say such a person cannot stand for election. I could not be stopped from putting my name on the ballot paper at a local election. I could not be deemed elected but if the people decided to put me at the top of the poll could any Minister go against what the people had said? Any Deputy can stand for election to a local authority. This problem needs to be examined.Local government should be accountable, accessible, responsive, representative and replaceable. There is no accountability at local government level. Who is responsible? If one telephones a local authority one will be sent from A to B to C and D. In the Oireachtas the buck stops with the Minister who is accountable to the  Dáil. That is a fundamental building block of democracy but it does not exist at local authority level. The Minister also said he would bring forward regulations to enable Members to have a link with the local authority. It is a pity we have not seen them.Regarding the dual mandate, I agree with Members who say there are two jobs. If we had proper reform of local government, and not local governance, politicians who chose to do so could have a full-time career in local government. This will not happen because the Government has not shown vision, there is no timescale for change and our undemocratic system gives us only minutes to speak on this major piece of legislation which will fundamentally alter how we govern the country.
#TomHayes	unknown-#TomHayes-party	unknown-#TomHayes-dob	unknown-#TomHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-16 00:00:00	Prelude	523	I am delighted to have the opportunity to speak on this important Bill. Local government is a service to the people who elect the members of local authorities but nothing in the Bill will improve the quality of local authority services.I will confine my remarks to a few important issues. It is disgraceful that the chairman of a local authority is not part of its management team. Every Monday morning the local management team meets to take decisions for the week or month ahead but the chairman of the county council does not attend. He will be there for a photograph or for a sod turning ceremony and he will be called upon if difficulties arise or when there is hassle because of Travellers in an area but when the everyday decisions are made the chairman of the local authority is not there. That is not acceptable, it is not a good way of giving a service and it should end.When I joined my local authority in 1991, meetings were meaningful and it took a day to get through the month's business. Nowadays our council meetings are over in a short time because the advent of SPCs has weakened the meaning of county council meetings. If they were properly organised county council meetings could be the driving force of the county and could drive an agenda for the betterment of the county.A huge mountain has been made out of the molehill of the dual mandate. Councils are now so weakened that I am not convinced we will miss out by not being members of them. We will, however, miss being able to point out wrongdoings in the county to the county manager because no one is in a better position to keep in touch with the issues within a county than an ordinary TD who is travelling the constituency on a full-time basis.The direct election of a mayor or council chairman would have been a major way of giving local people a say in the local authority system. This should be looked at again because people should not have been afraid of it. Democracy is about representing the views of the ordinary people. Directly electing a mayor would have improved people's interest in local government.

I am glad to contribute on this Bill. In speaking about a full-time career in local government, Deputy Stanton must give credit to the Minister, who has made the first real change in that regard.

I lost the battle when I found an overwhelming number within the Fianna Fáil Party moving against me. I argued the points and made my case but, as a democrat, I accept the decision and will vote for it although I have concerns about it.I have a huge attachment to local government. I have been a member of local government since 1974 and have headed the poll in four of the five elections, with the highest vote in Cork city in the last local elections and the second highest in the previous elections. I took that as an indication of the electorate's faith in me. It is not something I boast about but it shows they wanted me. I have a greater attachment to local government than to here but I get paid better here and that is why I will stay in this House.There are arguments for and against the Bill. The arguments for it are that a greater number of young people will become involved as public representatives and it will allow for a greater gender balance. That could happen now, there is no need to legislate for it. It is not happening in my own party in Cork city – I am the only member  with a gender balance in my ward – but we do not need new legislation to ensure gender balance because that right has existed for 60 years.The Bill will allow meetings to take place while we are in Dáil Éireann. That was a handicap of the old situation. Against that, however, we will lose a huge amount of experience at local government level. I was concerned when we lost Ministers of State because the cream rises to the top and they were the people with the necessary ability and experience. This will shift the fine balance between management, professional staff and members. There is no doubt that it will be Oireachtas Members who will take on managers when they have to be taken on. They have access to information and the corridors of power and they have the confidence and experience that go with the job. It is a fine balance and I am afraid that when we leave, the part-timer will always be beaten by the person with the full-time job.There should not always be conflict but there will be times when it is necessary to keep the democratic process on track. That is the Bill's greatest weakness and I am concerned about it. We can train our people and get them to take their share of responsibility because there has been a weakness in the decision making process at local level. All of us are culpable in some way but there has been a tendency to give the power to managers because we were not making decisions.I voted twice against service charges. Dick Spring reintroduced them in 1985 and 1986 and when I came into the Dáil in 1987, I was told quickly by my western colleague that there was no way charges were being funded from central Government or that they should be funded.

If they were, they would not have given a dual mandate to an extra 21 Members of this House at the last general election. There are groups that have made representations, including our colleagues in LAMA, but most of them have their own agenda.We must look at the financing of local government, which every party has fudged since 1982. We must also examine the decision making process. I have always tried to encourage my own group on Cork City Council to make decisions, and not always the populist ones, because otherwise the city suffers.
#SeanPower	unknown-#SeanPower-party	unknown-#SeanPower-dob	unknown-#SeanPower-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-16 00:00:00	Prelude	533	This Bill is simple. It deals with two issues, directly elected mayors and ending the opportunity and privilege for Senators and TDs of serving on local authorities.Are people with experience in local authorities  in a better position to carry out the functions of mayors than those with no experience? That is a difficult question to answer and I am no wiser having listened to contributions on the matter in the past two weeks. If we had directly elected mayors, people would feel greater ownership of the person in charge. The present situation suits the small number of councillors in every local authority who can aspire to becoming mayor of an authority – it is a great honour and privilege for them.I have been a Member of this House since 1989 and of Kildare County Council since 1999. I might be unusual in that I was elected to this House before I was elected to the local authority. I do not have too many regrets in my political life but I admit that I regret even running in the last local election. I have a brother who is a sitting member for the Green Party and, against my better judgment, I ran and probably kept him out of a council seat.

Apart from the regular monthly county council meeting, the most important meeting is the area meeting. The area meeting for Kildare County Council takes place every Thursday and, more often than not, I am not able to attend because of business here. We were voting on the Estimates in this House while my colleagues on the council were deciding on other matters. Those who elected me to a local authority would prefer it if I could attend meetings. Even though I have only been on the county council for a few years, often Dáil business and council business have clashed and I feel obliged to give preference to this House.I was disappointed with last year's county council estimates. The Kildare county manager presented us with estimates that increased commercial rates by far in excess of inflation. It is a separate matter that business people are treated as an easy target and we take money from them at the stroke of a pen.

#JohnMcGuinness	unknown-#JohnMcGuinness-party	unknown-#JohnMcGuinness-dob	unknown-#JohnMcGuinness-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-16 00:00:00	Prelude	548	During the last Administration and in the course of this one, I have made them clear to the Minister and my parliamentary party. However, like Deputy Dennehy, I must accept the unanimous view of the Fianna Fáil parliamentary party on the dual mandate, as I had to accept the party's view on the direct election of mayors and chairpersons, as provided for in the 2000 Act. I was against that measure and I am glad to see it is to be reversed. Public representatives elected by the public should have the election of a chairman or a mayor within their own power.If there is to be real reform in this area the Minster should amend the legislation dealing with managers to ensure the leading figures, such as mayors and chairpersons, can be included in the day-to-day operations in the manner outlined by Deputy Hayes. This is the only way in which local government can be changed because too much power has been placed in the hands of individuals. It means that public representatives are left with little or no power by comparison with what they had.When I started out in local government 25 years ago, local representatives had greater powers and we were willing to implement decisions, be they good or bad, based on a shared know ledge. I see no reason public representatives, having been elected, should not have the power to make and implement decisions. That balance must be redressed in the context of the other legislation to be introduced by the Minister.

#JohnMcGuinness	unknown-#JohnMcGuinness-party	unknown-#JohnMcGuinness-dob	unknown-#JohnMcGuinness-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-16 00:00:00	Prelude	550	I have a special attachment to local government. I am 25 years a member of my borough council or corporation and a member of the county council for many years. Between my late father and an uncle, we have over 120 years' commitment to local government from one family.I do not believe there is any demand for a change to the dual mandate. In 1999, the people had the opportunity to vote for Oireachtas Members or other candidates when electing their local representatives. In a substantial number of cases they voted to elect Oireachtas Members. If there was a free vote in the House I do not believe this legislation would be carried. There is an argument in favour of giving electors freedom of choice. If somebody wants to take on the work of membership of a local authority and membership of the Oireachtas, that choice should be allowed.I have been a member of Kilkenny County Council, Kilkenny Corporation and the Oireachtas since 1997. As local authority officials tend to clock attendance nowadays, I can confirm that I have achieved an approximate 98% attendance record at local authority meetings. In that time I have never missed meetings of Oireachtas committees. I have been able to bring the experience gained at local level to my consideration of legislation introduced to this House. It has enabled me to base my arguments at Oireachtas committee meetings on real life experience. Such input will be missing from future legislation if we pass this Bill.The electorate, who make the choice in the first instance, never demanded this change. When local authority members availed of the retirement package in 1999, I saw how much my local authority lost in terms of experience across the political divide. When Deputy Pattison, the former Deputy Crotty and other serving Members gave up their local authority seats, the result was a stronger executive facing a weakened group of public representatives who lacked the experience required to take on officialdom.Garret FitzGerald and the late Basil Chubb have argued that the present system encourages clientelism. I do not believe any Member of this House encourages clientelism. It does not happen. People attend our clinics week in, week out because the system is encouraging a growing public discontentment. It is not delivering services.The introduction of Better Local Government and the SPCs within the Better Local Government structure has been a failure. It has created a layer of bureaucracy, many talking shops and  much activity by officials and the SPCs, but no action. That will not change unless the Minister introduces legislation that makes county managers and officials more accountable and reverses the balance away from officials and in favour of public representatives.One of the weaknesses in the current system is that local government is not accountable to this House. Local government officials can do as they please and Members of this House cannot hold local authorities to account. That needs to be changed. Regardless of what happens, the public will hold this House accountable and will look to Oireachtas Members to be accountable to them for the actions of local authorities. Members of the public cannot understand why the House cannot call before it county managers or local authority executives to make them accountable.The local government system is antiquated and is not keeping pace with modern life. When contacted by telephone, county managers and directors of services respond by voicemail because they are attending courses or doing something else. They are not at their desks. Applicants for promotion at local government are interviewed by their peers or those holding similar grades elsewhere. That must be immediately changed.It has been argued that preventing Oireachtas Members from sitting on local authorities will make way for the entry to politics of women and young people. I do not see anyone queuing in any of the political parties to attend political meetings or to seek election for public office. There needs to be radical overhaul and reform if the system is to work effectively and if those who wish to serve are to be encouraged to participate.

#JoeSherlock	unknown-#JoeSherlock-party	unknown-#JoeSherlock-dob	unknown-#JoeSherlock-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-16 00:00:00	Prelude	561	Some years ago, the Fianna Fáil Government decided to abolish rates. At the time, a commitment was given to the people that there would be a rate support grant of 100%. The grant is now known as the local government fund and it provides less than 50% support. The Minister should take note of the point. Cork County Council, of which I have been a member since 1974, has seen its funding reduced this year by €500,000, which is the amount that would have been allocated for the collection of rates and tax on cars. I am glad the Minister is here to hear that. The council pays the staff who collect the money, which it hands to the Minister, but it is not refunded. It is appalling. The Fianna Fáil Government promised the rate support grant, but it is not keeping its word.SPCs and other sub-committees of local authorities are mere talking shops. Where is our better local government? A couple of years ago, the former Minister for the Environment and Local Government spoke to a large audience at a conference at which I was a delegate. Seeing quite clearly what his audience was, the Minister referred to local county councillors as parish pump politicians. He was very lucky I did not interrupt him as I intended.

#JoeSherlock	unknown-#JoeSherlock-party	unknown-#JoeSherlock-dob	unknown-#JoeSherlock-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-16 00:00:00	Prelude	571	These developments have reversed the process of local government and the better local government document has not been used to promote reform, but rather to reinforce the bureaucracy of local administration. It was a mistake to dismantle the professional tier of local government such as service planners. It has seriously weakened the professional and technical side of local government service and contributed to the drift away from local authority service of professional staff. They see little in the traditional career structures because, ultimately, the administration and managerial tiers have the advantage in terms of promotional opportunities. This is a regressive step.
#TommyBroughan	unknown-#TommyBroughan-party	unknown-#TommyBroughan-dob	unknown-#TommyBroughan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-16 00:00:00	Prelude	572	I will make a few brief points on this very important Bill. Most of our European colleagues throughout the soon-to-be 25 member states of the EU have real local government systems. We are practically the only country in the whole of Europe which has a totally bureaucratic system which is run by the Minister of the day and mandarins from the Department of the Environment and Local Government. Most of these Ministers have been members of Fianna Fáil. The little power local authorities had has been taken away by this Administration since 1997. We have seen dramatic losses of power during the current Minister's term of office in connection with housing and the waste plan. We have seen the introduction of the awful SPC system. For many years on my council, we had very good strategic committees up to 1997. We had a housing committee and a general purposes committee to address drainage, water and other essential services, which I chaired for many years. We did our business very well, we made policy and we had a civic charter, whereas now we have this awful system of SPCs which only meet now and again.

In terms of local government reform, we have only had the miserable prospect of directly elected mayors, but even this has been taken away within weeks of Deputy Cullen's appointment as Minister. The direct election of mayors has been suppressed because Fianna Fáil is terrified by the prospect of fighting a direct election in every county and city.

The Seanad is now unconstitutionally based on an unconstitutional electorate.

It is a grossly undemocratic basis on which to elect the Upper House and the Seanad knows it. That House is trying to do something about it to prevent itself from becoming unconstitutional. There needs to be a reform of the basic system.Since, as Tip O'Neill said, all politics is truly local, most important policies should be decided at the level at which they apply. Issues of transport, policing and health should be dealt with locally by locally elected people. The Minister should introduce a proper system of local government.

It is an unelected, tightly and bureaucratically organised near-dictatorship in many counties. In my city council before Christmas, 40 of the 52 councillors opposed the estimates. My party proposed alternative estimates but the city manager refused to accept them. Instead, he appeared to direct the law officer to state that our motions were unconsti tutional. We ended up with a budget we did not want and he got what he wanted. It is a most undemocratic system. When will the Minister do something about it?
#MartinCullen	unknown-#MartinCullen-party	unknown-#MartinCullen-dob	unknown-#MartinCullen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-16 00:00:00	Prelude	587	That is because the councillors did not want to introduce realistic charges.

I accept that he has come part of the way in this regard but I am still not happy. I have been a member of a local authority, Dublin City Council, for 12 years, during most of which time I have led the Labour Party, and I lead it today. I also represent the Fingal county area, as does the Acting Chairman, who would have exactly the same experience as me, although he was a Minister and would have had some extra clout with local officials which I do not have. We represent the Fingal county area even though we do not sit on the council.When one is a council member, one receives agendas and minutes and meets officials face to face. That experience is different when one represents a county but does not sit on the council. For example, this afternoon I logged on to the Fingal County Council website seeking the minutes of the Malahide-Howth area committee. An important decision had been taken regarding a planning matter in that area and I wanted to see it at first hand. However, the website stated that the page was not available. Obviously there was no intention of not putting it up, but it had not been put up. These are the problems.Section 3 is still much too weak. The Minister needs to recognise on Committee Stage that all Members are the primary elected representatives on the basis of votes cast for them. The Acting Chairman and I probably received more votes from the Fingal ward of our constituency than any of the local representatives. This elected role must be recognised in the legislation and that means not just receiving minutes, agendas, notices and so on but being informed at an early stage of major ongoing developments.

I presume he meant me, that I was disturbing the county council on the basis of trying to represent my area on a critical matter that would change the lives of my constituents.I urge the Minister to examine section 3. I accept and commend him on the extent to which he has tried to meet our demands. Tipp O'Neill was 1,000% right when he said that all politics is local, and it always will be. That is all the public wants to know. There are those who have been superstars in the House who lost their seats when they did not attend to local business. The Minster needs to strengthen section 3. He is still in the early part of his Ministry. I wish he would bring forward a real system of strong local government, like in Denmark, for example.

#TrevorSargent	unknown-#TrevorSargent-party	unknown-#TrevorSargent-dob	unknown-#TrevorSargent-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-16 00:00:00	Prelude	595	Ba mhaith liom buíochas a ghabháil ar dtús báire leis na Teachtaí Sherlock agus Broughan as a gcuid ama a roinnt liom. The Bill has already been referred to by my colleague, our spokesperson on the environment, Deputy Cuffe, who set out the Green Party view on it which emanates from the principle we work with that all decisions should be made at the lowest effective level. As a party, we work on the principle of thinking globally and acting locally. Local government is something we are keen to promote and strengthen. We support the ending of the dual mandate and have acted on that principle by resigning our council seats as each of us was elected a Member of the House.Deputy Cuffe referred to the Barrington report which went as far as to say that defence and foreign affairs were the only matters that should be dealt with by the Legislature. We have a long way to go before we deal with that level of decentralisation. That said, although the Bill falls short in terms of reform, and I agree with many of the points Deputy Broughan made, it must still be recognised that it contains within it a vital step in making local government more relevant and, ultimately, if the reforms are put in place, more effective. We certainly regret section 7 and the attempt to squash democracy by ending the possibility of directly electing mayors, but it is still the case that the principle of the dual mandate is being addressed in the Bill and for that reason we have to support it.It is not a one-off and neither is it thoughtless. It is clear that Ministers, MEPs and civil servants cannot be councillors, and TDs cannot be  cathaoirligh of local authorities. I sense a feeling of victimisation from listening to Members say that they are the only ones affected, but this approach is in line with the principle that we should strive towards local government – I say that deliberately – and not just local administration. Unfortunately, what we have in this country is a form of local administration based on the British colonial system and it is high time we moved on from that.Some say there is no demand for this, yet it is borne out by the fact that there is a huge level of confusion in the public between what a TD and a local councillor is mandated to do. I hope this measure will go some way towards putting clear water between the functions of both.It is also important that we have proper reform of local government. This will only come about, as Deputy Sherlock said, when the damage done by Fianna Fáil in 1977, when it promised to fund local government and reneged on it, is repaired. It is time the Government faced the fact that it must reduce levels of central taxation if funding at local level is to come about, as should be the case here and is in most other European countries. There local government has a way of funding itself that is independent from central government and is not viewed as double taxation because central government takes less proportionately than it would in this country.

The Minister has a responsibility to redress that ratio.

Members' views on it are passionate, no matter on what side of the debate they are. I have been a local authority member since  1996 and it has been hugely important in my role as a Government Deputy in terms of the grounding I received in local politics.I can understand the depth of feeling of Deputies on both sides of the House who debated both angles of this measure. I am not quite clear where the Fine Gael Party stands on the issue. Many Fine Gael Deputies have argued that they are against the Bill because they do not believe it will bring about a comprehensive overhaul of local government. However, the Minister has not presented the Bill to the House on that basis. He has clearly identified that it is a short Bill to deal specifically with the issues of the dual mandate and the directly-elected cathaoirligh of local authorities. In the past we were of the impression that many members of the Opposition were in favour of the abolition of the dual mandate. If that is where they stand it is incumbent upon them to support the Bill.

Maybe the leader of Fine Gael will clarify his party's position given that a colleague from my own constituency is so vocal and passionate about the dual mandate, as he is entitled to be.Let us consider some issues the Minister raised in his speech, particularly the idea that the abolition of the dual mandate will encourage more women and young people to become involved in local government. Would it be too late to consider an amendment to abolish the dual mandate for male members only? Few women are members of local authorities. I am one of three on the county council in my own constituency and if I am not able to represent my people at local level, it may be that I will not be replaced by a woman.

We must focus on it seriously because the lack of female representation both at local and national levels is serious.I accept the points that the Minister makes on young people because it has become increasingly difficult for them to get elected to local authorities, thus reducing their interest in politics as a whole. We need to address this. All political parties would welcome an influx of new people at local authority level and therefore there is some merit in what the Minister is recommending. I agree with the principle of what he is saying.It is not often that I agree with Deputy Sargent but I do in respect of the divide between national and local representatives. It is important the role of each person is identified clearly in the mind of the public. The Minister addressed this issue in his speech by saying that he believed it will  become clear over time. I hope this will not take long because, if it is, many people in this House may not get re-elected. The link between local authorities and national representatives has been beneficial for Deputies in terms of helping them get elected and keeping them in touch with local matters. At local authority level, I hope councillors value the fact that Oireachtas Members are members of the council and that they bring expertise and knowledge to bear in the carrying out of their duties.

There are clearly two schools of thought concerning the main provision of this Bill, which aims to end the dual mandate. It is thought that by breaking the link between local and national representation, a new dynamic will be unleashed that will benefit the operation of the Oireachtas and local government. Alternatively, there is a belief that we benefit both nationally and locally from the current system which involves Oireachtas Members undertaking key leadership roles at local government level and ensuring that national policy is reflected in local decisions. Both views are strongly held, as is evidenced by the debate which has taken place in my party for some time. Coming from the losing side in the debate, I rise today with a heavy heart to support the Bill, while retaining some reservations about the ending of the dual mandate. However, I congratulate the Minister on the constructive manner in which he has led the debate both within my party and in the Houses.The Minister has convinced me that he is committed to reform of our local government system, and radical reform is needed sooner rather than later. Therefore, what we are debating is just the first in a series of measures that the Minister will bring forward during the lifetime of this Government aimed at giving us more effective local government.Two problems must be considered. Better Local Government is not working. Management is functioning at a remove from councillors and councillors are uncertain and lack confidence in their own roles and often fail to act decisively in their policy-making role. While there is much talk of partnership at local level, from my experience and from discussions with colleagues around the country it is clear that this partnership, if it ever existed, has broken down in many counties and has been replaced by an unhealthy them and us scenario.Better Local Government was a wonderful theory. The idea of focusing on service development and delivery, led by an SPC and implemented by a director of services with a dedicated team, was a sound one. The reality, however, is somewhat different. While the experience is not totally negative, reports of significant progress are few and far between. We are hearing of directors and other senior officials who are more inaccessible  than ever before and of SPCs being used to stall initiatives rather than expedite them.Much of the difficulty that exists on the management side derives from the strategic management initiative. It is a positive initiative that has delivered major progress in many areas of the public service, but in local government strategies have replaced action and talks about management have replaced effective hands-on, day-to-day management. In effect, senior personnel seem to spend an inordinate amount of their time talking about how they might do a job rather than just doing it, and management has become professionalised without necessarily being more effective or professional.

It was passionate and reminded me of the days when I first came to this House when we had people like John Kelly, a more youthful Deputy Michael D. Higgins, the late Brian Lenihan and others. One actually came to the House to get the flavour of a debate because it could not be got on a monitor. This is because there was much passionate, witty, direct, constructive and wonderful commentary. The Deputies had a substantive understanding of their subject, which was evident in this debate as well. We would like to see more of this in Dáil Éireann. I think Deputy Gilmore entered the Dáil at the same time as I did in 1987.

#MartinCullen	unknown-#MartinCullen-party	unknown-#MartinCullen-dob	unknown-#MartinCullen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-16 00:00:00	Prelude	610	Those days probably represented the end of an era, but it was great to be there to see the kind of interchange that took place.I am happy to be here on the conclusion of the Second Stage debate on the Local Government Bill 2003, which is a further step in the ongoing programme of local government renewal. The wide-ranging contributions and the number of Members who have spoken on this subject reflect the importance of local government in society. It strikes me forcibly how wide the sphere of local government is in its impact on the everyday lives of people.Among the range of issues referred to during the debate were funding, customer service, staffing, roads, planning, housing, waste management, local authority charges, structures, functions, boundaries, the place of the community sector within the system, the need to enhance the role of locally-elected members and the relationships that exist and will exist between the Oireachtas and local government. Also mentioned were the substantive provisions in the Bill, namely, those associated with the dual mandate and the directly-elected cathaoirligh. In many ways, these issues capture much of the essence of local government today. It is important in sustaining economic and social development, both locally and nationally.I am encouraged to see that Members of the House have shown themselves to be strong advocates of the local government system, as always. The system truly benefits from their commitment and diversity of views on various issues. It is undoubted that such interest will continue to be displayed vigorously long after the ending of the dual mandate. In particular, it strikes me that while the various political parties may differ in their approaches to the local government system, we are not too far removed in terms of our ultimate goals. In the years ahead, I hope it will be possible to build on what is a shared commitment to ensure a vibrant and relevant local government system as a central focus for local communities.In my role as Minister for the Environment and Local Government I am acutely conscious that stewardship of the local government system falls to me. It is in this context that I have listened carefully to the views put forward by the various Members in the debate. Let us consider some of the points that have been raised. There has been much criticism that the Bill does not effect the comprehensive reform of local government. Although I have made my position clear, I must reiterate it in response to these comments.This is a short Bill. It is not a comprehensive overhaul of stewardship of the local government system and I have never tried to mislead anyone in that respect. We are all agreed on that. However, the abolition of the dual mandate is an essential element of a wider reform package and it will expand the political representative base throughout the country. It will have benefits for the national Parliament and local government and will provide the freedom and focus for each to concentrate on the role most appropriate to it. There is no doubt that the removal of the dual mandate will benefit both Houses of the Oireachtas in terms of ordering their business—

#MartinCullen	unknown-#MartinCullen-party	unknown-#MartinCullen-dob	unknown-#MartinCullen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-16 00:00:00	Prelude	612	Many Members on both sides of the House would like to see the House sit in plenary session more often. One of the tragedies of our structures is that the public and the media – even though they should know better – do not give credence to the committee system. I recall that in my early days in the House the media were screaming about why we could not have a proper committee system in our parliament. Now that we have it they will not cover it. That is very wrong for politicians because many non-Ministers get an opportunity to be front-line people in terms of their activities in committee and to contribute as much to the benefit of the Oireachtas and the people of this country as any Minister ever does in a plenary session. It is unfortunate—

#MartinCullen	unknown-#MartinCullen-party	unknown-#MartinCullen-dob	unknown-#MartinCullen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-16 00:00:00	Prelude	614	We are implementing that. Europe itself has now abandoned the dual mandate of membership of the European Parliament and of one's national parliament. That comes into effect from 2004. As all Deputies know, it will affect us not at the 2004 European election but before the general election, which will be in the middle of the next European Parliament. I expect there may no longer be anybody holding that dual mandate from 2004, but it is effectively gone, as was agreed in the European Parliament. Europe equally recognises that, with the demands of a modern parliamentary system, it is simply not possible to try to be a member of both local government and national government.If we are honest, we must also recognise the ever-increasing demands upon Members at both local and national level and that these trends can only intensify in the years ahead, to the point where, with the best will in the world it will be nigh impossible, if it is not so already, to satisfactorily carry out both roles on a simultaneous basis. Some Members have spoken in that regard in the course of this debate in a very honest and open way.We are also providing opportunity for more people, particularly young people and, I sincerely hope, more women to come into politics. It is not something that can be engineered in a simplistic way but I know from my own experience that there are women out there who will come into political life and serve in the wider public sphere if they get encouragement to do so. It is very difficult—

#MartinCullen	unknown-#MartinCullen-party	unknown-#MartinCullen-dob	unknown-#MartinCullen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-16 00:00:00	Prelude	618	It is very difficult to enter the local government system and augment the available stock of politicians willing to give their time to serve their communities at local level. We would all aspire to that. As I have already said, most of us share similar objectives even though the approach is different.I want to pick up on something Deputy Broughan was saying because I fundamentally agree with him. Almost every speaker in the House said he or she wants local government strengthened, more resources to be available under the control of the local government system and more autonomy at local government level. I subscribe to all of that. It was very interesting that Deputy Broughan used Denmark as an example. As he would probably know, I know the country very well. The reason local government systems work in these countries is that the amount of local taxation is very substantial. All of those countries have higher central personal taxation than we do.We can go down that road and I would welcome it. Deputy Broughan has said he wanted to see households in this country paying €5,000 or €6,000 per year in taxes into their local government system. There is no doubt that better services can be provided then in terms of local swimming pools, community facilities and local policing and that all sorts of wonderful things can happen—

I agree with the principles expressed in terms of local government but let us be collectively honest about what we are actually saying. If we want to give real authority to local government then, as everybody has said, in fairness, local government needs control of its own local taxation system. I look forward to the support that may be available to me in the years ahead if I begin to look at those areas because the tax base in this country is clearly too narrow.

The main Opposition parties voted against the very provision they now seek to retain. Collective agreement on this issue is therefore somewhat elusive at present even though the Deputies' colleagues on county councils and other representative bodies have lobbied extremely hard to ensure that directly elected mayors are not part of the system.It is not an ideological view. It is also not the case that I removed this proposal because the Fianna Fáil Party was afraid to go out and contest mayoral elections. I very strongly believe that people elected to local government should have the absolute right to choose their leader from among their own number of democratically elected people, just as we do in this parliament. We do not have a presidential-style system of election á la the United States. I do not believe elected councillors should have no opportunity in the lifetime of their service to become the mayor or cathaoirleach of their city or county. I just do not accept it. People have an inalienable right—

It is a view strongly held by all the political parties.

I have not done it just in response to some pressure put on me.

That is an important issue that has been mentioned across the House. I have listened carefully to all Deputies, and not just in this debate. I agree that this State put enormous resources into the local government system in recent years to produce a better local government system. It was not done for the self-aggrandisement of local government officials. It was done to improve local services and efficiencies. There seems to be serious questions as to what happened on the productivity side in terms of the delivery, and I am looking very seriously at that—

I, as a politician, accept that this is part and parcel of what we are trying to deliver, and I look forward to bringing my views and conclusions on that to this House in the not too distant future, I hope in the context of an overall review—

#MartinCullen	unknown-#MartinCullen-party	unknown-#MartinCullen-dob	unknown-#MartinCullen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-16 00:00:00	Prelude	632	I think they know my views. I have expressed them to many of them at this stage. For the moment, ending the dual mandate will itself bring about substantial change, while the current system of electing cathaoirligh for the newly elected councils from among their number will remain in place in 2004. The same model operates for the election of the Taoiseach.This Bill is therefore a starting point for me in continuing the programming of local government renewal, adding vigour and vibrancy to the changes being implemented in recent years and providing a platform from which to move forward. I flagged my intention to intensify the renewal programme and to develop more  efficient and effective local government with strong local roots and strengthened democratic input. Along the way we can look further at various issues which Members have raised in the context of further reform.I see that time is running out fast. A review of SPCs is being conducted by the Institute of Public Administration and all local authorities, including colleagues of the Deputies, are feeding into this process, as well as all of the different stake holders. I look forward in the not too distant future to having that review before me to see exactly what way it will shape up with regard to the role of councillors and directors of services.Before concluding, I acknowledge that many Members of both Houses have given years of dedicated service at both local and national level and that their departure from local government will, for most, be tinged with sadness and regret for leaving fellow councillors and friends and for the satisfaction – perhaps at times the frustration – and enjoyment which came with working within the local government system.I thank all Deputies who contributed to this debate for their interest and welcome the diversity of views and valuable inputs. I have enjoyed hearing the various views outlined which were often expressed in a very passionate way. I have gained a useful insight into contemporary parliamentary thinking on local government. While some contributions were outside the limited scope of this Bill, overall they provided much food for thought in considering and planning for the further development of local government in this country. On that positive note, I commend the Bill to the House.

In page 4, between lines 8 and 9, to insert the following:"‘club' means a club registered under the Registration of Clubs Acts 1904 to 2000;".Amendments Nos. 1 to 4, inclusive, are technical amendments which were prepared by the Office of the Chief Parliamentary Counsel because, in the definition of "licensee", registered clubs are covered as the text of the Bill stands by both paragraphs (a) and (b). This is due to the fact that, being registered, they are already regarded as licensed premises for the purposes of the intoxicating liquor code. Strictly speaking, therefore, only paragraph (b) should apply to them. The position can be rectified by the deletion of the existing references to clubs in paragraph (d) of the definition of “licensed premises”, by the insertion of a separate definition of such clubs immediately after the definition of closure order, and by other slight changes to paragraphs (a) and (b) of the definition of “licensee” in the section, as indicated in the amendment. I hope the House will accept these amendments.

The amendments seek to introduce measures that specify a duty of care. In this amendment, I propose that, "it shall be the duty of a licensee of catering premises to take such action reasonably within his or her control as is necessary to prevent disorder or noise referred to in section 4(1).”  It is important, as we embark in this section on a number of fairly strong measures regarding licensees, such as the possible closure of premises, and customers, that we impose a duty of care requirement and that we outline certain precautionary measures that should be introduced by the licensee.I have three amendments regarding the use of security cameras and the labelling of products. The licensees of premises which are catering or  other convenience outlets should take reasonable action to prevent any disorder or noise. That initial duty of care should be specified in the legislation. The licensees should know precisely the circumstances of an incident and their own responsibility in the matter. They should suffer a penalty if they do not take proper cognisance.
#GayMitchell	unknown-#GayMitchell-party	unknown-#GayMitchell-dob	unknown-#GayMitchell-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-16 00:00:00	Prelude	647	This is a worthwhile amendment. The proposals in the Bill and amendments of this kind are only worthwhile if there is enforcement. I cannot recall the last occasion I saw a garda in a public house and I occasionally visit public houses. Presumably those gardaí are too busy guarding former Taoisigh and driving Cabinet Ministers and judges to court and, indeed, senior Garda management to social functions. I note the Minister is carrying out a review of the security for the homes of former Taoisigh. I have no objection to the Minister being assigned a driver because Ministers work long hours and must cover wide areas.I suggest that the review be widened to include the introduction of the use of civilian drivers so that the Garda drivers could then be used for inspection duties as referred to by Deputy Costello. I only raise the issue because the Minister has also done so. This issue should not be examined in a piecemeal fashion. I suggest the Minister gives it a comprehensive examination. In the past there was a consideration of the security needs of Ministers because of the threat of terrorism and Ministers certainly needed greater security then. I suggest an across the board review which might result in more Garda inspection and investigation of licensed premises so that the law is enforced.
#MichaelMcDowellPD	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-party	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-16 00:00:00	Prelude	648	I am not accepting Deputy Costello's amendment because it is not the practice to insert provisions of this general nature into a criminal justice Bill. The question arises whether it is a criminal duty or a civil duty; whether the breach of it is to be a crime or simply a tort or whether it is to be just a general counsel of perfection. It is not very clear into what category it falls. I believe it would be more suited to a civil law measure such as the forthcoming intoxicating liquor Bill to set out civil duties of this kind.I indicated on Committee Stage that it was not my intention to introduce qualifying provisions such as "reasonable", "reasonably", "serious" and the like, because they would be regarded as let-out clauses and excuses which would lead to legal arguments as to what was meant by them.Regarding Deputy Mitchell's point, enforcement is of course a matter of some interest to me and I have made some points about it recently. From what the chairman of the liquor licensing commission remarked about and inserted in his report, there is no doubt that there is uneven enforcement of the law in Ireland. It cannot really be the case that Mayo is very different from Dublin in terms of the amount of under-age drinking  and yet the amount of prosecutions in Mayo seem to be 2.5 times the number in Dublin in one particular time period. Allowing for proliferation of licensed premises in some rural towns, one would imagine that there are far more premises selling liquor in Dublin than in Mayo.It seems to me that it cannot be a question of resources either, it is a question of policy and that is very important regarding these matters. It is not simply a matter of gardaí being available or not to enforce the intoxicating liquor laws, it is more than that.As regards gardaí going into such premises, the Deputy will know that the order in force at the moment is a well-intentioned attempt to ensure that gardaí who are out of uniform but on duty do not loiter in licensed premises. As Deputy Deasy will know because he has tabled an amendment relative to this issue, the law at the moment requires that a garda performing an official duty in a licensed premises must appear in uniform. It is my intention to amend that law because any real effort at enforcement and surveillance would require that a well-intentioned but impractical restriction on the presence of gardaí in licensed premises should be revoked. I will be doing that in the course of the forthcoming intoxicating liquor Bill, in accordance with the recommendation of the liquor licensing commission.As regards Garda resources generally, if I can be that irrelevant since the Deputy has been that irrelevant—
#GayMitchell	unknown-#GayMitchell-party	unknown-#GayMitchell-dob	unknown-#GayMitchell-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-16 00:00:00	Prelude	649	It is very relevant.
#MichaelMcDowellPD	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-party	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-16 00:00:00	Prelude	650	I believe that the commissioner is quite right in the context of re-assessing the use of the Garda personnel available to him to concentrate on getting as many gardaí as he can into the front line. There are many static posts which have nothing to do with former Taoisigh. Their use should be examined very carefully because it requires the deployment of 5.2 gardaí to maintain a static post on a 24-hour basis. This is expensive in terms of manpower resources. The commissioner is determined to review not just the security arrangements of former Taoisigh but others, with a view to making the best possible use, in the public interest, of manpower.As regards Ministers, the use of detective gardaí as ministerial drivers is a long-standing practice—
#GayMitchell	unknown-#GayMitchell-party	unknown-#GayMitchell-dob	unknown-#GayMitchell-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-16 00:00:00	Prelude	651	It used to be the same for Ministers of State.

In my judgment, the security needs of Ministers are well served by the use of gardaí. The use of civilian drivers would reduce the possibility of having armed security for Ministers or the Taoiseach. The civilian driver would have to carry a firearm or else there would be a requirement for armed gardaí.

The Minister has an inflated view of himself if he thinks he is much more important than a Minister of State. The Ministers of State have done without Garda drivers for a very long time. The Minister should review the issue and put more gardaí on the beat. If there is an opportunity for civilianisation then the Minister should take that opportunity.

We are discussing enforcement in relation to licensed premises and other catering premises but we have wandered a little bit.I acknowledge what the Minister said about not wishing to stray into the area of tort and wishing to be specific. The closure orders as outlined in the Bill are quite general in many ways in terms of the language used and what constitutes the offence where there has been disorder.Section 4(1)(ii) reads: "noise emanating from  the premises, or emanating from the vicinity of the premises and caused by persons who were on the premises, has been so loud, so continuous, so repeated, of such duration or pitch or occurring at such times as to give reasonable cause [the Minister said he would not use the word "reasonable" in the Bill and here it is in the main section] for annoyance to persons in that vicinity."  I do not regard this as a very sharp specific offence. My general introductory measure of care outlined in amendment No. 8 on the general duty of licensees is an excellent preamble to this section in regard to closure orders. It should be included as a warning for licensees that if disorder occurs this will be the consequence down the line. The provision would be useful in that it would prevent offences from being committed.
#MichaelMcDowellPD	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-party	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-16 00:00:00	Prelude	666	I do not want to create a breach of statutory duty which would give a right to someone who lived next door to a pub or restaurant to sue for damages. It is not that I am against this in principle but this is not the vehicle in which I want to include that provision. This is a criminal justice measure and, if I establish a statutory duty, it is not beyond the grounds of possibility that someone would say, "Here is a statutory duty. I have suffered as a result of my sleep being interrupted by a noisy take-away next door. I want to sue for damages", and rely on it as establishing a civil tort. While that may be a reasonable thing to do, I do not want to do it in the context of a criminal justice Bill without thinking through very carefully what would be the implications.What the Deputy is attempting to achieve is already implicit in the law. A District Court judge will only make a closure order or whatever if he or she is of the view that the licensee is behaving unreasonably or is failing to do something which is reasonably required. In that sense the implicit obligation to conduct one's premises reasonably is there in so far as one's premises can be closed by order of the District Court if one does not carry out that duty.

In page 5, between lines 16 and 17, to insert the following:4.–Without prejudice to the other duties specified by this Bill, it shall be the duty of a licensee of catering premises which are over such size as is prescribed by the Minister for the purposes of this section to maintain security cameras of sufficient nature and quantity as are reasonably required having regard to the risk of disorder and noise on or in the vicinity of the premises.I am pleased that the Minister has put forward an alternative. I am proposing a requirement for CCTV and security cameras, and that the Minister could prescribe the size and nature of the premises which would require these so that it would help to reduce the likelihood of disorder or noise on or in the vicinity of a premises.We are aware of recent incidents that have occurred. There was a report in yesterday's newspapers on the various videos taken from CCTV cameras. I understand they were taken from cameras in premises on Grafton Street in relation to a very tragic incident. Perhaps the Minister will indicate whether the gardaí had cameras on the street. When the Garda Commissioner spoke to us two months ago he indicated that he was in the process of establishing CCTV cameras in certain built-up areas which required a high degree of surveillance. Obviously the gardaí should have a camera in Grafton Street. There is one in O'Connell Street. CCTV cameras are a valuable deterrent to crime and a valuable tool in solving crimes that have been committed. It is important to incorporate this measure in the legislation so that we can ward against the likelihood of disorder and assaults which are taking place far too often in cities and rural areas.
#JohnDeasyFG	unknown-#JohnDeasyFG-party	unknown-#JohnDeasyFG-dob	unknown-#JohnDeasyFG-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-16 00:00:00	Prelude	671	Deputy Costello and I referred to this measure on Committee Stage. We appreciate the fact that the Minister has taken the matter on board and come back with this proposal. This measure is important. The catalyst for the bouncers Bill was CCTV coverage in Cork where a couple of horrific incidences took place.The Home Office recently carried out a study looking at different jurisdictions within Europe and the US. It looked at the effectiveness of CCTV and ordinary public lighting. The report concluded that additional or better public lighting can be just as effective and much cheaper than installing expensive cameras. It suggested that many cities and towns are not sufficiently lit and that if extra resources were made available to local authorities for extra public lighting, it would be just as effective. I am pleased that the CCTV issue is being included but we must also consider the public lighting issue.

Good management, including proper enforcement of the existing law, would  address this problem. Under section 5(3) of the Bill, if there is disorderly behaviour on a premises the court can rule that CCTV cameras should be installed in such premises. There is already sufficient CCTV in place. CCTV cameras do not seem to be a deterrent to the type of incident which took place on Grafton Street. I am wary of mandatory surveillance. I am concerned that a fine of €650 would not impact greatly on businesses which would not comply with a court order. Perhaps the figure should be increased.
#MichaelMcDowellPD	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-party	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-16 00:00:00	Prelude	673	Amendments Nos. 15 and 16 were meant to deal with the issues raised by Deputies Costello and Deasy on Committee Stage and I am grateful to the Deputies for raising those points.  Amendment No. 16 imposes a penalty on the basis that when a licence comes up for annual renewal, an opportunity is given to the District Court to examine cases where there has not been compliance with its orders. For non-licensed outlets, such as take-aways etc., there is not an occasion to sanction someone that is acting other than in accordance with the directions of the court. This was introduced as a criminal sanction for failing to comply. The spirit behind the drafting of the Bill is that most licensees that stand to lose their licences would be deterred from ignoring an order by the potential loss of the licence.A number of district judges are already requiring, on an informal basis, that CCTV be installed in certain premises as it has the ability to either deter offences or establish who is telling the truth about occasions of disorder. Whereas many banks install CCTV outside their premises to give some comfort to people using ATMs etc., they do have a collateral advantage in that they provide a useful reference, where available, for the Garda to attempt to detect who was involved and what happened in the commission of offences.Deputy Ó Snodaigh raised the issue of privacy. I am struck by the fact that he ploughed a distinct furrow from many other Deputies on this occasion and when I published the crime figures. He may be proved right, or otherwise, in the long run. I do not feel the privacy issue is all that serious. I do not feel my privacy is intruded on if there is a CCTV camera recording the goings-on in a chipper. There is a CCTV camera in my local corner shop and I do not feel my privacy is much intruded on. On the contrary, I draw some degree of comfort from the fact that it is less likely there will be a violent incident there if it is known CCTV is in operation.I am also struck by the point raised by Deputy Deasy regarding the British Home Office survey that seems to suggest good public street lighting is, in many cases, as good a deterrent as CCTV. One is not necessarily the alternative to the other and both combined are the optimum.

#MichaelMcDowellPD	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-party	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-16 00:00:00	Prelude	675	It is striking that in many cases  poor lighting is a causal factor in the location of crime, if not in its commission in the first place.While I cannot be more specific as I presume criminal proceedings are pending, the difficulty regarding the incidents to which Deputy Costello refers is that street lighting does not seem to provide any deterrent to people engaging in that kind of behaviour. I know there was almost a pitch battle recently on O'Connell Street where there is intense street lighting and full CCTV surveillance. Neither seemed to be a deterrent when people were minded to behave in that way. We should not be too naive about the capacity of CCTV to make our lives perfect.I take the point Deputy Ó Snodaigh generally makes that we cannot have a snooping society where every move of every person in every place is available to the Garda for public inspection. Regarding the type of case to which Deputy Costello refers, it is not as if gardaí spend their spare time, if they have any, going over CCTV footage to satisfy their idle curiosity as to what people do. Gardaí will only spend time doing this in pursuit of a serious Garda purpose. I do not think it is ever used for snooping. It is used sparingly and on a voluntary basis where the owner of the CCTV makes the material available to the Garda in the context of the commission of serious offences.
#JoeCostelloLAB	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-party	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-dob	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-16 00:00:00	Prelude	676	The Minister has been eminently reasonable in presenting this case. The amendment I tabled dealt with maintaining sufficient security cameras "as are reasonably required having regard to the risk of disorder and noise on or in the vicinity of the premises". The Minister's amendment goes a step beyond that and I agree with it.It can always be said that a citizen's rights are being interfered with if there is any intrusion arising from any form of surveillance or actions taken by anybody. As we have focused the amendment in the context of disorder or activity on or off the premises that would give rise to offences, it is corralled into that. Since CCTV was installed on O'Connell Street, the Garda has reported substantial improvement on law and order on that street even though the Minister has cited a sample disorder. The Garda Síochána has indicated a reduction of disorder of between 25% and 50%. While disorder was rampant on O'Connell Street some time ago, one does not hear of it as much now. It is almost as if much of the late night disorder has shifted, despite O'Connell Street being the Mecca for fast food outlets in the city.The Minister's amendment is reasonable and we should take on board what Deputy Deasy has said about the need for local authorities to ensure there is good public lighting, particularly in areas where young people assemble in large numbers late at night.
#JoeCostelloLAB	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-party	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-dob	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-16 00:00:00	Prelude	677	I move amendment No. 10:
In page 5, between lines 16 and 17, to insert the following:4.–Without prejudice to the other duties specified by this Bill, it shall be the duty of a licensee of catering premises which supplies products consisting of or containing intoxicating liquor for consumption off the premises to label such products in such a way as to identify the identity of the licensee in question.This is a duty I am seeking to impose on the owners of off-licences. This is a crucial issue and has been mooted before. I believe it was included in 1998 legislation but it has never been activated. It is virtually impossible to trace the origins of a bottle or can that has emanated from licensed premises because there is no marking on it. A good deal of under-age drinking takes place and many sales of alcohol get into the hands of young people whether sold by rogue off-licences or to persons over the age of 18 who pass it on to young people. A range of by-laws makes it an offence to drink in public places.This is a simple matter of providing traceability. Any item of liquor sold to be consumed off the premises should have indelible ink or some traceability element on it to enable it to be traced. That would be of enormous advantage in determining where the rogue off-sales take place and it would be enormously useful where offences are being committed. This does not mean one can immediately say that such and such a premises has committed an offence. Of course not, it may well be that it has been sold in a bona fide fashion but if it happens on a regular basis and the origins of the bottles or cans are the same premises, there would be a degree of suspicion and it would be a matter of checking up on that premises. It would be enormously valuable in dealing with under age drinking if we knew from where every can or bottle of alcohol came.The argument from supermarkets, off-licences and convenience stores – be they petrol stations or the local Spar outlets – is that this would be time consuming and would involve a cost factor. I do not see why we cannot deal with that issue. Every item of perishable goods from a grocery or supermarket has a stamp indicating its "sell by" date. We shall have to impose the same duty of responsibility on those who are the purveyors of alcohol because of the implications and the impact of alcohol. It is a drug and it causes much damage if abused and if in the wrong hands. Those who own the premises and sell the product will have to bear that extra duty of responsibility and care.I ask the Minister to take on board this amendment.

Virtually every community is affected by under age drinking. At a residents' association meeting with the Garda Síochána last year, the Garda was challenged as to why a specific off-licence was allowed  to continue sales because it was the belief of all present that the particular premises was the cause of much of the under age drinking in the area. The reply was the Garda found it very difficult get convictions or to prove the drink involved came from a particular premises. I agree with Deputy Costello that anything that makes it easier to prove the link between such a premises – whether the convenience store, the supermarket or the off-licence – and which would help the Garda to tackle rogue traders and remove licences from traders who are willing to supply drink either to under age drinkers who come into the store or to provide it to others who are willing to buy it for them, should be done.This is an enforcement issue. The Garda has the right to confiscate drink from under age drinking gangs but this has not been done at the level it should be done. If it were, it might help to address some of the problems of binge drinking and the thuggery that sometimes evolves from that. I would appreciate the Minister's endorsement of this amendment.

I met with the Minister's officials in the Department earlier today. I could be wrong but I thought this was already included in existing legislation and all that was needed was a ministerial order. If that is the case, we could probably sort this matter out very easily.
#MichaelMcDowellPD	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-party	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-16 00:00:00	Prelude	680	Deputy Deasy is correct. I am grateful to Deputy Costello for tabling this amendment. The position is that section 17 of the Intoxicating Liquor Act 2000 states:The name of the owner and the address of premises to which an on-licence or an off-licence is attached shall be clearly indicated on a label affixed to any container in which intoxicating liquor is sold for consumption off the premises.That section is not yet in force because the commencement order has not been made. A meeting took place between officials of my Department and the Garda representatives in relation to that matter. There are difficulties in relation to it which I should perhaps explain.First, it is not an offence at the moment for a 19 year old to go into an off-licence to buy a tray of cider and to go out and hand it to 14 year olds. No criminal offence is committed in those circumstances. It is not, in principle, an offence to supply an under age person with drink. If any of us had teenage children, we would be entitled to give them a drink in the house if we so wished or to give them a beer at a party or whatever. There is no generalised criminal offence in existence. We must be realistic about what can be achieved on this front.Second, it is my intention to bring to Government, and then to this House in the very near future, an intoxicating liquor Bill which will require persons purchasing drink, either on an on-licence or off-licence basis to prove their age  with a mandatory age identity card in the case of younger purchasers. In those circumstances from now on – and the off-licence trade has asked for this – it will be impossible for them to supply liquor, once that comes into effect, to an under age person by mistake because the person will have to produce an identity card as a precondition for purchasing liquor.The issue then moves on to what will be done to prevent 19 year olds from supplying 14 year olds. In that context it seems to me, and I would be interested the hear the views of others on this, that there should be a general offence in respect of a child, defined as somebody under the age of 18 years, of supplying them with intoxicating liquor without the consent of their parent, guardian or somebody acting in loco parentis. In such a case, a person who gives a tray of cider to a 14 year old commits a criminal offence unless he or she can prove it was done with the consent of the person who has responsibility for that child. If such an offence comes into play, the need for the provision in the 2000 Act will be greatly reduced but not completely eliminated. The question I have been considering is whether it is reasonable in the circumstances to require that the name and address of every off-licence and on-licence premises be printed on every bottle or can they supply. There are practical difficulties to which I want to draw the Deputy's attention. In the case of a six-pack, are they to break it open and stamp every bottle? Are they to rip open bubble-wrapped tins on a tray of beer cans and stamp every can before they sell it? There are many practical issues and we have to ask ourselves whether this is a good idea.Another problem is whether it is practical to require a name and address or if some kind of hallmark or symbol which is unique to the supplier would be better. It is not as easy as the Deputy might think. If a six-pack can be opened outside the off-licence premises, how can it be marked unless it is torn apart by the off-licensee or the publican in order to stamp every can? The intention was good in 2000, but it may not have been thought through to the Nth degree. I am well disposed towards the principle of it. Therefore, in the context of the forthcoming intoxicating liquor Bill I will accept any reasonable suggestion as to how a workable scheme could be put in place which indicates the source of a drink product found in the possession of a young person. In the context of supply onwards by an adult to a child, it could be of significant assistance to the Garda Síochána in at least establishing some kind of chain.Rather than reading on to the record the report of a meeting with the Garda on the issue I will undertake to make available to the Deputies opposite the distillation of that meeting, because it goes on for a number of pages. It spells out the kinds of difficulties about which I have been talking, and the practicalities as far as the Garda is concerned. It is an issue to which this House will return within a couple of months when we  will probably be able to arrive at a more satisfactory solution than the one which was found impractical in the 2000 Bill.
#JoeCostelloLAB	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-party	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-dob	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-16 00:00:00	Prelude	681	I thank the Minister for his reply. My problem with accepting what the Minister has said is that the provision has been in the legislation for a number of years and no attempt has been made by either the Minister or his predecessor to implement it or to deal with the difficulties and impracticalities of the issue. I am reluctant therefore to leave it as it stands and accept that at some time in the future it might be dealt with and the difficulties might be overcome. I intend to press this amendment. If the Minister introduced a mandatory identification card, that would be a bonus in terms of dealing with the situation of the normal off-sales purveyor. However, there are still rogue salespeople in that area and it would not deal with those.The question of a mandatory ID card raises other issues. We listened yesterday to spokespersons from the National Youth Federation and the National Youth Council of Ireland explaining their profound dissatisfaction with the proposal for a national ID card. They would much prefer to push in favour of a voluntary card, making it free – it is not quite free at present – and to campaign to encourage people to use the voluntary card. That is an issue that is controversial.On the question of 19 year olds supplying 14 year olds without parental consent, it would be worthwhile to deal with that in future legislation. Perhaps we should include something in that respect in this Bill.To get back to the difficulties of stamping, what are the practical difficulties of stamping a six-pack or tray of beer? If one looks at the various beers on the shelves in any off-license premises, one will find that one company packages its beer in a plastic covering while another uses a type of plastic holder. If all companies used plastic holders there would be no covering and each of the cans or bottles could be individually stamped.

With a holder it is possible to get to them all and they can all be marked. Currently, every item in a shop has a bar code which is put on at the wholesale or product level and it has to be scanned. It is not beyond the ability of the producers of drink to come up with some form of identification that is manageable. We have heard all the obstacles to doing this. I would much prefer to hear about the solutions. We have to have some labelling that is traceable. That could quite easily be done in respect of most of the beer that is currently being sold. It should not pose a problem.I do not know what problems the Garda have with it. I would have thought it would make its job easier if each can or bottle of beer had a label or a mark. I am not prepared to accept the Mini ster's argument or undertaking to address it at some future time. We have not addressed it to date. We should bite the bullet now and insert it in this legislation.

The Minister has explained the practical difficulties. I am willing to accept that explanation. If the Minister believes there are insurmountable practical difficulties, perhaps we should look at the minutes of the meeting and read what the Garda had to say. My party has been in favour of this for some time, but it might be more reasonable to take a look at that first and then deal with it in legislation. I would go along with that.

It is already in law and I could have pressed the button at any stage if I thought it would do much good. I will revisit the matter in the context of the intoxicating liquor Bill which I intend to publish and put through the Houses before the summer recess. At that stage we will assess the matter. I could easily sign the order commencing this, but it is something that has to be done in good conscience and the practical difficulties must be addressed – the ripping open of the bubble-packs, the tearing open of the six-packs and so on. Deputy Costello seems to think there is some way into the middle of a six-pack. I do not know what it would be unless it  was an adhesive label and that could be taken off. I cannot work out how to get into the interior of a six-pack to put on a mark, but maybe I am stupid.

There is individual barcoding on every product that goes through a shop. I do not see why we cannot insist on having an indelible mark put on by machine, by hand or by some form of barcoding. Can the Minister tell me that he or his predecessor has explored technical mechanisms to ensure that this could be done and found it would be impossible to do so?

In page 5, line 30, after "for" to insert "serious".This is a minor amendment that matches my earlier amendment. I want to introduce a general duty of care that would be clearly outlined in the legislation where the licensee could see straight away his or her responsibilities and that if he or she did not act accordingly that the sanctions are very tough – closure of the premises.I propose to strengthen the legislation by not leaving a word as subjective as "annoyance" as grounds for closure of premises. I propose that we insert "serious" so that the Bill reads, "reasonable cause for serious annoyance."  What annoys me might not annoy the Minister or he might have a lower tolerance level than me. It varies with age and circumstances and "annoyance" has any number of interpretations. Introducing the word "serious" would give this some strength. We do not want to impose the substantial sanction of closure on publicans and licensees without good cause. I am not the friend of the publican or licensee, they have not shouldered their responsibilities regarding legislation. If they had done so it would be much easier for us to ensure the maintenance of public order. We should, however, be careful about the way in which we frame our legislation and "serious" is an appropriate adjective in this case.

#BeverleyCooperFlynn	unknown-#BeverleyCooperFlynn-party	unknown-#BeverleyCooperFlynn-dob	unknown-#BeverleyCooperFlynn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-16 00:00:00	Prelude	699	I welcome the opportunity to speak on this important motion, especially because of the commitment by the Minster for Health and Children and the Minister of State, Deputy Tim O'Malley, to the whole area of cancer services. It is important that we recognise the huge and significant investment since 1997 in cancer services. More than €400 million has been spent on the development of services in this key area, especially in 2003, when €29 million is to be spent. Most people will recognise that significant improvements have been made country-wide as a result of this investment, particularly in the west. This is in no small part due to the Minister's commitment.Being a rural Deputy, I recognise that access to services, especially cancer services, is a huge issue. However, I also recognise that no service can be designed purely on the basis of geographical considerations, although these play a significant role. The Minister is aware of this. A number of years ago, when certain recommendations in a report suggested that the breast clinic at the Mayo General Hospital may have been at risk, the Minister was quick to reassure those in the west and especially those at the hospital, that the service would continue. It has continued and has since been enhanced, a development I welcome.Few issues are as important as the challenge posed by cancer to our health services. One in three of our citizens will develop cancer during the course of his or her lifetime, which puts the issue into context. As a member of the Western Health Board, I am very aware of this. All Members recognise it to be an important issue country-wide. Mortality rates in Ireland are higher than the European Union average, an issue that must be seriously addressed. We must continue to build on the improvements effected since the adoption of the national cancer strategy in 1996.A number of Deputies have mentioned that prevention is better than cure. This becomes apparent when consideration is given to the way in which funding of €400 million has been spent in the past number of years. I welcome the Government's investment in cancer prevention programmes, which has exceeded €17 million. The Minister is committed to anti-smoking measures and to considering the reasons for the high incidence of cancer in Ireland. We must recognise that lifestyle plays a huge part in this. Evidence supports this contention.We need to tackle the issue of smoking, which is the cause of a huge number of cancer-related deaths every year. Problems related to alcohol consumption must also be addressed. I fully support the Minister's proposals for dealing with smoking and I look forward to his plans for dealing with the problems associated with alcohol consumption.It is important that some of the funding of €400 million has been allocated to the creation of 80 additional consultant posts to deal with cancer services and support staff. This has resulted in a huge number of people receiving radiotherapy and chemotherapy services. There has been a 58% increase in radiotherapy and a 30% increase in chemotherapy services.As a woman, I commend the Minister on the recent extension nationwide of the BreastCheck programme. This is hugely beneficial for women. Over the past weeks many Deputies have tried to claim credit for the extension of the programme. The matter was extensively debated at the meeting last week of the Western Health Board, of which I am a member. We are fortunate in that the chief executive officer of the health board is the chairwoman of the National Breast Screening Board. She set the record straight, especially with regard to the Minister's commitment to this area. The Minister orchestrated the pilot programme, which proved to be so successful, and where the uptake in the service by women has increased by 75%. He also insisted on the programme becoming nationwide in conjunction with the national breast screening programme.

Since the report of the national cancer strategy in 1996, the previous and present Governments have invested unprecedented amounts of money in the provision of services for cancer, both for investigations and treatment. More than €400 million has been spent since 1997 and I find it demeaning to suggest that a service as vital as cancer care should be referred to as apartheid.

I wish to briefly allude to some of the important developments that have occurred since 1997. In excess of €39 million has been invested in the BreastCheck programme. The Minister's recent announcement of the extension of the service countrywide is welcome.The proposer of the motion knows that any new treatment modality should be fully evaluated before it is adopted. This evaluation has been done on the effectiveness of breast screening and, as a member of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Heath and Children, I was delighted the Minister acted so quickly on our recommendation, after we had heard from the chief executive officer and the medical director of BreastCheck that the programme should be extended nation-wide.It would be foolhardy in the extreme for any Government to spend enormous amounts of money on a programme that did not fulfil its expectations, hence the necessity to evaluate BreastCheck. The results were very positive.

The consultants in this field recommend that the optimum population base for the effective operation of this vital component of breast cancer care is a population of between 250,000 and 300,000 people. This is in keeping with best international practices. The investment of €30 million in this service is proof of the Government's determination to provide the citizens of this country with the best available treatment.The cancer consortium, established by the Minister, is a welcome development. Unfortunately, we do not know what causes cancer. An enormous level of research has been and is being carried out in this area all over the world. Certain facts have emerged. It may well be multi-factoral in aetiology, but more research is urgently needed. The decision to establish a trilateral partnership between the Republic, the Department of Health in Northern Ireland and the National Cancer Institute in the United States is one of the most innovative and important steps to uncovering the aetiology of cancer. I hope it will lead to its eventual elimination.Prostatic cancer is one of the most common cancers to affect males. A simple blood test, or prostatic specific antigen, is the best screening method available at present. I urge all males over 50 to take this test and the Papanicolaou smear which are available free of charge to anyone with a medical card. I urge everyone to avail of these very important investigations.In all its guises, cancer causes great morbidity and terrible mortality. This Government and the present Minister for Health and Children are committed to ensuring that our cancer services are of the highest standard in terms of prevention, early detection and effective treatment. Let us not engage in cheap publicity or headline hunt ing in the area of this awful disease. I commend the Government amendment to the House.
#PatCarey	unknown-#PatCarey-party	unknown-#PatCarey-dob	unknown-#PatCarey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-16 00:00:00	Prelude	716	I am very glad the Government has the chance to record the substantial developments in cancer services in recent years. I have read in detail the Opposition motion before the House and I acknowledge the right and obligation of Members to bring forward such motions. I acknowledge also the entitlement of the Government to make amendments.This House should congratulate the Government on its positive and verifiable commitment to cancer service provision. The Opposition is once again wheeling out the same old criticisms, complaining about what has not been done, arguing it would do more and ignoring the enormous steps this Government has made in the battle against cancer. I admit that we have a long way to go, but the continuous list of negative comments from the Opposition is unfair and fails to reflect the reality of what this and other Governments have achieved. The key aim of the national cancer strategy of 1996 was to achieve a 15% decrease in mortality from cancer among those in the under-65 age group in the ten year period from 1994. I am pleased to note that this target was achieved in 2001, three years ahead of time. How is this a failure by the Government? While it is an undeniably encouraging statistic, there is still much to achieve.The launch of the national cancer strategy in November 1996 marked the beginning of major developments in the treatment and care of patients with cancer. Since 1997, approximately €400 million has been invested in the development of cancer services which is well in excess of the £25 million initially envisaged in 1996. Of this sum, €29 million was allocated in 1993 alone. This investment will ensure that we continue to address increasing demands on cancer services in oncology-haematology services, oncology-drugs services and symptomatic breast disease services. This substantial development has enabled the funding of 80 additional consultant posts together with support staff in key areas such as medical oncology, radiology, palliative care, histo-pathology and haemotology.The benefit of this investment is reflected in the significant increase in activity we have seen. The number of new patients receiving radiotherapy treatment increased from over 2,000 in 1994 to almost 4,000 in 2000. An additional 1,407 patients are accessing these services which represents an increase of 58% nationally. The number of new patients receiving chemotherapy treatment increased from over 2,600 in 1994 to 3,500 in 2000, which represents an increase of 30% nationally. Breast cancer is the individual, site specific cancer which has received the most investment in recent years and in-patient breast cancer procedures have increased from about 1,300 in 1997 to nearly 2,000 in 2001. This is an increase of 37% nationally.Breast cancer is the cancer with which most of  us are most familiar. Since the implementation of the national cancer strategy, approval has been granted for an additional 39 consultant posts with a special interest in breast disease across the modalities of surgery, radiology and histopathology. A cumulative figure of approximately €39 million in revenue funding has been allocated to BreastCheck since 1999. The national breast screening programme was established in 1998 with the remit of reducing mortality from breast cancer by 20% over a ten year period by screening women in the 50 to 64 year age bracket every two years.The programme commenced in February 2000 with phase one covering the Eastern Regional Health Authority, the Midland Health Board and the North Eastern Health Board. Screening is offered free of charge to all women in the target age group. To the end of December 2002, the programme had invited over 110,000 eligible women and screened 83,000 with an uptake of 75%. The Opposition has ignored the success of the programme. I was delighted to hear of the recent national extension of the BreastCheck programme. Under the extension, approximately 130,000 women in the target population of 50 to 64 year olds will be eligible for screening. The programme expects to diagnose approximately 400 cancers per annum among the population.I commend the Minister for his dedication to providing the best cancer services. While there is no doubt that we have much to do in the future, the fact that a great deal has been achieved should not be ignored.

Members of this House have been lost to cancer since I was first elected. One in three will die of cancer, but everywhere one goes people say their area is worse hit than everywhere else. I fight often at health board and other levels to ask for doctoral students looking for ideas for their doctorates to conduct geographical surveys of factors outside obesity and alcohol and cigarette consumption. They should prove one way or the other what is happening in small areas.Early in my political career I was asked many questions by a local newspaper which wanted to know who was the person I would most like to meet. I replied that I wanted to meet the person who would invent the cure for cancer. It is incredible that in an age when hearts, livers and lungs can be transplanted, a little lump can be the end of many a person. We have spent much time on the issue of smoking in the Committee on Health and Children. It is beyond doubt that smoking is a serious contributory factor in the case of many cancers and I commend the Minister for Health and Children for his stance in this area and wish him continued success.The staff of the cancer support units are great as my family found when dealing with cancer.  Words cannot describe the kindness and tenderness of the people working at the Foyle Hospice. I wish the staff of the newly opened Letterkenny Hospice well, although the need for such a service is unfortunate. Carndonagh Community Hospital also has a hospice unit. The friends of the different hospitals are working hard to maximise Government supports. The air service links between Donegal and Dublin and Derry and Dublin provide cheap transport to people who would otherwise face a very long drive. I am glad these services can be brought back to the regions where possible.It would be a sad day on which we politicised the issue of cancer. There is hardly a person who has not been touched by it. I remember travelling with former Senator Mary Jackman and members of Europa Donna to Guy's Hospital in London at a time when we were talking about systematic breast disease services. Everybody was fighting his or her corner and demanding that the service be provided in his or her town or hospital. I was faced with a situation in which Sligo might have been chosen as the site of the service rather than Letterkenny because it was the site of the critical mass. The message from the consultants and the experts to me was that they did not want to see the issue politicised. The patient had to be the priority. That is the only message politicians need to take home. I was under political pressure to fight for Letterkenny, but I came home with a clear message from the experts which said the service must go to the place with the critical mass. Luckily, we were able to link with Altnagelvin in Derry to create an ongoing service.The cross-Border initiatives that have taken place are important. When I was first elected to the House, the national cancer study recommended that facilities be located in Galway and Dublin. I pointed out that I was 20 miles further from Galway than I was from Dublin because people assumed Donegal was next door to Galway. The interaction we have, be it with Belvoir Park in Belfast or any of the cancer services in the North is of benefit to us. I commend the cross-Border work and give it my full endorsement and support.Letterkenny hospital received eight extra beds in 2002 which are fully operational. We have a request for 18 more beds to support the new medical oncology and haematology specialities in the hospital. I would like to think that the Minister would be able to look positively on this. As well as the increase of eight beds, the hospital has seen an enhancement in radiology services with the picture archive communications system; improved out-patient facilities and medical rehabilitation units; the recruitment of radiography and laboratory staff; installation of pneumatic air tube systems; an X-ray ordering and viewing system to expedite the X-ray process; and improvements in triage. In addition, consultants in palliative medicine took up duty in 2002, the consultant radiologist replacement post was filled  and an additional consultant anaesthetist was appointed in 2002.There have been many advances but there is a long way to go. I appeal to Members not to politicise what is an important issue to many families in the country.
#SeanFleming	unknown-#SeanFleming-party	unknown-#SeanFleming-dob	unknown-#SeanFleming-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-16 00:00:00	Prelude	719	I am pleased to contribute to this debate. Cancer has unfortunately affected many families to date and will continue to affect more into the future. One of the main issues that has not been touched on sufficiently is prevention rather than cure. The Minister in his activities, especially his wish to extend the ban on smoking in the workplace, pubs and restaurants, is running into opposition. I would like those who oppose him to put the health care of the people who use their premises and their staff who work in them first on all occasions. It is important we reduce exposure to smoking because it can lead to cancer and cause many deaths.We have a great ability in Ireland to say we are in favour of reducing the incidence of smoking but, as soon as the Government proposes a substantial increase in the price of the packet of cigarettes, the social partners demand a substantial pay increase where it leads to an increase in inflation. Dealing with health must be put outside national pay talks because I am convinced the Minister should increase the price of cigarettes substantially in every budget, even though it has a knock-on effect on inflation. I appeal to the social partners to accept this in the interests of the health of their members. It might hit them in their pockets in the short-term, but will lead to lives being saved in the long-term if there is a substantial reduction in smoking over the years.Much discussion has taken place about BreastCheck which is being rolled out throughout the country. This is important for early detection. One matter that is not mentioned often and is important, especially in light of the fact that the majority of Members are males, is that we are always reluctant to talk about prostate cancer despite the fact that it is something that affects many families. It is not a topic people discuss. It is one of the silent issues. Men are reluctant to go to doctors and discuss these issues and, instead, put them off until a problem arises. It can happen that if one male in a family is hit with prostate cancer, it scares the others into getting checked out. I appeal to people to be more up-front on these issues in the way people are in other countries and to go for testing early. They should not put it to the back of their minds but rather should deal with it now.I acknowledge the tremendous investment in the health services in recent years. No one can deny it and I would not understand a person who would criticise the level of investment in this area. That said, further investment is required because we operate much higher health standards now than previously. The Minister acknowledged that  more resources are needed for radiotherapy services and these must be extended.There are two sides to the debate and one of the difficulties up to now is that, with politicians involved in health boards, the question of providing cancer services has been one of geography over and above patient care. In these issues geography is important because it is no good having a service 150 miles away as one cannot effectively avail of it. At the same time, it is important that patient care comes first in any such debate.I know in the midland region that more than 80% of people who suffered from cancer had to travel to Dublin for treatment whereas we are now moving to the position where 80% of people will be treated in the midland region. That is the way it should be. It means fewer people will have to travel long distances for small amounts of treatment and is more satisfactory from a patient's point of view.People must acknowledge that there has been substantial investment in this area, but more needs to be done as well. The party politics should be taken out of health because it is much too serious.

#MJNolan	unknown-#MJNolan-party	unknown-#MJNolan-dob	unknown-#MJNolan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-16 00:00:00	Prelude	727	I will give the Deputy an opportunity to speak and will not interrupt him, so I would ask him to have some manners.I support the calls made recently for smoking bans. They would go some way towards alleviating what has been identified as a contributory factor to lung cancer in particular.The Minister of State will be very aware of the huge cost of drugs, especially in the area of cancer treatment. Can savings be made in this area? I know that this and previous Governments have not been slow to invest in our health services. The area of cancer research and treatment is one that  costs the Department of Health and Children a great deal of money.I wish to acknowledge and record the huge amount of work and invaluable service hospice units give patients and also the amount of work done by home care teams and organisations. They run a very caring and professional operation. Any family affected by cancer will acknowledge the role of these organisations. The occasion should not pass without acknowledging the role these people play.There has been a great deal of controversy recently about the extension of radiotherapy units throughout the country. The south-east made a call and Waterford, in particular, feels aggrieved that such a unit has not been earmarked for Waterford Regional Hospital. While I support the call for a radiotherapy unit for the south-east as a representative from the area, I question whether Waterford is the ideal location for it. It is on the coast and, if one moves south of the city, one is into St. George's Channel. Perhaps a location like Kilkenny might be geographically better for the investment of a huge amount of money in one of these facilities.

#MJNolan	unknown-#MJNolan-party	unknown-#MJNolan-dob	unknown-#MJNolan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-16 00:00:00	Prelude	729	The Government has in recent years invested significant amounts of money in the health care area, especially in the cancer strategy. This was published in November 1996 and the strategy was set up with the aim of reorganising cancer treatment services and promoting a strong patient focus to ensure equality of access. It has met with considerable success in this regard. They have also identified the fact that resources should be devoted to screening and early detection. In that regard, I welcome the extension of breast screening to counties Carlow, Wexford, Waterford and south Tipperary. The establishment of the Ireland-Northern Ireland-NCI Cancer Consortium in October 1999 has been of great benefit. The expertise this group has drawn on has gone some way towards ensuring the early detection of cancer.Like other speakers, I call on the males of our society who seem to be slow to have examinations, particularly to detect cancer. Females seem to be far more likely to have themselves examined. Investment and funding are not the answer to the problem. There needs to be education as well.

#LizMcManus	unknown-#LizMcManus-party	unknown-#LizMcManus-dob	unknown-#LizMcManus-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-16 00:00:00	Prelude	732	I found it intriguing to listen to the two previous speakers, who suggested that health and politics should be separated. Deputy Nolan made this call and proceeded to make a strong argument to have a radiotherapy centre  relocated to his constituency. Deputy Fleming benefits from the fact that a previous Minister for Health and Children was in his general geographic area. I suggest that the two Deputies should examine the role of the Minister for Health and Children, his relationship with his constituency and his record concerning the appointment of people to boards that were within his gift before they start lecturing us.I warmly welcome this Private Members' motion by the Independent Deputies. It is supported by all the Opposition parties, including the Labour Party. In particular, I congratulate Deputy Cowley for his determination and dedication to this issue. I also commend Jane Bailey, who has been such a champion for good cancer care. The Labour Party supports this motion and the campaign surrounding it because it recognises that every family has been touched in some way by cancer. Cancer is a death sentence for some who contract it. For others it is a challenge to survive, overcome and battle against. Regardless of the outcome, every cancer patient needs the best care and treatment and the best possible chance for recovery that society can provide. It is regrettable that that is not what every cancer patient gets.A debate on the issue is necessary on a number of grounds. It is an opportunity to acknowledge the work of the health professionals, which is generally of the highest possible standard, and to acknowledge the support groups like Europa Donna and the Irish Cancer Society, which are extraordinarily dedicated. However, it is also an opportunity to highlight the deficiencies in the service which cause undue hardship and delay in treatment.The reality is grim for people who have to travel long journeys for radiotherapy that can take as little as ten minutes to receive. It is also grim for seriously ill public patients who wait months for treatment while private patients have speedy access to care. It is a reality that inspired hundreds of people to march on the streets of Dublin and thousands of people to march in Waterford in support of decent cancer care services.We marched for three key demands: the extension of breast cancer screening to the half of the population that does not have it; proper oncology services; and radiotherapy services to be easily accessible for patients regardless of where they live. The Minister for Health and Children took pre-emptive action on the first demand and announced that BreastCheck would be extended to the rest of the country. Many people, including myself, welcome the news. However, it is important that we see the Minister's statement for what it is.

#LizMcManus	unknown-#LizMcManus-party	unknown-#LizMcManus-dob	unknown-#LizMcManus-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-16 00:00:00	Prelude	734	It is essentially a restatement of his commitment to the extension of BreastCheck, and it has been stated many times in principle in the health strategy and parliamentary questions.  He made a similar commitment in his speech last night. However, there is no specific timeframe and not one cent is allocated for the project. We know how much it will cost but we do not know where the money will come from. Furthermore, there will be no additional money this year because the Taoiseach has made it clear that there will be no Supplementary Estimate for this purpose. Unless he takes the money from the already committed budget for cancer services, the Minister for Health and Children does not have a budget for BreastCheck this year.The women of Munster, Connacht and Ulster are no different from women on the east coast, yet it continues to be the case that their lives are being put at risk. More than 110,000 women have been screened already and there has been a 75% uptake where BreastCheck is currently in play. This is a tremendous vindication of the need for the service and an indication of the commitment and interest of women. However, one cannot provide a cancer screening service without money. We know that BreastCheck is of an excellent standard and it is certainly good value for money, but it does not run without funds. It is a question of whether the Government will produce the money swiftly to ensure that there is no delay.It would take €27 million to extend BreastCheck nationally, half the price of a Government jet. In Munster, it would cost about €11 million to introduce it, roughly the same amount of money the Minister has spent commissioning reports and setting up commissions since 1997.

#LizMcManus	unknown-#LizMcManus-party	unknown-#LizMcManus-dob	unknown-#LizMcManus-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-16 00:00:00	Prelude	736	Had this money been spent when it should have been, 268 women would have been detected through BreastCheck in Munster alone. Each year in Ireland, more than 600 women die from breast cancer. According to the evidence, early detection could and would have saved the lives of up to 20% of them.We will continue to press the Government on this issue. Since the general election, Government promises have been systematically broken. We were told there would be no cutbacks in health, that hospital waiting lists would end by the year 2004, that the ceiling for medical cards would be lifted and that the grave inequality within our health service would be addressed. None of these promises was kept. Instead, hospital beds are being closed, services to cancer and renal patients are being curtailed and community services, including services as diverse as psychological services and home help provision, are being slashed. The needs of people with disabilities in their special year are being brushed aside as there is no budget or new places.Why are we selecting the issue of cancer? We are doing so because it is so widespread and because so much can be done to help people survive cancer that is not being done. I welcome the  appointment of new hospital consultants. Their appointment shows that a targeted strategy can bring about benefits. I remind the Minister that this strategy was initiated by Michael Noonan when he was Minister for Health. Its success contrasts starkly with the failure of the Minister for Health and Children to spend other moneys within his budget either wisely or well. There is a lot more to do.There are questions to be asked of the Minister even in respect of current legislative provisions. The Public Health (Tobacco) Act 2002 provided for greater controls on the sale of cigarettes, yet there is little evidence of any of the measures being applied. Cigarettes are still displayed prominently as ever in shops and we are now hearing rumbles within Fianna Fáil against the Minister's long-promised commitment to ban smoking in pubs and restaurants. I, and other Members of the House no doubt, are inundated by pleas from interested groups and individuals who have simply lost faith in the Minister. We are anxiously pressing home the message that these measures are a vital part of the battle against cancer and that they must not be watered down. The Labour Party will continue to support these measures even as the Minister's own backbenchers conspire to undermine his ambitions.

#LizMcManus	unknown-#LizMcManus-party	unknown-#LizMcManus-dob	unknown-#LizMcManus-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-16 00:00:00	Prelude	738	We all know what is going on and there is no point in the Minister of State, Deputy Callely, arguing his case. It is important that we set down certain markers for the future. Three major reports have been withheld as a result of an ongoing internecine war between the Minister for Health and Children and the Minister for Finance over the future of our health service. One report was commissioned by the Minister for Finance and the other two by the Minister for Health and Children. I am sure Deputy McGuinness, in his paranoia, notes that the Brennan commission is headed by the wife of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy McDowell. Not one health professional working at the coalface is represented on or participating in that commission.When we get a right-wing agenda emerging not just from the Progressive Democrats but, in particular, from the Minister for Finance, there are many causes of concern and worry. We already see what the cutbacks are doing in terms of patient care. We can see that people suffering conditions like cancer are being forced to wait because the capacity in the hospitals is being reduced in order to meet the requirements of the cut backs that the Government has set, despite the great promises that were made to the Irish electorate.The people will not forget this. The people will not forget the fact that at the last general election Fianna Fáil went out and told them stories and fabrications that at the end of the day were nothing more than promises that could be set  aside, thrown aside and put away once the election was won.

Tugaim mo lán-thacaíocht don rún.I raised the matter of the urgent need for a radiotherapy unit at Waterford Regional Hospital on the Adjournment on Tuesday, 11 February. The previous Saturday there had been a report in The Irish Times indicating that the expert group on the future of radiotherapy services would recommend that service would only be provided in Dublin, Cork and Galway.Last weekend The Sunday Tribune carried a report which clearly stated that the newspaper had seen the expert group report. It went on to state that the report rejects the development of new radiotherapy services at Waterford and Limerick. It appears that the newspapers know the contents of the expert group report before the Minister does. In reply to the Adjournment debate in February, the Minister of State, Deputy Callely, stated, “I understand that the work of the expert review group is nearing completion and will be submitted to the Minister for Health and Children shortly.”  In his script last night, the Minister for Health and Children made no reference as to when the expert group report is to be submitted to him.However, he criticised the Opposition for engaging in opportunism even before they have had an opportunity to examine the report, see the essential principles that underpin its work and appreciate and reflect on the extensive benchmarking they have no doubt undertaken in relation to the provision of radiotherapy services in other countries. This statement by the Minister must take the accolade for this Dáil term in regard to brass neck. He is referring to a report which has taken longer to complete than the Old Testament. The Minister has been promising its imminent completion for well over two years. The Minister is asking the Opposition to suspend judgment until it has the report. Does this mean that the Minister intends to publish the report and allow for a full public debate before he goes to Government with recommendations which in all probability will be rejected by the Minister for Finance?The stalling of this report has been an utter disgrace. It is causing anger and frustration, not least in Waterford and the south-east region. It is causing great upset and sewing the seeds of despair. With regard to the south-east, if the expert group recommends a radiotherapy unit for Waterford the job then begins to press the Government for early delivery. If, as all the leaks indicate, the expert group recommends against a radiotherapy unit then the campaign in the south-east must  employ other ways of reaching an early successful conclusion.If, as The Sunday Tribune stated last week, the expert group reveals that the south-east region will have a population to justify the development of a four-machine unit within a decade or so, then now is the time to develop a unit rather than reacting to a much bigger crisis down the line. Waterford Regional Hospital already has chemotherapy and surgery available for the treatment of cancer. The Labour Party, in its election manifesto in 2002, proposed regional cancer centres, with the first in Waterford, and support services in large towns. The basic rationale was that the appropriate combination of treatment would be available to all patients close to home.I have raised in this House on previous occasions the fact that due to the lack of radiotherapy facilities at Waterford Regional Hospital, some breast cancer patients have opted for mastectomies. The same is true of at least one other health board area. It is absolutely unacceptable in any civilised society that women opt for mastectomies rather than spending long periods away from home receiving radiotherapy treatment in Dublin or Cork.Some 75% of breast cancer patients should receive radiotherapy but in the south-east only 48% received it. The latest figure which I have for new cancer patients in the south-east region is approximately 1,000, with 400 to 500 of these patients requiring radiotherapy services. Radiotherapy treatment is generally administered for short daily periods over a number of weeks. Treatment can be accessed by travel to and from the centre on a daily basis. This is a greater or lesser ordeal depending on distance. If the distance is too far then patients must stay in or near the centre. This is of course always contingent on places being available.Having to stay away from home is cruel and inhumane at a time when patients are at their most vulnerable and need their families and friends around them. I call upon the Minister to publish the expert group report and let the people discuss it and pass on their conclusions to him and his Department.
#WilliamPenrose	unknown-#WilliamPenrose-party	unknown-#WilliamPenrose-dob	unknown-#WilliamPenrose-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-16 00:00:00	Prelude	741	I compliment the Technical Group on bringing forward this motion and Deputy Cowley for pursuing it so vigorously. The national health strategy developed by the Government in 2001 promised us, "A health system that is there when you need it, that is fair, and that you can trust, a health system that encourages you to have your say, listens to you and ensures that your views are taken into account."  People in Westmeath have come to take such commitments by the Fianna Fáil/PD coalition Government with a large dose of salt.The deplorable story of Mullingar General Hospital highlights the reality that the national health strategy's aspirations were never intended to be fulfilled. In 1998, phase 2A of the Mullingar Hospital was completed and commissioned with  a new accident and emergency unit, an X-ray unit, an out-patient department and so on. The building also included a new five-storey block which, it was planned, would be fitted out to provide badly-needed extra beds and other facilities for this very busy hospital.Five years on there has been no action on this unused space. Overcrowding at the hospital can at times be severe and during winter months there are tremendous demands upon patients, doctors, nurses, attendants and everybody else. All we have got from the Minister is answers that obfuscate. Ask him for a timescale and one gets what I call departmental bromides purporting to be a ministerial response. The Minister should tell us when the money is coming, when the job is starting and how long it will take – three simple answers to three simple questions – rather than giving us obfuscation. I know what obfuscation is when I see it.The arrogant response of the Minister for Health and Children is in keeping with his stance on the development of hospital services in general and of radiotherapy services in particular. The vital importance of appropriate cancer treatment in Ireland is readily put in perspective by reference to a few established facts about cancer experience in our country. Nearly one quarter of all deaths in Ireland in 1999 were caused by cancer; Ireland has consistently had, since 1980, a much higher death rate from cancer than the EU average; and the rate of cancer deaths has been increasing steadily since 1950, when it was only 11 % of total deaths, and there is no evidence that this will change in the future.In such a context it is essential that our health care services for cancer patients especially be patient centred. The diagnosis that a member of a family has cancer is a great shock for both the patients concerned and for their families. Treatment can often be lengthy with unpleasant side effects and may involve surgery, radiotherapy and chemotherapy. People going through such a stressful experience need as much help as we can give them.When ill and needing treatment we all prefer to be treated as close to home as possible. This preference becomes an absolute necessity where cancer is concerned. Family support and a familiar environment can be vital factors in the recovery of cancer patients. For example, if a cancer patient needs radiotherapy treatment, the treatment may only take five minutes per day but may have to be repeated every day for a month, leaving patients feeling exhausted. Given the unpleasant side effects frequently associated with cancer treatment, long travel times to and from treatment will exacerbate a patient's distress and may delay recovery or, worse still, result in the patient abandoning the treatment.I have said that our health care services must be patient centred. What does this mean or imply where cancer treatment is concerned? It means in the first instance that patients, current or former,  must be involved in the decision processes when treatment facilities are being debated and decided. The National Cancer Forum, which advises the Minister for Health and Children on cancer services at present, includes a selection from the great and the good of cancer treatment professionals and some public servants but does not include, as it should, a significant number of lay persons with experience both directly or in their family of cancer. The national health strategy, in promising, "a health system that encourages you to have your say, listens to you, and ensures that your views are taken into account", was in fact taking the correct approach. What a pity that this approach was taken by a cynical Government which did not intend to deliver on this and other commitments.Much of the public discussion to date on cancer treatment has focused on how many centres should provide treatment. The medical profession involved in cancer specialties seems to favour fewer and larger treatment centres despite patients' needs for easy hospital access. The report on breast cancer services by the sub-committee chaired by Professor O'Higgins suggests that patients' need for easy access can be addressed by subsidising their travel, by laying on an organised transport service or by using support groups to provide voluntary arrangements. This smacks of a "let them eat cake" approach and is an unacceptable solution to the distressing predicament of cancer patients and their families. The case being advanced for larger and fewer hospitals and specialist units is not patient centred but is arguably centred on hospitals as power centres. There is no economic evidence that larger hospitals or specialist units are more cost effective than smaller ones. There is no incontrovertible clinical evidence, adequately adjusted for case mix, that large hospitals and units always lead to better patient outcomes.Whatever the technical, clinical and economic arguments, the approach which must be adopted is to put patients' needs first and develop policy around those needs. For example, rather than make traumatised cancer patients travel a distance for their treatment, let us provide more regional treatment facilities, as Deputy O'Shea said, and support these with travelling doctors, if necessary, and with tele-medicine, where appropriate. This area needs resources and instead of giving tax cuts to the rich, let us put the money where it is needed and look after people who require these services.

#ArthurMorganSF	unknown-#ArthurMorganSF-party	unknown-#ArthurMorganSF-dob	unknown-#ArthurMorganSF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-16 00:00:00	Prelude	744	I commend the Technical Group, particularly Deputy Cowley, on introducing this motion. I am sure every Member of this House has experienced the pain and trauma associated  with cancer and the turmoil it causes to a family and, indeed, to a community when word goes out that somebody has cancer. Fear and terror are probably the emotions most to the fore at such times.Imagine then the additional worry and concern of cancer victims when they discover that there are very poor facilities available to treat them. It is bad enough if one lives in Dublin, although hard luck if one arrives at St. Luke's Hospital, the only specialist cancer hospital in the State, to find that one cannot be treated with radiotherapy because of the €1 million cut in the hospital's budget this year. There is a €1 million cut when it should be getting millions in budgetary increases. If one is from outside Dublin, especially if one lives along the western seaboard, then one's goose is truly cooked.When we debate this issue, it is difficult to imagine the trauma and pain without looking at some cases. I noted Deputy Cowley spoke about a particular individual. I had a very good friend, Alan Mullen, who was diagnosed with cancer and given one month to live. When he went to Beaumont Hospital for chemotherapy, not only was there not a stand on which to hang the chemotherapy medicine bag – he had to place it on a window sill above his head in an overcrowded room with other chemotherapy patients – he had to bring his own cushion with him because when he sat on the hard plastic seats, the pressure of his weight on his bones hurt him. That is the reality for patients in this traumatic situation and the level of treatment which these people who are dying receive. Unfortunately, he died three months later. The treatment he received at the hands of the medical services left little with which he could be impressed.I acknowledge the 70 oncology appointments the Minister has made which, although welcome, are not nearly enough. I readily accept that other Members represent constituencies which are far worse off in terms of facilities or, at least, in terms of distance from facilities than the one I represent but none represents constituencies with cancer rates higher than County Louth. I heard a Deputy from the Government benches state that everybody thinks their area is the worst and has the highest cancer figures which I have no doubt is probably true but, unfortunately, my county is in the dreadful position of having statistical support for that claim. The National Cancer Registry figures for 1999 yet again verify that Louth cancer rates are increasing and continue to be 12% to 13% above the national average. In case people wonder why that is, I will outline the reason.Our people are being poisoned by the nuclear reprocessing plant in Cumbria and this Government is doing little or nothing about it. According to the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland, radiation levels on the County Louth coast are 150 times higher than those on the west coast. This Government and successive Governments have been quite literally criminally negligent in allowing the THORP plant to be com missioned when they could have brought a court case to Europe to prevent it. That job was left to four individuals in County Louth who are doing that job for the Government and who are pursuing it for its neglect in this instance.People in Louth who live with the current unacceptable cancer rates in the county despair that they are now faced with an incinerator that will, undoubtedly, pose a serious health risk to at least 100,000 people living in Drogheda, which is now the biggest town in Ireland, and in the Balbriggan, north Dublin and County Meath areas. These incinerators continually release cancer-causing dioxins into the atmosphere.The fight against cancer is a multi-billion euro industry and when one sees money like that, one can be sure there will be vipers in the wings. Sure enough, the pharmaceutical industry is hoovering up those millions of euro. I am not convinced the pharmaceutical industry is playing the part it should in trying to find a solution to the cancer plague affecting so many of our people.The National Cancer Registry's figures are running four years in arrears. The most up to date figures, which are due to be published in June, only bring us as far as 1999 – so much for having an up to date picture of the cancer endemic in this country.
#MartinFerrisSF	unknown-#MartinFerrisSF-party	unknown-#MartinFerrisSF-dob	unknown-#MartinFerrisSF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-16 00:00:00	Prelude	745	In supporting this motion and the fact it has drawn attention to issues which are relevant throughout the State, I would like to focus on some which are specific to my own county of Kerry. In 2001, the Irish Cancer Society report referred to Kerry as one of the worst affected parts of the country with nearly 900 people being diagnosed with the disease each year. Yet the county also experiences serious difficulties in regard to access to services. At present there are fears that even the current level of services may be under grave threat given the financial constraints under which the Department is operating.Many of my constituents are concerned that in this environment, the cancer treatment services in Tralee General Hospital may come under threat if the hospital is forced to make more cutbacks. The Minister assured me in reply to a question I tabled recently that the national task force on medical staffing will make no specific recommendation regarding cuts to Tralee. I welcome that assurance yet last week there was an announcement that Tralee would lose 30 beds for the summer months as well as curtailing elective surgery and out-patient services. What guarantees are there that these services will be restored? I am not doubting the Minister's word on the specific matter of the report of the task force but it proves hospitals are under immense pressure and that while cuts may not be part of the policy or the strategic objectives, they may be forced on the hospitals due to lack of funds.It is in this context that many people, including members of staff, are worried that cancer services at Tralee may also come under threat. There are also concerns about the future of the oncology  unit which was established in 1999 and which is now operating at full capacity. There have been assurances that the services will not be affected but will the increase on demand be met if funding is not available?At present Tralee shares a palliative care consultant with Bantry General Hospital and Marymount Hospice in Cork. Support staff were to be put in place from January 2003. A needs assessment report will be presented to the Southern Health Board tomorrow. The Kerry Hospice has offered to match funds to ensure that the necessary dedicated beds and services are made available, so people will be watching intently to see whether the health board is able to provide its share of the funding.I appreciate that the health board is under considerable pressure and, at times, is forced to make difficult decisions when the ultimate responsibility lies with central Government and its failure to provide adequate funding. A good example of this is that in September 2002, the Southern Health Board approved the appointment of an additional surgeon with special expertise in treating breast cancer. It called on the Minister to approve it and make the funding available last January but this has not yet happened. There is a temporary third surgeon, but this is not the post recommended by the board. The post is being paid for with money from the waiting list initiative.The same question arises regarding the BreastCheck programme, which is generally regarded asa significant asset in the fight against cancer in women. People in Kerry have been demanding that the service be extended to the county, but to no avail, so far. An expansion of the programme has been promised for 2005, but what confidence can we have that this will take place if, as appears to be the case, the current climate of fiscal rectitude continues?I would also like to raise the concerns that people have regarding cervical smear tests. The present arrangement, whereby samples are sent to a laboratory in County Antrim, has proven to be a significant help. It has served to cut back significantly the amount of time that people are forced to spend on waiting lists. It is a poor substitute for a national screening programme with access to all the necessary facilities, however. It is a good example of the ad hoc manner in which too many of our services are forced to operate, given the current resource constraints.Another issue which requires urgent attention is the need to update and increase radiotherapy services. An expert working group, which was established in 2000 to examine the area, has yet to publish its report. It is essential that this work be completed to evaluate properly the current situation, to plan for the future and to ensure that a significant number of those who are recommended for radiotherapy can access such treatment. St. Luke's Hospital in Dublin, which is a  leading radiotherapy centre, is encountering increasing pressure to meet the demand for services. What is being done to address this situation in terms of new investment and the recruitment of trained staff? The deficiencies in the latter respects are highlighted by the fact that the new unit at University College Hospital, Galway, which will be ready for occupation at the end of the summer, will not be able to operate for another three years due to a lack of staff. This scandalous situation not only highlights the lack of funding, but also the lack of foresight and planning in the Department.
#TrevorSargent	unknown-#TrevorSargent-party	unknown-#TrevorSargent-dob	unknown-#TrevorSargent-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-16 00:00:00	Prelude	746	Ba mhaith liom buíochas a gabháil leis an Teachta Ferris as ucht a chuid ama a roinnt liom. I thank Deputy Cowley and my Independent colleagues in the Technical Group for bringing forward this motion on cancer care services, which the Green Party wholeheartedly supports. It is vital that the cancer epidemic – it is right to call it an epidemic – in this country should be taken seriously by the Government. Many families, including my own, are not unaffected by cancer. It is important in this debate that we direct our attention at those areas where needs are not being met and not being highlighted.The Minister and his colleagues have claimed that significant amounts of money are being spent. While this is true, it is also true that significant amounts of money are needed. Members of the Government parties have acknowledged that more money should be provided, as the rate of cancer is increasing at an alarming rate. Money needs to be spent in a number of areas where it is badly needed, including research. The effects of electromagnetic radiation and various other dietary matters need to be investigated. There is no doubt that funding is necessary for prevention. Investment in the BreastCheck programme, which has been mentioned by many speakers, is badly needed to prevent the worst excesses of breast cancer and other cancers. There is also a need, as Deputy Cowley and others have mentioned, to invest in further treatment. The hospice movement also needs to be supported. I have helped to raise funds for St. Francis's Hospice in Raheny on many occasions. It seems that a great deal of fund-raising is ongoing to help the provision of cancer services.While a number of Deputies have spoken about BreastCheck, I wish to speak about prostate cancer, something that has not been mentioned to such a great extent. There is no "ProstateCheck", as such, but I think it is needed. Deputies who read the magazine with The Sunday Times last Sunday will have learned that 90% of men in the United Kingdom do not know what the prostate is, never mind what it does. One third of British men will have developed prostate cancer by the age of 50. Such figures alarmed me when I read them. Figures relating to Ireland, which I found on the Internet, show that the rate of prostate cancer in this country is higher than  in Britain, Northern Ireland or the EU average. There is no doubt that there is a clear need for mass screening to save the lives of those who are threatened by prostate cancer.The famous digital rectal examination method of detecting prostate cancer is regularly referred to and may sound impressive, if that is the right word, but it is certainly not very effective. When one reads documentation relating to this area, one discovers that a prostate-specific antigen test can be taken using blood samples. This is a real example of a question of cost, however, as the cost of the DRE test is the same as the cost of a rubber glove, whereas the cost of the PSA test is £181 in the UK. There is no doubt that money counts in this regard. Those on the Government benches who say that it is not a matter of money, but a matter of awareness, are being quite flippant about it. Money is quite critical in the detection, or otherwise, of cancer at an early stage. Approximately 1,130 men develop prostate cancer in Ireland each year. It accounts for about 11% of all cancers affecting males and is the most prevalent cancer, other than skin cancer, according to the figures I saw on the Internet today. About 500 men die as a result of prostate cancer each year. It is worrying that a growing number of younger men are developing prostate cancer.I appreciate the work of the national cancer registry, as a result of which we can acquire the figures I have mentioned. Although the registry has been operating for just seven years, its figures have helped us to become aware that there is an increased incidence of cancer. It may be that the increase has been caused by Sellafield, pesticides or dietary changes. The concerns mentioned by Deputy Morgan regarding County Louth are shared in north Dublin. The proposed incinerator near Duleek is a further concern in that regard. The Government must recognise, ultimately, that this is not just a case of treatment and research, because a level of awareness that does not exist at present is needed. I ask the Government to provide the funding that is needed to fight prostate cancer and breast cancer. Awareness among men of the problems of prostate cancer needs to be increased to the level that exists, rightly, among women in the case of breast cancer and other cancers.

In particular, he mentioned the difficulties of the Government and the Minister, who are running to stand still as a result of the extent and the nature of this problem. The Minister chose to misrepresent much of what my colleague said in his contribution. In pointing out the nature of the problems caused by cancer, he was not ignoring the central argument of this motion, that the distribution of resources determines whether people receive proper cancer treatment in this country. We know that lifestyle, environment and genetic disposition are factors, but the geographical  location and economic status are the biggest factors in determining whether an Irish person will survive an incidence of cancer.

I am convinced that this success resulted from the fact that the person involved had access to private medical insurance. I say that as someone who has chosen not to invest in private medical insurance, despite the fact that all other members of my family have taken that route. Perhaps I will change my mind about this matter when I look back on it in later years. I have a personal sense of discomfort that a health system has to be backed up by people buying insurance for services that the State should adequately provide. This is at the heart of the proposed motion.The situation in Cork, where the Minister and I come from, needs to be recognised. Other speakers have talked about the national cancer registry figures for Counties Dublin and Louth. County Cork is also in that category of being above the national average. While there might be anecdotal evidence as to the reasons for the high incidence of cancer on the east coast, there has been no attempt to survey why cancer exists—

The Minister for Health and Children gave an excellent account of himself last night and I do not need to repeat what he said. The key goal of the strategy in 1996 was to achieve a 15% decrease in mortality from cancer in the under-65 age group in the ten year period from 1994. As the Minister advised the House last night, this figure was achieved in 2001, three years ahead of target.

I welcome Deputy Gormley's contribution last night and many other speakers who welcomed the fact that we must concentrate on preventive measures. The Minister has demonstrated his commitment with the establishment on a statutory basis of the Office of Tobacco Control. The Minister today launched the second national survey of lifestyle, attitudes and nutrition called SLÁN. This survey has highlighted positive trends. One of the key pertinent findings was the decline in the number of Irish persons currently smoking. At the time of the last survey, 31% of the population engaged in cigarette smoking and it is now reported to be down by 4% to 27%. The rates of cigarette smoking have declined across virtually every demographic category. The statistics are in the report and in the statement I have circulated to Members. It is very important to build on this momentum by banning the use of cigarettes in licensed premises and other places of entertainment. That is vital if we are to give further critical mass to this issue.The future development of radiotherapy services—

During the debate in the Seanad this afternoon and in this House, the development of radiotherapy services was a particular and understandable focus of debate. There is general agreement on all sides that our radiotherapy services need to be expanded to meet current and future demand. We await the imminent report with great interest. We must be informed by the expert analysis, the international benchmarking and the recommendations of the expert report. We are coming from a very low base. I can appreciate why Deputies say it is terrible for any patient from rural Ireland to have to travel to Dublin for treatment. However, we cannot establish this service in every provincial location; it will not be the solution recommended to us by the experts. The patient must come first and ahead of any local sectional medical interest or local medical establishment. We have to provide a top class service in provincial areas. Northern Ireland has only one radiotherapy service.

I speak in support of the motion and specifically to address the issue of the radiotherapy unit in Galway. I wholeheartedly welcome the fact that the radiotherapy unit is being provided in Galway as referred to in the Minister's speech last night.I note with alarm that the Minister made no reference to the section of the motion stating:"That the Government is negligent in refusing to allow staff recruitment commence for the Galway radiotherapy unit, with the result that it will be 2006 before the unit treats patients."That has come about because the Western Health Board requested approval from the Department of Health and Children in 2001 to commence the recruitment of staff for the radiotherapy unit and that approval was refused. We are three years from 2006. The unit will be completed in July or August this year. Millions of euro of taxpayers' money has been invested in a building which will become a white elephant until 2006. I invite the Minister to clarify this unacceptable situation. Will the Minister confirm the date of completion of the unit, the planned opening date, whether the relevant staff have been recruited and when the first patients will be treated in the unit?I ask the Minister to set out clearly the date for the commencement of the BreastCheck programme in the west. Last night the Minister again  announced the roll-out of BreastCheck but he gave no commencement date.

This is an important move for the future of primary care in our county. I also acknowledge the hope for the future of all Irish women now that BreastCheck has finally been extended nationwide. The Minister's commitment to reducing the risk of passive smoking to workers in the hospitality industry will be supported by those of us who would rather see people live healthy lives than successfully sue their employers in years to come for exposing them to the known health hazards of passive smoking. This would certainly form the basis of a class action if one was to be taken.The Minister is far more likely to read negative remarks about the Public Health Act from his own backbenchers. The Minister can rest assured that despite all the manufactured crises we have seen in this Dáil, nobody will vote against him.This motion is about the lack of cancer services because there is still a significant weakness in the provision of these services, despite what the Government has stated tonight. There has been progress but we have also seen substantial improvements in the design of cars over the last 30 years. Improvement in health care should be expected, not seen as some fantastic achievement.

Indications are that the report believes that by 2010 we will have the population numbers to justify a radiotherapy unit. It would take the next seven years to establish this unit if we started today. There has been much talk about the multi-disciplinary approach. We have the surgeons, oncologists, palliative care team and haematologists available in the south-east. We have all that is needed to set up the multi-disciplinary approach. All we need is the radiotherapy unit. Even a commitment to set up a unit would be good enough for the people of the south-east at this stage. If the Minister believes in providing a comprehensive cancer service, he will be very supportive of this suggestion and not try to play it down with talk of case mix and population numbers. He should act in a proactive manner.Last night the Minister challenged some of us on this side of the House by saying he would like to arrange a meeting with the expert review group. I would like to take up that opportunity. I ask him tonight to arrange this meeting with people from this side of the House, including some of the experts to whom I have spoken. I  have not reached this conclusion on my own. I spoke to experts in the field who said there is enough of a case mix in the south-east to justify the unit. This is not something I pulled out of my head to make political capital, it is something we have discussed. I would be more than delighted to take up the Minister's offer to meet the expert review group. The only people who cannot bring themselves to give a fair chance to the people of the south-east is the Government. They are the only people who seem to say that we are asking for too much.Last night the Minister implied that medical people like myself and Deputy Cowley are more interested in politics and geography than in the health services. It would be more appropriate for him to defend his policies than participating in this type of misrepresentation.

Perhaps the Minister believes the spin himself because there was a very interesting sentence in his speech last night. He said that too often it is left to politicians to respond to pressure to pursue the organisation of services – reading between the lines, this means cutbacks – based on sectional interests and not on best practice. These are the same politicians who have problems reforming health boards or partake in this underhand method of reducing hospital services in the north-east. I have seen nothing proactive about politicians since I came into politics.Some of my patients who travel to Dublin must take a train to Dublin and a bus to St. Luke's Hospital because they are denied hardship payments for taxis to and from the train station. These people suffer from tiredness, lack of energy, nausea and vomiting. These cancer victims must often go back to work sooner than they would like because the maximum disability payment is €130 per week. No one can survive on that money, particularly if they are trying to support a young family.No matter what we have heard tonight, there is apartheid in the health services. There is apartheid between urban areas and the regions and between those who are well off and those who are not. I do not care what people say about taking politics out of cancer treatment; if we leave things as they are people will die at an unmerciful rate. We must acknowledge that there is a huge problem in this area and I would like to have heard more proactive comments from the backbenches than I heard earlier on. No doubt some of these backbenchers will go back home to their constituencies playing the game that everything is fine.

Last  night the Minister described the motion as an "all kinds of everything" motion but, of course, this is a well known ploy. The deliberate use of words or phrases to downgrade or dismiss the motion allowed the Minister to try to excuse himself from addressing the very substantive and serious issues raised in what I consider to be a very carefully considered and well thought-out motion. However, we cannot allow that to happen because, in the final analysis, the buck stops with the Minister. He has the full and final responsibility for delivering our cancer care services. As this motion clearly illustrates, the service falls well short of what it should be. The reality of cancer care in Ireland is that we are one of the richest countries in Europe, yet we have one of the worst outcomes for cancer patients. While the Minister has made some progress, it is too little, too late, for too many people.In his reply last night he admitted that there is scope for some improvement in our mortality rates in line with other EU countries. That sounds like something one would see in a school report – there is scope for improvement; must do better – C minus. As one of the wealthiest countries in Europe, we should be achieving an A grade.The Minister also said last night that the number of new patients receiving radiotherapy treatment had increased by 58%. However, as he said this evening, we were starting from a very low base. Even with that increase, we are still way behind the numbers that need to access radiotherapy. In Ireland approximately one in five patients accesses radiotherapy. The Minister referred a number of times last night to best practice at international level, yet international figures suggest that one in two will benefit from radiotherapy. This means that many cancer patients who need radiotherapy will not get it. Telling these people about a 58% increase is of little use. Telling people in the west and north-west who suffer from cancer that the radiotherapy service due to be finished in Galway this summer will not open until 2006 is not good news. If he really wants to allay the fears of women in the west, north-west and other regions about the BreastCheck service, will he please tell them now when the service will be in place, how much it will cost and when it will be funded?The Minister accused those of us who support the motion of wanting to please everyone politically and forgetting about quality patient survival rates and outcomes. In other words, he accused us of making this a political football and of having no concern for patients. That statement is unacceptable from the Minister, but it indicates a trend. Just one week ago, when the Minister for Education and Science was responding to the motion on cutbacks in expenditure in the school building programme, he also said the motion was politically motivated. The theme seems to be that when one has to answer difficult questions and account for one's stewardship as a Minister, one should just accuse the Opposition of political  opportunism. That does not let the Minister off the hook because, as I said earlier, he has the responsibility to deliver cancer care services. This motion points out that many of the services are inadequate and all we are asking is for him to deliver proper services.

#JerryCowleyIND	unknown-#JerryCowleyIND-party	unknown-#JerryCowleyIND-dob	unknown-#JerryCowleyIND-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-16 00:00:00	Prelude	782	This motion is about people, not politics. To say otherwise is a terrible insult to the people who proposed it. I thank my Independent colleagues, the Technical Group and the other Opposition parties for their support and co-operation. If things were right, the Government would also support the motion.I was intrigued to hear someone say the Minister acquitted himself well last night. I do not agree. He spoke about all the investment in cancer care. As evidence of this he quoted the significant increase in the numbers of new patients per annum receiving radiotherapy. He quoted an increase from 2,402 in 1994 to 3,809 in 2000 but he did not have the figures for 2001 or 2002. He said we should not worry about that because it will be okay. It is not okay because at least 7,000 new cancer patients each year need radiotherapy. It is absolutely unacceptable for the Minister to cite the wonderful increase in figures. He spoke about the oncologists who are being appointed, which I welcome. However, there is just one radiation oncologist for the whole south-east area and north Dublin, covering a population of 600,000. There are not sufficient oncology beds, nurses or other staff.We have eight radiation oncologists for the entire country, Belfast alone has 12 and Holland has 157. Given that Holland has four times our population, we should have 40 such posts at that rate. Brilliant young radiation oncologists are being trained for export. They are going abroad because they cannot get jobs at home. People are dying as a result and the Minister should address this issue.I welcome the Minister's statement that there is not proper access to radiotherapy, because it is a start at least. He is trying to defend the indefensible by trying to justify the current centralised service. As I pointed out last night, the National Cancer Registry showed no reduction in the mortality rate, that older people are not being treated for cancer and a large percentage of people are not getting cancer treatment at all.Health apartheid exists throughout the country. Cancer care apartheid exists in Ballymun, Ballycroy, Tallaght and so on. One must wait for three months for treatment unless one has money. My patient died waiting for a letter in the post which never came. This is a disgrace for which the Minister is responsible. He speaks about multi-disciplinary units, with which I agree. Despite the money the Minister claims to have spent, these multi-disciplinary units do not exist. However, they should exist. He put money into  breast cancer, with which I agree, but he should do the same for bowel and prostate cancer.Cancer figures in Ireland will double in the next 20 years. Given the inadequate services which currently exist, how will we deal with a doubling of cancer statistics within 20 years? Unless the Minister provides a multi-annual programme for cancer care, we will not be at the races. We cannot cope currently and we will not be able to cope in the future unless the Minister takes action. The Minister allocated €23.5 million to the development of cancer services, to be divided among 11 health boards, while €160 million was allocated to sport. The Taoiseach is talking about spending €350 million to €500 million on Stadium Ireland. It is a total and utter disgrace.The Minister has had the cheek to say that the debate has been about geography, not the quality  of service. That is rubbish. There are models available. There is a model in Norway and there is one in Ireland in the Mater Private Hospital. The Minister says it is nonsense and political fodder to be talking about two machines in Waterford. There are already two machines in the Mater Private Hospital. The people of Waterford would love to have the service.For less than half of the €200 million for the plan, the Minister could have all these things locally. He could save this money and get 50:50 cash back. The €400 million of cumulative costs is utter nonsense – it is a fabrication. Every surgeon that ever put a knife into anyone with cancer is included in that, as are the nurses and palliative carers.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-16 00:00:00	Prelude	783	No, it is additional.
#TomKitt	unknown-#TomKitt-party	unknown-#TomKitt-dob	unknown-#TomKitt-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-16 00:00:00	Prelude	784	I welcome this opportunity to debate once again the humanitarian situation in Iraq. It is important that this House should continue to pay close attention to one of the most critical challenges on the international agenda at present. While the intensive military phase has abated, it is clear that a humanitarian crisis of massive proportions is unfolding in Iraq with each passing day. Millions of innocent Iraqi people are suffering from the effects of the conflict, from hunger and water shortages and from deprivation of other kinds. There are large numbers of civilian dead. As hospitals struggle to cope, misery continues for those wounded in the conflict. The spectre of disease looms. In short, the humanitarian crisis being suffered by the people of Iraq is unimaginable.The most immediate priority is to facilitate access for humanitarian workers. Clearly the restoration of law and order is of critical importance. Another vital priority is to secure the restoration of water and power supplies throughout the country. There is an urgent need for food and medicine in large quantities.In any conflict the primary responsibility for the protection and welfare of the civilian population rests with the warring parties. In a case of foreign occupation it is the occupying power that has the responsibility to ensure the provision of food and medical supplies to the civilian population. I would like to see a safe and secure environment created as soon as possible which will enable badly needed aid to be delivered to those who need it most.The Red Cross and UNICEF, two international organisations with which we are co-operating closely, are performing heroically on the ground in the most difficult circumstances. Operating mainly with national Iraqi staff, they have proved by their actions in the past three weeks that they are the best equipped and have the requisite capacity and experience to respond effectively to this crisis. The Red Cross is working hard with the coalition forces and civilian administrators to achieve conditions which will facilitate the massive relief operation which is now required.The staff of humanitarian agencies such as the Red Cross and UNICEF have put their lives at risk on a daily basis in selflessly responding to the needs of the most vulnerable people. I pay particular tribute to Mr. Vatche Arslanian, the chief of logistics for the Red Cross in Baghdad, who was killed in crossfire on 9 April.UNICEF is continuing to implement emergency relief operations within Iraq, carried out by committed and experienced Iraqi nationals. It is delivering food, water and medicines to hospitals, orphanages and other institutions in Baghdad and Basra. It is co-ordinating closely with the Red Cross and other agencies and organisations.Other key partners for the Government in our response to this humanitarian crisis are Irish NGOs such as Concern, GOAL and Trócaire. These NGOs have a proven track record for delivering emergency assistance rapidly and effectively. We are supporting the vital work which they will be carrying out on the ground as they become operational. Key priorities for them will be the provision of emergency support for health services, water and sanitation, food aid and support for internally displaced persons.In my discussions with these NGOs and others I have stressed the need for effective co-ordination to maximise the value of our assistance. They will be working closely with partner organisations within Iraq and with the relevant UN agencies. Trócaire is currently operating in Iraq through its partner Caritas Iraq, Concern will be operating in northern Iraq with a number of local partners, and GOAL will be working with the  World Food Programme on emergency food distribution.Iraq is facing severe food shortages. Prior to the beginning of the current conflict, 60% of the Iraqi population – 16 million people – were dependent on rations delivered under the UN Oil for Food Programme, OFFP, as their only food supply. The suspension of this programme on 17 March, when the UN Secretary General withdrew United Nations personnel from Iraq, put even greater pressures on an already extremely vulnerable population. Although Resolution 1472, adopted by the Security Council on 28 March, gave the UN Secretary General the flexibility to prioritise contracts under the Oil for Food Programme to help meet immediate humanitarian needs, this programme is still not back in operation. Latest figures indicate that household food stocks in some areas will be exhausted by the end of April. It is vital to have this programme up and running within a very short timeframe.There has been some limited progress. For example, food deliveries have resumed in three northern governorates where the security assessment is relatively favourable. In other areas of the country, however, looting of food stores has been a problem for the WFP. Within this difficult environment I hope that the programme can be resumed in all areas as quickly as possible. It will be a race against time to ensure that basic food reaches those who are in greatest need at present. Resumption of this programme can only happen, however, if a secure environment exists to permit the safe delivery of this food.A point which is sometimes lost sight of is that what we are witnessing in Iraq at present comes on top of years of hardship and difficulty suffered by the Iraqi people. Since 1991 the people of Iraq have seen a dramatic drop in their living standards. In the league table that measures quality of life – the Human Development Index, HDI – Iraq fell from 96th place to 127th place in a little over ten years. No country has fallen so far so rapidly. This deterioration is translated at the basic human level into increased child deaths, malnutrition and high rates of disease. Iraqi children have suffered greatly and are still facing extreme risks at this time. A number of highly publicised cases have appeared on our television screens over the past week, but there are countless more. Children constitute half of the population of Iraq and are clearly one of the most vulnerable groups.Another priority concern for us will be the many Iraqi people who have been displaced by the conflict. The latest indications are that the majority of people in the south have remained in their homes rather than fleeing to safer areas either within the country or to neighbouring states. The majority of internally displaced people in the north are now returning to their homes. We will be maintaining close contact with the UNHCR in relation to the movement of internally displaced people over the coming weeks and  will be considering what has to be done to address their needs.From the outset of this crisis, I have worked closely with Irish NGOs and the key international organisations to shape the Government's response. On 25 March I announced a special €5 million emergency assistance package for the people of Iraq, with particular emphasis on women and children. This announcement, coming within a few days of the start of the military campaign, was one of the first to be made by any Government. Initial funding of €1.5 million from this package was provided through UNICEF and the Red Cross. Yesterday I announced details of how the balance of that funding will be spent through Irish NGOs and international agencies.Part of our funding will respond to a UN flash appeal in relation to the humanitarian situation in Iraq over the next six months, which issued recently. This assistance will be provided in strict adherence to the humanitarian principles of neutrality and impartiality that underpin the mandates of the United Nations and its emergency response agencies. The UN Secretariat has made it clear that a generous response to this flash appeal is critical, as the contracts in the oil for food pipeline will not go anywhere near meeting the essential needs of the Iraqi people in the short term.The UN appeal has two components, food and non-food needs. It is estimated that the food needs of the Iraqi population will amount to 480,000 metric tonnes per month for at least a three month period. Non-food needs include the provision of water, health, shelter, education, protection, de-mining and emergency repairs. Of our package, €1.9 million will respond to this appeal, helping programmes which are being implemented by our key partners, the World Food Programme, WFP, UNICEF and the UN office for the co-ordination of humanitarian aid.The European Union and its member states are the largest donors of development assistance in the world. The European Union, including the Commission, has allocated a total of €514 million in emergency humanitarian aid for the crisis in Iraq and has delivered over €157 million of this to date. This aid has been distributed via the Red Cross, UN agencies and NGOs. I welcome this rapid response and I will continue to use every opportunity to highlight the humanitarian needs of Iraq to my colleagues in the EU.My top priority as Minister of State with responsibility for development co-operation and human rights is to ensure that our support in a crisis such as this is focused on the protection and saving of human lives. This is a humanitarian imperative to which I am absolutely committed. All our assistance will go towards saving lives and meeting the basic needs of the most vulnerable Iraqi people.I believe that although the challenges we face are horrendous, they can be met with a concerted effort from the international community. It is vital that the UN should play a central role in this  respect. This issue was raised by the Taoiseach in his recent meeting with President Bush in Hillsborough. As Deputies will be aware, the Taoiseach also had phone conversations with the UN Secretary General, Kofi Annan, and had a meeting with him in Athens today. The UN has a substantial record of achievement in relation to the response of the international community to humanitarian crises such as that which we are facing in Iraq.The Government welcomes the news that the conflict appears to be drawing to a close. We have, in the past, expressed our profound regret that the United States and its allies felt that such action was necessary. However, as the fighting comes to an end and the people of Iraq adjust to the reality that the regime of Saddam Hussein has collapsed, it is necessary to look forward and consider what can be done to ensure that the reconstruction and rehabilitation of Iraq goes forward as rapidly as possible and for the benefit of the Iraqi people.The Government has been deeply disquieted by the dissension which affected the international community in the lead-up to the conflict. We believe it is now time to move beyond these divisions. Not least, it is essential to begin repairing the damage to the United Nations. The Security Council should be the guarantor of international peace and security in the future. This will only be possible if it is united and determined. The member states of the UN, particularly of the Security Council, must act to restore the authority of the council. They have the opportunity to begin this work as they consider the complex post-conflict issues which must now be addressed if Iraq is to emerge from this crisis as a peaceful and representative democracy.We wish to see the UN at the heart of the efforts to deal with the post-conflict situation, and not only in respect of humanitarian assistance. The Government believes, as do our partners in the European Union, that the UN should be at the heart of the reconstruction process. It has the experience, capacity and perceived impartiality to carry this objective forward. The work which it has already done in post-conflict situations as diverse as East Timor and Afghanistan is all the proof which anyone could ask for of its capacity to deliver what is needed today. Going beyond a purely humanitarian involvement, the UN's role must not be confined to humanitarian. The UN should play a significant political role in the broader task of helping Iraqis to assemble a legitimate and accepted administration and of rebuilding Iraq as a functioning country with a viable democracy. We will listen carefully to the judgment of Secretary General Annan in this regard.It is also essential that the Iraqis themselves, including the millions of decent Iraqis who live and work in Iraq, play an important and expanding role in the administration. I am pleased to see that this is being increasingly recognised and that efforts are being made on the  ground to get members of the Iraqi police and civil service to return to their duties.The assurance of Iraq's sovereignty, independence and territorial integrity, with every appropriate involvement on the UN's part, will be of the greatest importance for Arab public opinion. It will help to dispel fears that a rule from outside could be imposed. We still have to guard against the twin dangers of destabilisation in the region and the worsening of the terrorist threat.The conflict in Iraq and its repercussions have, to some extent, taken the spotlight off the festering Israeli-Palestinian conflict and the international effort to resolve it. It is important that this should not be allowed to remain the case. Indeed, in my view, the recent events in Iraq make it even more necessary for the international community to focus on the situation in the occupied territories and the associated conflicts between Israel and Syria and Lebanon.The European Union as a whole remains committed to the Middle East peace process. The High Representative, Javier Solana, and his staff are fully engaged in the search for peace and maintain constant channels both to the parties and to the other international actors who have a role to play.At its meeting on 21 March the European Council concluded that the Iraq crisis made it all the more imperative that the other problems of the region be tackled and resolved. The Heads of State and Government repeated their support for a two state solution on the basis of the 1967 borders. They called for the immediate publication and implementation of the road map and for parallel progress in the security, political and economic fields. Today, in Athens, EU Heads of State and Government discussed the Middle East peace process with the Secretary General of the United Nations, Kofi Annan. They considered the means to give effect to the road map and the most effective proposals for implementation. I am hopeful that we can now see the prospect of a settlement to this most intractable of international conflicts.I pledge our determination to work as part of a concerted international humanitarian effort in Iraq involving the United Nations, the European Union and NGOs. We must now be ready to assist the Iraqi people to cope with the effects of the conflict and to ensure that the humanitarian needs of the most vulnerable are met. As Minister of State with responsibility for our development and humanitarian assistance, I will do everything in my power to support this task. The challenge is enormous for us all but I believe it can be met.
#GayMitchell	unknown-#GayMitchell-party	unknown-#GayMitchell-dob	unknown-#GayMitchell-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-16 00:00:00	Prelude	785	This evening, in a church in my constituency, lie the remains of a lance-corporal who went to Iraq to do his duty. He was a talented young man and an upright and decent person. It is very easy for us to be condemnatory of people who took action in this war and to take sides and make political comments. When we  think about what has happened in Iraq, not just in recent days but over a very long period, we should remember that we are not here to make political points but to assist in the humanitarian crisis that now faces Iraq.We were all struck by the television pictures of young Ali with his arms missing, his body burned and a smile on his face, having lost his parents and siblings. There are many other Alis whom we have not seen. He represents many other children, not all of whom have suffered because of the recent war. Many of them suffered over the years, and not all as a result of sanctions. Many suffered by the deliberate action of their own Government.I was, perhaps, even more struck by a photograph on the front page of the Irish Independent which showed a tortured woman and her two young children, a boy and a girl about the same ages as my own two youngest children, whose father had just been shot dead, with another of his children and another person, in a car at a checkpoint. One would have to be a stone not to be touched by the terrible suffering on their faces.As we address this issue as our last act before we adjourn, we should remember that it is important for us, as representatives of the Irish people, to do everything we can to assist those people. We must do so directly, through the European Union and the United Nations and in any other way we can. There will be an opportunity for the Joint Committee on European Affairs to talk to the Minister before he goes to the European Council and for the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs, even when the Houses are in recess, to continue to address this matter as it did today. In addressing it, however, we must be aware that we are talking about people who endured terrible suffering and that apportioning blame will not help the situation or contribute to its solution.I find it hard to understand why a war which we were led to understand was so meticulously planned gave rise to a situation of chaos where there is no police force on the ground and there is looting and a complete break down in the rule of law. I hope that situation can be dealt with because where there is no law and order there cannot be successful delivery of humanitarian aid.By the Minister of State's own estimate, 450,000 tonnes of aid will be required by Iraq per month. That is more than twice what has ever been delivered in a crisis situation. Given the opportunity the Minister of State has had since the debate on the Fine Gael Private Members' motion last week to examine the matter, can he tell the House his estimate of the ability of the international community to deliver that level of aid and how he sees it being delivered in the short to medium term?The situation in Iraq changes hour by hour but according to Oxfam a truckload of 13.3 tonnes of medicines, soap and detergents arrived in Baghdad today to provide assistance to thousands of  malnourished Iraqi children in hospitals and paediatric wards across the country. It is a drop in the ocean in terms of the 480,000 tonnes needed but it will mean a lot to those who receive it. Every day 20 water tankers are arriving in Umm Qasr from Kuwait but that is nowhere near enough. In Zubayr, a town of 500,000 people just south of Basra, there is no piped water because the crucial booster stations to ensure pressure for taps have been looted and are not functioning. Oxfam hopes to fly a plane load of pipes, pumps and other equipment into Kuwait from England on Tuesday so work on the Zubayr pumping station can be started. These are the basic needs of the community at this time.Some of what Oxfam found demonstrated that the breakdown in law and order is doing as much, if not more, damage to Iraq's infrastructure as the fighting of recent weeks, extraordinary as that may seem. In Basra, water pumping stopped last week because staff had fled the plant fearing looters. This plant had already been repaired by the Red Cross after it was damaged during the 18 day siege of Basra. The British military forces in charge of the area have not yet given security clearance for the United Nations and aid agencies to enter Basra.The situation in Baghdad is near total anarchy. According to Oxfam, the United Nations has protested to the coalition over its failure to control lawlessness in Baghdad and other cities, reminding the forces of their duty to maintain law and order under international humanitarian law. The International Committee for the Red Cross reports that one key hospital has no water or electricity and that surgeons are operating under very difficult conditions. I had never seen a doctor cry on television, I felt they were trained not to, but I saw a doctor crying on television the other night and I was taken aback. He was crying over his patients, an extraordinary thing to see. The conditions under which surgeons, doctors and nurses are operating are extremely difficult. Many hospital staff are unable to report for work. The World Health Organisation says there is an urgent need for antibiotics, pain killers and surgical items.Oxfam's second shipment with the All Our Children organisation to children's hospitals left Jordan on 10 April and is in Iraq. The three truck convoy led by Première Urgence is carrying surgical equipment, blankets and sheets. Oxfam provided funding for the shipment through All Our Children. In the Basra area, UNICEF reports diarrhoea rates ten times as high as normal in the hospitals of Umm Qasr, mainly among young children. This can be deadly for children who are already malnourished, as 30% of Iraqi children are.Looting is rampant in Basra, with aid being removed from military trucks, staff fleeing water treatment plants and hospital staff not turning up out of fear. The water and power situation has improved but the BBC has reported that civilians are begging for water and visibly malnourished  children are in dire need of it. Oxfam maintains that occupying forces have a duty to maintain law and order and public life. Over and above their duties as warriors, they have a duty to assist and protect civilians.The Government promised to do all it could to help the humanitarian effort in Iraq when it supported Fine Gael's Private Members' motion last week. I draw the Government's attention to what Trócaire said. It has launched an appeal on behalf Caritas Iraq to support more than 43,000 families or over 260,000 internally displaced people in Iraq in the next three months. While Caritas Iraq is seeking €8 million in total, Trócaire hopes to raise €2 million in Ireland to contribute the vital work of its partner in the region. The Government could do worse than help Trócaire at this vital hour. Trócaire says that 1,740 families – 10,440 people – living in church buildings will be targeted, along with 21,000 families – 126,000 people – living with host families. The 21,000 host families will also benefit under this programme. Nearly half the population targeted is under 14 years or over 60 years of age.Fine Gael's position on the future governance of Iraq has been clear since the start. We have always believed in the legitimacy and primacy of the United Nations. For this reason it is imperative that the UN oversees the administration of Iraq as soon as is feasible. Now that the war appears to be ending, it is time to involve the United Nations centrally so that humanitarian aid can be delivered and an interim civil administration can be put in place that enjoys international legitimacy and support.In the long term there will be a need to heal divisions in the European Union and the United Nations that this conflict caused and a better way to ensure that the values of community and multilateralism are respected must be put in place.I draw the attention of the House to the statement made by the European Union that the UN must continue to play a central role during and after the current crisis. The UN has the unique capacity and practical experience in co-ordinating assistance in post-conflict states. The Security Council should give the United Nations a strong mandate for this mission. That is the EU view and one which this House would support.This conflict flew in the face of a 60 year tradition of multilateralism that led to an unprecedented period of peace and stability. Despite the removal of Saddam Hussein, a brutal dictator whose Ba'ath Party ruined, not ran, Iraq, the international community remains convulsed and it will take some time before trust is restored at UN, EU and NATO levels. The recreation of Iraq and the rebuilding of a shattered nation, could allow for some of that trust to be restored. It is vital that the United States and the United Kingdom give way to the UN so it can take its rightful place as the international guarantor of democracy.The plan of the United States for the country, in a nutshell, allows for a US led agency set up  under the auspices of the Pentagon. It has taken charge of civilian matters for the foreseeable future. There are plans to set up an interim Iraqi authority in the next few months but it is still not clear who will make up this interim government, how its members will be chosen and what power it will have. US officials have been vague about how long the US military will remain in the country. The Americans have already brought together representatives of exiled Iraqi opposition groups and local tribal and religious leaders in an attempt to lay the groundwork for a new Government but the various groups are themselves divided over their visions for a post-war administration.One of the country's main Shi'ite groups, the Iranian based Supreme Council for the Islamic Revolution in Iraq, is boycotting the meeting in protest at the role played by the United States. Recently on television, a leading light in the group said it accepts that parliamentary democracy should rule in Iraq. I hope this is the case and that it is not another extremist movement.Such a situation does not fill me with confidence. Any situation that allows for undue influence in the region by outsiders will add fuel to the fire and give credence to those who say the war was nothing but an act of aggression. Added to this is the fact that nobody – not one, two or any number of states – other than the United Nations is better equipped to create a post-war Iraq. I hope the British and American Administrations recognise this in the near future.At yesterday's meeting of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs, I asked that at the EU Council of Ministers meeting in Athens today, the Minster and the Taoiseach raise the need for the United Nations to become the leading agency and to resume its rightful place in the restoration of Iraq and the distribution of humanitarian aid. The British Prime Minster, Mr. Blair, will have a major influence on the United States because of his close relationship with President Bush. The Government should leave no stone unturned in its relations with Mr. Blair and President Bush to persuade them to make way for the United Nations when arrangements for the future governance of Iraq and the delivery of humanitarian aid are being finalised.Much of what was claimed would happen following the invasion of Iraq by the United States and Britain has not come to pass. Winning the war is one thing, but winning the peace is another. My reservations from the outset of the war related to the failure to have it sanctioned by the United Nations Security Council. That has set a precedent for other countries, such as China, Russia or some other state, in future conflicts that none of us can foresee. The sooner the authority of the United Nations is restored the better. In everything we do, multilaterally and in our bilateral contacts with Britain, the United States and others, we should use every opportunity available to us to influence the emergence of this course of events.
#MichaelDHiggins	unknown-#MichaelDHiggins-party	unknown-#MichaelDHiggins-dob	unknown-#MichaelDHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-16 00:00:00	Prelude	786	The Minister of State's outline of the humanitarian situation is a good description of Iraq before the war. We knew how many children were malnourished – some 24% – how many people were dependent on the food programme – 16 million totally dependent and 18 million who might be food insecure – and how many children were being treated in the therapeutic feeding centres in the 63 paediatric hospitals. We also knew the consequences of bombing infrastructure.It was on this population that people decided to use the instruments of war. That is why, without apology to anybody, I condemned this war on behalf of the Labour Party from the outset. It is hypocrisy of the greatest kind to say that the plight of the Iraqi population is being discovered after the bombing and the war. All these facts were known as a result of the sanctions. The level to which the people had been reduced was known.It is academic to ask how much of the responsibility lay with Saddam Hussein and how much with the sanctions. The people were as they were before the bombs were released on them. There is also nothing academic about the fact that Baghdad was subjected to aerial bombardment, including one 72 hour sequence of unremitting bombardment. The consequences were known since 1991, including the protection of the infrastructure and the hospitals. No attempt was made to protect the hospitals, but there were efforts to protect the oil. Should I apologise to somebody for apportioning blame for those who visited this disaster on Iraq? Have we not an obligation in this House to sometimes speak about morality and truth and apportion blame where it properly lies?We are responsible for that which we facilitated. When we allowed troops to pass through Shannon Airport, we linked ourselves to what happened to the people of Iraq. We cannot wash our hands of the matter and walk away. If we did so, we would be putting ourselves on the same level as the cousin who arrived with a bunch of flowers to a hospital in Kuwait to visit the little boy Ali who had been transported there.It is time for us to be honest and to be able to say, if we are interested in the recovery of the authority of the United Nations, that it had inspectors in Iraq who were making progress but whose work was undermined. There are those who ask me if I was wrong in predicting 100,000 deaths, to which UNICEF had referred, or the 400,000 secondary deaths. I am glad so many people in Baghdad escaped and kept their lives. I had been informed that people would be kept in their houses by the Ba'ath Party, that they would be used as human shields and that a siege would be put around Baghdad, with its population of 5 million people. If half the population went to villages and relatives and are now able to return to their looted houses, I welcome that.However, I do not take lectures from anybody in the House. In 1998 in this House, I condemned  Saddam Hussein's regime for the massacre of the Kurds in Halabja. It is equally my responsibility to say that there are those who must take responsibility for this destruction visited on the people of Iraq. Is it to be seriously suggested that a war can be planned, involving the expenditure of €65 billion, and widespread destruction can be visited all over a country of 26 million people, yet the protection of a hospital cannot be anticipated? It is offensive to say there are many millions of decent Iraqis. There are 26 million people in Iraq and they are all decent people. I am not here to pass judgment on who is or is not a decent Iraqi, as the Minister of State purports to do.There is a need for the various views on this situation to combine. I did so at the meeting today of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs when I submitted a proposal on dealing with the humanitarian situation. However, I wish to place on the record the fact that I am not using that initiative as a cover for not having any opinion on the questions the Government has avoided for the entirety of this session. There is no answer to the issue of the morality of a pre-emptive strike and international law. The Government also failed to answer the question raised by the war aims, which began with the discovery of the weapons of mass destruction and quickly became regime change.On the question of the status of Resolution 1441. at a meeting of the Security Council on 8 November 2002, Mr. Negroponte, speaking on behalf of the United States, said there is no threat in the resolution and no mention of the question of an attack. In the House of Commons, the Foreign Secretary, Jack Straw, none of whose statements can be believed, stated on three occasions that there is no automaticity in Resolution 1441.Am I supposed to ask if there is confusion as to the meaning of Resolution 1441? The Government said opinion is divided. The war would be legal, but it was unnecessary and immoral. There was a diplomatic process, but it was not allowed to conclude. To those who want to wring their hands about the situation in Iraq, the best way to have made everybody safe and to avoid what we are seeing on television was not to have proceeded with the war.The situation today is full of confusion. The Government says it is in favour of the United Nations having a central role. There is an immense difference between a central and a lead role. The Minster of State correctly said that 16 million people were being fed by the food programme. In the three Kurdish governorships, this was done directly by the United Nations agencies. In the south-central area of the country, including Baghdad, it was done through a network of warehouses. The food went to approximately 43,000 distribution centres where people paid approximately 250 dinar – approximately ten cent – for a food parcel, comprising 2,250 kilocalories per day and 40 grams of protein. It was a survival diet.On summing up, will the Minister of State tell  me what replaced those 43,000 outlets? Who is supplying the food? The amount of food required is not twice what was ever transported, it is five times greater. The largest volume of food ever transported at a time of emergency was between Pakistan and Afghanistan in the amount of 100,000 tonnes per month. What is required now is 500,000 tonnes per month, but it is not for only three months.Reference has been made to the oil for food programme and the new resolution which allows Kofi Annan to administer it for 45 days. He can spend the resources in the oil for food programme's account, but those will quickly become exhausted unless oil is pumped and sold. That raises the issue of who will pump the oil in Iraq and for whom. Will the oil industry be denationalised during the reconstruction? On the edge of this process we see the figure of Mr. Chalabi, a friend of Paul Wolfowitz and Richard Perle, who described him as the philosophic voice of Iraq. Mr. Perle refers to the United Nations as the old chatterbox on the banks of the Hudson which will still be bleating after the USA has finished. I do not hesitate to condemn these people. Mr. Chalabi received a 22 year sentence of hard labour in 1989 for the alleged embezzlement of Petra Bank in Jordan. Mr. Chalabi has been handing out oil contracts to his friends already. Is that liberation for Iraq? Is it on the money from the oil he sells that the people of Iraq will rely for their food?When I spoke to the headquarters of the International Red Cross yesterday week, one of the principal workers had been shot and the organisation was not in a position to help the Al-Jazeera team about whom I had received a telephone call. The headquarters of the Al-Jazeera team had been shelled and they were feeling insecure. The Red Cross told me its members were not working at that time because of what had happened to its own worker. The question arises of where are the humanitarian corridors along which food might be delivered. As I placed my motion before the Committee on Foreign Affairs yesterday, two hospitals were functioning. Now it is claimed there are between 12 and 14, but they do not have the capacity to provide a sterile environment for people who are badly burned or wounded. These people will die of septicaemia and it is a further obscenity that Sky, CNN and Fox, who ran propaganda campaigns right through this war, display a young child being brought flowers in a Kuwaiti hospital by a member of the al-Sabbah family.Why is there no reference in the speech we have heard of when we will receive an estimate of the number of civilians killed and injured and of the number of combatants killed and injured? We know about the British and Americans with whose families I sympathise. Nobody should have his or her heart broken by the loss of relatives in war. When will we see the figures? Do we know exactly what is needed by hospitals and, if not, when will we? The real questions concern food, medicine and the reconstruction of Iraq. We know from UNICEF, which Deputy Gay Mitchell  quoted, that there has been a threefold increase in the number of children presenting with diarrhoea and all of the other illnesses which come from contaminated water.As if that was not enough, leading academics in the United States of America went to the Pentagon twice to beg for the protection of the museum in Baghdad and to speak of the Koranic library. The matter was also raised by scholars in London. Robert Fisk wrote in The Independent yesterday:When I caught sight of the Koranic library burning flames 100 feet high were bursting from the windows. I raced to the offices of the occupying power, the US Marines' Civil Affairs Bureau. An officer shouted to a colleague that "this guy says some biblical [sic] library is on fire". I gave the map location, the precise name, in Arabic and English. I said the smoke could be seen from three miles away and it would take only five minutes to drive there. Half an hour later, there was not an American at the scene and the flames were shooting 200 feet into the air.I visited a museum which held 170,000 pieces – 10,000 of which could go on exhibition – dealing with a culture that is 9,000 years old. It has been a written culture for 7,000 years. One of the two books forming the basic law of humanity, The Code of Hammurabi, was held there. As I watched pictures of the new EU members at Athens, which was referred to as the cradle of democracy, I remembered that we learned of Greek philosophy through the Arabs of Spain. We learned about algebra, architecture and astronomy from them and we are not talking now of idle destruction. The heritage destroyed represented thousands of years of world history which the Pentagon could not be bothered to protect. It could not protect the museum and it could not protect the library, but it has no excuse. The Pentagon has known since 1991 what was held in all of these institutions which leads one to ask if the United States of America can ever be listened to again at UNESCO. Should we listen to it? UNESCO is sending a team to examine the damage to the cultural heritage of Iraq.I look back now at all that has been said during this Dáil term regarding this awful and appalling war. To the war mongers who celebrate and suggest we were wrong because not enough people were killed to fulfil our predictions, I say that any loss of life for the kind of project being pursued was a disgrace and a blot on the morality of us all. We touched it because we allowed the planes to go through Shannon and we came up with half excuses to explain it. It was said that to change things would upset a long-standing arrangement and would be perceived as unfriendly. We have surrounded ourselves with half apologies and we must now insist that the United Nations be the lead agency. We must now insist that we be immediately given information through the Red Cross in accordance with the Geneva Conven tion. I want to hear the number of civilian deaths, I want to know what number of injured persons are at risk, I want to know what is needed in hospitals and I want to know what has been put in place of the 43,000 outlets that provided food to the people. I want to know that we will go to UNESCO and lend our voices to the other voices of condemnation which say that it is immoral to visit war on a broken people.It is a disgrace to humanity in front of the whole world to sit back and allow a whole culture which affects the entire world to be destroyed because one could not be bothered to help. The assistant curator of the museum went out with four staff and begged people to send a tank or even a few soldiers with guns to protect an institution he ran on behalf of the whole world. This is not a time to avoid placing responsibility where we all know it lies. We should help the people of Iraq, but not use that as an excuse to avoid the responsibility of placing the burden precisely where we should. We should end the sanctions and help Iraq.

The urgency is the result of the uncertainty with regard to the intentions of the United States of America towards Syria, Iran and other countries in the Middle East. When the authority of the United Nations is still in question, there is a need for UN reform now more than ever given what has happened in recent months. Despite all that, the Dáil is about to embark on an excessive holiday break once more. This war is not over, it is entering a phase of military occupation.Tá sé de cheart ag an bpobal fios a bheith acu cá háit go díreach a sheasann an Rialtas ar an gceist mór seo. An mbeidh na Stáit Aontaithe nó na Náisiúin Aontaithe i gceannas ar an rialtas sealadach a chuirfear faoi sheol i gceann cúpla seachtain nó mí?Níl mórán ama againn don cheist seo agus ba chomhair don Dáil bheith á bplé, ní amháin inniu ach amárach, an tseachtain seo chugainn agus an tseachtain dár gcionn más gá mar is ceist mór, millteach é a bhaineann leis an dtír seo chomh maith le gach uile tír eile ar domhan.I gceann deich lá tarlóidh an dara cruinniú a bheidh urraithe ag na Stáit Aontaithe chun ceist an rialtais sealadach a phlé. De réir dealramh, tá Washington ag súil go mbeidh an rialtas seo faoi sheol i gceann coicís nó mar sin.Caithfidh fios a bheith againn sa Teach cad go  díreach é seasamh an Rialtais agus cad atá á rá aige leis na Stáit Aontaithe nó tíortha eile ar an gceist seo. Specifically, we need to know if the Irish Government supports a US occupation administration and an oil protective regime under a pro-Israeli former general and former director of the CIA.Despite US and British assurances that the UN would have a leading role, it was not invited to the first meeting yesterday to discuss Iraq's future. There is no guarantee that it will be allowed to the next meeting in ten days time. This is a major cause for concern, as is the boycott of yesterday's meeting by the main majority Shi'ite organisations. At the very least the Irish Government must strongly protest at the exclusion of the UN from yesterday's meeting and must ensure it is present at the next meeting.Likewise, cynically or arrogantly, the first reconstruction contracts worth millions have already been awarded by the US to US firms. It is deplorable that a Texas oil company formerly run by the American Vice-President stands to make tens of millions of dollars from rebuilding a country that the US Government has invaded and bombed into the stone age. This is obscene and the Irish Government must object.The Irish Government's platitudes on the UN are not good enough. The terms "central", "vital" or "leading" are too vague and, in fact, meaningless. What we need is for the specifics of the UN role to be defined. We join with others in the House in calling on the Irish Government to state publicly and clearly that the UN must co-ordinate and oversee the humanitarian aid distribution, the interim administration and the planning and reconstruction of Iraq, and hand over these matters to democratically elected representatives of the Iraqi people as soon as possible.The war is only just contained within the borders of Iraq. Despite the US Secretary of State's involvement, there is a risk that it will creep into surrounding countries. We must know the Irish Government's position on pre-emptive action, on the so-called axis of evil, the project for a new American century and the US national security strategy published late last year. These are some of the questions the Irish Government must answer. There are many more, but we cannot deal with them in the short period offered to us tonight. I appeal once again for the Dáil to be reconvened next week to deal with this issue properly.
#JohnGormley	unknown-#JohnGormley-party	unknown-#JohnGormley-dob	unknown-#JohnGormley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-16 00:00:00	Prelude	790	This motion is concerned primarily with humanitarian aid but colleagues in the House have raised many issues that need to be addressed. What is the Irish Government's position on this war? Does it believe we now require a UN administration as opposed to a US-British one, which is what we have? Does the Government believe that we require the arms inspectors to go back into Iraq again to verify once and for all if there are weapons of mass destruction? This is what this war was supposed  to be about. We now know it was about regime change.There has even been much sabre rattling regarding Syria. This is unacceptable. I would like to hear the Irish Government's position on Syria. Would it support an attack on that country? It should state its position now. Would it allow Shannon to be used if there were such an attack?I wish to ask the Minister of State a direct question. He may not be able to answer it but I will ask his colleagues as well. Have cruise or patriot missiles ever been transported through Shannon? It is a simple question and I would like an answer from the Minister of State. As he knows, this has been denied repeatedly in the House. What we have been told is that no verification has taken place. It is a neither confirm nor deny situation.It has been said that many of us made predictions that were out of line. In other words, and even Deputy Gay Mitchell said this, much of what was claimed did not come to pass. I said that America would win the war but would lose the peace and that the war would destabilise the region, lead to civilian casualties and a humanitarian crisis and create the conditions for further terrorism. Let us take these one by one.There is instability. It is quite clear, even in Iraq. We witness it on the streets there and see the protests throughout that country in Mosul, where 12 people were killed yesterday, Najaf and Nasiriyah. We must contrast this with the propaganda we heard from Sky Television which said that tens of thousands of people were out on the streets tearing down a statue of Saddam Hussein. In fact, about 150 people were in the square where the statue was torn down. I suspect if there were a statue in Dublin of the Taoiseach or any politician, one could get 150 people to damage it. I do not take that incident as an indication of what the Iraqi people think.I know the majority of them see the US force as an army of occupation and that is very clear. What we are seeing is a replication of our experience in Northern Ireland and what we witnessed in the West Bank. It will worsen because people will continue to take pot shots. There continues to be a problem with terrorism in Afghanistan, which has been forgotten. Some 17 US citizens lost their lives there. That problem continues.It is extraordinary to hear Tony Blair and George Bush talking about a trust fund for the Iraqi people to let them control Iraqi oil because the American people do not even control American oil. It is controlled by a few multinationals. They are claiming to introduce socialism to Iraq to allow its people to control their oil reserves. It is an extraordinary idea and I do not believe it. We will have the creation of further terrorism. This war has been a disaster for us all.
#FinianMcGrath	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-party	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-dob	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-16 00:00:00	Prelude	791	I thank the Acting Chairman for allowing me speak on the humanitarian crisis in Iraq and the urgent need for action. The beautiful country of Iraq is in turmoil for two reasons: the brutality of Saddam Hussein's  regime and the occupation and bombardment of the so-called coalition forces. That is where responsibility begins and ends.Over the past 22 days, we have seen 27 British and 61 American fatalities, 1,000 Iraqi soldiers killed in combat, many with white flags, 1,413 civilians killed – that is a conservative figure – and more than 5,103 civilians injured, many of them losing limbs.This is the reality of war, death and destruction. Iraq has been humiliated and homes, schools and hospitals have been destroyed. We have seen anarchy and looting on the streets. Many now know about the 12 year old Iraqi boy, Ali Ismaeel Abbas, who lost his parents and both his arms. He too is seriously ill.If this type of savagery is the best solution to the world's problems in the 21st century, it is time to think again, redouble our efforts and challenge Bush, Rumsfeld, Blair and their supporters in this country. Let us not cod ourselves by denying that we have plenty of Members in the House who support Blair and Bush but do not have the courage to tell the people. Most of the media disgraced themselves during the war in Iraq. Of course, there were a few notable exceptions but many went along with the spin of Blair and Bush. This is a serious issue for our democracy, our citizens and their right to know.The reality of this war is that thousands of people affected are trying to rebuild their lives. We have to support them and I urge the West, the United Nations and the Arab world to assist the Iraqi people in their hour of need. They need food, water, electricity and health care. As I said earlier, 1,413 civilians are dead and over 5,103 are injured. I am very cautious about the figures. I urge the House and Government to do their best in their efforts concerning humanitarian aid.
#MarianHarkinIND	unknown-#MarianHarkinIND-party	unknown-#MarianHarkinIND-dob	unknown-#MarianHarkinIND-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-16 00:00:00	Prelude	792	Like many Deputies, I strongly believe the UN should have a pivotal role to play in the distribution of humanitarian relief. I agree with Deputy Ó Snodaigh that it is not enough to say this and that the role needs to be defined. Furthermore, the EU should be actively engaged in this process. This could happen in two different ways. In the longer term we may have an opportunity to progress this issue during the Irish Presidency. Although the European Commission already interacts with the UN in the area of operations and policy debate regarding humanitarian affairs, there is still scope to develop a much more effective partnership. This might come about through co-operation and collaboration on a more systemic level, rather than just on a piecemeal or ad hoc basis.The EU has adopted a document entitled "Building an Effective Partnership with the UN in the Fields of Development and Humanitarian Affairs". This was adopted in May 2001. In February 2002, the General Affairs Council proposed to strengthen the role of the EU in international relations, particularly by channelling EU co-operation funds through the UN. A further document  is due and may well fall during our Presidency. Therefore, we will have an opportunity to enhance co-operation between the EU and UN and I sincerely hope we take it.In the shorter term we should exert pressure at EU level for a major donation of food products from EU intervention stocks. We sold Iraqis lots of expensive beef in our time. Why not give it to them now and empty EU intervention stocks? This might seem like an act of self-interest on the part of the EU and Ireland but it is very much in the interest of the people of Iraq.The most important things now are speed of decision and speed of action. The logistics of war, which proved so effective, should now become the logistics of food aid, but sponsored and controlled by the UN. The priority is to give humanitarian aid to needy people in good time, which means right now.
#TomKitt	unknown-#TomKitt-party	unknown-#TomKitt-dob	unknown-#TomKitt-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-16 00:00:00	Prelude	793	I thank everybody who contributed tonight. Some very genuine remarks were made. Deputy Michael Higgins referred to my reference to the decent Iraqi people. I will stand over that comment based on my experience of having travelled to Iraq as a new Deputy a year after my election. I was fortunate enough to meet many decent people in Baghdad in particular, including many of the street artists on the back streets of the city. I would certainly not include Saddam Hussein or all those who would torture or gas their own people as decent people. This was confirmed when I saw pictures on television recently of Iraqi people trying to chisel and hammer their way into underground tunnels in the hope of finding their fellow citizens. My reference was to the vast majority of Iraqi people but there are clearly some very evil people among them, in particular Saddam Hussein and those who have ruled the country.There is a huge humanitarian job to be done by all of us. It is difficult to find a precedent for the volume of food aid which must be supplied if large sections of the population are to avoid enormous suffering. Everybody has highlighted that tonight. It is too early to say if the international community will be able to deliver the level of aid required. However, Deputy Gay Mitchell is correct to focus on this. It is vital that we all play our part in mobilising food aid. The Government was one of the first to pledge support. The Deputy also referred to the work of Trócaire. I am a great admirer of its work, which the Government values very much and supports as actively as it can. We are willing to assist in any way we can as we monitor the crisis in the days ahead.The humanitarian problem is still unfolding and further assistance may be required in the weeks and months ahead. The challenges facing the international community in dealing with it are  formidable but they can be met. A Deputy asked a question about this. We have gained experience over the years and we have the capacity that is required. The key point is good co-ordination. Effective UN co-ordination of a civilian-led humanitarian effort must be established as soon as conditions allow. The world needs an effective United Nations and I have explained how I would like to see matters develop.The unanimous decision of the Security Council, through Resolution 1472, authorising the Secretary General to administer the oil for food programme for 45 days and possibly longer, was very welcome and signals the way forward. I hope that the resumption of the programme will mean that basic food assistance can be provided as quickly as possible to those who are most vulnerable. This will obviously require full co-operation from the coalition forces. This is relevant to what Deputy Michael Higgins said.Many of the previous structures have been damaged by the conflict and recent scenes of food being thrown from the backs of military trucks are an object lesson on how not to deliver humanitarian assistance. Only specialist agencies can identify those who are most in need and they are best placed to do so.Deputy Michael Higgins asked about the number of casualties. We cannot give an estimate and we must find out the precise number of people who have lost their lives and have been injured. The Government supports all appropriate efforts being made to assess the consequences of the conflict. Such assessments are best made by objective and impartial bodies such as the International Commission of the Red Cross, which is the guardian of the Geneva Conventions. Specifically, the Fourth Geneva Convention is germane to the protection of civilians in time of conflict. The staff of the ICRC are active even now within Iraq, at significant danger to themselves, seeking to address the urgent humanitarian needs of its population.A question was asked about the American plans for Syria. It is important to address this issue because the US has made certain assertions about Syria's policies, notably in relation to weapons of mass destruction and possible support of the former Iraqi regime. US differences with Syria give rise to concerns and we wish to see them addressed in a peaceful and constructive manner. There is no reason to believe that such issues cannot be handled through diplomatic means. The problem with Syria is not comparable to the Iraqi crisis. The latter evolved over a very long period as a result of Iraq's attacks on its neighbours and its long defiance of UN Security Council resolutions. Syria has a crucial part of play in the Middle East peace process and it is essential that it assumes its full responsibilities in this regard along with the other nations involved.

Tipperary town, as the Minister, Deputy Cullen, knows extremely well, has suffered hugely in recent years.To put it in context in the brief time available to me, it is a place that, because of its traditional dependence on the whole agricultural scene was once a great market town. It has been more badly affected than any other town by the changes in agriculture. When the Government recently carried out investigations while preparing a proposal under the RAPID scheme for various towns around the country, it transpired that Tipperary town was actually the second poorest town in the country.Recently, the town suffered another huge body blow when Pall Netherlands BV, which had been developing in the town over the past six years, decided to lay off 150 workers. To say it was a devastating blow is an understatement. There was shock that evening when people realised what was happening to a town that was already on its knees. The Minister and everybody else knows that what we need now is action. There are two options open to us. The town can be allowed to die or we can do something about it. I would always want to be positive and we need to do something about it.There is a total lack of understanding by the Government of the neglect of the town and the position it has been left in. The IDA has been thinking and talking but no action has taken place in relation to an industrial park. The land is there but no developments have occurred. We have spoken about it but it has not happened. There is a huge empty facility in the town already that has been left idle for the past six or seven years. Recently, the IDA told a joint meeting of local Oireachtas Members and the UDC that an investor has not even been taken to see that plant over the past number of years. All in all, the situation in Tipperary town is devastating to say the least and I am looking forward to hearing of some positive action from the Minister.The Minister is not too far away from Tipperary town and knows it well. The people of Tipperary town are at a loss as to why their town has been neglected. Right across the country, jobs were announced throughout the Celtic tiger era but there was nothing for Tipperary town. I ask that it be made a priority by the Government over the next number of months and that we all  pull together because we all want the town to succeed.

Currently, the accepted unemployment levels in Tipperary town stand at 12%, about three times the national average. The 150 redundancies announced recently are in the biggest factory in the town and it is an absolutely devastating blow not just to Tipperary town but to the whole hinterland, right out as far as Cashel and back into parts of east Limerick.I hope the Minister will be able to tell us tonight that he will set up a task force to take account of the difficulties that Tipperary town is experiencing and to ensure that investment and industry goes into the town. Tipperary town has been a very progressive town. Huge amounts of money have been collected on a voluntary basis to provide facilities that are second to none, such as the Canon Hayes sports complex, an IT training facility, the Sean Treacy swimming pool and the XL cinema. In excess of €1.5 million from the pockets of townspeople themselves have been put into these projects so it is a town that is very progressive and that needs and deserves employment. I hope the Minister will be able to announce a task force for the town of Tipperary.
#MartinCullen	unknown-#MartinCullen-party	unknown-#MartinCullen-dob	unknown-#MartinCullen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-16 00:00:00	Prelude	798	I am taking this matter on behalf of the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment. I thank Deputy Hayes in particular for raising this matter on the Adjournment. I learned with grave disappointment of the decision by Pall Netherlands BV to close part of its manufacturing operations in Tipperary with the loss of 155 jobs. I understand that the parent company has made a decision to transfer the production of medical filters to Puerto Rico but to continue the production of industrial filters in Tipperary. The company currently employs a total of 230 people in the manufacture of medical and industrial filters in Tipperary town.The decision to cease the manufacture of the medical filters results from over-capacity in the marketplace. The manufacture of medical filters will transfer to Puerto Rico, where Pall Corporation has an existing facility which is three times the size of the Irish plant. FÁS, the national training authority, has already been in contact with company representatives to discuss a detailed programme to assist those who are being made redundant to find suitable alternative employment. FÁS has offered to make available its full range of support services including skills analysis, jobs placement, guidance and counselling interviews, identification of training needs and suitable training courses. FÁS will also ensure ongoing support and action to keep redundant workers in touch with the labour market.In addition, Enterprise Ireland's south-east region office, in association with the management  of the Tipperary Enterprise and Technology Centre and Tipperary South Riding County Enterprise Board, has already held a clinic for the staff of Pall who wish to consider self-employment. The resources of all three bodies will be used, as appropriate, to give assistance to those employees who wish to set up their own enterprise.In regard to positive developments in South Tipperary, I understand that the ALZA Corporation Cashel, is currently in the process of expanding which will grow employment to 100. South Tipperary has a good range of foreign direct investment companies in the growing pharmaceutical and health care sectors. Companies such as Guidant, Merck Sharp and Dohme and Clonmel Healthcare in Clonmel and now ALZA Corporation in Cashel provide a solid base of employment. These are complemented by another significant employer, SRAM Ireland in Carrick-on-Suir.IDA Ireland will continue to promote Tipperary to potential investors and the agency will also develop its business park in Tipperary town as an additional attraction. Planning permission has recently been secured to carry out an upgrade of the park by improving the entrance road and landscaping the site. An advance technology building of 16,000 square feet will be built on the park this year. In addition, the former Namco building of 60,000 square feet is available and is being actively marketed by the agency.The IDA will work with existing clients in the county to encourage further new expansion activities. In the case of Pall, the company has indicated that it is willing to be flexible in relation to future use of its building and, in that respect, the IDA has already commenced to market the facility. I also understand that the Tipperary Enterprise and Technology Centre is now fully operational and that nine micro enterprises have set up there to date. It is hoped that a number of new enterprises will commence in the centre in the near future.In terms of increasing Tipperary's attractiveness as a location for investment, the Tipperary Institute is currently operating two campuses, one in Clonmel and the other in Thurles, and it is hoped to develop the range of courses to take on more business and science students. The State development agencies under the aegis of my Department are fully committed to the promotion of employment creation in south Tipperary, including Tipperary town. The agencies work closely with each other and with the development bodies in the area, as well as other local bodies and interests in facilitating an integrated approach to enterprise development in south Tipperary. In that respect, a sub-committee of the Tipperary County Development Board has been set up, in which the IDA, FÁS and Enterprise Ireland will participate to examine what initiatives can be developed for Tipperary town and ways of attracting potential foreign direct investment.
#EamonRyanGP	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-party	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-dob	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-16 00:00:00	Prelude	799	I very much appreciate the opportunity provided by this Adjournment debate. It is very important that the Government clarifies exactly what its position is on this issue. During Leaders' Questions yesterday, the Taoiseach was asked specifically about what his reaction would be to the reported decision by the ESB not to convert its Moneypoint Station to gas. The Taoiseach seemed confident that it would be converted to gas, that the strategy as set out in 2000 was ongoing and that all was well with the world.When it comes to our national climate strategy, I am sure that the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, who am I glad to see here tonight to take the debate, knows that all is not well with the world. If Moneypoint is not converted to gas, as was set out as one of the main recommendations in the national climate change strategy, we will have even further difficulty in meeting the targets for carbon dioxide reductions that we are already way above. It is very important that, rather than letting the Taoiseach continue with the misunderstanding that all is well, the Government starts to be very clear on what its position is and what our options are. I look forward to hearing what the Minister's view on this subject is.It is strange to take one particular power station as being representative of the whole issue, but Moneypoint is one of the single most important factors in regard to our climate change strategy.The Minister will know Moneypoint emits roughly 900 MW of power, slightly less than one quarter of our overall electricity generation capacity. He will also know its emission of 500 million tonnes per year is more than one quarter of the total CO2 emitted from the whole energy generation sector and that the plan to convert it to gas bringing a 3.5 million tonnes reduction per annum in CO2 emissions was the largest by a factor of three or four of the policies or proposals to reduce CO2 emissions. CO2 is our most significant greenhouse gas.It is a complicated issue when one gets down to the details. I will not pretend there are simple solutions, nor will I demand that the Government immediately converts it to gas because there are difficulties involved. There are security of supply difficulties in our electricity generation system. If we moved completely to gas for all our power generation, we would be vulnerable at the end of a long pipeline from Siberia from which future gas resources will have to come. When I say future resources, I am talking about ten years time. When we talk about electricity generation and investment in these areas, I would argue that we have to think in terms of a 50 year timeframe and not just a ten year one. We have to think strategically on this issue.We also have to think quickly because by June next year, we will be in the final period before we  can get a derogation or decide to continue to run Moneypoint as a coal burning station for 20,000 hours after the 2008 time limit when the reductions in emissions have to occur. If we want to apply for that derogation and to continue to run the plant for a period of time afterwards, we must do so by June next year, so the Government has to make a decision quickly.If, as reported in The Irish Times, it is to continue as a coal burning station and to be modified to take out NO2 and SO2, nitrous oxide and sulphur dioxide, the plant must be converted by 2008 to meet that directive. To achieve that, the lead time for the conversion of the plant is approximately four or five years. We must make the investment decision by early or mid next year. It seems clear from the reports in The Irish Times that the ESB is moving towards the conversion of the plant to take out NO2 and SO2 rather than CO2 – in fact, the technology does not seem to be available to take CO2 out of a coal burning power station. The power plant is not suitable to be converted to gas fired. It seems the ESB is moving in that direction. If it is, the Minister's climate change strategy needs to be radically reviewed very quickly. We are already in deep trouble in a range of other areas in which we are exceeding our emissions. In addition to that, we will lose another 3.5 million tonne reduction for which we were hoping.It is important that rather than put the decision back to June of next year, the Government starts to treat this climate change issue seriously and to comment on whether it will be willing to invest in some of the alternatives required. There are alternatives in terms of power generation. We could invest in gas and in alternative new stations. Our preferred solution is massive investment in renewable energy sources which we are only developing at a fraction of what is possible. The Government needs to move beyond the Taoiseach's seeming obliviousness to the issue and to the serious nature of the problem.
#MartinCullen	unknown-#MartinCullen-party	unknown-#MartinCullen-dob	unknown-#MartinCullen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-16 00:00:00	Prelude	800	I assure the Deputy the Taoiseach is engaged in this issue. I thank him for raising this matter and for making a reasoned, careful and constructive argument. I am responding to this matter on behalf of my colleague, the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, Deputy Dermot Ahern, who is abroad on Department business. I am glad to have the opportunity to set out the current position regarding the future of the ESB's coal-fired generating station at Moneypoint in County Clare.The national climate change strategy, for which the Deputy correctly indicated I am responsible, indicated that the replacement of coal-fired electricity generation at Moneypoint power station with an equivalent amount of gas-fired generation, would make the largest single contribution to reduce greenhouse gas emissions of 3.4 megatonnes of CO2 per annum. The strategy assumes that the Government will create a policy environment which will lead to the closure of Money point. At the same time, the strategy recognises that following such a course of action would mean that Ireland would be reliant on gas for 80% of its electricity generating capacity by 2010. This level of dependence would be extreme, when one considers that the European average dependence on gas is estimated to be about 30% in the same timeframe.It should be noted that in taking a view on the issue of gas dependence late last year, the Economic and Social Research Institute expressed concern at the possible impact on the economy of interruptions in supply or price shocks in a situation where such a level of gas dependence prevailed.Taking account of our peripherality to future gas supplies, it will be necessary for the Government to consider carefully whether the move from a reasonably diverse fuel mix for electricity generation to one of such a high dependence on gas would be prudent.In so far as Ireland's commitments under the Kyoto Protocol are concerned, the introduction of emissions trading under the EU scheme from 2005 is recognised as one of the flexibility mechanisms which will enable countries to attain compliance with Kyoto obligations at the least cost.The implementation of the emission trading regime is currently being prepared by me, as Minister for the Environment and Local Government. Virtually all electricity generating stations will be involved in this scheme, including Moneypoint, and, consequently, whichever approach is adopted for the future of the Moneypoint station in particular, the electricity generating sector will be making an appropriate contribution to Ireland's emissions reduction targets.In considering the options for the future of Moneypoint, three main alternatives will have to be considered: retro-fitting Moneypoint with cleaner coal-burning technology; conversion to gas; or replacement of existing plant with state-of-the-art gas technology. While ultimately a decision for Government, the matter, in the first instance, is for the board of the ESB and the company has recently begun a process of discussion with the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources and with officials from my Department, the Department of the Environment and Local Government, with a view to sketching out the possible options available, the costs associated with same, the implications of those for energy policy in terms of security of supply, for fuel diversity and for emissions levels, etc.Earlier this month, the ESB lodged its plan with Clare County Council for the environmental project it will have to undertake to allow Moneypoint station operate past 2008 in compliance with the licence granted by the Environmental Protection Agency last year. Rather than being interpreted as the ESB acting as if a final decision on the plant's future had already been taken, it should be seen instead as the company correctly taking prudent steps at this stage to enable it to be in a position to respond appropriately and in  a timely way to whatever decision emerges in due course regarding the future operation of the station. The question of Moneypoint being converted to gas will be decided in the light of the evaluation already referred to.
#DonalMoynihan	unknown-#DonalMoynihan-party	unknown-#DonalMoynihan-dob	unknown-#DonalMoynihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-16 00:00:00	Prelude	801	In 2001, the Department of Education and Science introduced a new disadvantaged programme known as Giving Children an Even Break. Two primary schools in Macroom participated in this programme – St. Colman's boys' national school and St. Joseph's primary school. They completed a survey and based on the data they supplied to the Educational Research Centre, they were selected for inclusion in the programme. In addition to getting additional funding, St. Colman's school was allocated an extra teacher and St. Joseph's was allocated three extra teachers.However, in 2002, each school was notified that they had misinterpreted one of the questions – question No. 29 – and, therefore, the response to it was incorrect. The school principals had answered the question to the best of their ability and had based their answer on how they perceived the question should be answered. The Educational Research Centre re-examined the data supplied in the survey forms submitted in 2000 and recalculated the revised points total. The new total was lower than that on which the level of funding and staffing was based and, on that basis, the Department notified the schools in question that the posts allocated under the programme would be suppressed at the end of the 2002-03 school year. The teachers have been placed on the teachers' panel.I am asking the Minister if he will reconsider the decision to withdraw the teachers from these schools until the end of the term of the programme, given that the schools were originally allocated the teachers based on the results of the survey. Macroom is in a very disadvantaged position at present as a result of the closure of the General Semiconductors Ireland plant in the town in August 2001, which resulted in the loss of about 700 or 800 jobs in the surrounding area. The reviewed figures in the appeal sent to the Department by the two schools confirm this.
#MartinCullen	unknown-#MartinCullen-party	unknown-#MartinCullen-dob	unknown-#MartinCullen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-16 00:00:00	Prelude	802	I intend to respond to Deputy Moynihan's comments on behalf of the Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Noel Dempsey, who is otherwise engaged tonight.I am pleased to have the opportunity to outline to the House the position regarding the two schools mentioned by the Deputy, particularly their participation in the Department of Education and Science's new disadvantage programme, Giving Children an Even Break. The Deputy may be aware that the programme was launched in 2001 to tackle educational disadvantage at primary level. Participating schools  receive a range of additional supports, including teacher posts and other non-teaching supports, to be targeted at disadvantaged pupils. The additional supports to be provided reflect the level of concentration of pupils from educationally disadvantaged backgrounds in schools invited to participate in the programme. The levels of disadvantage were established following a comprehensive survey of primary schools conducted by the Educational Research Centre in March and April 2000, at the request of the Department. Schools identified as having pupils with characteristics of disadvantage have been invited to participate in Giving Children an Even Break.The aim of the survey was to gain an indication of the level of disadvantage in each school using principals' responses to a questionnaire comprised of items relating to disadvantage. Each school was assigned a points total based on responses to questions about indicators such as unemployment, medical card possession and rented local authority housing. Any school in which there was at least one pupil who satisfied any of the criteria associated with socio-economic disadvantage was entitled to additional resources under the programme. Resources were allocated to schools on a sliding scale and schools with greater proportions of pupils from disadvantaged backgrounds were allocated more resources, proportionately, than those with fewer numbers.Urban schools identified as having the highest concentration of pupils with characteristics associated with educational disadvantage have been considered for additional staffing to implement a maximum class size of 20:1 in junior classes – infants through second class – and 27:1 in senior classes – third through sixth class. The schools referred to by the Deputy were selected in 2001 for inclusion in this category. Both schools were also allocated additional funding based on the percentage of disadvantaged pupils enrolled, as estimated by the 2000 ERC survey.Unfortunately, the points total for the schools to which the Deputy refers were calculated incorrectly due to the misinterpretation of a questionnaire item by the schools which led to an error in the ERC's calculation of points. The ERC has re-examined the data supplied in the survey form submitted in 2000 and calculated the correct points total in respect of both schools. The total is lower than that on which the original level of staffing and funding allocation granted to the schools in question, under Giving Children an Even Break, was based. Following the correction, neither school falls into the category of schools considered for additional teaching staff under the programme.In addition, the level of funding allocated to each school is no longer appropriate, based on the revised points awarded. The posts allocated to the schools will be suppressed at the end of the 2002-03 school year and the teachers in question will be placed on the diocesan teaching panel. In addition, the amended funding entitlement under Giving Children an Even Break in respect of the  2002-03 school year has been offset against the amount overpaid for the 2000-01 and 2001-02 school years.Having regard to the amount of funding available under this initiative and the selection criteria, it is not possible for the Department of Education and Science to accede to the appeal. The Minister for Education and Science is arranging to forward the Deputy details of the indicators of disadvantage and the associated points used to calculate the points total for urban schools in the survey of disadvantage in 2000.
#RuairiQuinn	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-party	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-dob	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-16 00:00:00	Prelude	803	I thank the Ceann Comhairle for allowing me to raise this matter. A decision has been taken and formally announced since I initiated this request for an Adjournment debate. I ask the Minister to respond to the concerns expressed to me by people working in the heritage sector who are employed by the Government. As I intend to refer to a document prepared by the trade union IMPACT, I should declare an interest by stating that I was once a member of the original LGPSU, the forerunner of IMPACT.IMPACT has claimed that the decision to re-organise heritage functions flies in the face of the Government's heritage plan, published last year. The decision has been unanimously opposed by senior Dúchas managers and all staff unions in the area. The Minister's decision to proceed with the changes ignores the recommendations of his officials and the best professional advice. IMPACT has called on the Minister and the Cabinet to recognise the damage that this decision will cause to the long-term protection of our valuable heritage, our standing in an international context and our valued tourism economy. The union has asked the Minister not to proceed with the plan. If I outline the union's concerns, perhaps the Minister will be able to respond to them, although I am sure he is familiar with some of the concerns that have been expressed.IMPACT considers that the Minister's decision will cause long-term damage to the built and natural environments. The value of an integrated service in the heritage area is recognised in many jurisdictions and the principle has been enshrined in the European landscape convention, which was ratified by Ireland in March 2002. Ireland has been a leader in this field in the recent past and has been held up as a model by many practitioners in Europe, in particular. The increased inefficiencies and complicated working arrangements which will result from the Minister's decision will, it is claimed, result in legislative confusion and uncertainty in relation to our obligations under EU and Irish law and the prosecution of cases, and thus less effective conservation and protection. The plans will lead to a slower decision-making process for planning and protection issues and a loss of efficiency in the  implementation of conservation projects and the management of sites on behalf of the State.IMPACT's second concern is that it contends that the proposed break-up of the heritage service comes at a difficult economic period for the country. The immediate costs in terms of organisational change and the creation of new bodies, purely in terms of note paper signage, vehicles, publications and public relations work, etc., are estimated at over €2 million.IMPACT is also concerned that the decision will damage the tourism industry. I support the union's assertion that the development of the Dúchas brand and the conservation and presentation of heritage sites has been a central to the development of the Irish tourism industry in recent years. Dúchas sites are recognised as brand leaders in heritage site presentation and interpretation. The investment of time and taxpayers' money in creating this brand is now proposed to be discarded. National heritage is, apparently, no longer to have a coherent image, nor the kind of co-ordinated, multidisciplinary management developed under the Dúchas banner. This will be the third disruptive reconfiguration of State-managed heritage in nine years. Such erratic mismanagement of our heritage by the Government can only damage a key sector of the tourism economy at a vulnerable period and reflects poorly on the aspiration to quality customer care enshrined in the national agreements.I can hear echoes of an old battle from the Office of Public Works, which was reluctant to see the responsibilities I have discussed transferred to the former Department of Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht when Deputy Michael D. Higgins was the relevant Minister. I wonder if the legacy of that bitter battle with certain officials has, in part, informed this decision. People whom I know and respect, who are at the coalface of the delivery of heritage services, feel betrayed and ignored by the manner in which this decision has been taken and the manner in which they have been, as they see it, excluded from the process.
#MartinCullen	unknown-#MartinCullen-party	unknown-#MartinCullen-dob	unknown-#MartinCullen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-16 00:00:00	Prelude	804	I thank Deputy Quinn for raising this matter and for allowing me to address changes in the future organisation of heritage functions, details of which I announced earlier today. I will address the specific questions the Deputy asked.Last June, the Taoiseach indicated that certain heritage functions were to be assigned to the Department of the Environment and Local Government and that responsibility for the management and other operational aspects of our built heritage would be exercised by the Office of Public Works. It was subsequently decided that all built heritage functions should be transferred to my Department initially, pending the completion of a review to recommend the most appropriate arrangements for giving effect to the Taoiseach's announcement. Deputy Quinn will accept that I have engaged in an enormous  amount of investigative work to get this right on this occasion and not go through the changes that have occurred in recent years.It was not a sudden decision. I have involved everyone. I acknowledge the Deputy's bona fides in the manner in which he has put the question.A report arising from that review was considered by the Government yesterday and a new set of organisational arrangements relating to heritage matters was approved. These involve the Minister for the Environment and Local Government retaining full responsibility for nature conservation matters and for built heritage policy, while the Office of Public Works is being assigned responsibility for the operational and management functions regarding the built heritage. In addition, the role of the Heritage Council is to be redefined and there is also to be a progressive expansion of the remit of local authorities regarding heritage matters.These new arrangements are wholly consistent with the direction outlined by the Taoiseach last June. They are designed to make the optimum use of the organisational resources available to the Government to meet its heritage responsibilities. They build on my Department's strengths in terms of policy development and regulation, particularly in the environmental area, as well as the Office of Public Works's strong tradition in the areas of conservation and property management.As the Deputy will be aware it is the only Government Department in Europe if not the world that now has four ISO 9000 accreditations to four of its business units. It was totally underutilised. My view at the time was, and still is, that a number of properties were the responsibility of the Office of Public Works and more in Dúchas. There were two organisations almost competing with each other. We did not need two architectural services or two front-line delivery services. It needed to be streamlined. I have a very open-minded approach. I was never involved in historic or past battles in any of these issues and I know to what the Deputy is referring. I took a clear-minded view and involved everybody as I will now outline.In addition, the decision to include the word "heritage" in the title of my Department, will reinforce the centrality of heritage issues within the Governmental system and highlight my Department's lead role in that regard. I am confident that the new arrangements will operate effectively, utilising the model for dividing responsibilities between my Department and the Office of Public Works devised during the review. In addition, interaction between my Department and the Office of Public Works will be assisted by  the establishment of a high level heritage liaison group.On the issue of consultation with staff, Deputy Quinn will know from his own experience in Government that changes in the distribution of functions between Departments have been implemented by successive Governments down through the years without such consultation. This reflects the long respected principle that decisions as to the apportioning of Government business between Departments are properly a matter for Government itself to determine and they are accepted not to be part of the industrial relations process.In the event, I arranged that the Department's staff would be consulted on the review just undertaken in relation to heritage functions. This was a facility which their counterparts affected by previous organisational changes, including the other changes announced last June, did not enjoy. During the review, meetings took place with many different groupings of staff right across the heritage area and with the trade unions concerned. It was unique in this context. It did not happen anywhere else and has not happened previously. I insisted that all receive an early draft report earlier this year and consultation and written submissions were accepted. The consultation process put in place for this review was open, transparent and extensive.Now that decisions on the new arrangements have been taken, we must turn our attention to the implementation phase. I am looking forward to a constructive working relationship between my Department and the Office of Public Works at both political and administrative levels so that we meet the very important objective – shared by all who participated in the review – of promoting and safeguarding our heritage. I acknowledge the participation of all the staff. I have taken great care and many months to consider all the options. I have taken peer review and looked at European models in great depth. Of the nine European countries I looked at, seven of the nine, excluding Northern Ireland and Norway, have environment departments with all the heritage functions married into them. That is the right course of action which we should follow.I felt that neither I nor the Department had the capacity to manage the whole operation of the built environment. There are excellent skills in the Office of Public Works. I have maximised those skills by transferring many of those skilled in conservation back under one organisation. I think it will work well. They will have tremendous autonomy in what they do. I have great confidence in them. I am personally committed to the heritage area.The Dáil adjourned at 10.35 p.m. until 2.30 p.m. on Wednesday, 7 May 2003.

Over many years, Bord Fáilte has taken advantage of the opportunities provided by several major international sporting events – international golfing events being a classic example – to market Ireland as both a general tourism destination and also as a sports tourism destination, as well as attracting visitors to Ireland in their own right.Many major international sporting events will not just be funded by gate receipts but by a variety of commercial income streams. These will arise from leasing retail/catering space, marketing stands, merchandising deals, sale of advertising, hospitality, etc. To be held at all, many major sporting events will have to be able to put forward a credible package of marketing opportunities and be able sell these to serious commercial players. This is a very specialized area and, in order to exploit some of the opportunities which it presents and to have an efficient, streamlined and transparent system for Bord Fáilte's participation in such events, the international sports tourism initiative was launched by the Government in 2000.Even though it has a ring-fenced allocation under Bord Fáilte's budget, the initiative is not a traditional grant scheme. Essentially, it is a framework which governs Bord Fáilte's participation in commercial relationships with event organisers. Bord Fáilte is paying for a set of benefits which the event organisers guarantee to provide. If the events do not deliver the benefits promised, a certain portion of the payment may be withheld and the prospects for future marketing investments by Bord Fáilte diminished.

I fully intend, in so far as is practicable, to endeavour to ensure that among the members of the authority there is an equitable balance between men and women. Moreover, the Arts Bill, Report Stage of which will shortly come before the Dáil, specifies that 50% of ordinary members of the Arts Council shall be women and 50% men.

With the Taoiseach, Ministers and Ministers of State visiting our key tourism markets – including Britain, North America, continental Europe, Canada and Australia – this year's programme of official overseas engagements for St. Patrick's Day presented a unique opportunity to ensure that Ireland was presented in a consistent manner as a top class tourist destination to a wide and receptive audience.To this end, my Department worked closely with the Department of Foreign Affairs and Tourism Ireland Limited to maximise the tourism promotional potential of these visits by making available to all Ministers travelling abroad special tourism briefing and speaking points which were customised for individual major markets. In addition, direct dialogue between Tourism Ireland's market offices and the diplomatic missions at an early stage of the planning process ensured that tourism interests were accommodated in so far as possible within the official programmes being arranged by the missions.The following examples illustrate how these visits were utilised for tourism promotion: in Australia, the Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Noel Dempsey, participated at a highly successful lunch event in Sydney organised by Tourism Ireland for the tourism trade interests in that market; in Seoul, the Minister of State at the Department of Finance, Deputy Tom Parlon, launched Tourism Ireland's website, which is now available in Korean for the first time ever; in South Africa, the Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, Deputy Éamon Ó Cuív, spoke at a tourism breakfast organised by Tourism Ireland for the tourism trade in that market; and in the US, I understand that Ministers travelling to this vital tourism market utilised the comprehensive briefing and speaking points provided by my Department at every available opportunity. In the current uncertainty in the international tourism market, particularly the US market, these visits were particularly useful in getting the message out that Ireland is open for tourism business and that the welcome is as warm as ever.

Unfortunately, as often happens when statistics are taken out of context, the report was not a completely accurate representation of the results from Bord Fáilte's latest visitor attitudes survey, which was conducted amongst overseas holiday visitors during the summer of 2002.In fact, the survey found that 94% of overseas visitors indicated that their holiday either matched or exceeded their expectations. Only a small minority of 6% were disappointed overall with their holiday experience. When asked, almost eight in ten visitors surveyed said that they would recommend a holiday in Ireland to a friend with virtually the remainder saying that they would recommend Ireland with some reservations.What is of concern to me, and something about which I have spoken consistently since taking up my present portfolio, is the level of dissatisfaction with the overall value for money that is emerging from all markets. As indicated in Deputy Ryan's question, the fact is that less than half of all overseas visitors, last year, were satisfied with the value for money on offer to them. This has to be seen in the context that the main influence on the choice of a holiday destination for half of holiday visitors to Ireland, are word of mouth recommendations of friends, relatives and others.

Projects under the programme must be directly related to the provision of sport and recreation facilities and be of a capital nature, which, for the purpose of the programme, is defined as: expenditure on the improvement or construction of an asset and includes any costs directly incurred in this process; and purchase of permanently based sports equipment, namely if it is securely housed, and will remain in use for five years or more.

However, after the unprecedented growth of the 1990's, the industry, in 2001 and last year, experienced two relatively disappointing years, and the prospects for this year in some areas are uncertain. While international political and economic factors have contributed to recent difficulties, I believe that we have to see what we ourselves can do to improve our international competitiveness and deliver better value for money.

Expressions of interest were sought from private sector investors for the development of a privately-financed stadium at Abbotstown. Some 23 submissions were received and have been evaluated. The evaluation of the various proposals received was carried out by my Department with the assistance of experts from Office of Public Works, the Department of Finance, National Treasury Management Agency, NTMA, and CSID Limited.Before bringing the matter to Government for final decision, I asked the IRFU and FAI, who have an urgent need for enhanced stadium facilities, to report to me by mid-April setting out their preferred options for stadium development.On receipt of this report I will examine its contents following which I will report to Government, taking cognisance of the proposals of the sports bodies and the evaluation of the expressions of interest received. My report will also deal with issues of stadium location, size and cost and will take into account the current budgetary situation.

The companies were set up to provide soft loan finance to new and expanding small enterprises and are constituted as companies limited by guarantee with charitable status for tax purposes. Membership is drawn from a wide geographic area throughout each county with representation from the business community, the co-operative movement, community organisations and the public sector.The county enterprise fund companies have the capacity to carry out a range of activities including involvement in small industry and community based economic projects. As community companies they are eligible for support from State agencies and other bodies such as the International Fund for Ireland, the EU INTERREG programme and the EU Special Support Programme for Peace and Reconciliation.I can confirm that, to date, the enterprise fund companies in Counties Cavan, Donegal, Leitrim, Monaghan and Sligo have sought and received assistance from the relevant county enterprise boards in their region.

#JoeWalsh	unknown-#JoeWalsh-party	unknown-#JoeWalsh-dob	unknown-#JoeWalsh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-16 00:00:00	Prelude	822	Looking at trends over the past decade, aggregate farm income, operating surplus, increased substantially between 1990 and 1996. There was a decline from 1997 to 1999, mainly due to the effects of the BSE crisis in the UK from 1996 onwards, the collapse of the Russian market in 1998 and weather related difficulties in 1998-99. Following these declines, the farm income situation improved in 2000 and again in 2001. Aggregate farm income, operating surplus, rose by 4.2% in 2001, despite the difficulties  caused by foot and mouth disease, following an increase of 8.6% in 2000. In the ten year period from 1991 to 2001, aggregate farm income rose by 36% while family farm income as measured in the Teagasc national farm survey went from €7,686 to €15,840 – a rise in nominal terms of 106%.The year 2002 was a difficult year for farming. Aggregate farm income fell by 8.9% to €2,381 million. The fall was caused by a combination of bad weather, a drop in beef slaughterings from their high level in 2001 and lower prices for many commodities.

Adult animals can become infected but it is rare, and they usually have other problems such as deficiencies with their immune system.Typically, most cases develop clinical signs between the ages of two and six years with the onset of clinical symptoms being precipitated by intensive farming systems, acid soils, poor nutrition, stress related transport, lactation, calving and immunosupression by other biological agents such as bovine virus diarrhoea, BVD, or by deficiency of essential elements. The disease can cause significant animal production and welfare problems. There is no satisfactory treatment and the majority of animals showing clinical symptoms will eventually die of the disease.

As I have previously said on many occasions, there is a wide range of important issues that must be taken into consideration and it is vital that all involved are consulted, be they staff concerned about their futures or departmental managements concerned about the delivery of the public services for which they have responsibility. Given these wide ranging considerations it is not possible for me to state, at this time, when the Government will be in a position to take a decision on the issue of decentralisation.

Accordingly, the daughter takes an inheritance of this one-half of the value of the dwelling house from her mother. Under the rules of inheritance tax, a child is entitled to take from a parent benefits tax-free up to a certain amount – group A threshold amount – provided no other benefits have been taken from either parent since 5 December 1991. The group A threshold amount for benefits taken during 2001 is €402,253.02. Where a benefit exceeds this amount. the excess is liable to inheritance tax at the rate of 20%. It would appear that the daughter would not be entitled to dwelling house exemption on the share of the dwelling house taken from her mother on the grounds that she  has not lived in the house for the three-year period prior to the date of her mother's death.

Under EU VAT law, with which Irish law must comply, it is not possible to introduce new zero rates of VAT, as we can only retain the zero rating that was in existence on 1 January 1991. This applies for the most part to food, oral medicines, books, children's clothes and shoes.Member states are permitted however to have up to two reduced rates of not less than 5% for a specified number of goods or services set out in annex H of the EU Sixth VAT Directive. Pharmaceutical products of a kind normally used in health care, prevention of diseases and treatment for medical and veterinary purposes, including products used for contraception and sanitary protection are included in Annex H. It would, therefore, be possible to have a reduced rate of VAT applying to such products, either our existing reduced rate of 13.5% or, if a second reduced rate was introduced, a minimum rate of 5%.Reducing the VAT rate on all non-oral medicines including condoms to 13.5% or 5% would cost the Exchequer €17.2 million or €36.7 million respectively in a full year. In addition, the introduction of a second reduced rate would increase pressure to introduce reduced rates for goods and services which are covered by Annex H of the Sixth VAT Directive. This could have significant consequences for Exchequer revenue from these sources. In any event, if there was a reduction in the rate of VAT applying to non-oral medicines including condoms, I am not convinced that any rate reduction would be necessarily reflected in retail prices for condoms or other non-oral medicines. Moreover, there are other factors at work which determine the level of pregnancies, planned or unplanned. A VAT rate change would not, therefore, necessarily help the objectives set out by the Deputy.

Montserrat's tourism industry was severely affected by a series of major volcanic eruptions during the late 1990s. An Irish consultancy organisation, CHL Consulting Group, was retained by the authorities in Montserrat to draw up the strategy document. We received last month a copy of a draft of this document.

It is considered that this is sufficiently flexible to allow for cases in need, and there is not currently an appeal system. Some 26.5% of students benefited from fee exemptions in 2002. On foot of a Government decision on 6 March 2003, the State Examinations Commission was established with a statutory responsibility for operational matters concerning the national certificate examinations. Application forms are issued by the commission to schools for distribution to each candidate. These forms provide for either the processing of payment of the fee, or the claim of an exemption by recording the medical card number and date of expiry, as appropriate.

The shortage was identified by the report on professional therapists undertaken by Dr. Peter Bacon and Associates in 2001. The announcement followed on the work of an interagency working group comprising representatives from my Department, the Department of Health and Children and the Higher Education Authority. The group was established to ensure the provision of these extra places. It considered proposals received from a number of third level institutions for the expansion of existing courses and-or the introduction of new courses, including graduate entry programmes.

It is intended that every primary school will implement SPHE by September. The primary curriculum support service has organised, on a phased basis, comprehensive in-career development programmes for all teachers in SPHE.A survey of post-primary schools in 2000 showed that 81% of post-primary schools were implementing RSE in some or all classes. A support service for SPHE up to junior cycle was established in 2000. Since then it has provided training and support to post-primary schools in all aspects of SPHE. The target is that all schools will have begun the implementation of SPHE, which will include RSE, by September. Extra training and support in the RSE element of SPHE is currently being offered to schools by the RSE support service, in conjunction with the SPHE support service.It is the policy of the national council for curriculum and assessment to carry out a rolling review of all curricula at primary and post-primary levels. The interim curriculum guidelines for senior cycle RSE will be reviewed as part of its inclusion in the broader curriculum for SPHE at senior cycle currently in development. An evaluation of all aspects of the SPHE junior cycle programme, including RSE, is currently under way.

When these allegations were originally brought to my Department's attention my officials corresponded with both sets of parents and the board of management. They set out the board's responsibilities and outlined my Department's complaints procedure. My officials subsequently received permission from the parents in both cases to pursue the matter on their behalf with the school's board of management.Following receipt of this permission in respect of the initial complaint the local inspector was requested to interview the various parties involved, including the parents. A report and recommendation on this case, which took account of its complex nature, was submitted to officials in my Department. They have communicated the outcome of this process to the family concerned and to the board of management.An investigation into the other complaint is currently under way and will be concluded following consideration of the inspector's report. The family concerned and the board of management will be informed of the outcome at that stage. Every effort is being made to conclude this matter as speedily as possible.

Due to the commercial sensitivities of site acquisition, I do not propose at this stage to identify the specific sites to be acquired. However, this information will be placed on the website when the relevant acquisitions have been completed.With regard to the proposed building project itself, in view of the scale of the capital programme for 2003 and having regard to the level of financial commitments to be met from projects already in construction, I do not envisage that my Department will be in a position during this year to initiate architectural planning for further large scale projects.

The regulation aims at implementing the resolution adopted by the IMO in 1993, the objective of which is to encourage the use of environmentally friendly tankers and the use of segregated ballast tanks in oil tankers. The regulation introduces a differential calculation system for fees for oil tankers to be followed by port, harbour and pilotage authorities in order to reach the objective of the IMO resolution.Under the EC treaties, regulations are directly applicable in all the member states without the need for any national implementing legislation. The regulation is binding on port, harbour and pilotage authorities within the Community being the authorities specified therein.The Harbours Acts 1996 to 2000 provide that a port company operating under the Acts may, in respect of pilotage services that are provided by pilots in its pilotage district, impose charges at such rates as are from time to time determined by it. Accordingly, in the event that any pilot is of the view that he or she is adversely affected by the application of the regulation, he or she should refer the matter to the relevant port company. The objective of the regulation is to encourage the use of environmentally friendly oil tankers.I bring to the attention of the Deputy the fact that the regulation is repealed as of 31 December 2007 by Regulation (EC) No. 417/2002 of the European Parliament and of the Council which deals with the accelerated phasing in of double hull or equivalent design requirements for single hull oil tankers. Accordingly, the preamble to the 2002 regulation notes that there are no reasons to maintain beyond 2007 the differential charging system for which the 1994 regulation provides.Section 80(2) of the Harbours Act 1996 provides for the possibility of a ministerial direction to a port company requiring it to comply with policy decisions of a general kind in relation to the levels of pilotage charges imposed. My Department has consulted the Office of the Attorney General in relation to the application in Ireland of the regulation and in particular in relation to the Shannon estuary. The clear legal advice is that a direction by me is not necessary.

I received an executive summary of their report yesterday and the final report will be available on 28 April next. I am currently examining the proposals in the IRFU and FAI executive summary report with a view to finalising my overall report to Government on all options for the provision of modern stadium facilities for major sporting events. This report will also incorporate my evaluation of expressions of interest received in the procurement of a privately funded stadium at Abbotstown. I do not intend making any further statement on the matter until the Government has decided on the further action to be taken.In relation to expenditure to date on the national stadium project, €3.1 million has been expended since 2000 on the Sports Campus Ireland project, including the National Aquatic Centre, in respect of planning, site survey work and general preparation and development of the entire campus site. Meetings have taken place with the three major sporting bodies, the Gaelic Athletic Association, the Football Association of Ireland and the Irish Rugby Football Union in connection with the stadium project.

In my statement of 26 February I intimated that my initial assessment of the expressions of interest received was that there would be difficulties in meeting the expectations of many of those who responded to the invitation. Since then, my Department has been contacted by two of those companies or consortia. Their concerns have been addressed and the current state of play has been clarified for them.It is my intention to report to Government, at an early date, on the issues involved in meeting the expectations of the major sporting bodies in the matter of providing modern stadium facilities. This report will incorporate my evaluation of the overall response received to the expressions of interest initiative as well as a report on the requirements and preferences of the IRFU and FAI for additional stadium facilities, which I expect to receive this week.

It is also one of the sites considered in an analysis being prepared by the IRFU and FAI on how best the stadium needs of these organisations might be met.The September 2002 report contained an estimated cost of site acquisition for each of the sites examined, where appropriate. However, these estimates constitute commercially sensitive information and in any event were simply indicative, as the acquisition cost could only be definitively determined by the marketplace. As it would prejudice the Government's negotiating position should the acquisition of the site ever become an issue, I do not consider that it would be in the public interest to divulge this information at this time.It is my intention to bring a proposal to Government to address the question of providing stadium facilities in the context, inter alia, of the response received to the expressions of interest initiative as well as the IRFU-FAI report.

I, therefore, see it as a priority to have an effective regime for the promotion of the arts in the international context. In the period since I took over my present portfolio, I have on various occasions made clear the fundamentals of my thinking on the promotion of the arts. These include the nurturing of genius, while doing as much as possible to broaden access to and participation in the arts among people generally. Included also is a belief that an effective regime of arts education is crucial not just for the future of the arts, but for the welfare and enrichment of the children themselves. I have also made clear my view that issues arise regarding the treatment of traditional arts.

The programme is advertised on an annual basis and any application which was unsuccessful the previous rounds of the programme lapse and such applicants must reapply on an annual basis. The 2003 programme was advertised in the national newspapers on 23 and 24 March 2003, inviting applications which must be received in my Department by 5 p.m. on Friday 25 April next.I will not be in a position to report on the number of applications to the programme until after that closing date. Nor will I be in a position to decide on the level of funding to be allocated until all of the applications received under the programme have been examined in accordance with the assessment procedures outlined in the guidelines, terms and conditions of the programme and taking into account the current level of indebtedness and the budgetary situation. In the past five years, grants in excess of €214 million have been allocated to almost 3,000 projects throughout the country.Under the local authority swimming pool programme, which is also administered by my Department, there are four stages in a swimming pool project, following the submission and approval of a feasibility study. These are in order of progress: preliminary report, contract document and tender and construction. My Department's technical advisors, the Office of Public Works, evaluate each stage and local authorities cannot proceed to the next stage of a project unless prior approval issues from my Department. Grant aid is allocated only when tenders have been approved for the project and is capped at the time of allocation. Proposals must comply with the standards laid down in the Department's procedures for the planning, approval and financing of swimming pools and technical guidelines.Under the programme, grants of up to a maximum of €3.8 million are available towards the refurbishment of existing pools or the provision of new pools, subject in both cases to the total grant not exceeding 80% of the eligible cost of the project or, in the case of projects located in designated disadvantaged areas, 90% of the eligible cost. Support is available towards the cost of the swimming pool, toddler pool, sauna and steam room.

The board has advised that the hospice unit, which has a bed complement of two beds, was officially opened on 23 January 1999. Part-time medical cover was provided locally at the time of the opening of the unit and it was subsequently decided that it was not possible to provide the required level of service at the unit without 24 hour medical cover. The board has advised that the unit remains closed because of difficulties in recruiting a medical officer and that this position has been advertised on two occasions, the most recent being in December 2002, but there have been no applications for this post to date.

However, I understand that one of the priorities for the commission over the next year will be to put in place the structures required for the operation of mental health tribunals. The mental health tribunals, operating under the aegis of the Mental Health Commission, will conduct a review of each decision by a consultant psychiatrist to detain a patient on an involuntary basis or to extend the duration of such detention.The Mental Health Commission will also appoint an inspector of mental health services which will replace the existing office of the inspector of mental hospitals. The inspector will be required to visit and inspect all approved centres at least once a year. The Minister will be empowered to make regulations specifying the standards to be maintained in all approved centres and these will be enforced by the inspector. The inspector's annual report and review of the mental health services will be published along with the commission's report.The commission has recently advertised the position of inspector of mental health services and three other senior administrative posts.

#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-16 00:00:00	Prelude	899	My Department and the Department of Social and Family Affairs are engaged in a major project to modernise the civil registration service. The project has developed new information systems, procedures and legislation to facilitate the electronic registration of vital events including births, stillbirths, deaths, marriages and adoptions and the electronic production of certificates. Archival records held by the General Register Office are being converted to an electronic format in a separate project in Roscommon.The implementation of a modern civil registration service is at the heart of providing better public services to citizens through the Government's modernisation programme. It is a key building block underpinning the integration of public service delivery and e-Government objectives of providing more convenient access to services. The new service will facilitate the sharing of information between Government agencies. Future registration of vital events will include a personal public service number, PPS No., which will be used as a unique customer reference number by public service providers, thereby facilitating opportunities for streamlining the provision of services from other Departments and public service organisations, as appropriate. At present a life event may only be registered in the district in which it occurred and this limits the access to copies of the records. It is proposed in future to improve access by allowing registration to take place in any registrar's office. Similar provisions will apply in relation to the issue of certificates. The number of offices located in each county and the number of registrars will be determined by reference to the needs of a particular area.The legal changes necessary to enable the direct electronic registration of births and deaths and the holding of birth, death and marriage records in an electronic format were included in the Social Welfare (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2002. Other provisions required to facilitate the wider modernisation of the registration service are being included in a new Civil Registration Bill, the drafting of which is currently being finalised. The new system has been successfully piloted during December 2002-January 2003 and the roll-out of the system is due to commence in June 2003.

However, as the agency was not fully operational until mid-2002, only €2.5 million expenditure was incurred in that year. The allocation to the agency for 2003 was €5.791 million. I am satisfied that the agency is capable of fulfilling its remit within its overall allocation.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-16 00:00:00	Prelude	902	Each health board is obliged to ensure that an equitable, accessible and comprehensive family planning service is provided in its area. The Department issued guidelines to the health boards in 1995 on the provision of comprehensive family planning services to all persons in their area who need such services. These services are provided primarily through general practitioners, NGOs and, to some extent, maternity hospitals-units.In recent years health boards have been asked to concentrate in particular on measures aimed at reducing unwanted pregnancies in the 15 to 34 age group and they are engaging in a range of initiatives in this regard. It is intended to continue to target initiatives at reduction, if possible, of the number of Irish women having abortions in Britain. The Crisis Pregnancy Agency will be working with health boards and with many other agencies in this regard.The information sought by the Deputy regarding the number of specialist family planning clinics in each health board area is not readily available. My Department has therefore written to the chief executive officer of each health board and the regional chief executive of the ERHA to request it. This information will be forwarded to the Deputy as soon as it is available.

The Status of Children Act 1987 amended section 7 of the Births and Deaths Registration Act (Ireland) 1880 by the substitution of sections 7 and 7A. These sections set out the procedures allowing for the registration of paternity details in such cases and included a provision for the registration of the father's details in the register of births on the joint application for registration by the parents or on the application by one or other parent with the co-operation of the other parent. They also provided for the registration of paternity details on the sole application of either the father or the mother of the child on the production of a certified copy of a court order naming the father of the child.

A briefing document has been prepared by the project team which I established. This document sets out the  broad scope of the future development of the hospital to be considered in the preparation of a development control plan. The Mid-Western Health Board has identified the following areas as priority areas for development, on completion of the plan: ward upgrade; accident and emergency; radiology; out-patients; and general infrastructure upgrade.The Mid-Western Health Board has endorsed the briefing document and requested approval to formally appoint the selected design team to prepare the development control plan.My Department is currently reviewing the national development plan for the health sector nationally in light of the outturn position for 2002. This process involves providing for existing capital contractual commitments and commencing, where possible, the planning or construction of new projects nationally in 2003 or beyond. The proposed developments at Ennis will be considered in that context.

Penalty points are being applied to the driving licence records of those convicted of such offences and to those who pay a fixed charge to the gardaí to prevent the instigation of court proceedings.The Road Traffic Act 2002, contains a specific structure that applies directly to the effective application of penalty points on the licence record of an individual. Section 5 of the Act provides that where penalty points are to be endorsed in a record, a notification of that endorsement must be issued to the licence holder involved. The notice sets out in particular the basis for the endorsement of the points. Section 7 of the Act provides that, save in limited and quite specific instances, the operative date for penalty points is 28 days from the date of the notice issued under section 5. The application of penalty points from the date of the alleged commission of an offence would not be appropriate in that the points would apply from a date that would precede either the payment of a fixed charge or the determination of guilt by a court.

I took the opportunity to explain the background to taxi liberalisation and the independent three person taxi hardship panel that was established by the Government to report in general terms on the nature and extent of extreme personal financial hardship that may have been experienced by individual taxi licence holders arising from loss of income as a direct result of liberalisation.I also explained that the Government has approved the implementation of the taxi hardship panel recommendations and that every effort will be made to put in place a structure to facilitate the commencement of payments on the basis of those recommendations as soon as possible. I have also agreed to have a further meeting with representatives from FAIR. I understand that the EU committee on petitions proposes to submit a further report on the FAIR petition in due course.

The draft will take account of economic, rail safety and road safety considerations as well as the need to protect costly transport infrastructure. Given the conflicting interests concerned, I envisage further consultations when the draft regulations are available  with a view to seeking consensus on the final shape of the regulations.The time scale for the introduction of the necessary regulations will depend in the first instance on the outcome of these consultations. Also, under Directive 98/34/EC, which deals, inter alia, with technical standards and regulations in regard to the avoidance of barriers to trade, it will be necessary to consult the European Commission which will in turn consult all other member states before the proposed new regulations may be made legally binding. I understand that no vehicle height restrictions currently apply in the UK but that Finland, Germany, the Netherlands and Sweden impose a vehicle height limit of four metres. I will arrange to forward information on the height restrictions which apply in the other member states to the Deputy shortly.

The proposal for a metro in Dublin is part of the Dublin Transportation Office's strategy, "A Platform for Change". Phase 1 of the metro involves a line from Blanchardstown and Dublin Airport to the city centre and to Shanganagh. Since then, the Railway Procurement Agency or RPA has concentrated its work on developing the outline business case for phase 1. The RPA has also conducted a preliminary public consultation and a pre-qualification exercise for potential bidders.In November 2002, my Department received the outline business case or OBC for phase 1 from the RPA. The OBC includes cost benefit analyses, a financing model, system options, a number of route alignment options, the estimated cost over the lifetime of the project and the estimated time scales involved. My Department is examining all elements of the OBC at present and, in particular, is in discussion with the RPA regarding the scope for reducing the costs involved. The possible effects which a project of this scale may have on the overall Exchequer finances and Ireland's obligations under the EU stability and growth pact are also being examined at present. No conclusions have yet been reached in this regard.

The first meeting of the UN ad hoc committee was held in New York from 29 July to 9 August 2002. The next meeting of the committee will be held from 16 to 27 June next in New York.Ireland believes the guiding principle of any new legal instrument in the area of disability should be to ensure that persons with disabilities can better enjoy their human rights. Ireland, along with our EU partners, will aim to ensure that the processes and outcomes of the ad hoc committee meet this principle. In advance of its next meeting, Ireland will work with our EU partners in an effort to reach a common position in regard to the future work of the ad hoc committee.

In particular, I am informed that much of the crime is committed by criminals from outside the area and this can add to the difficulties in detecting the perpetrators.

Application Number S2002SM01306J refers.The Deputy will be aware that duplicate land certificate applications take time to process due to the fact that notices have to issue to a number of institutions, an advertisement needs to be placed in the Law Society Gazette and certain time limits have to elapse before the application can receive further consideration. I am informed by the Registrar of Titles that a query in relation to this application and also correspondence regarding the advertisement in relation to the lost land certificate was issued to the lodging solicitor on 18 March, 2003 for publication of the notice in the Law Society Gazette. I am also informed that notices in relation to this application were sent to relevant institutions who may be able to assist the Land Registry with this application on 18 March, 2003. I understand that no responses have been received to date.Once the notice period expires and on receipt of a satisfactory reply to the query raised, the application will receive further consideration.

I am further informed that an inquest was held on 19 March, 2003. As the circumstances of this person's death were exhaustively investigated first by the Garda Síochána and then in public at the inquest, I have no plans to initiate an inquiry into the matter.

The spouse of the person concerned failed the asylum process and was subsequently deported to Kosovo. I was subsequently made aware of a marriage having taken place in Kosovo between the person concerned and her spouse following his deportation. I then reviewed the case file but did not see any reason to revoke the deportation order already made. This decision was recently communicated to the legal representatives of the person concerned.In relation to the request for a senior official to meet the person concerned, I do not see any useful purpose in such a meeting taking place. If there are any new facts on this case they should be brought to my attention in writing and the matter will then be considered further.
#MartinCullen	unknown-#MartinCullen-party	unknown-#MartinCullen-dob	unknown-#MartinCullen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-04-16 00:00:00	Prelude	924	The county-city development boards or CDBs, representative of  local government, local development bodies, State agencies and the social partners, were established in early 2000 on foot of a recommendation by the task force on the integration of local government and local development systems. The boards were given statutory recognition in the Local Government Act 2001.A key function of the CDBs is to bring about the more co-ordinated and integrated delivery of local development and public services at local level. As part of this remit, the boards published their ten year strategies for the economic, social and cultural development of their areas during 2002 and are currently overseeing the implementation of these strategies by their member agencies. The role of the CDBs is recognised in a wide range of Government policies, including the recent joint initiative involving the Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform and myself to bring greater cohesion to local and community development programmes. As part of this initiative, and in line with the boards' co-ordinating role, it was decided that various local agencies and boards should submit their 2003 business plans to the CDBs for endorsement. County and city child care committees are also included within this arrangement.The question of assigning further functions to the CDBs will be kept under review by the task force which continues in operation and which I chair.

Under strands I and II of the RAPID programme, an area implementation team was established in each of the 45 areas to develop a plan for their area. The plans for both strands have been completed and proposals forwarded to the relevant Departments for consideration.It is a matter for each of the other Departments to report on the implementation of the programme that falls within the remit of their Department. As regards my own Department, proposals from the RAPID plans fall to be considered under the young peoples facilities and services fund or YPFSF, the community development programme or CDP and funding for local drugs task forces. In the case of proposals relevant to the YPFSF, proposals submitted under the RAPID plans will be considered in the context of decisions to be made under round II and in light of the overall funding position for 2003.

Allocations from within the budget available for the programme in 2003 were recently agreed by the board of ADM and notified to each partnership and community group. ADM must manage the programme from within the budget available in my Department's Vote. Reductions in available funding for 2003 are being managed on a sliding scale, ranging from 4%-7%, depending on the annual budget of the partnership/community group.I am working with ADM and the partnerships to minimise as far as possible the impact of the reduction in funding this year. Details of allocations to area partnership companies, community groups and employment pacts for 2003 follow. For payments prior to 2002 I refer the Deputy to ADM's annual report for the year in question.
