            <from>The Taoiseach</from>
            <p eId="para_6">I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 to 5, inclusive, together.</p>
            <p eId="para_7">The Cabinet sub-committee on climate change and energy security has met nine times since August 2007 when it was established.  The most recent meeting was on 29 April last.</p>
            <p eId="para_8">I also chair the Cabinet sub-committee on health.  The other members are the Ministers for Health and Children and Finance and the Minister of State with responsibility for children and youth affairs.  Other Ministers who are not members of a Cabinet sub-committee may attend meetings where appropriate.  This committee has met on 13 occasions since June 2007.  Its most recent meeting was on Wednesday, 27 May, and it is next scheduled to meet on Wednesday, 22 July.</p>

            <from>Deputy Liz McManus</from>
            <p eId="para_9">I thank the Taoiseach for his reply, but he did not tell us how many times he attended.  Can I take it from his reply that he attended all the climate change sub-committee meetings?</p>
            <p eId="para_10">On climate change law, could the Taoiseach clarify his position on the introduction of a climate change Bill to this House?  Does he concur with the view of the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, who stated that the Bill would be introduced to the House before the end of this year?  The Minister indicated that the Bill will be on a par with the United Kingdom legislation.</p>
            <p eId="para_11">On the forthcoming global conference in Copenhagen in six months' time, in his role as chair of the sub-committee, does the Taoiseach not consider it would be helpful, in order to ensure we reach a wise and significant conclusion, if he were to lead the delegation to the global conference in Copenhagen at the end of the year?  This would show the leadership that the Minister, Deputy Gormley, has called for on a number of occasions.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#JohnODonoghue" as="#Ceann_Comhairle" eId="spk_3">
            <from>An Ceann Comhairle</from>
            <p eId="para_12">The Deputy is extending the remit of the question somewhat but we will see how helpful the Taoiseach can be on it.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#BrianCowen" as="#Taoiseach" eId="spk_4">
            <from>The Taoiseach</from>
            <p eId="para_13">As the Deputy will be aware, all Cabinet meetings are conducted under the principle of collective responsibility, so providing specific detail on the attendance at the meetings would impinge on that principle.  That is only to say that I think I have attended them all.</p>
            <p eId="para_14">The question on legislation is a matter for Government to consider at any time.  Our commitment is as outlined in the programme for government.  On the question of my attendance in Copenhagen, that is a matter that can be decided upon closer to the time.  The European Union, working collectively on the matter, is seeking to prepare for that conference under the able chairmanship of the new Danish Prime Minister.  We will continue to work in that way with him.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#LizMcManus" eId="spk_5">
            <from>Deputy Liz McManus</from>
            <p eId="para_15">I wish to ask a brief supplementary on the EU position, which is that the targets should be increased to 30% by 2020, if there is agreement globally.  Is that the Taoiseach's position, and will he promote it as Ireland's position?</p>
            <p eId="para_16">On climate change legislation, the Minister has now stated that there will be a Bill, which he expects will be introduced before the end of the year.  Is that the Taoiseach's position?  The Bill is not in the programme for Government so there is not much point in referring to that programme.</p>

            <from>The Taoiseach</from>
            <p eId="para_18">Those are matters for the line Minister.  They are policy issues.  As a general principle it is open to Ministers to bring forward any proposal to Government for approval and it is up to the Government to decide to approve it.  We operate under a collective authority.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#EamonGilmore" eId="spk_8">
            <from>Deputy Eamon Gilmore</from>
            <p eId="para_19">He has not done so yet.</p>
          </speech>

            <from>The Taoiseach</from>
            <p eId="para_20">No, that has not occurred yet.  On the other matter the Deputy raised, the EU's objective is that a new international treaty will be agreed at the conference of the parties at the Copenhagen meeting in December 2009 to come into effect when the five-year commitment under the Kyoto Protocol expires at the end of 2012.

            <p eId="para_21">I assume this committee does not meet for the sake of meeting, but that it has targets and objectives.  The current legislative agenda and the website of the Office of the Taoiseach states that during this session the Government would publish legislation to support offshore energy development through the modernisation of the planning process, but there is no mention of that in the recently published Planning and Development (Amendment) Bill 2009.  Will the Taoiseach explain that contradiction?  I have raised before the fact that the Joint Committee on Climate Change and Energy Security, chaired by Deputy Seán Barrett, published a Bill on this matter.  Following analysis by the committee, will the Government commit to accepting the Bill given that it failed to produce its own?  Does the Taoiseach intend to include offshore energy projects as part of the critical infrastructure Bill in view of their importance?</p>
            <p eId="para_22">In a letter dated 15 May 2009, the Chief Scientific Adviser to the Government, Professor Cunningham, a very able man, referred in particular to the harnessing of wind power to pump seawater to storage reservoirs.  He made the point that, in principle, such as system could actually supply the full power requirements of this country.  He stated in the letter to the Minister that there are at least 50 sites throughout the country where the system could be implemented and that a reservoir of 2 sq. km would supply 1 GW of electricity, which is the equivalent of the output of Moneypoint.  He also stated the planned upgrading of the electricity grid, costing €11 billion, could be obviated by investment in these kinds of generation systems, and that costings indicate it should be a highly profitable investment both for the country and private investors.  He stated the overall cost of achieving energy independence is between €10 billion and €12 billion.  Has the climate change sub-committee considered this?</p>
            <p eId="para_23">Is it the case that the committee does not set out the big picture from the Taoiseach's perspective and have line Ministers follow through?  The letter from the Chief Scientific Adviser is very important.  In it, he sets out his position formally.  It is very clear and we have advocated it on this side of the House for some time.  Has the sub-committee the Taoiseach chairs actually considered the big-picture objectives and targets?</p>

            <p eId="para_25">Cabinet sub-committees comprise an integral part of the Cabinet process and questions about the business conducted at Cabinet or Cabinet sub-committee meetings have never been allowed in the House on the grounds that it is internal to the Government.  The reasons for this approach, as the Deputy knows, are founded on sound policy principles and the need to avoid infringing the constitutional protection of Cabinet confidentiality.  Questions relating to particular policy issues should be directed to the relevant Minister.</p>
            <p eId="para_26">To be helpful to Deputy Kenny, I can only say that all major issues applying to the climate change agenda have been discussed at various times in respect of the nine meetings held since 7 August.  The question of energy security has been dealt with in the context of the implementation of the White Paper on energy, brought forward by the former Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, Deputy Noel Dempsey, and subsequently implemented by the current Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, Deputy Eamon Ryan.  There is a commitment to increasing the wind energy component of our national energy grid to the tune of 30% by 2020.  Considerable work on the matter is ongoing.  The volatility of oil prices and the difficulties we are having in bringing onshore a very substantial national asset off the coast of Deputy Kenny's constituency further emphasise the need for the energy security agenda to be supported by every Member of the House.</p>

This needs to be addressed.  I hope the sub-committee has considered the creation of a permit system for wind farms because at the present rate of dealing with these it will be 20 years before applicants get through the queue gate that is installed.  Where there is community good will, with community leaders and people who want to set up wind farms and either have permission or are very likely to get it, there is no possibility of their being connected to the grid system in under 20 years given the current state of processing.  That is not as it should be if the big picture is the achievement of energy independence inside ten to 15 years.</p>

I expect the Taoiseach also holds that view.

            <p eId="para_50">In a previous reply I detailed the number of times the sub-committee has met to deal with various issues, including important decisions made on climate change during the past two years and in preparation for the meeting in Copenhagen.  Many of them are dealt with at EU level, which involves co-ordinating positions and ensuring that particular Irish concerns are taken into account on the sequestration of carbon, forestry and all the technical matters that come into play when assessing where the burden sharing is to take place and in what way Ireland's interests are being protected and fair play is given to the country, given the particular characteristics of our farming and forestation, in line with the cases made by other countries and sought by the Presidency, in this case the French Presidency, as it seeks to pull together a common EU position in preparation for the Copenhagen meeting in December which is a wider international negotiating forum.</p>
            <p eId="para_51">This is a continuing requirement and the Cabinet sub-committee is there to consider the technical details, the state of negotiations and the contribution made by various Departments and what studies are being done.

It has met on the occasions mentioned by Deputy Ó Caoláin and child protection issues were discussed at its most recent meeting.  The Minister of State with responsibility for children has been asked by the Government to prepare a detailed implementation plan arising out of the Ryan report to be brought to the Government prior to the end of July.</p>

What further address of the recommendations will the Cabinet sub-committee undertake over the period ahead?  Does the committee also address health policy?

Has the sub-committee given consideration to how fast the fast-tracking has been over the four-year period since 2005?  None of the co-located hospitals has materialised and not a single bed has been fast-tracked.  Is consideration being given to examining a different fast track now for the provision of hospital beds, since the fast track chosen by the Minister clearly has run into something of a siding?</p>

          <p eId="para_76">My question relates to the Cabinet Sub-Committee on Climate Change and Energy Security.  Does the Taoiseach receive reports or a copy of the minutes from the committee I chair, the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Climate Change and Energy Security?  This committee has met 37 times since it was established in November 2007, but we have received very little feedback from the Cabinet sub-committee.  The Oireachtas committee is unique in that it is an all-party committee that endeavours to operate on an all-party basis at all times.  The committee includes members from all parties in the Dáil and Seanad and includes Independent Members.</p>
          <p eId="para_77">The work of the Oireachtas committee will only be successful if there is co-operation between the Government and the committee.  One of our major initiatives was to prepare legislation on an all-party basis to fill a void that existed in the energy area — the Offshore Renewable Energy Development Bill.  We were told by those who made submissions to us there was a possibility of a €16 billion investment in this area.  However, apart from an acknowledgment from the Taoiseach, as chairperson of the sub-committee, we did not even receive the courtesy of a note from the sub-committee commenting on the legislation.</p>
          <p eId="para_78">I wonder whether we are wasting time on the Oireachtas committee or whether it was only established as a front to placate the Green Party.  I and my colleagues could have done a lot more with our time than waste it attending 37 meetings since November 2007 without the co-operation of the Government.  Ireland could become a net exporter of energy in the foreseeable future if we had investment into the European supergrid following upgrading of our grid.  Our committee is not a Mickey Mouse one that meets to keep us all amused.  We are talking about jobs, significant investment, including inward investment into the country in the future, and the replacement of massive quantities of imports.  Currently we import 90% fossil fuels to produce our energy.</p>
          <p eId="para_79">Are we really wasting our time on this committee or is a serious effort being made to deal with this matter?  We have endeavoured to do our part.  I have the great honour of chairing this committee and am very fortunate to have many committed members, some of whom are present here.  Can we have greater co-operation between us and the Cabinet sub-committee?  Should we scrap our papers on the Private Members' Bill we have prepared and leave it to individual parties to use Private Members' time to deal with the issue?  Is the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources really serious about dealing with this issue?  I would like to know this so I can report back to the committee at its next meeting, tomorrow.</p>
          <p eId="para_80">Are we serious about dealing with offshore wind and wave energy or not?  There are no structures in place here currently to allow the development of that industry.  There is no planning structure in place, yet we are told there is some €16 billion of potential investment waiting to be put into the sector.</p>

The question asked by Deputy Ó Caoláin earlier about the decision of our transport company to cut back on public transport also has an impact on the area of climate change.  In one breath we lecture people and tell them to use public transport, but in the next breath we tell them we are taking buses off the road.  Are we really serious about dealing with this issue?</p>

          <p eId="para_86">The reorganisation of the bus fleet in Dublin or anywhere else depends on the facts.  From memory, bus passenger numbers are down by 10% which, against a background of finite budgets, means that some reorganisation has to take place in the interest of providing a sustainable public transport system in the city.  These are the challenges management in that company, as in other companies, have to face, in the face of a downturn in the usage of public transport.  It is important that we bear those issues in mind as we try to provide a service to the people.</p>
          <p eId="para_87">The issue Deputy Barrett raised is a matter on which I saw correspondence between the Minister and the committee some time ago.  My understanding of the situation was that while it does have interdepartmental responsibilities, the Minister, Deputy Ryan is not solely responsible for this matter but he indicated a preparedness to meet with the committee and see in what way the arguments being put forward by it can be advanced.  The best prospect of doing that is by direct engagement with the line Minister concerned.</p>
          <p eId="para_88">The Cabinet committee is a creature of Cabinet and takes some of the workload from Cabinet in its full plenary session on to the committee's work.  Policy formulation or proposals on offshore energy production and the potential our coasts and waters have for such proposals are matters that can and should be advanced with the line Minister and Department.  Inviting people in, including those with technical expertise and the political heads of Department, to see in what way progress is being made would be beneficial.  I will also raise the matter personally with the Minister.</p>

          <p eId="para_89">I appreciate the Taoiseach's response.  Regarding what Deputy Barrett has said, none of us on the committee would want to raise these issues here on questions to the Taoiseach, except for the fact that the recourse he is proposing is not working.  I ask the Taoiseach to respond as to how we move beyond the arrangements he is suggesting should work but are not working.  We have had Ministers before the committee, it has proposed legislation and nothing is happening.</p>
          <p eId="para_90">I have no doubt the Taoiseach, as Chairman of the sub-committee, is very conscious of the urgency regarding climate change.  It is the largest challenge facing us, in terms of our global responsibilities but the record is not good.  Will the Taoiseach consider organising a meeting between the members of the Cabinet sub-committee and the Members of the Oireachtas committee in preparation for Copenhagen at the end of the year?  We have to do things differently because the world is changing and because of the threat of climate change.  So far, nothing is being done differently to the way it was done before.  I urge the Taoiseach to look at this in a different way.</p>
          <p eId="para_91">I have a suggestion to make to which the Taoiseach might respond.  If we had a meeting between the Cabinet sub-committee and the Oireachtas committee, it may lead the way, in terms of resolving issues here at home and our approach internationally.  We are one of the greatest polluters in Europe.  Either we will continue with that shame or we will work towards low carbon economic growth, which is the commitment we are making internationally but are not living up to at home.</p>

            <from>Minister for Defence (Deputy Willie O’Dea)</from>
            <p eId="para_130">The development of the medical corps in the Defence Forces forms part of the agreed programme for Government.  I am committed to providing a sustainable medical service to meet the needs of the Defence Forces both at home and abroad.  As the Deputy is no doubt aware, the challenges in the medical arena have been recognised for some time and a review of the provision of medical services has been ongoing as part of the modernisation agenda for the Defence Forces.  In view of the complexity of the challenge facing the Defence Forces in this area, I decided to engage PA Consulting to make recommendations on the best means of meeting the medical requirements of the Defence Forces.  To meet this objective PA Consulting reviewed the medical services required for the Defence Forces in light of its roles and operations as required by Government, assessed the current arrangements for the provision of medical services and proposed a model for future delivery of medical services.</p>
            <p eId="para_131">The consultants recommended a programme of major change.  Their report makes a number of recommendations, including a centralised command structure and the creation of a medical services management and administrative function.  This structure will provide strategic planning, resource allocation and overall responsibility for the management and delivery of the medical service.  They also propose the development of medical officer lead care teams together with a refocusing of medical staff on appropriate clinical tasks.  The report also recommends steps leading to a reduction in the number of doctor interventions and medical assessments and better management of health services outsourcing.  The structure and systems recommended have been designed to meet the needs and demands of modern Defence Forces at home and overseas and provide medical officers with a fulfilling and rewarding career.</p>
            <p eId="para_132">The report reaffirms the need for a dedicated medical corps and addresses the challenges facing the Defence Forces in the recruitment and retention of medical officers.  Implementation of the recommendations will result in major change at both strategic and operational levels in the Defence Forces.  Thankfully in these difficult times, the report shows that major additional investment is not needed to meet the medical needs of the Defence Forces.  Change will be achieved in the main through better use of the available resources.  The PA report is an important milestone in addressing the challenges to the provision of medical services in the Defence Forces.  Implementation will take time and commitment.  This will be achieved in consultation with the representative associations.  I have asked that implementation of the recommendations of the report proceed immediately.</p>
            <p eId="para_133">The report makes a number of recommendations regarding a governance structure for change delivery in this area.  The structure recommended, including a high level steering group composed of both military and civilian personnel, will be used.  At a lower level a dedicated programme group with civilian and military representatives will manage the delivery of a suite of projects identified by the consultants.  I welcome the recommendations and fully support their implementation.  Implementation by the military authorities will commence immediately.  Certain recommendations will require further elaboration.  Consultation with the representative associations will also take place.</p>

            <from>Deputy Jimmy Deenihan</from>
            <p eId="para_134">I welcome the report.  I remind the Minister this was the first question I put when I became an Opposition spokesperson on defence.  I am pleased the Minister has responded and set up and appointed a group of consultants to draw up a very comprehensive report.  I believe the Minister would agree this is a damning report on the present level of health services to which our Defence Forces are exposed.</p>
            <p eId="para_135">We have a very professional Defence Force which has responded very positively to the White Paper.  It is now very well equipped, the command structure is streamlined and, overall, it is an extremely fit, lean force.  However, in the medical area the Department has fallen down and it has taken several years for the Minister to realise as much.</p>
            <p eId="para_136">Let us consider the findings of the report.  For example, there is a 60% shortfall in medical assessment in the Defence Forces, which is damning and puts the lives of personnel at risk.  There are chronic difficulties in recruiting medical personnel, especially for overseas missions.  A very basic service such as physiotherapy is outsourced.  Given the large number of physiotherapists available at present, it should be easy to recruit several to work within the Defence Forces in some fashion.  Some 30% of dental care is outsourced.  Referrals to HSE, Health Service Executive, secondary and acute care are not tracked or monitored hence there are potentially dangerous gaps in medical reports.</p>
            <p eId="para_137">Overall this is a very critical report.  I realise the Minister has given some assurances today that the findings of the report will be implemented immediately.  Specific health care teams comprising doctors, nurses and physiotherapists could be set up immediately by the Minister.  Will he give a commitment to the House that he will begin to implement the recommendations in this report immediately?  Is the funding ring-fenced?  He said there would be very little financial commitment.  Is funding available to implement these proposals immediately?</p>

            <p eId="para_138">I do not accept the report is a damning indictment of the Defence Forces medical services.  It is clear from the report that medical treatment is available to members of the Defence Forces when they need it, whether that be from within the Defence Forces or from outside.</p>
            <p eId="para_139">I agree with Deputy Deenihan that there is considerable outsourcing, particularly in the physiotherapy area, and 30% of dental care work is outsourced.  It must be borne in mind that there will always be outsourcing of medical facilities available to the Defence Forces because the Defence Forces medical services are not equipped to carry out certain procedures.  A better management of outsourcing is required and it would be preferable to have as little outsourcing as possible.  Good work has been done by the Army medical staff, but the model does not meet the needs of a modern army.  The Department appointed consultants to advise on how to resolve that issue and we will take their recommendations on board.</p>
            <p eId="para_140">In answer to Deputy Deenihan's question as to the timeframe for the implementation of the report's recommendations, we must first talk to the representative associations and a number of stakeholders must be consulted.  I have asked the Department to begin implementing what can be done immediately.</p>

            <p eId="para_142">The Irish Red Cross Society is an autonomous charitable body with full powers to manage and administer its affairs through its governing body, the central council.  I have no function in the day-to-day administration of the Irish Red Cross and, as such, I am not involved in the day-to-day running of its affairs.</p>
            <p eId="para_143">I am not aware of any allegations of underperformance of the Irish Red Cross in Ireland and overseas.  I received correspondence earlier this year from a member of the central council, who informed me of her decision to resign from the council of the society.  In the letter, the council member expressed concerns to me about governance, accountability and transparency issues within the society.  I forwarded the letter, with the consent of the person concerned, to the chairman of the society.</p>
            <p eId="para_144">I understand that a range of issues relating to the governance, organisational structures and electoral arrangements of the society are currently the subject of consideration by a governance committee within the society.  That committee is expected to report to the executive committee and the central council before the end of this year.</p>
            <p eId="para_145">The contents of the report will be subject to discussion between the Departments of the Taoiseach, Foreign Affairs and Defence and the Irish Red Cross Society and the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies.</p>

            <from>Deputy Brian O’Shea</from>
            <p eId="para_146">I thank the Minister for his reply.  He will recall that when I raised this with him previously the issues that had been described to me included an appalling industrial relations record, high turnover of staff and a history of general secretaries being dismissed.  I understand the last general secretary was dismissed in 2007 during the course of a dispute and that she was the fifth or sixth general secretary to have been dismissed.  The current general secretary is a career civil servant on loan from the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform.</p>
            <p eId="para_147">The Minister states he does not interfere in the day-to-day running of the organisation.  The issue that has been raised with me, and which was raised in the letter sent to the Minister by that person earlier in the year, relates to governance.  One of the main allegations is that the chairperson has been reappointed for the fourth time for a three-year tenure and that this reappointment was not greeted internally with any great enthusiasm.  The Minister also appoints 14 members to the council of the society.  One of the allegations is that these people and the chairman are political appointees to an independent organisation whose work is both national and international.</p>
            <p eId="para_148">The Minister referred this letter to the chairman of the society.  The alleged issues of governance relate to the board and the chairman and the Minister appoints the board.  Has he considered the fact that many of these people have been on the board for a long time and have been reappointed many times?  It appears to me that the Minister's hands-off attitude is not appropriate in light of the letter he received earlier this year and the issues I am raising today.  He said at the committee meeting that he would reply to me.</p>

            <from>Deputy Willie O’Dea</from>
            <p eId="para_149">I apologise to the Deputy and I will reply to his query.</p>
            <p eId="para_150">The governance committee of the Irish Red Cross Society is currently examining various issues of governance and I will await the outcome of its deliberations.  The chairman is appointed for a three-year term and this is the fourth time he has been reappointed.  However, I have been informed that the general view, except for one or two people, is that he has been a very good chairman.  I noted much enthusiasm within the society when I reappointed the existing chairman.</p>
            <p eId="para_151">As regards the reappointment of the members of the council, the legislation stipulates that the Government must appoint a number of people which is not less than one third of the total membership.  This means the Government must appoint at least 14 people because the society's local branches elect 28 people.</p>
            <p eId="para_152">As Minister for Defence, I stand over everyone I have appointed.  I have taken some pains to ensure that those being appointed would have some contribution to make.  I spoke personally to everyone I appointed and I discussed with them their functions and what problems needed to be dealt with.  I have tried to ensure that people appointed to these positions would have a contribution to make and they are making that contribution.  I will await the report of the governance committee.</p>
            <p eId="para_153">I do not wish to deal with the specific allegations Deputy O'Shea has raised.  I know the contents of the letter, which has been passed on.  Over the years there have been one or two other complaints of an anonymous nature to which we did not lend too much credence.  I have received one or two complaints about governance but these are matters for the governance committee.  I have not received any specific complaint about underperformance, either at home or abroad.</p>

            <from>Deputy Willie O’Dea</from>
            <p eId="para_157">In the context of the Government decision on the implementation of savings measures on public service numbers and the reduced budgetary provision available for 2009, all recruitment to the Reserve Defence Forces had been suspended.  Following a review and examination of Reserve Defence Force personnel numbers and budget, I am satisfied that there is sufficient provision to allow for paid training for existing members of the Army Reserve and Naval Service Reserve this year.  Accordingly, I have recently approved the commencement of limited recruitment to fill vacancies which may arise due to existing Army Reserve or Naval Service Reserve members resigning or being discharged during 2009, in the normal manner.</p>
            <p eId="para_158">The numbers that may be recruited will depend on the numbers leaving and any such vacancies will be filled over the coming weeks and months, drawing from the current list of applicants.  This limited recruitment will be monitored and kept under review in the light of the uptake of paid training within the Reserve Defence Force and the future budgetary provision.  The savings measures are being implemented in the Permanent Defence Force.  I am in contact with my colleague, the Minister for Finance, about the implications of the measures for the Permanent Defence Force.  My focus is on the ongoing operational capability of the Defence Forces.  The question of limited exceptions to the application of the measures arises in this regard. It is therefore too early to confirm if there will be a cadet class this year.</p>
            <p eId="para_159">I can confirm that normal advancements within the Permanent Defence Force do not fall within the scope of the savings measures.  This includes such categories as existing cadets being commissioned following cadet training and general service recruits who have already been enlisted and who are completing their course of training.  Consequently, such advancements are now proceeding in the normal way.</p>
            <p eId="para_160">Approval has been granted in respect of the appointment, by promotion, of a successor to the incumbent director of military prosecutions, who is due to retire next month.  The appointment will be filled by way of competition.  The competition process is underway at present.</p>
            <p eId="para_161">The Defence Forces have improved in every respect since 2000 through the implementation of the White Paper.  This represents a significant public service success story.  The organisation is therefore in a healthy state both in terms of personnel and equipment.  The economic reality is such that the Government decision must be implemented.  It can be anticipated that further flexibility and restructuring will be required arising from the implementation of these measures.  I intend, within the resources available, to retain the capacity of the organisation to operate effectively across all roles.  This will represent a significant challenge in the coming years and one in respect of which I will work closely with the Chief of Staff.</p>
            <p eId="para_162">I am advised that the Defence Forces retain the capacity to undertake the tasks laid down by Government at home and overseas.</p>

          <speech by="#JimmyDeenihan" eId="spk_105">
            <from>Deputy Jimmy Deenihan</from>
            <p eId="para_163">I welcome the fact that the Minister has confirmed that promotions will take place within the Defence Forces and that the moratorium does not affect promotions.  As the Permanent Defence Force is a hierarchical organisation promotions are very important in the chain of command.</p>
            <p eId="para_164">Given that approximately 350 members of the Defence Forces will retire this year and others, because of uncertainty regarding taxation of the retirement gratuity, may retire before their time, there will be an outflow of people from the Permanent Defence Force.  This will affect our capacity to carry out overseas missions and other duties.  The Minister has lifted the moratorium on recruitment to the Reserve Defence Force.  Why can he not do the same for the Permanent Defence Force?  Why can those who will leave the Defence Forces this year not be replaced?</p>
            <p eId="para_165">Young blood is particularly essential for the Defence Forces.  It is important that young, energetic and fit people are recruited.  Otherwise the force could go stale.</p>
            <p eId="para_166">I am glad the Minister clarified the matter of promotion.  In the interest of the Defence Forces and their future, can he give a commitment that, at the very least, those who leave the Defence Forces will be replaced?</p>

            <from>Deputy Willie O’Dea</from>
            <p eId="para_167">I repeat what I stated regarding promotions:</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_168">I can confirm that normal advancements within the Permanent Defence Force do not fall within the scope of the savings measures.  This includes such categories as existing cadets being commissioned following cadet training, and general service recruits who have already been enlisted and who are completing their course of training.  Consequently, such advancements are now proceeding in the normal way.</p>
            <p eId="para_169">With regard to other promotions and Deputy Deenihan's question about the replacement of people who will retire this year, the Permanent Defence Force and the Reserve Defence Force are quite different.  The Reserve Defence Force is a voluntary organisation.  The Department of Defence pays for a number of training days per annum for the Reserve Defence Force.  Membership of the Permanent Defence Force is something else entirely. We must observe the moratorium on recruitment.</p>
            <p eId="para_170">I have written to the Minister for Finance and I will speak to him shortly with regard to that correspondence.  I have asked for various matters to be clarified and for exceptions to the moratorium to be made.  I expect to meet the Minister shortly to discuss my request.</p>

           the number of projects and programmes entered into by Ireland through the European Defence Agency to date; the number which did not contribute to our ability to participate in United Nations mandated missions; if the Chief of Staff of the Defence Forces was consulted prior to his decision to restrict Ireland’s participation in the European Defence Agency; if European Defence Agency projects and programmes to date entered into by Ireland breached Ireland’s neutrality; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

          <speech by="#WillieODea" eId="spk_109" as="#Minister_for_Defence">
            <from>Deputy Willie O’Dea</from>
            <p eId="para_174">The European Defence Agency was established under a Joint Action of the Council of Ministers on 12 July 2004, "to support the member states and the Council in their effort to improve European defence capabilities in the field of crisis management and to sustain the European Security and Defence Policy as it stands now and develops in the future".  Following Government approval, Ireland joined the EDA when it was established during the Irish Presidency in 2004.  Ireland participates in the framework of the agency and I represent Ireland on the EDA steering board.  The steering board acts under the Council's authority and within the framework of guidelines issued by the Council.</p>
            <p eId="para_175">Since its inception, the agency has made significant progress on many projects and programmes.  Ireland is a contributor to initiatives and the ongoing work programme of the EDA, which includes identifying and overcoming shortfalls in capabilities development to increase the capacity of the Union to undertake appropriate peace support operations.  These include initiatives in relation to chemical, biological, radiological, nuclear and explosives protection, CBRNE, communication and network systems and improved counter-IED, improvised explosive devices, capability to enable military forces to operate safely.</p>
            <p eId="para_176">In 2007, Ireland joined the joint investment programme on force protection, which has a budget of €55 million over three years.  Ireland's contribution amounts to €700,000 over the three years.  Force protection involves measures to protect personnel engaged in peace support and crisis management operations overseas and is one of the main factors considered when undertaking any operation.  Ireland's key interest in the programme is in the development of technologies and capabilities to protect troops from threats such as snipers, booby traps and improvised explosive devices.  Body armour, sensors and counter explosive devices are all key elements of the programme.</p>
            <p eId="para_177">Ireland also participates in the EDA's code of conduct for defence procurement and a code of best practice in the supply chain, developed to ensure transparency in procurement and security of supply of defence equipment.  The EDA have also developed a European bulletin board, which acts as a single portal for defence contract opportunities.  This has enabled wider advertising of Ireland's defence force contracts so as to achieve better value for money for Ireland's expenditure on defensive equipment.</p>
            <p eId="para_178">Additional information not given on the floor of the House.</p>
            <p eId="para_179">Participation in the framework of the agency does not breach Ireland's neutrality nor does it impose any other specific obligations or commitments on Ireland, other than a contribution to the operational and functional budget of the agency.  Participation in individual projects of the agency is a matter for national decision on a case-by-case basis.</p>
            <p eId="para_180">Ireland's participation in the EDA ensures that Ireland's views and particular approach to international security policy is fully represented and that the evolution of EU policy is directed in a manner which meets our concerns and our interests.  I have at this time imposed no restriction on Ireland's participation in the EDA.</p>
            <p eId="para_181">Ireland's participation in the agency is focused on the development of capabilities for the protection of our troops in particular when they are deployed on UN-led or UN mandated peace support operations.  It is essential that the Defence Forces have access to the latest developments in these fields so as we can provide the best protection possible for our troops, which is and must be my primary concern as Minister for Defence.</p>

            <from>Deputy Jimmy Deenihan</from>
            <p eId="para_182">Can the Minister highlight the benefits to Ireland of EDA membership?  This is important in view of the referendum on the Lisbon treaty.  Can he also highlight the impact of a possible EDA exit on Ireland's peace keeping missions?</p>
            <p eId="para_183">It was recently reported in the national media that the Government is preparing legislation to enable Ireland to opt in or out of the EDA.  Could the Minister explain the necessity for this legislation?  Will it include the triple lock, which is already provided for?  At present, any decision relating to the EDA goes to Government.  I understand that under new legislation it would also have to come before the Dáil.  Why is that necessary, given that our participation in the EDA is generally for our own benefit, improving the equipment of our armed forces and protecting the lives of our military personnel?</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#WillieODea" eId="spk_111" as="#Minister_for_Defence">
            <from>Deputy Willie O’Dea</from>
            <p eId="para_184">I will clarify the position on the legislation.  Basically, the EDA is about developing the capability of EU member states to perform the Petersberg Tasks.  Ireland has only engaged in one EDA project, the force protection project.  It is about developing communications systems, body armour, sensors and so forth to protect our troops when they go into these dangerous environments.  Ireland is a member of the EDA.  Under the Lisbon treaty, there is no compulsion on this country to be a member but the Government has decided that membership of the EDA is a good thing for Ireland.</p>
            <p eId="para_185">With regard to opting out or in, Ireland can opt out of or into any project in which the EDA engages.  The EDA has engaged in a number of research projects and Ireland has opted into one, and made the appropriate contribution.  This project is specifically geared towards force protection.  Why is legislation required?  It is required to make it absolutely clear to people who have doubts — and some doubts were expressed on this in the referendum campaign on the Lisbon treaty — that any project in which Ireland gets involved under the EDA will be simply and solely to advance the capability, capacity and safety of our troops when they are performing the Petersberg Tasks, which EU troops carry out under a United Nations mandate.  The legislation will provide that the Government and the Dáil must be satisfied that the project is for that purpose.  It will provide similarly with regard to joint structured co-operation.</p>
            <p eId="para_186">The benefits of the EDA for Ireland are twofold.  First, it allows for economies of scale.  It will allow us to get much better value for the money we are spending on defence equipment by regularising the market.  The market has been very fragmented and the EDA has done much to bring it together.  Second, it has enabled Ireland to avail of the same information and research as our potential EU partners in peacekeeping.  When Irish troops go into the arena as part of a UN-mandated EU mission, they will have communications equipment, tanks and general military equipment that are compatible with that of their partners.  That is designed to make the operation more efficient and to ensure the safety of our troops.</p>

            <from>Deputy Willie O’Dea</from>
            <p eId="para_188">On 15 March 2009, MINURCAT, the United Nations-led mission in Chad and the Central African Republic assumed operational control of the United Nations force of 2,085 personnel, including 1,877 troops re-hatted from eight EUFOR contributors.  In the weeks following the takeover of the force by MINURCAT, the mission faced a number of challenges, including fuel shortages in Chad.  The fuel problems encountered by MINURCAT were common to all of Chad, as there was a countrywide fuel crisis at the time.  The fuel situation was exacerbated by the rebel incursion into Chad in early May 2009.  The UN was fully exercised on the issue and all possible sources of fuel for MINURCAT contingents were investigated by the UN to meet the mission's needs.  This included the airlifting of fuel from a neighbouring UN mission.</p>
            <p eId="para_189">Significant progress has been made by the United Nations in the past month and I am pleased to inform the House that the fuel situation as it applies to the Irish infantry battalion in Goz Beida has essentially been resolved.  Sufficient stocks are now in place in Camp Ciara to provide for the unit's needs in the future.  In addition, extra fuel is stored in the new UN fuel farm adjacent to the Irish camp.  The UN also have a facility to fly in quantities of fuel at any stage.  The Defence Forces continue to monitor the fuel supply situation and are maintaining close liaison with the UN authorities on the ground.  For now, I am satisfied that the necessary measures have been taken by the UN to address the fuel issue.</p>

            <from>Deputy Jimmy Deenihan</from>
            <p eId="para_190">I welcome the reply.  Due to the logistical problems with the transfer of responsibility from the EUFOR mission to the UN the Irish mission was left cruelly exposed.  It certainly was unable to carry out the duties for which it was sent to Chad and could not patrol to the same extent.  Will the Minister confirm that the Irish mission is able to carry out the required number of patrols and that it is not inhibited or restricted from doing so because of the fuel problem?  Will the Minister also confirm that he is satisfied this problem will not recur during the term of this mission?</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#WillieODea" eId="spk_114" as="#Minister_for_Defence">
            <from>Deputy Willie O’Dea</from>
            <p eId="para_191">It is, perhaps, overstating the case to say the troops were left cruelly exposed.  Obviously, in a situation where the UN is taking over a EUFOR mission, there will be teething problems.  There was a shortage of fuel which affected the entire country as well as the Irish mission.  As a result there was some rationing of fuel in the Irish camp.  It meant, for example, that routine patrols were restricted.  That does not mean all routine patrolling stopped, just that it was restricted.  However, the troops were always available for emergency work, such as medical evacuation and so forth.  The reason they had to conserve fuel was that they had to concentrate it on the life support systems in the camp, for example, cooking, heating, lighting and so forth.</p>
            <p eId="para_192">The problem has now, by and large, been resolved.  The new contract with the United Nations should guarantee fuel for the duration of the mission.  In addition to the United Nations contract, there is also a UN fuel farm adjacent to the Irish camp which can supply fuel.  The UN retains the capacity to fly in fuel at any time.  I cannot absolutely predict what will happen in the future but the advice I have received from the military authorities in the Department is that the situation is resolved for the foreseeable future.</p>

            <p eId="para_193">As this is the last Question Time with the Minister before the summer recess, will he confirm that consideration is being given to the extension of the Irish mission in Chad?  Given that the logistics are in place, there is a strong case to be made for that.  There is also the fact that the Irish mission is performing efficiently and effectively in Chad and I understand it is the wish of the local population that the Irish troops remain for as long as possible.  Finally, I hope the fuel issue never arises again.  It is essential for any mission that an adequate fuel supply is in place in preparation for such a mission.</p>

I also agree that there is a wish locally in Chad that the Irish troops be left in place.  I am giving careful consideration to an extension of the mission.  I do not envisage the mission continuing as long as the mission in Lebanon did, for example, but I am giving serious consideration to an extension.</p>

            <from>Deputy Willie O’Dea</from>
            <p eId="para_199">I propose to take Questions Nos. 32, 36, 91 and 373 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_200">In the context of the Government decision on the implementation of savings measures in public service numbers and the reduced budgetary provision available for 2009, all recruitment to the Reserve Defence Forces had been suspended.  Following a review and examination of Reserve Defence Force personnel numbers and budget, I am satisfied there is sufficient provision to allow for paid training for existing members of the Army Reserve and Naval Service Reserve this year.  Accordingly, I have recently approved the commencement of limited recruitment to fill vacancies which may arise due to existing Army Reserve or Naval Service Reserve members resigning or being discharged during 2009, in the normal manner.  The numbers that may be recruited will depend on the numbers leaving and any such vacancies will be filled over the coming weeks and months, drawing from the current list of applicants.  This limited recruitment will be monitored and kept under review in the light of the uptake of paid training within the Reserve Defence Force and the future budgetary provision.</p>
            <p eId="para_201">The savings measures are being implemented in the Permanent Defence Force.  I am in contact with my colleague, the Minister for Finance, about the implications of the measures for the Permanent Defence Force.  My focus is on the ongoing operational capability of the Defence Forces.  The question of limited exceptions to the application of the measures arises in this regard.  It is therefore too early to confirm if there will be a cadet class this year or an intake of general service recruits.</p>
            <p eId="para_202">The Defence Forces have improved in every respect since 2000 through the implementation of the White Paper.  This represents a significant public service success story.  The organisation is therefore in a healthy state both in terms of personnel and equipment.  The economic reality is such that the Government decision must be implemented.  It can be anticipated that further flexibility and restructuring will be required arising from the implementation of these measures.  I intend, within the resources available, to retain the capacity of the organisation to operate effectively across all roles.  This will represent a significant challenge in the coming years and one in respect of which I will work closely with the Chief of Staff.  I am advised that the Defence Forces retain the capacity to undertake the tasks laid down by Government at home and overseas.</p>

          <speech by="#JimmyDeenihan" eId="spk_118">
            <from>Deputy Jimmy Deenihan</from>
            <p eId="para_203">I am sure the Minister realises this is the first time in our history there will be no cadet school unless he is to change his mind.  I appeal to him, that if he is to make exceptions this should be one of them.  It probably will be, in any case, by the end of the summer.  There are compelling reasons to support the taking in of the cadet school for the future of our Defence Forces.  In addition, regarding the skills base there at present, namely, the trainers and instructors, if there were to be no cadet school this could affect some of those people who might move on and that would leave gaps.  It is very important that the whole structure be maintained because we have a highly efficient cadet school in this country and have produced some outstanding officers from that school.  It is probably one of the best in the world.</p>
            <p eId="para_204">I was in West Point last March and compared what I saw there with here.  With regard to the quality of training and the approach used, we would be on par with West Point, if not ahead of it.  I appeal to the Minister, regarding the issue of cadets, that he give serious consideration to taking on the cadet school this year, for the reasons I have given.  The young people coming into the Army are the lifeblood.  These are the people who will be in control and commanding overseas missions in the years ahead.  If the Minister breaks that sequence, I am convinced he will do damage to the future of our military personnel and the Defence Forces in general.</p>
            <p eId="para_205">I want the Minister to give very serious consideration to changing his decision on the cadet school.</p>

            <from>Deputy Willie O’Dea</from>
            <p eId="para_206">The reasons underlying the policy of ongoing recruitment, including having a cadet class every year, are still valid, despite the moratorium.  The reasons are to help achieve a balanced age profile for the Defence Forces and to maintain the necessary strength and skill levels.  As I indicated to the House, this has now been superseded by a moratorium with which we must comply because there is no point about talking generally about reducing public expenditure and then refusing to do so in any specific way.</p>
            <p eId="para_207">As I said already to Deputy Deenihan, I made recommendations in a major submission to the Minister for Finance.  This submission was made in writing and I spoke to the Minister as recently as today.  I am to have a formal meeting with him very shortly.  I do not wish to disclose to the House the terms of my submission.  All I will say is that if Deputy Deenihan were to guess that the Cadet School was part of it, he might not be that far wide of the mark.</p>

            <from>Deputy Brian O’Shea</from>
            <p eId="para_208">I share some of the concerns expressed by Deputy Deenihan with regard to the strength of the officer corps if this situation is to continue for any length of time.  There is also the other factor, namely, officers taking early retirement or moving onwards.  Is this situation under review at present?  Can the Minister give any indication of how many officers intend to retire from the Defence Forces this year?  How many cadets are currently in the cadet school?  Is there a possibility, or a probability, that the moratorium on the cadet school might continue into future years?  Does the Minister envisage any serious weakening of the officer corps in the Army as a result of early retirement and the lack of new cadets coming on stream?</p>

          <speech by="#WillieODea" eId="spk_121" as="#Minister_for_Defence">
            <from>Deputy Willie O’Dea</from>
            <p eId="para_209">If I miss any figures in respect of Deputy O'Shea's question I shall get the answer for him.  I am informed that during the lifetime of the moratorium which will finish at the end of 2010,  three Brigadier Generals and one Deputy Chief of Staff are due to retire.  The total number of people who are to retire in the officer corps over that period will be 90.  The last cadet class was put together last year and 41 members were taken into that class.  I realise the importance of continuity and I understand Deputy O'Shea's point about the strength of the officer corps.  It is not my decision.  The moratorium applies to every Department.  I made submissions to the Minister for Finance and by the next time parliamentary questions for the Department of Defence come around again, albeit after the summer, we will know the situation in full.  I hope I will be able to persuade the Minister for Finance to grant me some concessions.</p>

            <from>Deputy Jimmy Deenihan</from>
            <p eId="para_210">In view of the fact that the Minister has removed the moratorium, albeit on a restricted level, on the Reserve Defence Forces, I have some specific questions.  How will recruiting on a limited basis to the reserve operate?  This is very important.  What number is envisaged will be recruited in 2009?  How will the candidates for recruitment be identified and prioritised within the numbers of potential recruits who have been part of, or have completed, the pre-induction programme in 2008?  I understand there is a large number of these, over 1,000.  How will the Minister decide which of those who are ready to join the Reserve Force will be selected?  It is very simple.  If there is to be a restricted form of recruitment there will be major problem in identifying those people.  What methods will be used to identify them for this restricted recruitment?</p>

            <from>Deputy Willie O’Dea</from>
            <p eId="para_213">I shall clarify for the House the way this will operate.  We took the decision that a certain number of people leave the reserve every year.  We looked at the number at the start of the year, which was, I believe, 7,575 and have committed to maintaining that number.  In other words, people who go on the non-effective list or who leave will be replaced.  We intend to maintain the strength at least at that level.  That is our present position but we are keeping the matter under review.  If we can do better than that we will do so.</p>

            <p eId="para_215">We have improved the conditions of the reserve.  There is better training and it is now better organised, has better clothing and equipment.  As the Deputy knows, there is a proposal in the White Paper to have an integrated element in the reserve and for it to be integrated with the Reserve Defence Forces.  So far, recruitment to that has proved disappointing and only 300 people have been trained as integrated reservists.  However, we are learning some lessons from the fact that it has not been as successful as was envisaged.  Originally it was envisaged that ultimately about 2,500 people would be in the integrated reserve.  That ambitious objective will not be reached within the lifetime of the White Paper, which is to the end of next year.  The military has informed me that it has learned from the failure to move the initiative more quickly and that it will take appropriate actions to improve recruitment to the integrated reserve.</p>

            <p eId="para_216">In light of the Minister's removal of the moratorium on recruitment to the Reserve Defence Force, RDF, does he intend to extend the principle and remove the moratorium on promotions within it, for example, fixed term promotions from second lieutenant to first lieutenant and from second private to third private?  These are volunteers, not members of the public service, and their promotions would be fixed term.  It should be possible to allow fixed term promotions to occur without any expense.  Will the Minister review the promotional structure within the RDF, given his decision to remove its moratorium on recruitment?</p>

If the Minister makes progress on this front with the Minister for Finance, how will they be enrolled and from where will they come?  There is a problem in that people who would want careers in the Defence Forces might apply in other fields and seek to pursue other careers due to the moratorium.  Should a decision not be reached quickly so as to allow people to direct their attention towards the Defence Forces?  They could pursue cadet careers, which would lead on to officerships.</p>

            <p eId="para_224">In the context of the Government decision on the implementation of savings measures on public service numbers and the reduced budgetary provision available for 2009, all recruitment to the Reserve Defence Force, RDF, was suspended.  Following a subsequent review and examination of RDF personnel numbers and budgets for 2009, I was satisfied there was sufficient provision to allow for paid training for existing members of the reserve this year.</p>
            <p eId="para_225">Accordingly, on 19 May I announced that limited recruitment to fill vacancies arising due to existing reserve members resigning or being discharged this year in the normal manner could proceed.  The numbers recruited will depend on the numbers leaving.  This limited recruitment will be monitored and kept under review in light of the uptake of paid training within the RDF and the future budgetary provision.  Therefore, I am not in a position to specify the exact number to be recruited this year.  The resources available for paid training, taking account of the recruitment that is under way, are being closely monitored.  The situation with regard to promotion in the reserve will be also reviewed in this context in the period ahead.</p>

            <p eId="para_226">We have touched on this matter in our previous supplementary questions to the Minister.  It is important that he would make some progress on the RDF's promotional structure and on rewarding its volunteers.</p>
            <p eId="para_227">Reverting to Deputy Stanton's comments, there is a feeling that, due to the attitude taken towards the RDF in recent years, it is undervalued and that its role has been trivialised.  This is the feedback I am getting from people within the RDF.  Like them, I am committed to the concept.  Across the world, reserve defence forces play a critical role in overseas missions.  I refer to the forces of America, England and elsewhere.  Rather than diminishing the RDF's role, we should enhance, encourage and support it.  The diminution of its role or giving the impression, albeit not publicly, that the RDF has no great role would be unfortunate.</p>
            <p eId="para_228">Has the moratorium on recruitment and promotions affected the future prospects of RDF personnel serving abroad?</p>

          <speech by="#WillieODea" eId="spk_135" as="#Minister_for_Defence">
            <from>Deputy Willie O’Dea</from>
            <p eId="para_229">I agree with Deputy Deenihan regarding the promotional structure, which is under consideration.  Any perception that the reserve is being undervalued is mistaken.  An entire section of the White Paper addressed the reserve and made various recommendations.  For example, the recommended re-organisation has been undertaken.  The White Paper recommended better uniforms, training, systems of gratuities and so on.  All of these have been followed.  The White Paper was ambitious in some respects.  As I have told Deputy Stanton, integration has not occurred to the extent preferred.  However, a follow-on White Paper on defence next year will deal with this issue.</p>
            <p eId="para_230">I have the highest regard for the reserve.  When the moratorium was introduced, the Department of Finance took the view that it should apply to everyone, including the reserve.  I managed to overturn that decision, one of the first breaches of the moratorium.  I did this to indicate the high regard in which I held the reserve and the fact that I did not want to see its numbers further depleted.</p>
            <p eId="para_231">Deputy Deenihan asked a question on serving abroad.  Since members of the RDF are not entitled to serve overseas statutorily, we are hoping to recruit into the Permanent Defence Force, PDF, on a temporary basis members of the RDF who had signed up to go abroad.  Obviously, this idea is affected by the moratorium.  As I have made certain recommendations to the Minister for Finance regarding the moratorium, let us see what occurs.</p>

            <p eId="para_233">I appreciate that.  We should compliment the Minister on overturning the moratorium in respect of the RDF.  Obviously, he does not have exact figures, but could he give the Dáil a ballpark estimate of the number of RDF places that might become available for recruitment in the course of the year?  I understand that quite a number of people were well down the road of the recruitment process, which is long and drawn out, when the moratorium was introduced.  Would it not be fair and equitable that those people be given priority for whatever places might become available during the year?</p>

            <p eId="para_234">I agree with the latter point.  Criteria have been drawn up by the director of the reserve and the questions of where people came in on the chain, whether they have had medicals done and when they applied will be important.  I understand it will be done in chronological order.</p>
            <p eId="para_235">I do not want to get specific about numbers.  How many we will take on depends on how many drop out or join the non-effective list.  We started the year with 7,575 members, give or take one or two.  This year, my policy is to ensure numbers do not fall below that figure.  To the extent that people leave and that figure is reduced, they can and will be replaced.</p>

Why is some use not being made of the 300 even in barrack duties or in some way to act as a backup to the Permanent Defence Force, PDF?

            <p eId="para_237">I will have to speak to the chief of staff about that.  I understand that the Army command is considering ways in which it can make some use of the integrated reserve.  I do not know why that has not happened to date.  I will revert to the Deputy when I have spoken to the chief of staff about it.  I think that perhaps the Army command was a little underwhelmed by the number of people it managed to recruit.  More than 300 individuals have now been trained to a high degree, as Deputy Stanton indicated.  We will speak to the Chief of Staff and get back to the Deputy on the matter.</p>

            <p eId="para_238">Is the Minister aware that a number of individuals who are anxious to get into the reserve force here are going North to join the reserve force of another country?  They find there is easier access and that the security clearance is much easier.  The point was made that the moratorium did not apply to the Garda Reserve force because it is a voluntary, non-remunerated position.  It appears the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform indicated that there would not be a halt to recruitment of members to the Garda Reserve.  This seems to indicate a contradiction in Government policy between recruitment to the Reserve Defence Force and the Garda Reserve.</p>

That is our duty.  It would be irresponsible of me to say that we can recruit 1,000 or 2,000 people more than those for whom we can provide a reasonable number of paid training days.  The Reserve Defence Force must undertake an essential minimum level of training.  That is the position.  The original ruling that we got from the Department of Finance was that the moratorium applied across the board.  I managed to get that lifted.  Let us see what happens with my submission on the Permanent Defence Forces.  We will take it from there.</p>

Does the Minister agree that those people are committed, dedicated and anxious to serve in some way?  If no use is made of them, and they are just allowed to sit around, that could be a reason the Minister has a problem with applications in the first place.

          <p eId="para_245">There has been a great deal of public comment in recent days about the fact that the 148 members of the Judiciary have been put in a position by a political decision of the Government that they be excluded from paying the pension levy.  On what grounds did the Government make a political decision to exclude members of the Judiciary from having to pay a pension levy when approximately 300,000 other public servants have to pay the levy?  Many of those public servants are now feeling real pain and difficulty and have to live on less than €100 per week after all the contributions have been made.  What are the reasons for the Government exclusion of a particular sector of the public service, amounting to approximately 148 persons in all?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#BrianCowen" as="#Taoiseach" eId="spk_147">
          <from>The Taoiseach</from>
          <p eId="para_246">As the Deputy is aware, the Attorney General has given his advice, having regard to the Constitution.  As the Deputy is also aware, the case law interpreting that advice is confidential.  The decision not to impose the pension levy on judges was made on the basis of that advice.  The wording of Article 35.5° is clear.  In express terms it imposes a prohibition on the reduction of a judge's remuneration during a judge's continuance in office.  The remuneration has been interpreted in previous decisions as including pension rights and the protection in Article 35.5° provides for financial independence on the part of the Judiciary, which is a key component in judicial independence.  As we all know, the separation of powers is fundamental to the Constitution.  It is not appropriate for one organ of Government to interfere with the constitutionally protected rights of another organ of Government.</p>
          <p eId="para_247">Things have moved on.  The fact that the Chief Justice has been in touch with the Revenue and has provided for a scheme whereby he and his colleagues can arrange for a voluntary contribution of the order required is to be welcomed.  It enables the Judiciary to make that contribution and I believe they will do so.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#EndaKenny" eId="spk_148">
          <from>Deputy Enda Kenny</from>
          <p eId="para_248">I note the comments of the Chief Justice in that regard and I welcome them.  The Government and the Taoiseach have placed members of the Judiciary in a very particular position, through no fault of their own.  I respect the constitutional provision preventing a reduction in the remuneration of judges' pay.  It is necessary that they are seen to be independent from the Executive.  That is as it should be.  However, the fact is that approximately 300,000 public servants are being told that this is not a pay cut, it is a pension levy.</p>
          <p eId="para_249">The advice of the Attorney General is only that; it is only advice.  Political leadership, either from the Taoiseach, the Minister or the Government, must make judgments based on the advice given to the Cabinet by the Attorney General, who is the legal adviser to the Government.  On a number of occasions in the past that advice has been deemed to be invalid before the Supreme Court, but not from this particular Attorney General.  The advice given to the Cabinet by the current Attorney General is only that; it is advice.  People are beginning to feel the pinch.  Young gardaí, nurses and teachers, who say to me they must live on €90 per week after the contributions have been made, feel a political decision taken by the Government has excluded 148 public sector workers, that is, judges, who must now pick up the traces by way of voluntary contributions. I respect the Taoiseach's comment that judges should be independent but, as the pension levy was made as a result of a political decision in the common good, and members of the Judiciary were included in that common good, they were therefore not being marked out for their independence.</p>
          <p eId="para_250">The Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest Act 2009 clearly reflects a political decision that the Minister may exclude persons he or she believes should be included in a particular set of circumstances.  If the Attorney General advises the Cabinet that judges' pay should not be reduced, bearing in mind that it would be reduced because of the pension levy, I disagree with that.  The Taoiseach has placed the judges in a most enviable position.  The Cabinet should have thanked the Attorney General for his advice and decided the pension levy was in the good of all public sector workers.  For the 300,000 public sector workers who are not members of the Judiciary, the measure is deemed to be a pension levy and not a pay cut, as per the constitutional issue.  The Taoiseach should at least publish the advice of the Attorney General so we can see it.  He should be up-front by admitting the political decision taken by the Cabinet based on the advice of the Attorney General amounts to a pay cut dressed up as a contribution and that he has placed the Judiciary in a very enviable position by having to follow on the words of the Chief Justice.  Has the Taoiseach any intention of reviewing the advice of the Attorney General on the basis that a pension levy applied across the board is in the common interest?  Judges share that view.</p>

          <p eId="para_254">The position of the Attorney General, as I have outlined, is clear.  He is the adviser to the Government on the Constitution and legal matters generally.  It is not open to the Government to act in a way that it is advised would not be in line with the Constitution.  That is a basic procedure of government.  The advice was based on the case law and the clear wording of the Constitution itself.  I have explained that in my first reply.  It applies to pension rights also.</p>
          <p eId="para_255">Apart from that, it is incorrect to suggest there was an effort to put anybody in a difficult position.  As the Chief Justice said in his statement, members of the Judiciary considered it a matter of duty to seek ways to meet the constitutional inhibition, which is not in any way contested.  Both the Judiciary and the Attorney General are <i>ad idem</i> on their interpretation of the Constitution.  Members of the Judiciary themselves, on their own judicial initiative, consider it a matter of duty to seek ways to address the constitutional inhibition while at the same time respecting the spirit of the Constitution.  As a result, the Chief Justice was involved in detailed discussions with the chairman of the Revenue Commissioners with a view to ascertaining what arrangements could be put in place to enable judges to make an appropriate voluntary contribution.  All that has happened in this respect has been on the initiative of the Judiciary.  It has dealt with the chairman of the Revenue Commissioners and produced an eight-page document.  The arrangements have been approved by the Revenue Commissioners and they have facilitated the making of a voluntary contribution equivalent to the sum that would have been paid in any given year if the levy applied.</p>
          <p eId="para_256">The Chief Justice made the statement yesterday because of what he believed were misapprehensions that in turn have led to misleading statements concerning the operation of the scheme for voluntary payments by the Judiciary in respect of the pension levy.  The purpose of the statement yesterday was to clarify and confirm the initiative that was taken by the Judiciary.  The Judiciary does not contest the constitutional inhibition and it has made arrangements with the Revenue Commissioners for the payment of the voluntary contribution in line with what would otherwise be payable were the pension levy applicable to it.</p>

        <speech by="#EamonGilmore" eId="spk_153">
          <from>Deputy Eamon Gilmore</from>
          <p eId="para_257">On 29 September last, the Government introduced in the House what became known as the bank guarantee scheme.  According to the legislation introduced on that date, the scheme was to last for two years.  The Credit Institutions (Financial Support) Bill that was passed stipulated the guarantee would end on 29 September 2010.  It stated explicitly that it would not continue beyond that date.</p>
          <p eId="para_258">Last Friday week the Government published a Bill called the Financial Measures (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill, which provides for a number of matters, including the transfer of university pensions to the National Pensions Reserve Fund, a number of technical amendments to the Central Bank Act, a number of provisions affecting insurance legislation and legislation governing the use of credit cards.  Buried away in Part 2 of Schedule 2 of the Bill is an amendment to the legislation that introduced the bank guarantee scheme.  That amendment lifts the two-year time limit on the scheme and gives power to the Minister for Finance to extend the guarantee by ministerial order for any period.</p>
          <p eId="para_259">The Labour Party considered that the bank guarantee scheme introduced by the Government was a disaster for the taxpayer.  As we have seen, this has been borne out in that every time the banks have a problem, the taxpayers must put their hands in their pocket.  Some €4 billion has been allocated for Anglo Irish Bank and €3.5 billion each for the two main banks.</p>
          <p eId="para_260">Regardless of what one thinks about the bank guarantee scheme, extending it indefinitely and giving the Minister for Finance the power to do so by ministerial order is a major step for us to be asked to take.  It should at least be the subject of thorough and rigorous debate in the House.  However, not only has the Government introduced this far-reaching measure in an underhand way and slipped it into the Schedule of a rather technical looking Bill, it also wants to take all Stages of the Bill tonight.  It is proposed to guillotine Second Stage at 7 p.m. and it is proposed to take Committee and Remaining Stages between approximately 8.40 p.m. and 10 p.m.  The provision to which I refer will probably not be reached at all by the House for examination.</p>
          <p eId="para_261">For how long does the Government intend to extend the guarantee scheme beyond 29 September 2010, as proposed in the legislation to be taken this evening?  Why is there such a rush to deal with all Stages in one sitting this evening?  If the guarantee as it stands does not expire until 29 September 2010, we have approximately 14 months in which to consider the matter.  Will the Taoiseach agree to withdraw Part 2 of Schedule 2 of the Financial Measures (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill — it is straight out of Sir Humphrey — and allow the House to have a proper, considered debate on what everybody will agree is a substantial legislative measure to be brought before the House?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#BrianCowen" as="#Taoiseach" eId="spk_154">
          <from>The Taoiseach</from>
          <p eId="para_262">The provisions to which Deputy Gilmore refers amending the bank guarantee scheme legislation, the Credit Institutions Financial Support Act 2008, in order to facilitate long-term debt issuance by the banks of up to five years, in accordance with the findings of a review of the guarantee, was signalled in the supplementary budget as far back as 7 April.  There is no question of something unanticipated or unannounced suddenly arriving in the second Schedule of a Bill.  This is being done to ensure that Irish banks have access to this longer-term funding in line with the mainstream approach in the European Union.  It will contribute significantly to supporting the funding needs of the banks and to securing their continued stability.</p>
          <p eId="para_263">It is true, as the Deputy stated, that the Irish Government was the first to bring forward a bank guarantee scheme.  Many governments since have followed that example as part of their response to the need to provide financial stability at a time of unprecedented turbulence in the international banking system.  There have been other and further measures such as the recapitalisation of the banks and the National Asset Management Agency Bill which is also being prepared.</p>
          <p eId="para_264">This Bill is designed to ensure that Irish banks will have access to the issuance of eligible debt securities for the same length of time as other banks.  We set out our bank debt guarantee for two years.  In line with developments at EU level and the review in respect of the guarantee scheme it would put Ireland at a disadvantage were we to suggest that our bank guarantee was to extend only to September 2010 when debt securities of up to five years beyond that date are available to others.  We would extend it to ensure that Irish banks can compete on a level playing pitch for those debt securities.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#EamonGilmore" eId="spk_155">
          <from>Deputy Eamon Gilmore</from>
          <p eId="para_265">Yes, the Minister for Finance did indicate in the documentation supplied with the Budget Statement, rather than in the Budget Statement, that there was a proposal to extend the coverage of some categories of debt for five years.  With all due respect to the Taoiseach, the way to do that is for the Minister for Finance to come in and explain that to the House,put a legislative measure before the House and provide for it.</p>
          <p eId="para_266">We have two problems with this legislation, first, what is being proposed in the Bill is not a provision for five years or for particular types of debt — it is an open-ended provision, stating explicitly that the power is being given to the Minister for Finance to do this by way of order.  There is no mention of five years, or of particular categories of debt.  The Minister for Finance is asking the House effectively to open the bank guarantee scheme and leave the manner in which it will be exercised to his discretion in future.  We have given one blank cheque to the banking system, now the Government is effectively asking the House to provide the system with an undated blank cheque.</p>
          <p eId="para_267">Second, what is the rush?  As the Taoiseach said, the Minister for Finance signalled something along these lines on 7 April.  This is 23 June.  Why does the Taoiseach want it done and dusted by 10 p.m. tonight?  What is the big hurry?  Why can this not be removed?  I do not want to have the debate here but I want provision for the House to debate this measure.  This is a fairly major departure from the commitment given when the original bank guarantee scheme was introduced.  It was brought in for two years and we were told it would end on 29 September 2010 and that it would not be extended beyond that date.  That is in the legislation.  There may well be a case for changing that for particular categories of debt but it should be done here openly.  It should be brought in with an upfront statement of the Government's proposal, the Bill and the conditions attached thereto, debated and decided.  The Government is not doing that.  What it is doing is underhand.  It is slipping in the provision as a Schedule to a Bill, at a point in the Bill where it will not be debated, or will be debated only tangentially, because a guillotine is to be imposed.  There is, however, a solution.  The Minister could withdraw the Schedule from the Bill and introduce it separately.  We can all co-operate with the handling of it and the taking of it.  The Taoiseach has not explained why there is such a rush to have it all over and done with by 10 p.m. tonight.  At the very least a matter of such seriousness, with so much taxpayers' money riding on it, requires a bit more debate now than being put in as a Schedule to a Bill which is guillotined and put through in one sitting on what is after all a half-day sitting on a Tuesday.</p>

          <from>The Taoiseach</from>
          <p eId="para_268">There is a need to deal with this matter because we have limited our bank debt guarantee to September 2010.  Five year money securities are becoming available on money markets that we cannot take because we cannot guarantee the banks beyond September 2010.  There are other banks in other jurisdictions that can do that because they did not impose the prudent two year restriction that we imposed on ourselves at the time.  There are loans that we could take up for five years if we apply the bank guarantee.  The best way of ensuring stability in the banking system is to ensure that it has access to funds.  Other banks in other jurisdictions are able to tender for these funds because they can apply a bank guarantee to them that we cannot do because we have legislation which restricts it to September 2010.</p>

Legally we can provide a loan guarantee only until September 2010.  This amendment to the legislation provides us with the means of ensuring that we compete on a level playing pitch with other financial institutions.</p>

The following arrangements shall apply on No. 5. — the proceedings on Second Stage shall, if not previously concluded, be brought to a conclusion at 7 p.m. and a Minister or Minister of State shall be called upon to make a speech in reply which shall not exceed five minutes; the proceedings on the Committee and Remaining Stages shall, if not previously concluded, be brought to a conclusion at 10 p.m. tonight by one question which shall be put from the Chair and which shall, in relation to amendments, include only those set down or accepted by the Minister for Finance.  In the event a division is in progress at the time fixed for taking Private Members’ business, which shall be No. 75 — motion re children’s hospital funding, Standing Order 117(3) shall not apply and Private Members’ business shall be adjourned after 90 minutes tonight.  Parliamentary questions next for answer by the Taoiseach on EU matters shall be taken on the same day as the statements on the EU Council meeting in Brussels, scheduled to be taken on Wednesday, 24 June 2009, and shall be moved to be taken first as ordinary oral questions to the Taoiseach on that day. </p>

          <p eId="para_278">The Taoiseach and the Government propose to have a guillotine on this debate and there will be an hour and a half for Committee Stage with 19 amendments having been tabled.  This is not trivial legislation; it currently involves a guarantee of €400 billion worth of assets being covered by the State.  Few of the amendments will be reached or debated.  Contrary to what the Taoiseach stated a moment ago, there has not been any review — or if there has it has not been made available to Members of the House who will be asked to vote on it.  There has not been any report on the existing scheme.  We have not been offered any guarantee, such as the Taoiseach outlined, that this would be confined to issues of the sort to which the Taoiseach referred.  There is no sunset clause on these provisions.</p>
          <p eId="para_279">We need to take ourselves seriously as a House.  The Taoiseach will come here next week and bleat across the House that every time he comes up with something he is opposed, yet this serious legislation which he has brought to the House will almost inevitably be opposed tonight because most of the amendments seeking the protections that the House wants to debate and have included, if possible, will not have been reached.  The Taoiseach must be reasonable with the House.  We are attempting to deal with huge changes occurring in our community and are trying to debate them in a reasonable fashion.  To be honest, I do not think the Government is interested in this debate.  It has an aggrieved sense of self-righteousness.  It pushes ahead with everything and dismisses this Chamber as a place to debate these important issues.  I am getting fed up with it.</p>

          <from>Deputy Joan Burton</from>
          <p eId="para_281">I object to the way this Bill is being taken.  The leader of the Labour Party has set out our concerns about the section of the Bill dealing with NAMA and the guarantee.  In effect, it enables the establishment of NAMA and loans to be transferred at what will probably be very cheap prices.  However, other parts of the Bill seriously deserve detailed scrutiny.  Only in the past hour and a half I received from the Department of Finance — finally, after many requests — the schedule of the pension funds of the public bodies that will be transferred to and taken over by the State under this legislation.  We will take over assets of €1.75 billion in those pensions funds but the liabilities, of which I have now been given a list, for the end of December 2008 run to more than €3 billion.</p>
          <p eId="para_282">Based on a quick reading in the time I have had to glance at it, in the case of FÁS the State will take over assets of €328 million and liabilities of €683 million; in the case of Trinity College Dublin — assets of €245 million and liabilities of €554 million; and in the case of the National University of Ireland-  assets of €6 million and liabilities of €13 million.  In what Parliament in the world would one find, along with very important banking matters, the taking over of assets of €1.75 billion to give the national balance sheet a bit of a boost under technical EU and ECB rules and, at the same time, the taking over of unexamined pension liabilities of more than €3 billion where some of the pensions funds have a deficit of more than 50%?  Everybody knows pensions funds have fallen in the crash.</p>
          <p eId="para_283">I am also told in the note that the IPA and the ESRI pension funds will be added on Committee Stage.</p>

Nevertheless, despite the Tánaiste chiding Opposition voices and the Government proceeding absolutely intent on its own purpose irrespective of what other opinion might be offered, the business of the House collapsed for more than three hours.  How can we have confidence in a Government that cannot even measure the length of time required to address the passage of legislation let alone to govern?</p>

          <from>Deputy Eamon Gilmore</from>
          <p eId="para_478">I want to make a proposal to the Taoiseach on this item.  He proposes to guillotine Second Stage of the Bill at 7 p.m. and Committee and Remaining Stages at 10 p.m.  I know the Taoiseach has offered to extend the sitting until 11 p.m and he will guillotine it at that time instead.  That, unfortunately, does not meet the requirements.  This Bill, for the reasons we stated before and which Deputy Burton has outlined, has a range of issue that require attention.</p>
          <p eId="para_479">There is also the critical issue of the proposal to give the Minister for Finance the power to extend the life of the bank guarantee scheme.  I suggest to the Taoiseach that we agree to take Second State of the Bill today, take Committee Stage after statements on the European Council tomorrow and take Report Stage on Thursday.  That way we would have the opportunity to properly examine the Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_480">I heard what the Taoiseach had to say about access to money and so on.  The timeframe to which I referred would allow for proper parliamentary scrutiny of the Bill and would not compromise the need to deal with the Bill reasonably quickly.  It would be done this week.  I am sure there can be co-operation in the House on the taking of the Bill and this would be a reasonable way to deal with it. Otherwise, the Labour Party will have to oppose the proposal before us, that is, to guillotine Second Stage at 7 p.m. and Committee and Remaining Stages at 10 p.m.</p>

          <p eId="para_631">I object to this proposal because it cuts across the suggestion I made to the Taoiseach in respect of dealing with the Financial Measures (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill, which provides for the extension of the bank guarantee scheme.  The explanation the Taoiseach has given us as to why the Government wants to have this Bill dealt with in one sitting today does not stand up.  The idea, for example, that it has to be dealt with this evening because the statutory instruments legislation must be dealt with before the statutory instruments are ready does not stand up when it can be dealt with at a more reasonable pace tomorrow and Thursday.  The final argument that he put, namely, that somehow he was going to inconvenience the Chief Whip if he agreed to our request and that his hands were tied, is farcical.</p>
          <p eId="para_632">We are in a situation where the Government is deciding, as it often does at the end of a parliamentary session, to use its parliamentary majority to force certain measures through the House in a short period of time.

Will it be next week or the week after?  Is there a conclusion on this and when can we expect the Bill to come to the House?</p>
          <p eId="para_652">Second, has the Taoiseach any further detail on whether the Dáil will be recalled in September to deal specifically with the NAMA legislation?  That seemed to be the indication last week.</p>

He also said at the time of that announcement that the Government had made a decision to prioritise the legislation dealing with the amalgamation of the various elements of that sector.  What is the situation with regard to the production of that legislation which the then Minister of State said would be given priority by the Government?</p>

If the Deputy wants simple A, B and C answers to what are complex issues he cannot get them but he is being advised of very clear procedures outlined by the Minister, Deputy Lenihan, at the time of the supplementary budget.  Consistent with that and with which he is proceeding this evening, a statutory instrument requiring the approval of the Oireachtas in compliance with EU state aid rules will be required.  It is something that will require further consultation with the Commission in due course as with previous schemes which met with its approval.</p>

The reason for the delay in its re-introduction to the House is, we are told by the Minister for Education and Science, that there are certain amendments he wishes to be made.  Have these amendments been passed by the Cabinet?  I refer to third level fees which are on the boil, but we have yet to be told whether a memorandum has been brought to Government.  Two primary schools in north Dublin, completing their first year at the end of this month, have no legal basis on which to function because the legislation to provide for the VECs to become a patron at primary school level has not been introduced.</p>

          <from>Minister for Finance (Deputy Brian Lenihan)</from>
          <p eId="para_762">I move: "That the Bill be now read a Second Time."</p>
          <p eId="para_763">This miscellaneous Bill contains a number of distinct, important provisions and it can be broken into four parts.  First, there is a provision to give effect to the continued operation of existing direct debit mandates after the introduction of the Single Euro Payments Area direct debit scheme; second, there is a provision for the transfer of assets of certain pension funds to the National Pensions Reserve Fund; third, there is a provision to allow the Minister to extend the period for which financial support can be provided under the Credit Institutions (Financial Support) Act; and, fourth, there are a number of amendments to other legislation.</p>
          <p eId="para_764">I wish to deal first with Part 5 of the Bill which makes a technical change to enable, with Oireachtas approval, the extension of the guarantee contained in the Credit Institutions (Financial Support) Act 2008, beyond the current expiry date of 29 September 2010.</p>
          <p eId="para_765">I have been open and transparent about my approach to this issue.  I note the considerable amount of discussion on this matter in the House today.  This issue was first signalled on 11 February last in the context of the announcement of the details of the recapitalisation programme.  It was again signalled on 7 April in the supplementary Budget Statement to the House.  The reason it was signalled is that it is essential to revisit the current guarantee, subject to European Commission approval and consistent with the EU state-aid requirements, in ways which will support financial institutions in Ireland in accessing longer-term finance.  As this House is aware, Ireland was one of the first member states to introduce a guarantee.  The other European states have now either explicitly or implicitly introduced such guarantees.  We are not unique but many of those guarantees extend far beyond the expiry date of 29 September 2010 and, hence, financial institutions in these countries have a considerable competitive advantage over our banks.  It is essential not to extend the entire guarantee but to modify it to ensure our institutions are not put at a competitive disadvantage by virtue of the more extended guarantees which other jurisdictions have made.  This is the essential issue here.  There is no power in this Bill to allow me to extend the guarantee on the stroke of a pen; a positive resolution of the Oireachtas will be required were such to happen.  It is subject to EU state-aid requirements and the amendment of the Act to facilitate longer-term debt issues by participating institutions of up to five years maturity, in accordance with the Budget Statement, is essential.  The necessary modification of the guarantee may well take place from the commencement of the statutory instrument.  Access to longer-term funding is in line with the mainstream approach in the European Union.  It will contribute significantly to supporting the funding needs of the financial institutions, to secure their continued stability and to enhance their potential to discharge their central role in facilitating economic activity.  This will require state-aid approval.</p>
          <p eId="para_766">I wish to make clear at this stage that there is no question of issues of subordinated debt being covered by any such extension.  That is not the issue involved and, unless that issue be raised, I am anxious to point out and to put on the record of the House that dated subordinated debt will not be part of any such extension.</p>

          <from>Deputy Brian Lenihan</from>
          <p eId="para_770">The Commission has signalled a number of issues regarding liabilities to be covered.  We are working to resolve these difficulties.  If these can be resolved, I hope to bring the necessary statutory instrument before the House before the summer recess when we will have ample time to discuss and, as a Parliament, approve or disapprove, of the nature of the securities covered.  To avoid us going down the route of having a debate about subordinated debt, I simply want to make clear at this stage, for the assistance of Members, that this is not one of the securities in the contemplation of the Government in our discussions with the EU Commission.  Clearly the securities that were referred to in the budget speech and which are the subject matter of our discussions, are the longer-term debt issuance where other banks in other European countries are now at a competitive advantage in accessing such funding by virtue of the more extended guarantees which such countries have given.  The details of these matters are under discussion with the Commission and at this stage what is sought is a statutory authority so that we are in a position to introduce an instrument for the approval of this House.</p>
          <p eId="para_771">I will deal with the details of each section of the Bill in turn.  Section 2 provides for the continued operation of existing direct debit mandates after the introduction of the Single Euro Payments Area direct debit scheme. This scheme will be introduced in November 2009. This industry-led initiative is a major component of the development of a single EU market in payment services. The SEPA direct debit scheme will enable customers of any EU bank to set up a direct debit on their account regardless of the country in which they live.  It has the potential to make travelling and working in other member states much more flexible in terms of, for example, paying utility bills.  A significant hurdle in the introduction of the SEPA direct debit scheme is the need to make sure existing direct debit instructions continue to be valid.  The Bill contains a provision enabling the Minister for Finance to make regulations to provide for the continued validity of existing direct debit instructions, subject to the need to ensure customers are properly informed of the fact that their direct debits will move to the new direct debit scheme rule book.</p>
          <p eId="para_772">Part 3 of the Bill deals with the transfer of assets of certain pensions funds to the National Pensions Reserve Fund.  Part 3, comprising sections 13 to 14, contains provisions to facilitate the transfer of pension funds in the universities and certain State bodies, to the National Pensions Reserve Fund, to enable the payment on a pay-as-you-go basis of the benefits currently covered by those funds and to offset the value of the funds transferred against annual contribution obligations under section 18(2) of the National Pensions Reserve Fund Act.  The funds in question, which are set out in Schedule 1 of the Bill, are the pensions funds of the five older universities: Trinity College; University College Dublin; University College Cork; National University of Ireland, Galway; and National University of Ireland, Maynooth and the National University of Ireland, together with certain State bodies: Forfás; SFADCo; FÁS; An Bord Bia; the Arts Council; and Fáilte Ireland in respect of the regional tourism authorities and the fund for former CERT employees.</p>
          <p eId="para_773">The pension schemes of the five older universities and some of the non-commercial State sponsored bodies, SSBs, are unique in terms of their structure and relationship with the State.  The non-commercial SSBs concerned are part of the public service, with the State and the Exchequer ultimately responsible for their funding, and their pension liabilities must be seen in that context.  The universities concerned have part-funded pension schemes, with retirement lump sums and basic pensions paid from the funds, while post-retirement increases are paid by the State on a pay as you go basis.  This is different from the position in respect of the pensions of the newer universities and entrants to the older universities from 2005 onwards, whose benefits are paid on a pay as you go basis and are met via the core grant provided by the State.</p>
          <p eId="para_774">The Universities Act 1997, provided that all the universities should introduce new pension schemes along the lines of the public service model and since February 2005, such arrangements have been in place for all new entrants to these universities.  The funded schemes are, therefore, closed to new entrants since that date.</p>
          <p eId="para_775">All funded schemes in the public service must now meet minimum funding standards under EU law, specifically the IORPS Directive, unless they are, effectively, guaranteed by the State.  This has placed the universities concerned in a situation where they have to be able to show there would be sufficient cover in their schemes to meet the potential liabilities arising, with potential implications for the universities' finances generally, or that the State would clarify its supporting role to give the cover required.  Some time ago, a working group under the Higher Education Authority examined the situation and recommended that the best way forward was for the State to initiate discussions with the trustees and administrators of the funded pension schemes concerned, who would then consult with their members with a view to the winding up of these schemes, and the takeover by the State of the assets in the funds.  The liabilities of the schemes would then be met on a pay as you go basis in the future with the assets transferred to the National Pensions Reserve Fund.  It is not possible to predict if the assets will eventually prove to be sufficient to meet the future liabilities. This will depend on how they perform over time.</p>
          <p eId="para_776">The transfer of the assets of pension funds in the universities and certain non-commercial State bodies to the National Pensions Reserve Fund where the assets will be managed as part of the reserve fund has a number of advantages.  Rather than having a number of relatively smaller funds attempting to manage their deficits while at the same time meeting current pension benefit outgoings, it is preferable to have the assets managed for the State in the reserve fund where there will also be the benefit of economies of scale.  With no drawdowns before 2025, the reserve fund can accept periods of volatility as a trade-off for achieving a long-term return that will make a meaningful contribution to Ireland's future pension costs and the sustainability of the pension system.</p>
          <p eId="para_777">Section 3 defines terms in Part 3 of the Bill.  The section also clarifies that the assets to be transferred do not include assets covering additional voluntary contributions on a defined contribution basis.  Following the transfer, the funds of these AVC schemes will be held in a separate trust for the contributing members.</p>
          <p eId="para_778">Section 4 provides an interpretation of the phrase "relevant pension scheme" both before and after the transfer of the assets in a covered pension fund.  This is important in the context of continuing the scheme members' benefit structure following the transfer.</p>
          <p eId="para_779">Section 5 provides that the relevant Minister may, with the consent of the Minister for Finance, make an order transferring the assets of a covered pension fund to the National Pensions Reserve Fund.  The transfer order in respect of a particular fund will determine the date of effect of the transfer of the fund.  It will also confirm the instruments and other documents underpinning the "relevant pension scheme" referred to in section 5.  A transfer order shall be laid before each House of the Oireachtas with a notice published in <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i>.</p>
          <p eId="para_780">Section 6 provides that the effect of a transfer order made under section 5 is to transfer the assets of the fund which is subject to the transfer order to the National Pensions Reserve Fund.  It also provides that any trust deed relating to the assets of the fund is terminated and that the trustees and the bodies cease to be liable for anything done relating to the fund on or after the date of effect set out in the transfer order.</p>
          <p eId="para_781">Section 7 provides for the continued operation of any pension scheme for which a transfer order has been made, subject to the provisions of the Bill.  It also provides that, following the transfer, the board of directors or governing body of the State body or university in question becomes the administrators of the scheme.  This section also makes provision for the continuation of scheme membership for those who were members on the date of transfer.</p>
          <p eId="para_782">Section 8 provides an exemption from any form of taxation for any assets transferred under a transfer order.</p>
          <p eId="para_783">Section 9 provides that a transfer order has effect notwithstanding any provision in the Pensions Act 1990.  It also provides that, following the date of a transfer, the Pensions Act will continue to apply to a relevant scheme to the same extent as it did prior to that date, so that the protection of the Act will apply to members following the transfer, for example, the right to appeal in the event of a dispute.</p>
          <p eId="para_784">Section 10 provides that assets transferred to the National Pensions Reserve Fund pursuant to a transfer order shall be taken to be in satisfaction or part-satisfaction of the obligation of the Minister for Finance under the National Pensions Reserve Fund Act 1990 to make contributions to that fund.</p>
          <p eId="para_785">Section 11 provides that any discretion contained within a covered pension scheme in terms of rights and benefits of members, either individually or collectively, shall, after the making of the transfer order, be exercised by the relevant Minister and the Minister for Finance who in turn may delegate the exercise of the discretion.</p>
          <p eId="para_786">Section 12 provides, subject to the provisions of this section, for the continuation of obligations of members and employers to make contributions to the scheme and for the bodies to pay benefits relating to the scheme in relation to any covered scheme after a transfer order has been made.</p>
          <p eId="para_787">Section 13 provides that section 25(7) of the Universities Act 1997 and the Fifth Schedule to that Act, which provide for the approval of the terms and conditions of any university superannuation scheme, continue to apply to a covered pension scheme after a transfer order has been made.</p>
          <p eId="para_788">Section 14 provides that nothing in Part 3 of the Bill or in any transfer order affects the jurisdiction of the Pensions Ombudsman or procedures relating to internal dispute resolution established under section 132 of the Pensions Act 1990. If a relevant pension scheme confers on a Minister the function of settling disputes, the relevant Minister continues to have that function after the making of a transfer order.</p>
          <p eId="para_789">I will be bringing forward a Committee Stage amendment to provide for the inclusion of the pension funds of the Economic and Social Research Institute and the Institute of Public Administration in the scope of the Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_790">Part 4 deals with guarantees by Minister for Finance.  Section 15 deals with the construction of certain provisions when the Minister for Finance guarantees non-equity securities and so on.  It amends the Prospectus Directive Regulations 2005 and the Investment Funds, Companies and Miscellaneous Provisions Act 2005 to protect the Exchequer by removing any legal liability on the State as guarantor of certain debt securities for the accuracy of information contained in prospectuses that relate to the guarantor and the guarantee.</p>
          <p eId="para_791">Part 5 deals with the amendment of other legislation.  Section 16 is an amendment  required to give full effect to the transposition of the Assessment of Acquisitions in the Financial Sector Directive 2007.  I recently signed the European Communities (Assessment of Acquisitions in the Financial Sector) Regulations 2009, SI 206 of 2009, which transpose that directive.  It establishes a harmonised legal framework setting out the procedure to be applied by competent authorities when assessing acquisitions on prudential grounds in the EU/EEA.</p>
          <p eId="para_792">Part II, Chapter VI of the Central Bank Act 1989 already provided a regime for acquiring transactions relating to holders of banking licences.  The amendment in section 75(1) of the Central Bank Act 1989 disapplies the existing regime for acquisitions in the case where the regime created by SI 206 of 2009 now applies, thus ensuring that the directive is transposed correctly and that there is no dual acquisitions regime in the State.</p>
          <p eId="para_793">Section 17 amends the Credit Institutions (Financial Support) Act 2008.  As Deputies will be aware Ireland was the first EU member state to make a guarantee available to its financial sector at the end of September 2008 last.  As a result, in contrast to the position in other member states, the governing legislation and detailed scheme currently in place do not allow for guarantees to be provided for a period which would allow banks to access new longer-term funding which would make a significant contribution to further strengthening of their financial standing and stability overall.  The House will understand as the term of the guarantee proceeds the importance of providing scope for extending the term of the guarantee increases so it is appropriate to provide scope for addressing the issue in this Bill.  Section 17 therefore amends, via the Schedule to the Bill, the Credit Institutions (Financial Support) Act 2008, to allow for the extension of the period of financial support beyond 29 September 2010 by ministerial order.  Access to longer term funding is line with the recent mainstream approach in the EU will contribute significantly to supporting the funding needs of the banks and to securing their continued stability.</p>
          <p eId="para_794">It is important to stress that the implementation of this provision include a number of important safeguards.  First, in making an order to provide financial support on an extended basis the Minister must be satisfied, following consultation with Governor of the Central Bank and Financial Regulator, that the circumstances set out in section 2 of the Credit Institutions (Financial Support) Act 2008 continue to apply.</p>
          <p eId="para_795">In addition, EU state aid approval is required for any financial support provided under the Act.  Moreover, the Minister in making a scheme to provide financial support in the form of a guarantee must secure the positive approval of both Houses of the Oireachtas in accordance with section 6(5) of the primary legislation.</p>
          <p eId="para_796">Sections 18 and 19 deal with amendments to the insurance Acts.  The Insurance (No. 2) Act was introduced in 1983 to enable the then Minister for Trade, Commerce and Tourism to present a petition to the court for an order for the administration of a non-life insurance company and the appointment of an administrator.  As this option is not available for life insurance and reinsurance companies, the Financial Regulator asked for this regulatory gap to be addressed, which explains the necessity for this amendment.</p>
          <p eId="para_797">Section 20 amends the Netting of Financial Contracts Act 1995 to insert a new definition of "party" in that Act.  The purpose of this amendment is to clarify the application of that Act for netting agreements where one party to the agreement has created a security interest in favour of a third party.  The Netting of Financial Contracts Act 1995 encompasses only bilateral netting agreements.  However, the creation of a security interest by either party to a netting agreement could result in an interpretation that the agreement is between more than two parties.  In such circumstances, the protections afforded by the Netting of Financial Contracts Act in the event of insolvency may not apply.  This has the potential to cause significant difficulties for parties to netting agreements, including issues affecting the capital adequacy position of the parties, as well as impacting on the cost and viability of such transactions in the Irish market.  The amended definition of "party" clarifies that it does not include any person in whose favour a security interest has been created.</p>
          <p eId="para_798">Section 21 deals with amendments to the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997.  In the context of the transfer of the pension funds' assets there are a number of amendments to the Taxes Consolidation Act in Schedule 2, Part 6.  These amendments are technical in nature and clarify that the assets of the National Pensions Reserve Fund, in addition to the National Pensions Reserve Fund Commission, are also exempt from Irish tax.</p>
          <p eId="para_799">As I have outlined, the issues addressed in this Bill largely relate to some important, albeit technical, issues.  The Bill will also address a number of technical reforms to various Acts falling within my remit.  I hope the Bill will be examined by the House in the time available in a positive and constructive way.  I commend the Bill to the House.</p>

          <from>Deputy Richard Bruton</from>
          <p eId="para_802">While the Title of this Bill, Financial Measures (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill, sounds very innocent, the Bill has quite large implications.  I am very unhappy with the way in which the debate is being conducted.  This is not the first time, in the course of the banking crisis, that we have seen both policy and legislation being introduced on the hoof, without the opportunity for proper debate.  It is disconcerting.  There has been an extension of the guarantee, recapitalisation and the nationalisation of Anglo Irish Bank, and on each occasion amendments have not been reached, guillotines have been imposed and sections have not been debated.  In time to come, when people reflect on how the Oireachtas oversaw its responsibility, they will be aghast that sections of legislation that had huge implications were simply never debated.</p>
          <p eId="para_803">The Minister pleads urgency.  Undoubtedly, urgency can be pleaded in these cases.  However, there is an old adage to the effect that the urgent often squeezes out the important.  That can happen here.  Ministers come to the Chamber in a flurry saying a measure is very urgent.  There is a great rush but the important work of debate is not done.  That is what we are here to do.  We might be an inconvenient cog in the wheel that is not moving at the speed the Government would wish but we are elected to do that.  It is our role.</p>
          <p eId="para_804">There is a creeping sense of self-righteousness on the part of the Government and in the tone of its statements.  It appears to be saying: "Here we are doing all these difficult things, and not one of you will give us an ounce of support."  I have also seen instances of deliberate misinterpretation of what the Opposition has said to promote the notion that the Opposition is irresponsible and misunderstanding of what is really happening.  I get worried when I hear Ministers and Taoisigh pretending the Opposition does not understand instead of defending what they are putting forth.  I have seen this happen repeatedly.  Instead of the Government setting out the reasons for the guarantee, NAMA, the nationalisation and recapitalisation of Anglo Irish Bank and keeping it as a going concern, it attacks everybody else, as if all of us are Balubas trying to destroy our international reputation.  That is a dangerous basis on which to have a debate, and there must be a proper debate about these issues.  It might be a good political tactic but it is a short-term gain.</p>
          <p eId="para_805">Today, we are being asked to extend the guarantee beyond September 2010.  To be fair, the exchanges with the Taoiseach began to clarify what the intention is, which is not clear from any of the legislative material that has been presented to Members.  The Taoiseach attempted to make it clear that what the Government was going to extend was very limited.  There is no such limitation in any of the legislative material we have seen.  He said that a review had come to the conclusion that this is needed.  No Opposition Members have seen this review.  I presume we will have to take it on faith that our betters have read it and have drawn these very wise conclusions, but the Oireachtas should have access to these reviews if they are so important.</p>
          <p eId="para_806">There is no report on the existing scheme, for which we voted.  Payments are being made and this has substantially increased the cost to the Exchequer of borrowing.  We have not received a report, yet we are already obliged, for understandable reasons, to vote through an extension of it.  There is no legislative guarantee that it will be confined to the instruments the Minister mentioned.  There is no sunset clause to establish how long it could continue.  Yes, the Dáil will have the opportunity to approve the scheme when it finally emerges but there appears to be a cat and mouse game involved in finding out when that will be.  Will it be brought before the House before the summer recess, when we will be bounced into approving it, or will it be a more leisurely development and not launched until the autumn?  At times the Taoiseach gives the impression that this is highly urgent and that there are opportunities in the market which we must rush out and seize, while at other times it all sounds very leisurely, with much drafting and consultation with the EU and others required before we will see the scheme.  Which is it?  It cannot be both.  It cannot be a case of opportunities being whisked from under our noses in the absence of this legislation on the one hand, and then claiming there will be plenty of time to consult and all that is required is statutory approval.</p>
          <p eId="para_807">This is a little like our children informing us they want to go to a concert and asking us for our credit card number and expiry date to book tickets.  That happens, but one can tolerate it from one's children.  However, when a Minister comes to us seeking that type of arrangement, whereby we give him the credit card and he promises to return in a few months to tell us what he spent with it and what commitments he made that we will have to honour, that is worrying.  There is an element of this——</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#BrianLenihan" eId="spk_358" as="#Minister_for_Finance">
          <from>Deputy Brian Lenihan</from>
          <p eId="para_808">There are no commitments until the House approves the scheme.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#RichardBruton" eId="spk_359">
          <from>Deputy Richard Bruton</from>
          <p eId="para_809">That is all very well but the Minister can say: "We have now made these commitments and simply cannot go back on them."  We have no time to debate it now but when the Minister comes forward with the scheme he will tell us: "This is ready to go — AIB or Bank of Ireland have made huge commitments, they are ready to sign and the House must get this through."</p>
          <p eId="para_810">We have already seen this happen.  We were told with the guarantee that there was a buffer for the taxpayer.  However, very quickly after that we heard that AIB and even Anglo Irish Bank were to get €1.5 billion in recapitalisation.  We had no role in deciding whether that was a good thing.  Then we were told Anglo Irish Bank would be nationalised.  That debate was curtailed and we did not get a chance to insert protections.  Following that, we were told that Anglo Irish Bank had to be kept going as a going concern.  It could not be nationalised on the basis of a wind down.  We did not get the opportunity to have a proper debate on whether these were sound policies.  That is frustrating.</p>
          <p eId="para_811">With each sequence the Minister states that he is only looking for one thing, but he will already have made commitments.  In the case of NAMA, for example, he will probably have made commitments before September that are simply irreversible.  Technically, the Minister can say the Dáil is approving the matter but <i>de facto</i> he will have entered into such commitments and the train will be so far down the track that going back to the station to redesign the train will not be an option.  The Minister will not accept amendments because the train will have long since left the station as far as he is concerned.</p>
          <p eId="para_812">There is a legitimate role for this House but it is not getting a chance to exercise it.  This is a type of smother tactic.  If one questions it later on then one is guilty of sabotage.  It is like the Government asking us to admire its work even as it wishes to re-design some element of it.  We are told this is outrageous and are asked to imagine what will happen to our international standing, with people looking in at us who will think we are a banana republic.  We are told the Oireachtas wants to having a say in designing how our very great amounts of money will be committed.  I am very unhappy with the way this is going.</p>
          <p eId="para_813">I can see the argument for a selective extension of the guarantee and I do not oppose that.  However, I do not see anything about selectivity before us and cannot understand why we do not extend the powers under section 5.  We are asking the taxpayer to extend our guarantee and take all this on the shoulders but the protections outlined in section 5, in which the Minister has powers to take action with the banks, will die in September 2010.  Surely there is a <i>quid pro quo</i>.  If the taxpayer is to be asked to carry the guarantee beyond the September date, surely we should be told there will be powers to match the responsibility we are being asked to take on board.  However, there is no mention of extending section 5 and the admittedly extraordinary powers afforded to the Minister by that section.  I believe we should extend a de-limited number of those powers beyond September 2010 in order to have a balance.</p>
          <p eId="para_814">I welcome the Minister's talk of changes in the regulatory system.  I will not dwell on this because we are constrained by time.  However, nobody believes that the reason our property bubble got out of hand was because the Central Bank and the Irish Financial Services Regulatory Authority, IFSRA, were not talking to one another.  That is the plainest poppycock I have ever heard.  There was no problem with the Central Bank being able to talk to the IFSRA, or with both knowing what the other was doing.  They had substantially the same, or interlocking, board members.  The Governor of the Central Bank had the chance to say anything he liked and the opportunity under law to request any information he wanted from the IFSRA.  He had absolute authority to get everything that was needed.</p>
          <p eId="para_815">There is a notion that we need to re-design all these stables to the highest international standard but what really happened was that the stable door was left gaping open when the horse galloped out.  This was not a defect in the design of the stable though now we may say there were some defects in the design.  The bodies were adequately supported and the design defects were consciously and knowingly pushed through this House by the Minister's predecessor but one.  It was not the design that went wrong.  The theoretical criticism of that design was about merging consumer protection with prudential.  The Central Bank, which had responsibility for systemic risk, had all the powers it needed to protect against systemic risk if it had been on the ball and doing its work.  The truth was the horse bolted because that stable door was lying open and all we heard were a few powerless whimpers as the horse galloped out the door.  That is the reality.  To say that this is about best practice and is driven by the EU standards is misleading concerning what happened.  We should, as other jurisdictions have, a White Paper on regulation prior to the implementation of the change but to cover people's blushes, we are pushing ahead with the re-carving up of the institutions.  However, that was not the problem. This is covering other people's blushes — not, in this case, those of the Minister — and it is not a very satisfactory way to do it.  We should take it more seriously.</p>
          <p eId="para_816">The same can be said of the NAMA.  I do not believe we have had anything like the level we should have of evaluation available to the House and to the general public in respect of a decision of such grave national importance.</p>
          <p eId="para_817">I shall turn briefly to the issue of pension provisions.  As Deputy Burton mentioned on the Order of Business, we are taking on our shoulders over €3.1 billion in liability versus assets of €1.75 billion.  That is a substantial deficit to be taken on the shoulders of the taxpayer.  Undoubtedly, the Minister will say there was an implicit commitment in this area and that, implicitly, the State was going to support the pensions of universities, and so on.  We must examine the merchandise before we make a purchase of this nature.  It is the most basic rule.  One does one's due diligence before one takes on such liability.  It is now absolutely on our shoulders.  Where is the actuaries' audit of these pension funds?  Deputy Ardagh, who would be far more qualified in this respect than I, will understand that one would expect some sort of report concerning what are the assets and the liabilities.  What did the actuaries say to the trustees about what should be done to contain the deficit?  Are the practices in these pension funds sound?  Are there some crazy practices going on?  We ought to have that sort of information before us before walking in to shoulder all these commitments.</p>
          <p eId="para_818">I accept we must shoulder many of them but we should be vetting what are the practices and whether they are well-based.  Are  practices going on here that would not happen in other areas of the public service and in other areas of pension policy, practices we would not want to have carried into the public sector?  We must look at that and have some reassurance.</p>

That is probably necessary in the present climate but there is no requirement on the Minister if this is to be repeated.  We are setting a precedent whereby the Minister does not state what the sound principle is, namely, that assets of this nature should not diminish our commitment to providing pensions for the future.  That would be the principle that would normally be espoused.  One could say that at present it makes sense to deviate from that sound principle because otherwise we would have to go out into international markets to borrow.  However, the Minister has not annunciated the sound principle in the legislation and subsequently stated there is a deviation.  Presumably, this will be looked to in the future as the legislative precedent for other pensions.  Undoubtedly, there will be other pensions involved because there are people such as regulators whose pension schemes, as far as I know, are not included here but who probably have the same expectation that the State will underpin their pension position.  I do not know if that is the case.  The Minister is looking in a puzzled way——</p>

          <p eId="para_832">I wish to touch on some items within the Bill.  The Government has guaranteed the extension of its own guarantee.  In principle, there is nothing against that but it puts taxpayers' money at risk for an extended period.  In effect, the Minister will have to bring a scheme back to the House but it appears he is putting the cart before the horse.  We will have no precise idea of what is in the scheme.  Does the Minister have a date for the extension of the scheme?  When will he give us an indication of that date?  When will he bring the scheme before the House?</p>
          <p eId="para_833">Regarding the pension scheme, it is an adjusting item for general Government balance that has not been paid for by the State but effectively comes from the pension funds of other semi-State bodies.  The Minister is putting it forward as an adjusting item but I believe it should have been left as a non-adjusting item because it reduces the general Government balance although it is not a payment from the Minister's good self on behalf of the taxpayer.  Was any form of due diligence carried out by the Department prior to taking over the pension funds?  Was any proper actuarial valuation carried out on the assets and liabilities?  I understand that the former amount to approximately €1.75 billion and that the latter amount to approximately €3.1 billion.  On what was the valuation carried out and is it up to date?  That the deficit is approximately €1.35 billion should be taken on board.</p>
          <p eId="para_834">The asset value of €1.75 billion is reflected in the Minister's contribution to the National Pensions Reserve Fund, NPRF, and is an adjusting item in terms of reducing the general government balance, but the liability of €3.1 billion is not being reflected anywhere.  In normal business, one would be required to reflect this liability.</p>
          <p eId="para_835">Part 3 of Schedule 2 amends the Insurance (No. 2) Act 1983 to "enable the Financial Regulator to present a petition to the High Court for the administration of a life insurance or reinsurance undertaking and the appointment of an administrator where it considers that the business of the insurer-reinsurer is being or has been conducted in such a way that inadequate provision has been made for its debts including contingent and prospective liabilities".  Is there a specific reason for including this amendment in the Financial Measures (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill less than two weeks prior to the Dáil getting up?  I assume that the Dáil will sit until 9 July.  We are not having a real debate, as Second Stage will be guillotined in just over 30 minutes.  Given the possible implications for the Exchequer and the taxpayer in terms of life insurance companies——</p>

          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_847">Dáil Éireann declines to give a Second Reading to the Financial Measures (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2009 because of the provision contained in the Bill that will allow for the indefinite extension of the bank guarantee scheme by Ministerial Order.</p>
          <p eId="para_848">It is nine months since the fateful night of 29 September when the bank guarantee was hatched to save Anglo Irish Bank on the eve of its financial year end.  What promises we heard from the Minister, Deputy Brian Lenihan, that day about new capital flows into the banks and, through them, into the economy as a whole.   It is fair to ask what the experience of the past nine months has been, a period during which the Minister repeatedly declared that the banking crisis had been contained and offered a series of still unsuccessful fixes.  What justifies the belief that he knows what he is doing?  He is making it up as he goes along and tonight's Bill is just the latest instalment.</p>
          <p eId="para_849">The Minister is demanding near dictatorial authority and even immunity from review and scrutiny.  On his record, he does not deserve such power and immunity.  The flows of new credit to business have never occurred and the banking crisis has worsened.  A professional stopped me in the street and asked me to ask the Minister whether he knows that, by September, only a few professionals will still be employing people because the situation has grown so bad.</p>
          <p eId="para_850">The multi-billion euro recapitalisation has come and gone and been digested by the banks without the slightest hiccup.  The flow of credit remains as elusive as ever.  NAMA is the new panacea to achieve what the guarantee failed to deliver.  Now, the Minister wants another prop to cover up the dismal failure of his original efforts nine months ago.  He wants to assume a stunning new power to decide on extensions to the guarantee.  In effect, he wants to rule by decree as if he were a new Napoleon.  Why this and why now?  Is it because the Minister and the Taoiseach do not expect to be in office when the September 2008 guarantee expires in September 2010?  Is it that they want to impose the burden of the Minister's failed policies on his successor?  Perhaps their cronies and political clients in the banks and among the developers want to have this extra lock on policy——</p>

          <p eId="para_856">——from, presumably, the Department of Finance.</p>
          <p eId="para_857">For the Dáil to award these sweeping powers to a Minister is an abdication of responsibility.  For Government Deputies to agree so casually to this Bill would be a shocking dereliction of duty.  The Dáil has a sacred duty to scrutinise the exercise of power by Ministers.  This Bill abandons that duty and enables the Minister to exercise power without due accountability.  The Bill should be opposed in principle.  The core value that is entirely absent here today is transparency.</p>
          <p eId="para_858">We only got the PricewaterhouseCoopers report on Anglo Irish Bank because that bank imploded under the weight of its persistent malpractice and had to be nationalised.  We have still not received a full review of Bank of Ireland, AIB or the Irish Nationwide Building Society.  How then can this House, in the absence of full information, so readily abandon its duty and transfer so much power to one Minister with no restrictions on the exercise of that power and not demand that he provide the Dáil and the taxpaying public with sufficient evidential basis for the decisions he makes in the exercise of those powers?  This Bill will result in liabilities for the taxpayer of tens of billions over a period of time less than five years, depending on whatever date the Minister deems the Paris agreement originated, yet there is not as much as a figure in the Bill.  I will refer to the pension liabilities and the pension assets taken over.  It is truly stunning to have such a Bill, the financial implications of which will affect not only this generation of taxpayers, but taxpayers for another 20 years.</p>
          <p eId="para_859">Believe it or not, Mr. Enron over on the Government side does not even have a financial figure to offer us.  That is absolutely outrageous.  How can we so casually agree to the Bill without guarantees of accountability?  I do not trust the Minister's party on this matter.  It has been and remains the silent spider at the centre of a conspiratorial web of dodgy property deals and corrupt rezoning.  How could it be trusted?  That party is simply too closely wedded to vested interests in the property sector to enjoy the trust of the people in this sensitive matter.  Why the extra layer of guarantee at this point?  First, we had the 29 September guarantee, time-limited for two years.  Then we had NAMA, the mechanism to transfer dodgy loans to the State at excessive prices.  Now we have a proposal to abolish the two-year time limit and replace it with ministerial powers to extend the time.  In effect, it is a triple layer of State protection for the banks.</p>
          <p eId="para_860">If NAMA gets up and running in the coming year — we understand it is to be up and running sometime in September — surely the banks will have their worst performing loans transferred by September 2010?  Why would they then need an additional extension of the guarantee?  The Minister has told us NAMA will work, that it will take the dodgy loans and clean up the banks' balance sheet, yet the banks' balance sheets having been cleaned up, we are now offering another guarantee for up to five years.  We do not even have a date.  In fact, in the Schedule, the additional guarantee period is unlimited and undated.  This is an extra cocoon of Lenihan insulation from the cold winds of the market for our wretched banks.</p>
          <p eId="para_861">I thought capitalism's great virtue was the value it placed on market disciplines.  If one invested and took risk, then one was entitled to the rewards of success with modest taxation.  If one lost and one's investment failed, then tough luck.  Try again.  No lame ducks.  No sore losers.  Why are the banks now exempt from all those rules?  They are now lame ducks kept alive solely because of the guarantee and the prospect of NAMA taking on their soured loans.  Are they not sore losers?  Look at them, still in total denial of the wreckage they have created in businesses, families and people with jobs and employment around the country.</p>
          <p eId="para_862">The Minister is a distinguished senior counsel.  He knows what double jeopardy means.  What we have tonight is double jeopardy in reverse.  It is double indemnity for the banks.  In fact, it is triple indemnity for them.  Indemnity No. 1 is the first guarantee.  It has not worked so the banks want another fix.  Indemnity No. 2 is NAMA, the magic wand that will draw the poison of bad loans away from the balance sheets.  Now the Minister has gone one step further with this new power to extend the guarantee for a further undefined period that I understand is to be up to five years.  The banks are to be saved and now they are to be cocooned by three layers of Lenihan insulation.</p>
          <p eId="para_863">Does moral hazard have any place in this Minister's universe?  Moral hazard arises because an institution does not have to suffer the full consequences and responsibilities of its actions.  This weekend at Farmleigh the Minister appears to have thrown the avoidance of moral hazard out the window as a guiding principle of policy in the case of all commercial banks.  Their debts, no matter how dodgy and how recklessly accumulated, will now, in effect, be the sovereign debts of the State according to the Lenihan Farmleigh doctrine.  According to <i>The Irish Times</i>, the Government press office did not circulate any speech from the event in Farmleigh, whatever it was.  Nor it is on the Department’s website.  I wonder why.  Is it because it contains some extremely important statements?  What did the Minister, Deputy Brian Lenihan, say at this dinner?  One sentence stands out in the report.</p>

          <p eId="para_865">Whatever the event was — let us call it a tea party.  There were tea cups and coffee.  The Minister stated: "Governments have to prevent banks failing and stabilise them."  There one has it — no caveats, no exceptions.  Every bank is of systemic importance.  None can be allowed to fail.  In a nutshell, that is the new Fianna Fáil ideology.  Children can be allowed to die or to live lives of dreadful suffering because of health cuts.  Children can be educated in super-sized classes with little regard for their well-being, but no bank can be allowed to fail, whatever the cost to our country.  Any speculative bondholder who risks his or her money in an Irish bank will be allowed the profit when things go well, but none can be asked to take a hit if things go wrong.</p>
          <p eId="para_866">The private debt of Irish banks ranks equally to the public debt of the sovereign State.  The taxpayer has to pay always.  Does the Minister remember Seánie FitzPatrick?  He gets to keep his mega pension pot no matter what happens.  The banks are to be free commercially but if anything goes wrong then Ireland, as a sovereign State, will offer not one, not two, but three and maybe more layers of guarantee and insulation, as required, at whatever cost to protect them.  Moral hazard is the standard rule of capitalism that decrees that one has to bear some responsibility for one's actions but the Minister has decided to set that aside.</p>
          <p eId="para_867">I wish to quote from one university economist speaking about the Minister.  Mr. Gregory Connor from NUI Maynooth stated: "Our current Irish Finance Minister is not competent for the job and his statements have no logical consistency.  Trying to interpret his statements in terms of a logically consistent perspective on the current market environment is an exercise in futility."  That pretty much sums it up.  We are being railroaded by the Bill.</p>

          <from>Deputy Joan Burton</from>
          <p eId="para_869">No.  I hope the Minister gets around to reading what some of the economists have to say.  That is a mild comment compared to some of the analyses on the various websites.</p>
          <p eId="para_870">I wish to refer to the transfer of the pension liabilities.  The Minister should listen to me for a moment.  Deputy Ardagh is sitting behind the Minister and he has some sensible questions to ask about the Bill.  We are taking over liabilities.  I thank the Department for the list of liabilities I received.  It took a lot of persuasion to get it.  I understand the Minister had the list until approximately lunch time.  He could not decide whether to release the pages to me.  The sum of €3 billion is listed on the liabilities.  Currently, the National Pensions Reserve Fund does not stand much above €15 billion, depending on what the current valuation is, because it has fallen a lot.  Those liabilities are one fifth of the National Pensions Reserve Fund.</p>
          <p eId="para_871">Before the emergency budget and last year, moving those assets on was considered a smart move because the assets can be taken into the State assets to improve the financial situation somewhat.  However, it is absolutely ridiculous to have that happening with no attempt at analysis.  A reasonable question can be asked.  FÁS has €328 million of pension assets and €683 million of pension liabilities.  Some of the institutions listed have a much lower liability.  In other words, their deficits are not nearly as big.  The liability of two other institutions — Trinity College Dublin and the National University of Ireland — is less than 50% funded.  This is a very important issue concerning the financial responsibilities and liabilities of this country and in itself is deserving of detailed and serious discussion.  We need to know why this happened.  Although funds suffer from the general downfall in the markets, as a national parliament we are entitled to ask, and are simply responsible for asking, questions about what has occurred.  What the Minister is doing may well be very worthwhile and I am sure the staff in the various universities and public bodies will be delighted, but we must ask how we reached this point.  Who was asleep on the job such that pension liabilities were allowed to become so under-funded?  It is absolutely stunning.</p>
          <p eId="para_872">With regard to other elements of the legislation, I do not have enough experience of the insurance market to know why the Financial Regulator now wants to introduce regulations dealing with the appointment of an administrator in the case of a life insurance business.  We do not have too many life assurance companies in this country.  This measure did not come out of nowhere.  The Minister states the provision has no particular purpose but it is legitimate to ask what are the various life insurance companies in the State, their current liability and whether the Minister has been advised of the picture in respect thereof.  The measure provides a mechanism of redress should one or more of the companies get into difficulty.</p>
          <p eId="para_873">I note changes proposed in respect of the liability of the Financial Regulator in regard to prospectuses.  Why is this the case?  The Financial Regulator carries an advertisement on every financial product stating it is registered with or licensed by the Financial Regulator.  Why does the Minister seem to be resiling from this?  My question is legitimate and the House should be given the opportunity to address it in a longer debate.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#PatRabbitte" eId="spk_390">
          <from>Deputy Pat Rabbitte</from>
          <p eId="para_874">I thank Deputy Burton for sharing her time.</p>
          <p eId="para_875">I want to consider Part 2 of Schedule 2, which amends the Act we passed last September and, as I understand it, permits the Minister, by order, to continue the banks' guarantee essentially for as long as he sees fit.  I have heard Deputy Bruton refer to selective extensions only and to the Taoiseach's qualification of this on the Order of Business or during Leaders' Questions.  I would like to hear the Minister explain how the extensions are qualified and limited because it seems that so long as he is of the opinion that it is in the public interest that such assistance be continued and that circumstances warrant his doing so, he can make orders indefinitely.</p>
          <p eId="para_876">This is such a major matter that I do not believe any greater one will come before the House unless some nation declares war on us.  We believed some €440 billion in liabilities was guaranteed until 29 September 2010 but the Minister is now taking power unto himself, and by order, to extend this period when and if he sees fit.  The criteria laid down in section 6(3A) and so forth are not really very onerous.  Given how we interpreted the legislation so far, we can predict the Minister will extend the timeframe.</p>
          <p eId="para_877">The Taoiseach made a reasonable point today when he said there are borrowing opportunities in the marketplace of which he would not be able to take advantage were the date restricted to 29 September 2010.  However, the blanket power is excessive.  The least one can say is that this House ought to have been given the opportunity to scrutinise the Bill at leisure and hear the Minister's arguments.  We are not being given that opportunity.</p>
          <p eId="para_878">I do not claim to have the knowledge of Deputies Burton and Bruton on this measure and have quite a heavy legislative burden of my own as part of my spokesmanship, but I am one of a number of Deputies who believe we are taking a momentous decision that will affect future generations.  The Deputies would like to believe they could be reasonably assured, following debate in the Oireachtas, that they are going broadly in the right direction and have discharged their duty.  We cannot discharge our duty in the time provided or in the manner proposed, regardless of whatever excuse will be presented on 29 September 2010.</p>
          <p eId="para_879">While it is very easy to talk on the Opposition side of the House, I understand the dilemma that may well have arisen on that fateful night when the two chief executives told the Minister for Finance and Taoiseach the house of cards was to come down in the morning and that the banking system would collapse if it were not guaranteed.  It is like the case of a bomb disposal expert faced with cutting a red or blue wire in the knowledge that making the incorrect decision will have disastrous consequences.  I understand this but cannot understand today, on 23 June 2009, the pressure not to permit the House to scrutinise this legislation Stage by Stage, as was intended when the legislative process was put in place.  I worry about this enormously.</p>
          <p eId="para_880">As Deputy Burton stated, we saw a piece of the jigsaw last week and are to see another next week and we do not know when we will see the National Asset Management Agency Bill.  I am told there are developers working feverishly at present to strip out the not-so-risky bad loans and place them with institutions whose headquarters are outside the State and not covered for the purposes of this legislation, such that by the time the National Asset Management Agency becomes operable, we will be left with the more long-term liabilities or useless or less valuable assets.</p>
          <p eId="para_881">There are so many questions one would like the opportunity to raise.  Deputies Burton and Bruton both dealt with the regulatory system.  I cannot get my head around how one originally small bank, Anglo Irish Bank, was permitted to blow the bubble so large that the entire banking system was put at risk.  Nobody shouted "Stop".  As Deputy Burton fairly stated, it does not matter how often the bank returns for recapitalisation, the guarantee will leave us with no choice but to pony up.</p>
          <p eId="para_882">I missed the Minister's introductory remarks because I had to go out to the gate to meet a woman who, in 2001, had to remortgage her house to get €25,000 to meet a pressing family need.  She went to the Bank of Ireland yesterday to pay off the loan.  She has been paying in the intervening years at a fixed rate.  The bank wanted €58,000 to discharge the loan.</p>
          <p eId="para_883">She had raised the €58,000 and went to hand it in to the Bank of Ireland which asked for a €12,000 break-out fee on top of the €58,000.  That is what the average punter is experiencing.  For all of the recapitalisation we have no protocol with the banks which can exert that kind of pressure.</p>
          <p eId="para_884">In the minute remaining to me I want to underwrite Deputy Burton's comments on the pensions issue.  I, too, am delighted for the staff of the universities and FÁS.  If one travels a lot one needs pension reassurance.  What about all the people in the private sector who are experiencing problems with defined benefit pension schemes and so on, yet at the flip of a coin we take on this responsibility?  It is all very well for Deputy Burton to say that it was an addition to the balance sheet on that side but what about the liabilities that come with it?  It is mind-blowing.  The assets in the FÁS scheme are €328 million.  I do not know what scrutiny they have undergone by way of audit of individual schemes and so on.  The liabilities are €683 million.  That measure of the pension transfer alone would warrant the kind of debate that we are having here until 11 p.m. tonight, never mind the bigger issues in the Bill.</p>

          <from>Deputy Arthur Morgan</from>
          <p eId="para_885">I thank the Labour Party for sharing time with me.  In the brief time available to me I must confine my comments to the crucial part of the Bill, the section enabling the Minister to extend the bank guarantee scheme on a whim, which makes the State liable for almost all of the toxic debts in our financial institutions.  I wonder why the Minister has decided to delegate this power to himself.  Why can we not have a proper debate on a scheme which could end up literally bankrupting the State?  I would not give these powers to a Minister for Finance from my own party much less to a Fianna Fáil Minister for Finance irrespective of who the Minister was — in fact, I certainly would not give it to a Fianna Fáil Minister.</p>
          <p eId="para_886">What the Minister proposes to do disenfranchises this House.  It takes away an opportunity for us to have a proper debate and gives him dangerously sweeping powers.  The Minister is advised by an Attorney General who might be of the view that this legislation is within the principles laid down in Cityview Press <i>v.</i> AnCO and is not repugnant to the Constitution.  This is, of course, the same Attorney General who thinks we cannot impose a pay cut on the Judiciary despite the view of numerous legal commentators who think that we can.  That is a bluff.  The intent is to ensure that a judge is not penalised because of a decision that he or she made and is nothing to do with what is intended here, which is to protect the public finances.</p>
          <p eId="para_887">The extension of the guarantee means extending the public's liability for toxic debts created by the fat cats and the speculator friends of the Fianna Fáil Party in particular.  We will end up guaranteeing more debts and cementing our liability to pre-existing debts.  That is completely unacceptable as people outside the House are saying.  Whatever about the reasons given at the time, the banking guarantee scheme has failed to provide any stability and the only thing it has done is expose people to debts they did not create which could result in the State's being bankrupt.  The Minister does not have a mandate to bankrupt the State.  He does not have the right to use public money in any way he deems fit and he does not have the right to decide what is in the public interest without proper debate in this House.</p>
          <p eId="para_888">Over the past eight years his Government thought it was in the public interest to allow the property bubble to get out of control and to ignore the warnings that we were too reliant on the construction industry for employment and for failing to ensure adequate tax revenue.  His Government knows nothing about the public interest.  Why does this sweeping power need to be passed on to the Minister when there is a sunlight clause in the Credit Institutions (Financial Support) Act which allows for him to extend the scheme upon a resolution of the House?  The very least that would require would be that the Minister would introduce a resolution in the House that we would debate and on which we would vote.</p>

          <p eId="para_894">I look forward to his reply to that point.</p>
          <p eId="para_895">We were misled about the guarantee scheme in the original legislation.  We were told that proper terms and conditions would be brought in that would bring the banks to account.  No such terms and conditions were brought in.  Poor Seánie has gone off and has to survive on the mere €83 million that he borrowed and whatever other bits and pieces he brought with him.  There is also the debacle of Anglo Irish Bank.</p>

          <from>Minister for Finance (Deputy Brian Lenihan)</from>
          <p eId="para_897">I will try to deal with the points raised by Deputies in so far as I can.  I thank them for their contributions to a very brief debate.</p>
          <p eId="para_898">Deputy Bruton suggested that I was accusing the Opposition of irresponsibility.  I am not accusing him of irresponsibility in respect of this legislation.  All the Deputies mentioned the guarantee.  The current legislation provides for the guarantee to end at the end of September 2010.  That creates significant problems for the medium-term funding of Irish banks in terms of the senior debt they can acquire.  This is not debt to be advanced to them on a speculative or hazardous basis but the routine funding requirements of the banks.  That difficulty has arisen because other European countries have also explicitly or implicitly guaranteed their banks.</p>
          <p eId="para_899">Deputy Burton dramatises the night of 29 September in many of her public contributions but every European country has now explicitly or implicitly guaranteed its financial institutions.  The terms of those guarantees in many other European countries have enabled guarantees to be given to the banks beyond our expiry period of September 2010.  It is important that our banks be put on an equal playing field with other banks.  That is the purpose of taking this power.  It cannot be exercised without positive approval in this House.  There is no question of entering a commitment of any kind before there is positive approval in this House.  There is no question either, as some Deputies suggested casually, of underwriting existing borrowings by the financial institutions.</p>
          <p eId="para_900">If the Commission approves a proposal from the Irish Government and if it is brought to this House, the terms of that proposal will apply to debt issues subsequent to the adoption of the proposal by this House.  We will have plenty of opportunity to discuss this matter in the event that the EU Commission approves of the approach the Government is taking.  Therefore, the scope of the power is not unlimited.  It is limited by the essential and positive approval of this House.</p>
          <p eId="para_901">I was glad to see an amount of critical comment in the newspapers about the announcement in respect of the Central Bank and IFSRA because it is not at the heart of the regulatory reform.</p>
          <p eId="para_902">At the heart of that reform, as I announced in the budget, is the need to ensure that whoever heads up the regulator commands total confidence and produces a radical change of culture in the operation of banking regulation in this country.  To recruit the new regulator we have engaged Sir Andrew Large, a former deputy governor of the Bank of England, to preside over the recruitment process.</p>
          <p eId="para_903">To produce a regulator one must have a job specification.  Therefore, I brought proposals to the Government to provide for certain essential changes required in the legislation so we know exactly, in terms of appointing a candidate as regulator, what is the job specification.  I did not bring forward those proposals as a final solution to the problems of our regulatory system and many commentators made the point that tinkering around with the regulatory system would not resolve our problems.  I agree but, at the same time, when one is in the process of recruiting a regulator it is important to set out the legislative framework into which that person will be slotted.</p>
          <p eId="para_904">Deputy Bruton raised the question of university pensions and the fact that we are shouldering commitments.  I can confirm that the State was effectively liable for the liabilities of the pension funds being transferred and, as such, they do not constitute an additional liability.  This important point was also raised by Deputies Burton and Rabbitte and we are already shouldering these commitments.  With regard to the question of auditing what we will receive, I assure Deputies that a full actuarial assessment was made at my Department on the various securities and interests that will be transferred.  Deputy Burton met my officials last Friday and I regret that she was not able to see the final calculations she had wanted until lunchtime today.</p>

          <p eId="para_906">My officials were not able to contact me this morning because I was at a Government meeting and that is why there was a delay in informing Deputy Burton of these matters.  It is not fair either to me or my officials to hold us to blame for that.  As soon as they could contact me they asked me if I wished the information to be released and I stated to do so immediately.  There is no question of trying to conceal information from Deputy Burton.</p>
          <p eId="para_907">With regard to the life insurance companies, there is no significance to this other than that the regulator rightly believed that there should be comprehensive machinery available to the Oireachtas in this matter were any difficulties to arise.  There is no suggestion that any difficulties have arisen in this regard.  A number of other points were made but I have covered the main points of substance made by Deputies and I will try to assist them as much as I can on Committee Stage also.</p>

          <p class="indent_3" eId="para_1180">is deeply concerned:</p>
          <p class="indent_4" eId="para_1181">that the postponing of lifesaving surgery in growing children should not be an option as it can cause lifelong disability and may even shorten their lifespan;</p>
          <p class="indent_4" eId="para_1182">that the Government has applied funding cuts of €9.1 million in 2009 which, to date, has led to the indefinite closure of a ward and theatre;</p>

          <p class="indent_4" eId="para_1186">that the hospital is likely to see further ward and theatre closures which will see a reduction of out-patient appointments by 15% or 8,483 attendances and 1,100 admissions in 2009;</p>

          <p class="indent_4" eId="para_1188">that these cutbacks take no account of:</p>
          <p class="indent_5" eId="para_1189">the increased costs that Crumlin has experienced due to new technologies such as Extra Corporeal Membrane Oxidation which has reduced the mortality from cardiac surgery by 50%;</p>

          <p class="indent_5" eId="para_1193">the increased birth rate over the past number of years; and</p>

          <from>Deputy James Reilly</from>
          <p eId="para_1198">I move this motion on behalf of Fine Gael but, more importantly, on behalf of our children.  A fortnight ago, we discussed the Ryan commission report, which outlined dreadful inhumanity and cruelty to past generations of children.  All of us, one after another, expressed our shame and horror at what was done to them while nothing was done about it.  While the wrongs were committed by the religious orders, the State was complicit in allowing it to happen, and the broader society turned a blind eye.</p>
          <p eId="para_1199">The cutbacks in Crumlin Hospital will once again inflict needless pain and suffering on children.  The big difference is that this time there is something we can do about it.  We know what the implications of our decisions will be; they have been outlined very clearly for us by the relevant medical experts.</p>
          <p eId="para_1200">Let me give a few facts about scoliosis.  This is a condition that causes increased curvature of the spine.  In the bulk of cases, this is of little concern, but for the small percentage of progressive cases, it affects children severely leaving their backs twisted and deformed.  In this country we put people on the operating list when they reach 68° of curvature in their spine, because of our lack of resources.  The international standard for intervention is at 48°.  Nonetheless, at 68° one operation will correct the situation.  By the time children here get to theatre, they will be at 75° of curvature.</p>
          <p eId="para_1201">The budgetary cutbacks at Crumlin will result in patients being left longer on waiting lists.  This could mean up to three, four or even five operations for a patient who otherwise would have needed only one.  This is unacceptable.  Not alone is it unacceptable because of the need for five general anaesthetics, five admissions and five episodes of post-operative pain where one of each of these would have sufficed, it is unacceptable because these children are then left with, perhaps, their entire spine fused, resulting in reduced ability to rotate or to flex their spine, giving them life-long disability where they might have had virtually none.  It is needlessly cruel to cause extra pain and suffering where it can be avoided.  It is also financially inane, because it costs the State so much more money in terms of repeated surgery time, theatre time, hospital time and then a life of reduced capacity and all that implies for the child when he or she becomes an adult.</p>
          <p eId="para_1202">In the area of cardiac surgery, the situation is equally serious for children with cardiac anomalies like a hole in the heart, incomplete valves or other rare conditions like hypoplastic heart.  These conditions, some of which were not amenable to correction by surgery in the past, are now amenable to correction through advances in surgery and other techniques, particularly extra corporeal membrane oxidisation, ECMO, which has reduced by 50% mortality from cardiac procedures.  This has, of course, saved the lives of many young babies, but some of the corrections require repeated procedures as the baby's heart grows.</p>
          <p eId="para_1203">Even a more simple condition like a hole in the heart is a dynamic situation that changes.  Sometimes the hole will close over itself, sometimes it will stay stable and other times it will deteriorate.  When doctors realise the defect is getting worse rather than better, they will plan to do surgery in an urgent fashion.  This does not constitute an emergency, but it will rapidly become an emergency if not corrected.  Therefore, the foolishness of believing that one can delay such procedures, as will be the case due to these cutbacks, is just that, foolish.  It is foolish because it endangers the life of the child and because it may well end up costing the State more money.  Emergency surgery is never deemed to be an ideal solution, or a substitute for planned surgery.  The outcomes are very different.  When patients develop complications, this means further suffering for the patient and further worry, anxiety and emotional distress for the family.  It also means further costs for the State.  Everybody loses.</p>
          <p eId="para_1204">The list of procedures that have been delayed as a consequence of these cutbacks goes beyond these areas.  However, every effort has been made to protect children, particularly those requiring cardiology and oncology services, but in urology there are many children with serious defects, such as hypospadias, which need to be corrected, especially before they go to school where their condition can cause them tremendous psychological problems if left uncorrected.  Again we see a penny-wise, pound-foolish health policy from this Government.  While a 3% cut across all hospitals might on the face of it seem sensible, surely it would be more sensible to examine the efficiencies of each hospital, reward the ones that are efficient and penalise those that are inefficient?</p>
          <p eId="para_1205">Let us consider some of the facts on Crumlin Hospital.  In 2004 the budget was €98.6 million and in 2009 it is €134 million, an increase of some €36 million or 37%, but what we have to examine here is what happened to the €36 million.  A total of €24.3 million went in pay awards, which were outside the control of the hospital and were awarded by this Government.  The balance of some €12.4 million, or 13%, was available to deliver increased volume and complexities.</p>
          <p eId="para_1206">The increased budget enabled Crumlin to see more patients, to treat more patients and to treat more complex problems, and this it has achieved.  It can now perform life-saving operations on heart conditions that were untreatable before and is now treating many more patients.  This is not surprising because our population has increase.  This is acknowledged by the Department through increased allocations to the maternity hospitals, but the very hospital which has to treat the rare and more serious conditions and the increased number of children requiring treatment has its budget cut.</p>
          <p eId="para_1207">Today members of the Oireachtas health committee visited Crumlin Hospital.  I had already visited it in the previous week and had an in-depth tour.  I have statistics which are worth reading into the Dáil record.  All hospitals have been asked to be more efficient, to cut down bed days stayed, to do more day cases and fewer inpatient procedures.  We have had an increase in our population and our birth rate and this has been acknowledged, but Crumlin Hospital is not being acknowledged in the same way.</p>
          <p eId="para_1208">With an increasing population, more children will need treatment, but inpatient figures for 2004 and 2008 show no percentage change.  Day case surgery, however, has increased by 30%, so Crumlin is following Government policy and there is a greater emphasis on day care.  It is right and proper for children to wake up in their own beds in the morning, go to hospital for treatment and go to their own beds at night, where that is possible.</p>
          <p eId="para_1209">The number of total bed days used has increased by 14% and outpatient activity by 23%.  Theatre procedures have increased from 10,000 to 13,000, a 34% increase.  ICU bed days increased from 4,600 to 5,600, a 21% increase.  At every level of measure for efficiency, increased activity and greater emphasis on day cases, the hospital has done all that it has been asked to do, and did it within the increased budget of €12 million, or some 5%, afforded to it.  The figures show a pretty good return.  To ask it now to cut back the budget by €9 million will have a detrimental effect.  It will delay cardiac surgery.  It will turn many urgent cases into emergencies.  It will delay orthopaedic surgery, with life-long consequence for children.  This is not acceptable.  We have been told Crumlin Hospital is overstaffed by comparison to other hospitals.  Nothing could be further from the truth.  There are 63 whole time equivalent consultants in Crumlin, representing 3.7% of the workforce.  Non-consultant hospital doctors account for 6% and nurses 43%.  Administration accounts for 13.6%, which compares very favourably with other hospitals — in particular Birmingham Hospital — which generally have a figure of 16%.</p>
          <p eId="para_1210">It is disingenuous, to say the least, to compare Crumlin Hospital with Birmingham, when the figures for Birmingham included its day case surgery as well as its inpatient surgery, but the figures for Crumlin included only its inpatient surgery.  When one compares like with like, one finds Crumlin compares very favourably.  International recommendations for oncology cases state that if a hospital sees more than 50 new patients per year, it needs another consultant.  The three oncology consultants in Crumlin are seeing 100 new patients a year between them, double the international standard.  There are five paediatric surgeons in the country.  In the North there are six, serving a population one-third the size of Ireland</p>
          <p eId="para_1211">We have debunked the thoughts the Government had, namely, that the cutbacks were necessary because of overstaffing and unproductive doctors and nurses in Crumlin.  It was a needless insult to the staff at Crumlin.  It is bad enough to be understaffed and have one's budget cut, but to have it suggested that it is because one is inefficient, overstaffed or not producing the goods is grossly insulting.</p>
          <p eId="para_1212">The staff at Crumlin Hospital, however, are not particularly concerned about that hurt, rather, they are concerned about the hurt to their patients, to small babies in their mother's arms who have serious, ongoing cardiac conditions and who are having their treatments delayed causing great anxiety to their parents and extended families.  They are concerned about the children who have scoliosis, whose spines are starting to press on vital organs, whose longevity may be shortened and whose lives will have needless additional disability imposed upon them.</p>
          <p eId="para_1213">The reality of this is that the closure of St. Joseph's Ward resulted in 25 beds being lost.  While we welcome the news that there will not be further cuts, one theatre remains closed and 25 beds are lost, representing 4,000 lost bed days.  With an average bed stay of approximately five days this could cause up to 800 patients to have their treatments delayed.  We know one theatre will be closed.  This will delay surgery for many children with very worrying conditions, not just scoliosis and cardiac surgery, but also other urological conditions like hypospadias.  All of this is done for what?  For the sake of €9.6 million.</p>
          <p eId="para_1214">It is clear to me there are billions for the bankers but cutbacks for the children.  This is real.  These are not statistics.  These are real children, such as a young girl from Galway who had surgery in Crumlin where rods were inserted into her back, and has had two lengthening procedures since.  She was due another lengthening procedure within the next two weeks, but she has been advised it will now take place in September at the earliest.  She was nine months on the waiting list to have her surgery.  Her sister was diagnosed at the age of 15 with a 66° curvature of her spine in April 2008 and today is still waiting for surgery, despite the fact that when she was reviewed in April 2009 the curvature had increase to 80°.  She has been on the list for 15 months.  Her breathing is affected and her lung capacity is diminished.  She is an Irish citizen.</p>
          <p eId="para_1215">These are real people, real children and they are our citizens.  How can we do this to our own?  The many thousands of children now who will wait for an outpatient appointment because of the delays and cutbacks in the outpatients in Crumlin will rightly ask why them, and why they must suffer the delay in diagnosis.  Disabilities that could last for life might have been cured.</p>
          <p eId="para_1216">There has been tremendous spinning and management of the media on this and the latest twist is that there will not be any further closures of theatres over the summer.  However, that does not address the serious issue of St. Joseph's Ward being shut, the lost 4,000 bed days and a theatre being shut, while fully trained specialist anaesthetists and spinal surgeons stand idly by, being paid for their services by the State and unable to do the work they have been asked to do, are paid to do and want to do.</p>
          <p eId="para_1217">The idea that Cappagh can be made available was welcomed by the staff, but only if Crumlin was working at full capacity to allow them to tackle the existing backlog.  However, to close Crumlin and open Cappagh is foolish nonsense, will not save a penny and will cost the State money.  The children of this nation are our future.  Their parents will not be deflected from their responsibility to protect and care for them.  I will not be deflected from my responsibility to protect them from cutbacks.  The Minister should look elsewhere.  She should look at the €16.5 million spent on outside consultants and PR gurus, or the €60 million spent on taxis and transport — a 10% saving through better logistics would yield €6 million there alone.  Fine Gael will not stand idly by while this happens.  It is our responsibility to cry halt and to use whatever democratic mechanisms are open to us.</p>
          <p eId="para_1218">In closing, this motion is about preventing cutbacks at Crumlin hospital which will result, make no mistake, in needless suffering for children, whom we vowed to protect only two weeks ago.  This is a test for us, and it is a test for the Fianna Fáil-Green Government and the Independents who support it on its commitment to children.  I ask the Government not to fail them.  I commend the motion to the House.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#CatherineByrne" eId="spk_406">
          <from>Deputy Catherine Byrne</from>
          <p eId="para_1219">I welcome the announcement, however temporary, that the closure of two more wards and another operating theatre at Crumlin hospital will not go ahead next month.  As we know, one 25-bed ward and one theatre have already been closed, leaving longer waiting times for sick children.  The long-term consequences after the summer months will only bring increased hardship and anxiety to parents throughout the country when the closure of these wards comes into operation.</p>
          <p eId="para_1220">Our Lady's Children's Hospital is a very special place.  It is more than just a hospital for sick children; it is a place where the family and extended members are placed at its very heart.  The hospital prides itself on its relationship with not only the sick child, but also with the families and extended family members, making it unique in modern day health service.  There is an urgency for the Minister not only to provide a temporary solution to this ongoing situation, but to deal with this continued uncertainty once and for all.</p>
          <p eId="para_1221">As a parent of five children, I have on many occasions made the midnight dash to Crumlin hospital when one of the children had become unexpectedly ill.  At all times, the hospital and staff went beyond the call of duty to ensure that everything was done both medically and emotionally to reassure both parent and child.  In Crumlin, we have a hospital of excellence, a home from home in the heart of a living community where people down the years have given it every support possible through fundraising and particularly through voluntary activities.  I do not understand, nor do the people of the area, what is the rationale for this decision to move what is a much-loved hospital to a location which is plainly one of the most unsuitable sites in the city.  There is no obvious reason to move the hospital to another location when it has such a track record of excellence and is situated on a 12-acre site in Crumlin within easy reach of the Luas, trains, buses and so on.</p>
          <p eId="para_1222">When a parent is confronted with the illness of their child, all other life is put on hold.  The state of the national economy is way down the priority list.  What is important is the medical care, the child-friendly atmosphere and the accessibility of the hospital.  All these have been tried and tested in Crumlin.  Despite the recent cutbacks and reduction of services in the hospital, the staff continue to provide an excellent service and a proper standard of care for children who are seriously ill and also for those who present for just an hour or two.  In the coming months, and in the current climate, the Minister will have the opportunity to reassess the decision to relocate Crumlin hospital to the Mater hospital site.  There is a now a real urgency to take decisive action and to channel funding into Crumlin hospital, which is ready, willing and able to meet the current and future needs of all sick children throughout the country.</p>
          <p eId="para_1223">For many years, I have been very much a part of a choir in my community.  I have sung at the regular mass and one of the songs we continue to sing at the children's mass is "Suffer little children".  I believe the words of this song relate to Crumlin hospital today.  Children do not have to suffer when all the facilities and, in particular, the staff are in place.  We have a real opportunity to change many of these lives and to give children who are seriously ill the opportunity to laugh and play again with their friends and again become part of their family home and community.</p>
          <p eId="para_1224">I welcome this motion put down by Deputy James Reilly and thank him for allowing me some of his time to speak on the matter.  This hospital is very much a part of me as I have grown up in the area and lived there all my life, and have on many occasions, voluntary and otherwise, been within its grounds.  I urge the Minister to reconsider immediately the decisions that have been made and, first, to keep the wards open continuously and, most of all, to reconsider the location of Crumlin hospital.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#SeymourCrawford" eId="spk_407">
          <from>Deputy Seymour Crawford</from>
          <p eId="para_1225">I thank my colleague, Deputy James Reilly, for raising this issue.  In no small way, he, with others, had a role to play in making sure that at least some of the worst cutbacks planned for Crumlin hospital have been eased.</p>
          <p eId="para_1226">The Minister has a major role to play in this regard.  On behalf of the Government, she can decide whether the ward is re-opened and the funds are made available.  I appreciate more than most that we are in difficult times, but we were in difficult times before.  While I do not remember it, I was often told of the time my oldest brother was born prematurely and rushed to Monaghan General Hospital where his life was saved.  My late mother would always write to any family that had a bereavement because she realised how precious it was to save a child.</p>
          <p eId="para_1227">Monaghan General Hospital is another issue which I will not go into here.  However, the Minister will have to bear the responsibility in that regard also.</p>
          <p eId="para_1228">I think of the Clerkin family in my parish who, although they lost their child as a result of serious illness, thought so much of the work that was done for the family in Crumlin hospital that they organised a major fundraiser.  I think also of the Quigley-McPhillips family who, thankfully, still have their child.  They raised €106,000 in one night jointly for the hospital and the Jack and Jill Children's Foundation, which does a great job in its own right.  These are two examples of where the people of a small community in the parish of Aghabog and Killeevan came together and committed themselves to provide funds to help this hospital because they saw the great job that was being done and the great need for it.</p>
          <p eId="para_1229">I can personally recall the case of a 13-year old girl who had a serious illness, although it was a major task to find out what the illness was.  Crumlin hospital did not give up, however, and was eventually able to transfer that child to London where she had her transplant.  Subsequently, she has moved on in life and she now has her own children, although she had been at death's door.  I understand also that a young couple were glad their baby girl had her operation yesterday at the hospital.</p>
          <p eId="para_1230">These are some of the real issues for families, yet the Minister has tried to claim, as she did on television recently, that these cutbacks will not affect anybody.  I am not totally dependent on Deputy James Reilly or the Minister's colleagues who visited the hospital with him today.  Like every other Member of the House, I have received an e-mail from a family that has recent experience of being in that hospital.  They made the point that many of the beds in the cardiac wards in St. Brigid's ward are being used for orthopaedic patients since St. Joseph's ward closed last month.  This means there is reduced cardiac surgery and children's vital heart operations are being postponed.  It is only a matter of time before a family pays the ultimate price for these cutbacks.  I do not state as much flippantly, this is what the parents of a child patient told me.  They further stated that during their visit there were signs over the ECG, electrocardiogram, room stating, "No staff, limited services".  They were informed only three staff were working in an area in which there should be three times that number to cover all the clinics.  While they were being admitted to the day ward a young girl with a newborn baby was informed the cardiac procedure for which she presented had been cancelled at the last minute.  She had to go home with her tiny baby and wait until the hospital could fit her in another time.  How can the Government maintain these cuts will not affect children?  How can it continue to hit the most vulnerable sector in society?  These are not the words of a politician.  This is the case of a real family which saw what is taking place at first hand in the hospital in Crumlin.</p>
          <p eId="para_1231">Professor Drumm has stated on the record that there are management or senior staff in the HSE and he does not really know what they do.  I suggest, with all due respect, that there are other areas within the HSE and Government which should be examined before the treatment of children is compromised.  I make no apology for using that word.  Children are the dearest thing on the earth to the parents who brought them into the world.  They only seek fair play and a service.</p>
          <p eId="para_1232">We could spend all night discussing the idea of moving this hospital to the Mater Hospital, which would beg the political question for the move.  Anyone who has visited the Mater Hospital as often as I have is aware that in the present circumstances there is no parking or anything else available much of the time.  However, savings must be made within the Department of Health and Children.  In recent years I have sought taxi services for genuine hardship cases but I have been told none was available.  However, as a result of a Dáil question, I have discovered that in the past two years some €60 million has been paid out in taxi costs.  This is only one relevant example.  Before it is too late, the Minister should either find the necessary money or savings from elsewhere or make a decision on what she should do personally.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#FergusODowdFG" eId="spk_408">
          <from>Deputy Fergus O’Dowd</from>
          <p eId="para_1233">This is a very important debate which goes to the heart of the purpose of our society and health services.  Our services are a measure of how we treat the very young and old in our society, the type of people we are, the type of country we have created and how we manage and run it.  In the case of these very young children any necessary help, support and money should be given to the hospital or hospitals which treat them.  Whatever services are needed and whatever medical specialties are required must be provided.  This is the bottom line for our society.</p>
          <p eId="para_1234">Let us put down a basic benchmark of a human, just republic which we all seek and which cherishes all our children equally.  If we can help young children who have a medical problem or a disability to live a longer, better life then that is the measure.</p>
          <p eId="para_1235">As in the case of other speakers, I wish to address in a constructive way what should happen in our society.  The Minister for Health and Children has failed in her duty of care to provide the moneys for these operations and to consider the necessary processes.</p>
          <p eId="para_1236">As transport spokesman in my party I examined the transport costs associated with health care.  In 2003 the HSE transport costs came to €18 million total.  In 2008, the latest year for which the figures are available, the figure is in excess of €29 million, an increase of some €11 million from the 2003 cost of providing transport in the health services area.  Our argument and that of Deputy James Reilly, the Fine Gael health spokesman, is that it is surely possible to find savings in the area of transport policy to provide the moneys necessary for this hospital.</p>
          <p eId="para_1237">Let us examine the facts.  I have read the relevant details and acute hospitals throughout the world have an effective transport policy and in many cases a green transport policy.  Such policies reduce costs and the carbon footprint but provide essential services to people in an effective way.  In the past two years the HSE spent €60 million on transport policy, compared to a figure of €20 million in 2003.  There has been a significant overrun in this area.  Let us consider the staff taxi costs of last year.  In one area, that is, the mid west the transport spend last year was almost €150,000, in the east coast area some €162,000 was spent on staff taxis, in the south west more than €277,000 was spent, but in the north east only €1,340 was spent.  Clearly some areas have an effective transport policy for their staff and others do not.  The Minister must examine the matter.  Some areas work very well and others are not working as well.</p>
          <p eId="para_1238">Another matter arises in the reduction of costs associated with the transport policy for patients.  Appointments are made in such a way that when a patient is notified of an appointment, public transport options are provided, including how to reach the destination and the associated costs.  This can be done quite easily.  Many people must travel from rural areas to cities and in many cases long distances are involved.  Such people require essential and important treatment and are often very ill.  However, if one provided transport options upon making the appointment along with the costs of same it would provide alternatives.  The cheapest possible option, if public transport is available, would effectively underline the importance of ensuring that moneys available in the health services are used to provide the medical expertise at the point at which it is needed.  Other essential costs can and must be reduced.  Why is it not possible to save €6 million for Crumlin hospital in our transport policy?  It would make a good deal of sense to do so.</p>
          <p eId="para_1239">I understand many people must travel long distances to attend specialist care.  If someone has cancer he or she must go to the appropriate regional centre.  If a person suffers from serious kidney disease he or she must go for dialysis elsewhere.  I understand in other countries a volunteer programme is in place.  A similar programme might operate here which in the case of cancer care could be operated through the hospice movement.  A volunteer programme for kidney dialysis treatment could be operated by survivors or people who have had such illnesses.  They might offer or be available to drive patients to the treatment centres.  If such a voluntary network were built up and supported in association with the hospice movement and strategies were put in place it would make a significant difference to the cost and the quality of concern expressed by the community on behalf of sick people.  The community could lend its support and empathise with sick people during an illness.  The Minister must think again about the way in which she manages the budget.  She must re-examine how to reduce some costs and make it more practical and realistic to get patients to the point of treatment.  The bottom line is it is possible to make such savings if they are sought, but the Minister has not done so up to now.</p>

        <speech by="#TomHayes" eId="spk_409">
          <from>Deputy Tom Hayes</from>
          <p eId="para_1240">I thank the Ceann Comhairle for the opportunity to speak about the issue of Our Lady's Hospital in Crumlin and I compliment Deputy James Reilly on moving the motion and allowing a real opportunity to discuss and debate a matter on the minds of many people in the weeks since the matter first arose.  The number of e-mails we received and the concern expressed by many people surprised me.  According to the hospital, the cutbacks announced and still in place will result in longer waiting times for assessment and non-emergency surgery.  This issue came up on the doors in recent weeks when I canvassed all across Tipperary South.  People know that we are in a terrible time financially.  They can feel it in their pockets and in the job losses they see around them or which they may even be experiencing themselves.</p>
          <p eId="para_1241">However, people on the doorsteps in Tipperary South were sure about one thing — there is a bottom line in politics.  That bottom line means that children should get the health care they need.  Children are waiting in pain for vital surgery or wait years for assessment while their health and sometimes their education are cruelly put on hold.  People have told Fianna Fáil over and over again where is the bottom line in politics.  They do not want older people to have their medical cards taken from them, they do not want children to be desperately in need of health care and to go without.</p>
          <p eId="para_1242">I represent the people of Tipperary South when I point to the burden that families carry when a child is sick.  Parents will travel, they will juggle school and child care and jobs and other children.  They will do whatever is needed to get that sick child the care he or she needs.  We in Dáil Éireann need to honour that commitment to parents and the struggle which young children with serious illness go through every day.  I ask the Minister, Deputy Harney, to ensure these children receive the essential surgery, assessment and out-patient care they deserve.</p>
          <p eId="para_1243">Ward closures and surgery cancellations are not good enough.  Patients in Tipperary South are very grateful for the excellent paediatric services provided in the county hospital in Clonmel.  However, they need the back-up available in Crumlin.  These cutbacks in Crumlin will affect children all over the country as the most seriously ill children will not have the services in Crumlin and will be more dependent on their local service.  This will only create more pressure on those services and fewer patients will be cared for.</p>
          <p eId="para_1244">Every parent in this country fears their child being seriously ill above all else.  Every other disaster can be handled, but a seriously sick child is devastating and this has been the case for many parents.  Parents in Ireland believe this Government has lost all touch with them.  It has created longer waiting lists, cuts in surgery numbers and longer times for assessment.  To make matters worse, this Government has done nothing to tackle the waste in the HSE.  The waste stems from the number of administrators hired by the HSE and without the permission of the Department of Health and Children.  When I spoke to health care professionals in south Tipperary they pointed to the waste in medical supplies, the numbers of products that are over-ordered and cannot be re-used due to the sell-by dates, but the HSE procurement processes does not allow for these orders to be reduced as required.  This is a significant issue that needs to be addressed by the Government and the HSE.  We need to address the issue of wastage.</p>
          <p eId="para_1245">I have met health professionals who are very concerned about the procurement process and the way it is being handled.  The Government has created a monster.  I am asking it to stop the monster and protect the children of Ireland.  They need the Minister's support on this issue.  Many people all over the country are very concerned.  I urge her to take away that fear and to issue a statement after this debate promising that the children of Ireland will be protected so that any care they need can be guaranteed by the Government.  We all agree that cutbacks and savings must be made but not at the cost of our children.</p>

          <from>Deputy Mary Harney</from>
          <p eId="para_1261">Nothing concerns parents more than the health of their children.  Nothing concerns people worthy of election to this House more than the health of our children.  One of my main priorities as Minister for Health and Children is to try an put in place a new national paediatric hospital in which we could bring together the three children's hospitals in Dublin on a single site in order to deliver better patient care for our children.</p>
          <p eId="para_1262">In this debate I wish to refute some of the suggestions made opposite.  I have made many visits to Our Lady's Hospital Crumlin.  I hold the hospital in the highest esteem.  Crumlin hospital is a centre of excellence, delivering outstanding care to the sick children of Ireland.  It is the tertiary hospital for the vast majority of children with a serious illness.  Its cancer services, which were centralised there by Dr. Eoin Smith, are second to none.  I have said in this House before and I repeat it now that the outcomes for children's cancer in Ireland are top of the class, world-wide.  We are at the top because we have centralised the service, even though, following initial diagnosis and surgery, some of the services are delivered in 16 hospitals around the country.  This service was led by Dr. Eoin Smith of Crumlin hospital.  What we have learned from the treatment of children's cancer is what we are trying to achieve for adult cancers, with the concentration of the services into eight centres.</p>
          <p eId="para_1263">I refer to the international peer review of haemophilia services last October.  The review group said that Crumlin hospital operated to best international practice.  The group recommended the appointment of a new paediatrician-haematologist and Dr. Beatrice Nolan was appointed in March of this year.  She came from the national tertiary centre at St. James's Hospital which is an international service.</p>
          <p eId="para_1264">The standard of care provided in Crumlin, in Tallaght and in Temple Street hospitals is exemplary by any standards but we could do better.  I have said and I repeat here that it has been suggested to me that we could save €20 million a year on the operation of those three hospitals by bringing them together on a single site.  In reply to Deputy Catherine Byrne, the people who were the biggest persuaders in my decision to move to a single children's hospital were some of the doctors in Crumlin.  They were strongly enthusiastic for the establishment of a new children's hospital bringing the three existing hospitals together to be co-located with an adult teaching hospital.  Two sites were under consideration, at St. James's Hospital and at the Mater Hospital and the Mater was chosen as the favoured site.  It was only at that point that some of the paediatricians did not agree with the decision.  However, there was unanimous agreement and the submission made by the hospital was for a single children's hospital.  The alternative is to build two new hospitals, one for Crumlin and one for Temple Street.</p>
          <p eId="para_1265">Crumlin hospital has 170 doctors and 708 nurses.  It admits 30 patients a day and 45 day cases a day are carried out.  A total of 102 out-patient appointments are seen every day.  Temple Street hospital has 110 doctors and 365 nurses with 20 admissions a day, 14 day cases a day and 70 out-patients appointments a day.  I do not have the information for Tallaght Hospital to hand.  We want to bring these resources together in order to give better services to the patients.</p>
          <p eId="para_1266">Better services for patients will be achieved by having one payroll department, one human resources department, one waste management department, one department dealing with materials, a central sterile department instead of four, which was one each for the three children's hospitals and one for the Mater.  This is where the €20 million saving will be made.  There will be one chief executive officer, one director of nursing and so on.  In the short term we are seeking to integrate those services. It has now been agreed to have a single department of surgery.  Deputy Reilly is correct in that we have five paediatric surgeons between those hospitals.  One surgeon is due to retire and three new surgeons will be appointed this year.  There will be seven surgeons and instead of them all being on call in three hospitals, a single service will be available across the three hospitals.</p>
          <p eId="para_1267">Dr. Des Bohan has come here from Canada. He is a very experienced paediatrician with specialist training in critical care and he will organise a joint department of critical care between Temple Street and Crumlin.  Tallaght does not have a critical care department.  He has made recommendations which we want to implement.  In advance of building the new facility in 2014, we are moving to integrate the services.  If Crumlin were to work more closely this year with St. James's Hospital in the area of blood products and in the procurement of drugs with the other two hospitals, they could save €4 million.</p>
          <p eId="para_1268">Furthermore, I understand they are owed €3 million by private insurers.  Temple Street Hospital seems to have a better record on making applications to private health insurers.  That amounts to €7 million which we could get this year by closer integration on the procurement of products, particularly blood products for haemophiliacs in St. James's Hospital, which is already approximately €900,000 over budget.  I make these suggestions to be helpful. No matter who is in my seat, we will not have unlimited resources for health care.  No country in the world has such unlimited resources.  We must do our best.</p>
          <p eId="para_1269">There has been a 39% increase in funding for Our Lady's Children's Hospital in Crumlin since 2004.  That is considerable.  Approximately 74% of the increase goes on pay and 26% on non-pay.  Listening to Opposition speakers, one would assume there was no additional staff in Crumlin.  Since 2004, there has been an 18% increase in medical staff, a 29% increase in nursing staff, a 19.7% increase in health and social care staff, a 19% increase in management and administration staff and an 11% increase in general support staff.  We have put substantial resources into Crumlin hospital, as we have in every other hospital.</p>
          <p eId="para_1270">Crumlin is being asked for a 3% cut, which is no more than every other hospital.  Fine Gael published its pre-budget plan in October.  On page 19 of that document, they said we must find 3% saving in every Government Department and every single activity.  On page 21, they go on to say that existing levels of service should not be the basis for deciding budgets.  This is the case in the health system because we want to try to maintain the previous year's level of service.  Fine Gael says we should have a 2% cut and that existing levels of service should not be the basis for deciding budgets.  I do not make this point to be partisan.  I am surprised to hear such proposals from a spokesman who aspires to be a member of a Government, particularly as Minister for Health and Children, in a time of unprecedented economic challenges.  We will spend 40% of the money we will raise this year in income tax on the public health service.  I do not know of any other country which spends 40% of all taxation on its public health system.  We are spending a considerable amount of the money.  In fact, we are borrowing more than €20 billion.  Every single penny we are spending is actually borrowed money.  We do not have the option of bringing a supplementary budget for hospitals before the House.</p>
          <p eId="para_1271">People are being asked to make an efficiency saving.  All of us can do better, no matter how good we are.  My Department is also making savings through voluntary early retirement and other schemes.  We must all do better because there is less money.  No matter who is Minister for Health and Children, that will be the reality for the next 24 or 36 months.  In that context, it is not unreasonable to ask people to make efficiency savings.  I find it strange that when we ask hospitals to make efficiency savings, some hospitals decide that the most sensitive area is the one that must be cut first.</p>
          <p eId="para_1272">Decisions on patient care and clinical care must be made by clinicians.  They cannot be made by me or by the Health Service Executive.  The HSE has given Crumlin hospital a budget of €139 million.  I have already explained how there is €3 million outstanding from private health insurers and how €4 could be saved by greater co-operation with St. James's and other hospitals.  Funding must be allocated on the basis of decisions made by clinicians within the hospital.</p>
          <p eId="para_1273">The Fine Gael alternative suggestions are flawed for a number of reasons.  Deputy Reilly referred again to the €16 million spent on advisers.  When one is spending such large sums it is not unreasonable to get outside expertise.  Even if we are spending too much on advisers, Deputy Reilly seems to use this €16 million for every problem that arises.  Two weeks ago, it was to be spent on orthodontics, tonight it is to be spent on children's services, next week it will be something else.  One cannot spend the same €16 million on every problem one identifies.  Taxi bills are for patients who travel for dialysis and other treatments.  Staff taxis are used, in the main, by people who are called out at night and who may not have their own transport.  They are used, in the main, by people who are providing front line services and not by administrative staff.  If the HSE were to abandon its arrangements with private taxi companies, keep its own fleet providing 24/7 cover and pay for insurance, driver training and vehicle replacement it would be substantially more expensive.  That is not to say we should not look at transport costs.  Everything is being looked at.</p>
          <p eId="para_1274">I was criticised recently for centralising the issuing of medical cards in order to free up 300 people.  The Opposition demand that we cut the number of administrators but oppose our efforts to provide services more efficiently.  They cannot have it every way.  Every cost is being examined.  Since Professor Tom Keane became director of the national cancer strategy we have provided a volunteer transport service for cancer patients, run by the Irish Cancer Society.  An allocation of €500,000 has been given to that service and it is working incredibly well.  I would love to see it expanded because I am sure many people would be happy to give their time voluntarily to transport patients for essential care.</p>
          <p eId="para_1275">How do we organise services so that more money is spent on the care of the children?  In the short term, this can be done by integration between the three hospitals.  The HSE is headed by a paediatrician who is a former doctor in Crumlin, Professor Brendan Drumm.  He has asked the former CEO of St. James's Hospital to head a group to work with the three hospitals and, in particular, to work with Crumlin to come up with a plan for scoliosis patients for the rest of this year.  If everyone applies his or her mind, ingenuity and sense of innovation, that issue can be addressed.</p>
          <p eId="para_1276">Yesterday, the board of Crumlin hospital decided not to close any further wards or theatres during the months of July and August.  The board made the decision at a regular meeting. I had no part in the decision and I would be surprised if they were influenced by Deputy Reilly's motion.  I welcome that decision and the fact that the board was able to make it in the context of the current financial arrangements.</p>
          <p eId="para_1277">The way forward is the single children's hospital but we will not have that until 2014.  A huge amount of work has gone into that project.  The chief executive of the development board has been appointed.  He is the former deputy chief executive of St. James's Hospital.  The medical director is Dr. Emma Curtis from Tallaght.  A huge amount of work is under way.  Some people would prefer a different site for the new hospital.  However, this is not about a piece of land or a building.  It is about bringing expertise together in a single entity with all the benefits which flow from that.</p>
          <p eId="para_1278">The last thing we need is to politicise the plight of some of the sickest people in the country.  I hope we can avoid that.  Managers, Ministers, Opposition Deputies, doctors and nurses must look at how we can provide services in a more innovative fashion.  I salute the fact that this year's activity level for Crumlin is already ahead of last year's.  There are more day cases and we are moving to a situation where 85% of surgery is done on a day case basis.  When I had my tonsils out as a child, I was in Jervis Street Hospital for a week.  We have come a long way from that.  Safe care can be provided on a day case basis, greatly reducing the need for 24-7 staffing.  The more rapidly we can move in that direction, the more resources that can be provided to a larger number of people.</p>
          <p eId="para_1279">The budget for the National Treatment Purchase Fund is 0.5% of what we spend, and those who work on it do a fantastic job.  They are maligned constantly.  The fund has paid for the treatment of some scoliosis patients and two more will be treated next month in Cappagh National Orthopaedic Hospital.  The fund does not pay three times more for the service there.  Cappagh National Orthopaedic Hospital is a public hospital; it is as public as Crumlin hospital.  The State does not own Crumlin hospital, it funds it.  The State does not own Temple Street Childrens University Hospital or the National Children's Hospital, Tallaght.  There is a unique situation in the Dublin area whereby the State owns none of the hospitals but funds them.  The new children's hospital will be a State-owned hospital, and rightly so.  There is huge support for that.  Clearly, there are limitations with regard to hospitals the State does not own.</p>
          <p eId="para_1280">Professor Drumm has appointed one of his main finance personnel to go into Crumlin hospital to work with the staff there and to examine the activities with a view to supporting the hospital.  If the hospital moves to an automated system for claiming from private health insurance, for example, it might help to secure that €3 million I mentioned.  We must look at the many innovative ways to provide the money for the treatments and less money for administration and so forth.  If all of us approach the issue of paediatric services on that basis, there is no doubt that no child would have to wait unduly for the treatment he or she needs and no child should ever be in pain while awaiting necessary treatment.</p>

          <from>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Deputy John Moloney)</from>
          <p eId="para_1281">Last week I responded to the Private Members' motion and listened with great interest to Deputy Mary White and Deputy Simon Coveney.  On that evening I refuted the allegation that critically ill children have had their service withdrawn.  I reiterate that this evening.</p>
          <p eId="para_1282">I support the Minister and her commitment to reforming the health services.  We see that again in this particular area.  I have in mind what has taken place previously, particularly the initiative she took to reform cancer services.  The same arguments were made by Members on the other side of the House, yet we have seen the progress that has been made.  I am more than pleased with it.  Other developments were the consultants' contract and progress with accident and emergency services.  However, that is not the argument before the House.</p>
          <p eId="para_1283">I do not intend to be drawn into the remarks thrown across the floor that we are more interested in bankers because, clearly, people who are knowledgeable would not say that in the first place.  I do not accept it.  The strategic view the Minister has taken is the one on which we should focus.  I also share her view about throwing out the same old remark about the money for every area coming from the same small pot of money.  I cannot buy into that.  It is nonsensical to include the issue of taxi fares when it is clear that most of the taxi expenditure goes to provide transport for essential services in the HSE.  It is not worth responding to in the context of this debate.</p>
          <p eId="para_1284">The real issue is the Minister's strategic policy.  While Crumlin hospital is central to the debate before the House, the most important issue is the sensible initiative taken to establish one hospital, instead of three, to serve paediatric needs across the city.  With regard to the saving of €6.5 million, it must be put on record, because obviously it is a position that is not being taken up, that the issue is to protect front-line services, which is so important.  It is also important to delve into the background to this debate and take the longer-term point of view.  We are talking about initiatives for the appointment of new clinical directors.  This is quite important and should make the public realise that the Minister has total command of the issue of providing essential services.</p>
          <p eId="para_1285">The issue we are debating is the €6.5 million.  The HSE has advised that based on the financial performance for the first five months of 2009, the hospital should achieve a break even position at the end of the year.  This assessment takes account of cost saving measures totalling €6.5 million, which have been agreed with the hospital and which are to be implemented over the remainder of the year.  Much of the focus of the discussion between the hospital management and the HSE has been on ensuring that all areas of non-pay expenditure are critically examined and that costs are reduced where possible.  The allocation for Crumlin hospital for 2009 is €139 million, an increase of more than 39% over the past five years.  As with all expending facilities, the reduction that is expected is 3% over the 2008 figure.  A particular challenge for the hospital is that it has been operating with 91 posts above its ceiling and employs 641 whole-time equivalents.</p>
          <p eId="para_1286">The point was made during the last Private Members' debate that apparently the issue was purely to deal with life threatening illnesses.  It should be pointed out that when the orthopaedic services in Cork were severely disrupted in 2007 by the early retirement of the consultant paediatric surgeon, efforts were made to recruit a replacement without success.  At that time arrangements were put in place for Crumlin hospital consultants to provide the outpatient clinic service in Cork, with patients requiring surgery transferring to Crumlin.  It should be noted that the HSE pays €0.5 million per annum for the service.  It also pays the consultants separately.  The HSE intends to advertise again for a paediatric consultant with a special interest in orthopaedics.</p>
          <p eId="para_1287">I heard the criticism last week of the National Treatment Purchase Fund.  The fund has identified a number of cases from the waiting lists for treatment at Cappagh hospital.  Two operations have been carried out for scoliosis patients as a result.  Further cases are being reviewed.  Discussions are ongoing with the three paediatric hospitals with regard to the provision of orthopaedic services generally and, in particular, the treatment of children suffering from scoliosis.  The National Treatment Purchase Fund strongly rejects the recent media claim, which I was alarmed to hear on the radio one morning, that scoliosis procedures arranged by the fund cost two to three times more than similar procedures performed in the public hospital system.  The claim is entirely incorrect.  No evidence has been offered to support the claim which comes, of course, from unnamed sources.  The prices the National Treatment Purchase Fund pays for operations are as competitive as the published prices for the public hospital system and no premium is paid for work through the fund.  Achieving value for money for the taxpayer throughout the process of arranging faster treatment for the longest waiting public patients is a matter of the highest importance for the fund.</p>
          <p eId="para_1288">The commitment of the Minister is not just the short-term one of reducing and dealing with the overspend.  Hospital care for children is provided across the three hospital sites in the city.  Significant progress has been made over the years in developing paediatric services in Crumlin.  There has been development of the national paediatric hospital, a priority project for the Government.  It is of strategic importance in the development of paediatric services in Dublin and nationally.  Work has been ongoing to move towards that model of care in terms of closer integration and co-operation of the existing three hospitals and the most effective use of resources.</p>
          <p eId="para_1289">It was claimed this evening that the cut was made without any concern.  However, the Minister outlined the overall strategic position for providing paediatric services and made the point that the reduction is expected not just of Crumlin hospital but of all hospitals so they can remain within their service plans.  I do not wish to make political points and I accept that dealing with health issues in children is important.  However, when one considers that 40% of taxes go to the health service it does not make sense to suggest that we can just allow continuous overspends without a service plan being agreed as well.  The HSE is fully aware of the financial challenges faced by the hospitals and is involved in ongoing discussions with hospital management regarding its 2009 financial allocation service plan.  The priority is to ensure that services are maintained at an optimum level, in agreement with the Department and the HSE.</p>
          <p eId="para_1290">Our Lady's Hospital Crumlin is no different from any of our hospitals.  In common with all other hospitals, Crumlin is faced with the challenge of delivering a high-quality service to its patients while remaining within budget.  A top priority will be to protect patient care.  It has proved necessary for Our Lady's Hospital to stay within budget.  In that regard I agree with the Minister who made the point that Professor Drumm, who has known expertise in the area, clearly supports the notion that all hospitals should live within their service plan.</p>
          <p eId="para_1291">Having clinical directors is a tremendous initiative.  Regarding the integration of the three hospitals, this key initiative is the same as the appointment of Professor Tom Keane in the cancer area and is the specific way forward.  The appointment of a new clinical director to operate across the three hospitals is pivotal to the success of the integration of current paediatric services.  The appointment of a director in the near future who will have responsibility for all three paediatric hospitals in Dublin in preparation for the advent of the new paediatric hospital shows the surety of the policy proposal.  I re-emphasise that this post promises to contribute significantly to the achievement of more efficient and effective services, in Crumlin and the other two hospitals.  It will draw the medical professionals together with greater co-operation and integration in respect of the critical service they provide.</p>
          <p eId="para_1292">The new consultant contract also allows the model of clinical director to operate in a way that is internationally recognised as effective.  This was not possible in the old manner, before the new contract was negotiated and went into operation.  The new model allows equitable access to care based on medical need, more efficient use of public resources and a requirement to support patient safety initiatives in high-quality acute sector services.</p>
          <p eId="para_1293">I shall deal with some of the issues regarding the service provided at Crumlin.  So far this year, the hospital has delivered more treatments to patients than in the same period last year.  In the first four months of 2009, there were 3,704 treatments for children as in-patients, running approximately 6% ahead of the service plan target.  There were 5,095 day places.  Staffing levels at the hospital have increased by 24% since 2004.  This percentage reflects the increase to the approved ceiling of 1,550 but the actual increase is higher, at 31%.  Day care activity has increased by 26% since 2005, outpatient attendance by 16% and elective admissions by 12%.</p>
          <p eId="para_1294">The issue of cancellation of operations has cropped up, creating the notion the hospital is not keeping to its service plan.  It is important to establish some of the reasons——</p>

To bring clarity to the issue of cancellation of operations, which I heard discussed on a radio programme last week, I point out that operations are cancelled for a variety of reasons.  The patient may be deemed unfit to proceed, the procedure may be cancelled by the patient or the guardian, or there may be normal rescheduling due to appointment times not being suitable.</p>

I wish to challenge the Minister, Deputy Harney, and the Minister of State, Deputy Moloney, on some of the points they just made.  The Minister constantly insists that, somehow or another, the Opposition is being political and she is not.  That is far from the truth.  The Minister stated that bringing three hospitals together will make savings and provide a solution to the problem and we are being political by focusing on the problem here and now.</p>
          <p eId="para_1303">When the HSE was being set up almost five years ago,  the Minister used exactly the same arguments.  She said that by bringing 11 health boards and a number of other organisations together there would be economies of scale.  I went to the launch of a book today, "Irish Apartheid: Healthcare Inequality in Ireland" by Sara Burke.  It debunks this absolutely.  There is no point in the Minister smiling at me.  She has an immense facility to debate, to retain facts and figures in her head and to stand up and repeat them but she tries to deny the right of the Opposition to make political arguments.</p>

It is all very well to talk about what will or may happen if three paediatric hospitals in Dublin are brought together with economies of scale.  However, I understand there has not even been a cost-benefit analysis on the bringing together of those hospitals.  The work has not been done.  Nothing has been done at this juncture apart from the planning of the tertiary hospital.</p>

          <p eId="para_1307">They are not together at this point but are operating separately.  The Minister spoke about the clinicians having to make the decision, which is a clinical one.  The clinicians in Crumlin are in an impossible situation.  They have 1,318 children on the waiting list.  The figures quoted by Deputy Reilly are factual, namely, that between 2004 and 2008, despite most of the increase in budget having to go on pay-related issues, the hospital increased patient activity by 30% in day cases, 23% in outpatients and 34% in theatre procedures.  They had to deal with matters such as the fact that the birth rate in Ireland is increasing.  More children are presenting with serious illness and it is not their fault there is no funding stream for sickle cell disease or that much of the money that used to be allocated for treating children outside the country has dried up.  Referrals to Crumlin from around the country are increasing.  The demand on the hospital is growing.</p>

          <p eId="para_1311">——of the children.  There is no point in the Minister telling us what will happen in the future.  She should tell us what will happen to the sick children now, to the children with scoliosis whose spinal curvature is increasing day by day because they are waiting for treatment.  I shall read from an e-mail I received today:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1312">What are these families to do?  Watch their child every day to see if he is turning blue, having difficulty with his feeding, not let him out to play because he cannot keep up with other children as he doesn't have the energy to walk at times, don't mind run.  They live on their nerves, are shattered, stressed and worried.  These are just some of the difficulties that families of heart children have to deal with on a day to day basis.</p>
          <p eId="para_1313">That comes from parents of a child who had four heart operations in Crumlin hospital.  Unfortunately, the child has since passed away but the parents are talking from experience.</p>
          <p eId="para_1314">I was one of those who tabled an Adjournment motion last week in the Dáil.  For part of the motion, two speakers focused on particular children.  The speaker on the Government side focused on a child called Jamie Murphy.  I read in the newspaper today that a private benefactor has had to come along so that child can have her treatment outside this country.  Where is the policy in a situation where a private benefactor must come along in order to pay for the essential treatment of a small child whose condition is constantly deteriorating, day by day?  Discussing planning for the future is all very well.  While I accept we must plan, we must deal with the current situation, namely, that our sick children are incurring greater costs than heretofore.</p>
          <p eId="para_1315">We must cut budgets, but to stand back and enact a 3% cut across all health services would be wrong.  One must consider individual situations, particularly where children's health care is concerned.  I fundamentally disagree with the Minister that the same type of decision-making process can be applied to children's medicine as is applied to other aspects of the health service.  This is a fundamental difference that we are trying to get across to the Minister, one that many of her backbenchers and members of the Fianna Fáil Party understand.  I do not know whether Green Party Members understand it and the Minister no longer has a party, but there are Deputies on all sides of the House who realise one cannot stand back at a distance when it comes to children's health.</p>
          <p eId="para_1316">The Minister must intervene.  Her problems must be overcome.  One such problem was her abdication of responsibility for the majority of the health budget, despite her Department's advice.  When the HSE was being established, she decided that its CEO would be the accounting officer for the sizable health services' budget.  For this reason, she can stand back and say something is a matter for Professor Drumm or individual hospitals and that a percentage cut across the board is fine.</p>

          <p eId="para_1320">This situation requires a political decision.  We are discussing children and costly but life-saving operations.  One specialist, Dr. Patrick Kiely, a consultant surgeon, has stated that putting off operations makes no economic sense.  However, as the HSE is so focused on balancing books, it is making an across-the-board, swingeing cut to the system to every hospital irrespective of the types of caseload that I have mentioned or the additional procedures implemented by hospitals.</p>
          <p eId="para_1321">Had we a system of money following patients, which is advocated by every Opposition party, the hospital would be paid appropriately for its workload.  One cannot claim that sick children are somehow responsible for being ill.  We must respond to their needs.  I welcome today's decision by the board of Crumlin hospital.  I am not sure how it has managed this within its budget, but it has announced that it will not close the extra beds and theatres as planned.  It stated: "Our Lady's Children's Hospital, Crumlin reiterates that this decision has been made in light of the existing pressure on services and the potential impact on children and families of additional closures".  This is the hospital's focus.  Sadly, it is not the focus of the Government or the HSE.  They focus on balancing books.</p>
          <p eId="para_1322">The Minister of State, Deputy Moloney, does not believe we should contrast this situation with what is occurring in terms of the banks.  However, when the banks came back and stated the money given to them was not enough, the response was not to the effect that they would need to make do.  Rather, the Government gave them billions of euro more.  When a children's hospital comes back and states the money is not enough, it is told that it must make do.</p>

          <p eId="para_1338">The concept of €1 billion is beyond the imagination of most of us, yet many multiples of this in taxpayers' money is being poured into the corrupt financial institutions that have helped to bring the economy to its knees.  Public and political pressure, including the tabling of this motion, which we in Sinn Féin fully support, has apparently resulted in some respite from further cuts.  The hospital remains in crisis because of the funding cuts of €9.1 million already imposed in 2009.  As a result of these, children are suffering.  Operations are being cancelled and postponed, parents and children are being put through anguish and agony and children could be more severely disabled as a result of entirely avoidable delays to the essential surgeries that they desperately need.  The lives of some children may even be shortened.</p>
          <p eId="para_1339">In response to parents' distress, the Minister, Deputy Harney, can only resort again to her mantra about the need for the reorganisation of children's hospital services in Dublin.  What is to occur to sick children in the meantime?  One 13 year old girl with scoliosis has been on a waiting list for surgery since last August and has had her appointment for July cancelled.  The older she gets, the worse the curvature of her spine, the more serious and perilous the surgery that she will face and the poorer her chances of living a near-to-normal life.  In a reply to a Dáil question, the Minister claimed that the National Treatment Purchase Fund, NTPF, was seeking to arrange operations in the private system for this patient and others.  When the family inquired, they found this was not the case.</p>

          <p eId="para_1348">I welcome the opportunity to speak on this important debate.  I welcome the Fine Gael motion, which is timely and, I hope, will bring to bear on the Government backbenchers the need to stand up for once in their lives.</p>
          <p eId="para_1349">I am not critical of the staff of Our Lady's Children's Hospital, nor of the families, who deserve our praise for the contribution they have made to try to help children in need.  I also praise the contribution of the hundreds of thousands of people who make donations to Our Lady's Children's Hospital, because without those charitable donations the situation in the hospital would be much worse than is the case at present.</p>
          <p eId="para_1350">One of the areas on which I wish to concentrate is that which the Minister of State, Deputy Moloney, tried to defend, namely, the increased spend on private hospital procedures for children in recent years.  In a five-year period it increased by 8,400%.  I received that information in a reply from the Minister, Deputy Harney.  In 2004 the amount of money spent on the National Treatment Purchase Fund and on outsourcing of other private operations was €54,000.  Last year the spend had increased to €4.615 million.  One can work out the maths.  That is more than €4.5 million that did not go to a public children's hospital.  That is the privatisation of public health care, in particular, children's health care.</p>
          <p eId="para_1351">The result is that Our Lady's Children's Hospital cannot operate properly.  One operating theatre and one ward have already closed and are not due to re-open.  The HSE spin doctors who said today and yesterday that there was a reversal of the decision were talking rubbish.  The announcement that further cuts will not take place is a relief but I deplore the fact that children and their parents who are dependent on outpatient facilities will have to wait for their appointments in the future due to closures for a week here and a week there.  The result will be the cancellation of 7,000 outpatient appointments in the next few months because the HSE cannot appoint relief staff, invest in the hospital or in the health care of our children.</p>
          <p eId="para_1352">Our Lady's Children's Hospital, Crumlin, is operating ahead of its care plan in every respect.  It treats more inpatients, deals with more day cases and caters for more outpatients than was planned when the hospital drew up this year's care plan.  The HSE's reward for the hospital doing its job properly, treating sick children quicker and using the hospital to its full capacity, with in excess of 85% bed occupancy, which is one of the highest in Europe, is that the Government is starving the hospital of funds required to deliver the best possible medical care for our children.</p>
          <p eId="para_1353">The moves by the Minister, Deputy Harney, the HSE's cuts in funding and refusal to fund will result in cancellation of more than 2,000 operations.  That is the figure also supplied by the HSE.  Approximately 2,000 operations are carried out in almost every theatre in the hospital and that will be the effect if one closes one theatre.  That will result in delays, injury and pain for children who are dependent on those operations.  At the end of the day it is children whom we are talking about.  Often they do not understand what is happening to them.  They have no alterative, as they are dependent on their parents and us as legislators to try to address the problems they have.</p>

          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1369">In page 5, after line 40, to insert the following new section:</p>
          <p class="Center" eId="para_1370">"PART 2</p>
          <p class="Center" eId="para_1371">PROHIBITIONS</p>
          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_1372">2.—Nothing in this Act shall permit the extension of any guarantee under this Act or Credit Institutions Financial Support Act 2008 beyond 31 December 2014.".</p>
          <p eId="para_1373">Much of the previous debate on the Bill in the House was concerned with the open-ended nature of what the Minister was seeking to get from the Dáil, without any corresponding analysis presented as to why it was justified.  In this amendment and the next one I seek to in some way delimit the powers the Minister is seeking, in one case by providing a sunset clause, if one likes, or an outer limit beyond which we would not extend, namely, 2014.  That gives, in effect, a five-year period.  The Minister appears to be indicating that he has in mind the issue of bonds for up to five years.  That would ensure that at least the Minister would have to come back and get a fresh mandate in the event that he was going to extend them for a longer period.</p>
          <p eId="para_1374">The purpose of the second amendment, which I will come to later, is to limit the types of liability on which we would enter into a guarantee and to exclude certain types of risk capital, namely tier 1 and tier 2 capital.  Again, that is to corral the general powers the Minister is seeking under the Act.  The amendments are self-explanatory and I will not enter into a prolonged debate on them given the short period of time available.</p>

          <from>Deputy Pat Rabbitte</from>
          <p eId="para_1375">I rise to support the amendments.  I support amendment No. 2 in particular because I cannot take on board the fact that we are giving the Minister authority for ever and a day to do whatever he thinks is required in his perception of the public interest at the time and in respect of whatever type of liability he wants.  It is unconscionable that we should be asked to go that far.  As far as I can see there will not be any moral hazard in Irish banking for between 20 and 30 years, despite what we know about the conduct of some bankers and the certainty that some will revert to type.  The Minister is using the opportunity to take this power to himself without constraint and without any sunset clause.</p>
          <p eId="para_1376">Deputy Bruton's proposition that the legislation ought not to go beyond the calendar year of 2014 is very reasonable.  I do not want to question the Taoiseach's statement today that there are opportunities in the marketplace of which we could not avail if the guarantee were not extended.  There should be a limit and the one proposed is very reasonable and generous.</p>

          <from>Deputy Kieran O’Donnell</from>
          <p eId="para_1377">The key point is that the Minister is asking the Dáil to give him a <i> carte blanche</i> in extending the guarantee.  I believed the guarantee was to ensure banks could deal with the circumstances that arose at the end of September 2008 such that we could have, within a relatively short period, a sustainable banking system.  Deputy Bruton’s amendment refers to 31 December 2014, thus establishing a five-year period.  This is not an inconsequential period but it is reasonable.  Through the legislation, the taxpayer is effectively giving a guarantee of up to €440 billion.  This is an enormous sum and therefore the banks must be aware it is not open ended and that they are receiving something extremely valuable and precious in the eyes of the taxpayer.  The period to 31 December 2014 is reasonable and I would like to hear the Minister’s comment on it. </p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#SeanArdagh" eId="spk_467">
          <from>Deputy Seán Ardagh</from>
          <p eId="para_1378">Circumstances are such that, potentially, the sums of money in question are huge.  I can understand the concern of Deputy Bruton in tabling his amendment.  Having said that, I believe the reason behind the extension of the guarantee, for five-year bonds in particular, is to restore the credit system in the banking world.  This will allow banks, in time, to give loans to first-time buyers for houses and to small businesses to get the blood flowing.  Unless the banks have the finances to do so and are not spancelled in raising capital, there will be a significant problem.</p>
          <p eId="para_1379">The Minister for Finance has shown since last September that there is a step-by-step plan in place.  There are no knee-jerk reactions and the problem is being worked out in a methodical way.  The Minister goes to Europe and visits various investment bankers and managers in London to put the case for Ireland.  In all cases he is very well received.</p>
          <p eId="para_1380">The Minister or Taoiseach stated no subordinated debt would be included in the extension of the period subject to the guarantee and that the debt in question would be the five-year medium-term debt that is auctioned off on a normal basis in the euro banking system.  To have to come back in December for another extension certainly would cause fear among investors in that they might believe there is something wrong in the Irish system.  They might believe we are now going to allow a guarantee and change our mind in six months.  Therefore, it is important that confidence be inspired among those who are to invest in the banks through the medium-term five-year bonds.  This can be achieved by demonstrating the guarantee will not be lifted in six months.</p>
          <p eId="para_1381">I can understand the Deputies' concerns over the open-ended nature of the guarantee.  However, they should bear in mind the current financial position and the NAMA legislation in September — there is nothing sure about this and we all hope it can be worked out and that the valuations will be fair, agreeable and manageable.  There is nobody more competent and better able to address this issue than the present Minister for Finance.  I ask Deputy Bruton to withdraw his amendment and allow the Minister time to deal with the financial circumstances that obtain.  The Minister has done very well since he entered office and needs to be given the confidence and assistance that the House can give him to ensure the banking system will be restored such that the economy can be stimulated.</p>

          <from>Deputy Arthur Morgan</from>
          <p eId="para_1382">I support the intent of amendments Nos. 1 and 2 in the name of Deputy Bruton.  I appreciate that what he is trying to do is the opposite to what the Minister is trying to do.  At least he is trying to impose some kind of timeframe on the scheme and ensure it will not extend for more than five years from now.  This is useful.  I would like to see a much shorter timeframe and will address this in more detail in respect of my amendments.  Amendment No. 2 attempts to limit the exposure of taxpayers and this is particularly welcome.</p>
          <p eId="para_1383">The guarantee scheme is not working.  The banks are not functioning and the taxpayer is still exposed to risk.  The people who have escaped exposure to all the risks thus far are the bond market people.  The taxpayer will be bailing them out in addition to the banks until September next year.  This is grossly unfair.  We must examine ways to try to reduce the risk to the taxpayer and allow those who took a gamble to carry the risk associated with investments from which they profited for long enough.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#JoanBurtonLAB" eId="spk_469">
          <from>Deputy Joan Burton</from>
          <p eId="para_1384">As this is Committee Stage, perhaps it might be opportune for the Minister to answer some questions on what he has in mind regarding this scheme.  He is talking about taking indefinite powers for renewal but, in practice, we are advised by the officials and others that, in effect, this guarantee is subject to European Union and European Central Bank agreement.  We are advised it follows the Paris model and is, therefore, time limited, potentially for five years.  This is not the case in Irish law but in terms of EU-type schemes.  I would like the Minister to comment on that because the Taoiseach and others have referred to the Paris arrangements at various times.  This would indicate a period up to five years.  I am not sure when the arrangements commenced.</p>
          <p eId="para_1385">A more fundamental question concerns the fact that the measure was to allow Irish banks enter the securities market for a longer term than is possible under our two-year guarantee.  The Minister did not say that when other countries adopted guarantee schemes, many did so because our arrangement, in the eyes of many, effectively forced their hands to do something similar.  I am not sure the Minister would share that analysis.  When the countries set up guarantee arrangements of their own, they did so after the Paris meeting, but their arrangements covered a longer period than ours.  However, they did not include the kind of ultra-risky debt our guarantee included.  We have not had a full analysis of the composition of that debt on a summary basis for the covered institutions nine months after the guarantee.  Institutions going to the market from now on effectively have only a year because we are almost in July and the formal guarantee expires in September 2010.  I do not understand what the Minister envisages happening.  What will Anglo Irish Bank do with this power?  Will it go, as it did before, into the UK market to look for some type of mezzanine finance?  Is that the idea?  Is the Minister encouraging or enabling the bank to do so?  That is the kind of deal with which the bank was involved.</p>
          <p eId="para_1386">In the normal course banks turn over debts.  Maturity dates arrive, the debt is converted and turned over.  The Minister has made a point of saying at various times that this is new debt, implying that it is not rolled over debt.  We are interested in new activity not in the context of the UK market, but of the Irish economy, job retention, job creation and credit flows to business.  I cannot make head nor tail of why the Minister says this because he will not level with us and paint a picture of the kind of activity in which he expects this initiative to result.  Is it simply a case of the banks in effect renewing various kinds of medium-term loan notes?</p>
          <p eId="para_1387">The Minister is putting forward an architecture.  He and his officials obviously have a game plan in their heads, but he will not share it with us.  He has the two year guarantee and the National Asset Management Agency, NAMA, will come on stream.  Does he intend NAMA largely to be set up and to have taken over its portfolio of loans from the different institutions by the end of this year?  He seems to indicate that the NAMA legislation will be here in September.  Much of the work is going on, although there is no legislation for it.  Does the Minister intend that by the time the guarantee expires in September 2010 that NAMA will be up and running and have taken the loans?  If so, a fundamental question arises about what the Minister is doing with this Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_1388">He has set up the depositor guarantee scheme for €100,000, which everybody broadly supported and which will take care of most ordinary depositors in the banks and more.  He could, if he wanted to, set up a similar scheme for retail and small and medium-sized enterprises.  I am sure the House would broadly agree with that too.  There would be no difficulty in doing it.  Why does he want to give this <i>carte blanche</i> of another unlimited period under EU rules, probably up to five years, without specifying exactly what is in it?  Anglo Irish Bank and Irish Nationwide came to grief because their business model went bad.  We know what they are still interested in doing.  If they could get sufficient guarantees, they would like to go back into some kind of financing structure presumably with middle range loan notes.  Is that what the Minister wants them to do?  What does that do for Irish jobs and job retention?  I do not understand what it means.</p>
          <p eId="para_1389">I have seen the notes from JP Morgan and Merrill Lynch and others about the prospects for Irish bank shares.  The level of information the Minister has provided does not allow me to know if the Minister's target is to have a short to medium-term increase in Irish bank share values.  If that is the Minister's strategy, the problem is that he can boost share values and many of the small shareholders will be delighted, but those share values are going up and down at the moment because people are taking bets on them.  However, the increases will not be sustained unless the Minister has a sustainable banking model that involves domestic retail banking, what the Americans call "plain vanilla banking", taking deposits, lending money, short, medium and long, and mortgages to suitable candidates.  There is no evidence that such activity is recommencing in any serious way.  That is our problem with the structure the Minister proposes and what he is not telling us.</p>

          <from>Minister for Finance (Deputy Brian Lenihan)</from>
          <p eId="para_1390">Deputy Burton has ranged far and wide and I will try to deal with her points.</p>
          <p eId="para_1391">Deputy Rabbitte suggested that I am conferring unlimited power on the Minister but the crucial point is that the Minister cannot exercise this power without the approval of both Houses.  They must give a positive resolution and approval of whatever the Minister proposes.  That is fundamental to the operation of this section.  I am not King Henry VIII for the purposes of this section.  I must submit whatever is proposed to the House and I must propose it in the form of a scheme.  That will be a very detailed scheme that will outline and address precisely many of the issues Deputy Burton has raised.</p>
          <p eId="para_1392">To give a practical factual context, without getting into the details, which must be finalised with the authorities and the Commission, this envisages five year debt.  That is one of the Paris principles.  Deputies are aware of the frozen condition of world markets for banks in obtaining such debts.</p>

        <speech by="#BrianLenihan" eId="spk_472" as="#Minister_for_Finance">
          <from>Deputy Brian Lenihan</from>
          <p eId="para_1394">We are talking about five year debt.  The European scheme envisages a six-month window within which the debt can be issued.  That can be renewed if renewal is needed and there is EU approval.  The approval is required not only for the initial scheme, but at the end of each six-month period for extension of the issuance.  The rationale for this is that we want our banks to be in the same position as banks in the rest of Europe to obtain these funds if the markets relax to the extent to which they are readily available.  That is a legitimate object of public policy.  I have flagged our intentions in this regard in the budget.  I indicated it at the different investment conferences that I addressed in Europe where it was well received because the Irish guarantee was seen as being somewhat unusual because it comes to a sudden and dramatic halt on 30 September 2010.  It is important that it is confirmed.</p>
          <p eId="para_1395">In response to Deputy Burton's concern about particular institutions abusing this facility in the future, which is legitimate in the light of our experience, not only do we require EU approval at the end of the six-month period, but it is also subject to ministerial approval in respect of particular issues.  That is the intention of the scheme.  It is not a case of the Minister giving a blank cheque — but let us not mix up our financial instruments — a blank authority, to a particular institution to go out and raise money.  That is not the intention in this extension of the guarantee.  It is not possible to set an end date in legislation if the EU makes a six-month extension available.  The EU's willingness to facilitate such an extension is contingent on world money market conditions.  I am prepared, however, to examine the suggestion in Deputy Bruton's amendment to see whether in the context of the scheme it can be translated into a more definite limitation so that whatever the Oireachtas does approve will in some way have a clear sunset attached.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#RichardBruton" eId="spk_473">
          <from>Deputy Richard Bruton</from>
          <p eId="para_1396">The Minister says he can do nothing without a scheme.  My reading of section 6(4) of the Credit Institutions (Financial Support) Act 2008, however, is that the Minister can proceed to provide financial support in a number of ways, namely, by individual agreement, by a scheme made by the Minister or otherwise.  It states that where the Minister proposes a scheme he must get the approval of the Houses of the Oireachtas.  However, he has the other routes of individual agreement and the unspecified "otherwise" to proceed.</p>
          <p eId="para_1397">While my belief is that the Minister will not extend this by individual agreement, from a strictly legal point of view he is not correct to state that it can be done only by way of a scheme with the approval of the Houses.  This is why we on this side of the House feel that the Minister has not sought to delimit in any way the potential use of financial support after September 2010.  He has not stated that it is confined to this very narrow range of issues.  He is seeking this blanket approval and while on most occasions he would have to return to the House, this is a bad way to legislate.</p>
          <p eId="para_1398">As I stated in my Second Stage speech, to proceed and obtain permission now and then to enter commitments through negotiation with the EU and banks and then to return to us with a scheme would effectively be a <i>fait accompli</i>.  The Minister would tell us that we could not pull the rug out from under him as he had had negotiations with the EU and the banks and that he had been to Basel and Frankfurt and that everyone was in on it and only the lousy Opposition in the Dáil was holding out against him.  I may be facetious in portraying it in this way but essentially it is the process in which we are engaged.  We would have preferred to see a delimitation of what the Minister seeks in the Bill and an understanding as to the nature ofthe scheme for which the Minister would return to seek approval rather than how he is proceeding.</p>
          <p eId="para_1399">I do not pretend for one minute that my amendments are perfectly drafted or would pass the draftsman's test but I am not reassured by the Minister's request to have faith and everything will be okay.  This is the last chance we will get.  The Minister and I know that much water will have passed under the bridge by the time he returns with the scheme.  I am not happy with this process.  I do not want to delay matters because there are many amendments which people will want to discuss but my intent is clear even if the drafting is not perfect.</p>

          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_1407">"3.—Nothing in this Act shall permit the extension of any guarantee under this Act or Credit Institutions Financial Support Act 2008 to any form of Tier 1 or Tier 2 risk capital as defined under the Basel II Capital Adequacy Framework.".</p>
          <p eId="para_1408">This is an attempt to delimit the authority of the Minister to issue guarantees on behalf of the Irish taxpayer.  Under the existing scheme there are certain types of deposit, including unsecured debt and asset covered securities, to which the taxpayer has provided a guarantee.  I seek to exclude what I would regard as risk capital.  Perhaps my drafting has let me down in that I think some tier 2 instruments are covered by the guarantee but many are not.  The intent of this is to narrow it and not allow the Minister to stray into new areas of guarantee such as forms of predominantly risk investment to which the taxpayer has no reason to offer the comfort of a guarantee.  Predominantly these were professional investors who invested in what proved to be disastrous banking practice in the Irish economy, the consequences of which have brought ordinary people to their knees, and there is no way in which we should allow under the cover of this legislation the extension of the guarantee beyond where it is already.</p>
          <p eId="para_1409">In amendment No. 13<i>a</i> I seek to confine the extension to new issues rather than simply allowing everything that was already limited to September 2010 potentially to be rolled on by the Minister.  This would give the Minister a more selective and forensic tool whereby certain new issues could be provided with a guarantee — I would like to hear the conditionality about the issues that would be offered the guarantee — but that generally the €400 billion would not be pushed out to an unspecified date in the indefinite future.  Confining it to new issues would meet the concerns of Deputy Ardagh as it would involve financial instruments that we feel are sensible and strengthen the banking infrastructure and it would not be global.</p>
          <p eId="para_1410">In this group of amendments I seek that it would require a resolution of the House for the Minister to make an order extending the date.  From hearing what the Minister has said already I do not believe that he will be of a mood to support it.  While I am on my feet, I would like to request clarification from the Minister on his belief that he has the powers under section 5, which are confined strictly to the September deadline.  These are the powers that match the responsibilities the taxpayer is taking.  When the guarantee was issued the taxpayer shouldered all of these responsibilities but the Minister stated that he wanted to have powers over the same period to do anything that would be deemed necessary.  According to my reading of the legislation, those powers to do anything that would be deemed necessary will lapse in September 2010 but our guarantee will proceed into an indefinite future about which we do not know and I do not see why the responsibility to shoulder this would not be matched by the power to do whatever we feel necessary to curb abuses by banks or to do whatever the Minister and his advisers deem necessary.  Will the Minister elaborate on how he feels so certain that he has the power to do anything deemed necessary without section 5?</p>

          <p eId="para_1411">I wish to address amendment No. 10 in my name which is included in this group.  We have been over this territory a few times and it would be simple to read the wording of the Bill from line 36 on page 15 to line 23 on page 16 but I do not see any point in doing so.  Having examined it very carefully I cannot see how it does otherwise than confer upon the Minister the authority to extend the scheme by ministerial order without reference to the House but if it does do otherwise, I ask the Minister to point it out to me.  When the time comes I will move my amendment.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#JoanBurtonLAB" eId="spk_480">
          <from>Deputy Joan Burton</from>
          <p eId="para_1412">I refer to amendment No. 12.  The Minister is taking extraordinary powers onto himself to provide for the extension of most of the guarantee.  He has suggested he will exclude the dated subordinated debt, some of which was included in the original guarantee.  This was pointed out at the time by the Labour Party as being completely inappropriate because it was high risk capital, which should not have been the subject of a guarantee.</p>
          <p eId="para_1413">When does the Minister propose to permit the banks to avail of the Bill's provisions?  Will this happen prior to the establishment of NAMA, following the establishment of NAMA or in tandem with its establishment?  Under the NAMA exercise, the taxpayer will take on for between ten and 20 years a level of debt relating to impaired loans, which the Minister suggested will be significant, the IMF has conservatively estimated at €25 billion and others have suggested will be much higher.  Once the agency is in place, the Government will have imposed on this and the next generation of taxpayers significant public debt.  When the banks receive the agency's bonds, they will be entitled to discount them on the market or go to the ECB, and I am sure that is what they intend to do.</p>
          <p eId="para_1414">I do not know what will be the discount applying to the bonds, as it will depend on the market's take on the value of Irish debt at the time which, in turn, will be heavily influenced by the valuation attaching to the assets taking on by NAMA.  One newspaper, in particular, seems to be close to the Minister's Department and over the weekend it suggested the discount would be 16%, which is an unbelievable figure given the example I outlined previously of the two blocks currently for sale in the AIB bank centre and which are under negotiation.  This will involve maintaining a 15-year lease with the bank to use the blocks as offices, which will be a first class tenant at the most desirable address in the city, Dublin 4, but it is estimated the discount that will apply will be at least 45%.  Even at that discount, which is being offered through the media and advertising, there are no takers.  A sovereign wealth fund was interested but it backed out because, apparently, the discounted price was too high.</p>
          <p eId="para_1415">The Minister is not giving us any information that allows us to make a financial assessment of what he is suggesting.  If NAMA becomes another life raft for the banks and, in addition, this scheme is provided as a third layer, the bankers will be laughing all the way to the bank.  We have no indication.  At the end of the day, banking is a business and it is driven by activity.  In the same way a person visits a shop or a garage or an engineering firm where a product is sold, the Minister is not able to tell us what it will do for the taxpayer who is taking on this extraordinary level of debt other than it will be a financial engineering structure.  In years to come we will not have sufficient hospitals, Luas or metro lines.  Like oxygen being sucked out of a house, NAMA will suck significant debt capacity out of Ireland for 15 to 20 years unless there is a miraculous turnaround in the economy and the debt is repaid much faster.  This is real debt, which we will incur as a country and the Minister is saying that having cleansed the banks of the NAMA debts, he will provide this additional open ended-guarantee.  When will it operate?  Will it operate as soon as the Minister introduces the statutory instrument or after the banks have been cleansed of their impaired loans to NAMA?</p>
          <p eId="para_1416">Because of the sovereign guarantee being offered by the Minister, this also will be sovereign debt.  Ireland is paying two or more percentage points above the ECB borrowing rate on all its debt because the Government gave a sovereign guarantee on approximately €440 billion last September.  It is a massive overhang and everybody knows that if this goes wrong, that is the amount we owe, but if everything goes right, we will owe between €25 billion and €60 billion through NAMA.  Ireland is paying a higher premium on its borrowings than Greece while the credit rating agencies have marked us down.  One of the reasons our reputation has not recovered is the perception that Ireland is a murky pit where deals are done among friends and there is no transparency about what the Minister proposes.  He has still produced this measure and I do not know what will be the financial consequence in terms of billions of euro.  He has not even put an upper limit on the amount of debt he will guarantee when it is issued.  At the end of day the debt will be guaranteed and, reputationally, we will be out there for this in the future.</p>
          <p eId="para_1417">The Minister is still not prepared to say when this will happen or what exact form it will take other than it will take approximately five years and he is still not prepared to say anything about the amounts involved.  He is taking on an incredible power to facilitate banks.  This is at the core of the reputational issue in Ireland.  It is similar to bad rezoning.  There is perceived to be a golden circle between political contacts, bankers and developers who move in a political orb while the taxpayer picks up the tab.  Until he has broken the links in the golden chain and has outlined an objective, stand alone measure with the requisite information about Anglo Irish Bank and the other banks, we cannot believe him.</p>
          <p eId="para_1418">I refer again to the dated subordinated debt, other debt and the directors' loans at Anglo Irish Banks.  A number of newspapers reported that the former managing director had large amounts on deposit with the bank at the same time as large debts, which were provisioned against.  I do not know whether the deposits were part of a package or the dated subordinated debt, perhaps as part of a wider package held by insiders.  We do not know the answers to any of this.  However, it appears his deposits are untouchable in the context of his loans because they are without recourse.  This is the type of mess that taxpayers will work hard to clear for the next 20 years and the Minister is not prepared to level with us as to how this will be done.</p>
          <p eId="para_1419">I visited Leitrim village last weekend, which I had not been in for a while.  I counted approximately seven partially completed housing estates with unsold houses and at least two sets of three-storey apartment blocks.  I felt I was in NAMA land.  These are the assets NAMA will pick up, but who will buy these places, even in ten or 20 years?  Driving through towns and villages, one comes across areas like this with an extraordinary level of development.  However, these developments are not occupied.  There may be a sprinkling of places let as holiday homes or to immigrant workers, but apart from that these places are empty.</p>
          <p eId="para_1420">Will the Minister tell us when this scheme will be introduced, for whom it is intended and what amounts are involved?  We propose the powers the Minister has should be deleted, because we believe it is wrong for him to have them.  Given he already proposes to rescue the banks via NAMA, why do they need a further unlimited guarantee for an unlimited sum of money?</p>

          <from>Deputy Michael Noonan</from>
          <p eId="para_1421">I feel increasingly desperate about the lack of information being provided to the House.  As the national Parliament, Members are being asked to make decisions of enormous consequence for everybody in the country, but we are doing it on the basis of having blindfolds over our eyes and not having the kind of information necessary to make decisions.</p>
          <p eId="para_1422">Here again we have a situation where all amendments and discussion end at 10 p.m., approximately 15 minutes from now.  This is a different way of doing business from what we have been used to.  Finance Bills were always teased out over several days in Committee, either in Committee in the House or in a select committee.  However, we are now presented with a series of proposals, without the back-up information which informs Deputies when making decisions.  Is it any wonder then the Minister does not get the co-operation of the Opposition?  He leaves us with no choice but to oppose him on the votes.  On several occasions, I have heard the Taoiseach complain that he cannot get the co-operation of the Opposition.  How can the Government get the Opposition's co-operation when information is not provided to Parliament and we are asked night after night to vote for a pig in a poke?</p>
          <p eId="para_1423">I do not know when the Minister will bring the NAMA legislation before the House.  I presume the Government intention to return in early September is connected to the legislation and that we will probably deal with it in the second or third week of September.  This is just another example of the House being asked to make decisions of the utmost importance, which will affect this and the next generation, without adequate information.</p>
          <p eId="para_1424">I appeal to the Minister at least to publish the Bacon report.  Even if he must exclude sensitive economic or business information, he should publish the rest of the report.</p>

          <from>Deputy Michael Noonan</from>
          <p eId="para_1431">These do not provide the information that is necessary.  For example, Deputy Burton asked the Minister a simple question earlier, namely, the proposed discount for when NAMA takes over the debt.  That is a simple question.  We see figures in the newspapers, but we do not know whether they are correct.  All I know is that bank shares are worth nothing currently if we match the liabilities of the banks against their assets.  They are worth zero, yet the market has taken a view that the two main banks are worth just below €2 and just above €2 per share.</p>
          <p eId="para_1432">The only reason the market would take that view is that it thinks the discount NAMA will give will give that level of value to bank shares.  If one tries to do a calculation on this, the discount seems to be somewhere between 15% and 20%.  That is the view the market is taking, but is that an informed view?  Is that view being formed on the basis of a briefing from the Department of Finance or on the basis of something the Minister has said?  The informed view in the market, considering the value of shares over the past three or four weeks, suggests the discount is not less than 15% and somewhere between that and 20%.  Those are the kinds of calculations being made.</p>
          <p eId="para_1433">The position in this House is that we will shortly be asked to make major decisions, without being given the full information.  I got up to speak to ask the Minister to respect Parliament.  Will he give us time to debate these major issues, which are of such consequence not only to this generation, but to the next?  Will he provide us with the fullest possible information?</p>
          <p eId="para_1434">We all know there is a crisis.  I believe we must deal with the banking crisis before coming to terms with the fiscal crisis and getting the economy going again.  The banks are essential to what the Minister is doing.  However, the Government is doing nothing to earn the respect or co-operation of the Opposition, because our questions have not been answered and the Government continues to take shots in the dark.  To be candid, I am losing confidence in the decision making process of Government.</p>
          <p eId="para_1435">To give one example, the Government took the decision to nationalise Anglo Irish Bank.  At the time, the impression given in the House was that the liabilities of the bank were from €1 billion to €1.5 billion.  A few weeks later, taxpayers were called to put €3.5 billion into Anglo Irish Bank and were told they would probably have to pay another €1.5 billion or €2 billion.  These figures bore no relationship to the information provided in the House when the decision was taken to nationalise the bank.  Where does this leave Parliament?  How can we make decisions when information that is put before the House is so flawed?</p>
          <p eId="para_1436">The procedure for dealing with this Bill tonight is an absolute charade.  The Taoiseach suggested on the Order of Business that we could go on till 11 p.m. to discuss it.  Deputy Gilmore made a very good suggestion that we could spend tomorrow on Committee Stage and Thursday on Report Stage and then complete the Bill.  At least then we and the public would be informed as a result of the debate.  To proceed by guillotine with matters of such magnitude is extremely dangerous.</p>

          <p eId="para_1437">The matter of great magnitude to which Deputy Noonan refers is one section of the Bill and he has addressed his comments to that section.  On the matter of Anglo Irish Bank, what we saw in the spring was a serious shortage of funds in the bank.  Circumstances do not stand still in the case of any particular financial institution.  It is now clear the decision to nationalise the bank, which was an essential decision to take at the time, and the various revelations associated with the bank led to a further deterioration in international confidence in it as an institution.</p>

          <from>Deputy Brian Lenihan</from>
          <p eId="para_1439">The directors appointed by me, as Minister for Finance, went into the bank and conducted a review and presented a true and fair view of the half-yearly return.  We have had to act on that.  We are not here to discuss that, but to discuss the section.  Deputy Noonan said matters of great moment are being decided but the information was not being put before the House.  The information is that no decision has been taken with regard to the extension of the guarantee.</p>
          <p eId="para_1440">It is worth noting the terms of the Paris declaration:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1441">To this aim, Governments would make available for an interim period and on appropriate commercial terms, directly or indirectly, a Government guarantee, insurance, or other similar arrangements of new medium-term (up to 5 years) bank senior debt issuance.  Depending on domestic market conditions in each country, actions could be targeted at some specific and relevant types of debt issuance.</p>
          <p eId="para_1442">Obviously, the debt issuance remains within the senior debt issuance category.  This is what was stated in the Paris declaration last year and that is what we are talking about this evening.  We are talking about a section that empowers the Government to act upon that, in the context where the following European Governments have adopted guarantee schemes: Denmark, Spain, France, Italy, Latvia, Netherlands, Portugal, Slovenia, Finland, Sweden and the United Kingdom.  When Deputy Burton refers to the sovereign exposure of the Irish Government, these are exposures that have been adopted by all of these other governments and sovereign states in the European Union.</p>
          <p eId="para_1443">The total maximum volume of crisis measures so far approved by the Commission's schemes and <i>ad hoc</i> measures, taken together, entail an amount of some €3,000 billion.  The idea that this is somehow unique——</p>

        <speech by="#BrianLenihan" eId="spk_493" as="#Minister_for_Finance">
          <from>Deputy Brian Lenihan</from>
          <p eId="para_1445">I can arrange for that information to be furnished to the Deputy, but the point I am making is that we are not unique.  There is a constant suggestion that there is something unique in what is happening in Ireland regarding the banking crisis.  There is not.  Constant interventions by the Government and Parliament are required to protect the position.</p>
          <p eId="para_1446">The amendments tabled this evening are grouped.  Deputy Bruton seeks to insert a new section 3, to restrict the scope of financial support that may be provided under the Credit Institutions (Financial Support) Act 2008, as amended by this Bill.  It prohibits the extension of financial support that may be provided under the Act to any form of tier 1 or tier 2 risk capital.</p>
          <p eId="para_1447">As the Deputy is aware, regulatory capital comprises tier 1 capital, which is largely equity and reserves, and tier 2, which are longer-term instruments that have the capacity to absorb losses, such as the subordinated debt instruments referred to by Deputy Burton.  Current EU state aid requirements set down strict guidelines for the material scope of guarantees or the types of liabilities covered and any scheme providing financial support under the 2008 Act must receive State aid approval.  That will be worked out in the context of the scheme which will be submitted to the House and upon which it can make a decision.</p>
          <p eId="para_1448">I accept the reasoning behind Deputy Bruton's amendment, which conforms to what would be required under current EU state aid rules, but I would be very wary about specifying in primary legislation restrictions of that type.  As I indicated already, I am open to ensuring that the appropriate definitions are inserted in any scheme under the legislation.  The Deputy's other amendments concern Schedule 2 of the Bill and the changes in the period of financial support.</p>
          <p eId="para_1449">Deputies Morgan and Burton propose, in effect, to delete the proposed changes in the Bill to the 2008 Act and Schedule 2, Part 2  of the Bill amends the bank guarantee legislation to allow for the extension of the financial support scheme, subject to EU approval.  The draft scheme providing financial support beyond the expiry of the current guarantee would be in line with the credit institutions financial support scheme in 2008 and would require positive approval.</p>
          <p eId="para_1450">I have made clear on a number of occasions, including in my budget speech which occasioned very little response, that the Government intended to put in place a guarantee for the future issuance of debt securities, with a maturity of up to five years.  Given that every other country in the EU that adopted a guarantee is doing it, it is hardly remarkable that we should at least allow ourselves that facility and empower ourselves to do it, otherwise our banks are not on a level playing field, as far as our EU partners are concerned.  Access to longer-term funding is in line with the recent mainstream approach in the EU and will support the funding needs of the banks.</p>
          <p eId="para_1451">A new section 6(3)(<i>a</i>) is inserted into the 2008 Act to give us that power, and Deputy Morgan proposes to delete it.  He also proposes to delete from the schedule the new section 6(20).  It is a technical provision granting a very limited decision making power to the Minister to resolve any ambiguities in the administrative terms of the credit scheme within the purposes of section 6.  It is to remove any potential ambiguities arising in the administration of the scheme as to what debts, liabilities and borrowings fall within the determinants of the scheme.  It is necessary because of the diversity of instruments in financial markets.</p>
          <p eId="para_1452">Deputy Bruton also proposes to delete the sentence, "The Minister's determination is conclusive", but the meaning of the phrase in the Bill is that the Minister's determination is conclusive between the parties only.  Clearly, any interpretive issue would have to be left to the courts.</p>
          <p eId="para_1453">Apart from the amendments, Deputy Burton went over a large piece of ground.  The foundation of her speech was a suggestion in a newspaper article that a 16% discount was what was being sought in the NAMA operation.  My Department does not brief newspapers on an unattributed basis.  That is pure speculation by a particular journalist in a particular newspaper.  The reality of the position regarding valuation under NAMA is that Deputy Noonan is correct.  We have fundamental decisions to take.  That is why, on the issue of valuation, we must proceed with extreme care and caution.  I have said this consistently since the budget.  The NTMA has retained HSBC as its adviser on the valuation methodology, which is yet to be finalised.  One point is fundamental regarding the valuation methodology and is insisted upon by the EU authorities, that is, that each valuation must be of an individual asset.  There cannot be a collective valuation of the assets.</p>
          <p eId="para_1454">It is true that when all the assets are valued, a collective figure can be totted up.  However, the valuations have to proceed on an individual basis and that is an EU requirement.  I do not propose, at this stage, to have a discussion which lies on the foundation of a newspaper report about an alleged discount which will be applied because the valuation methodology is still to be determined.  There is no hidden activity taking place in my Department in that regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_1455">I would be more than pleased to arrange for Deputies to be briefed by the NTMA and my Department on these issues.  The NTMA accompanied me recently to a parliamentary committee where there was extensive questioning on these subjects.  It is working very hard to ensure this matter is brought to completion as soon as possible.</p>

If it is forthcoming in the next few weeks we will be in a position to bring the scheme to the House immediately.  If there are further technical issues to be worked out, it will have to wait until later in the year.  It is not related to NAMA.  It is a separate item in the guarantee picture.</p>
          <p eId="para_1461">Regarding the stabilisation of the banks, we are examining a policy that guarantees the banks, capitalises the institutions, ensures that the balance sheets are cleaned up and then ensures appropriate restructuring takes place in the banks.  All these items are related, but as far as this item is concerned, it relates to the guarantee itself.  A defect in our original guarantee means it will lapse on that date in September 2010.  There is no necessary relationship between NAMA and this particular proposal.  This is a proposal to put our banks in the same position as every other bank in the European Union.</p>

            <from>Deputy Thomas Byrne</from>
            <p eId="para_1600">Judicial independence is a critical feature of any democracy.  The independence of the Judiciary is enshrined in Article 35.2 and subsequent articles of Bunreacht na hÉireann.  Article 35.5 provides that a judge's remuneration should not be reduced during his continuance in office.  In light of this when the Oireachtas enacted the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest Bill we specifically excluded judges, military judges and the President from the provisions relating to the pension levy.  At the time there were widespread calls for judges to be included in the pension levy.  I welcomed the announcement at the time by the Chief Justice that a voluntary scheme would be agreed between the Revenue Commissioners and the Judiciary.  However, it was revealed recently that apparently, only 19 of the 148 judges have thus far agreed to voluntarily take part in the scheme.  I presume this number does not include military judges.  Nevertheless it is most disappointing from the point of view of the Oireachtas.  It is also damning to the Judiciary.  Failure to sign up unanimously to the voluntary agreement will affect the independence and respect of the Judiciary a good deal more than any forced pay cut.</p>
            <p eId="para_1601">I fully acknowledge the Judiciary cannot be in hock to anyone and especially not to the House.  It must be completely independent.  However, it must also have due regard, as it does on a daily basis, for the economic circumstances in which we find ourselves.  I acknowledge and welcome the statement by the Chief Justice that he fully expects more judges to join the scheme.  The Chief Justice further stated not much time had elapsed since the scheme details were sent to judges.  It is critical from the point of view of democracy and the Judiciary that judges sign up fully to the scheme.</p>
            <p eId="para_1602">The Constitution does not foresee the introduction of a pension levy, such as that recently introduced, as an attack on judicial independence.  It is similar to an income tax in that it has broad application.  However, I condemn the comments of Deputy Enda Kenny today in which he made a similar argument but stated that the Government made a political decision to exclude judges from the levy.  That was a disgraceful remark reminiscent of his allegations about an Anglo Irish Bank golden circle.  He was against the pension levy at one stage but now it seems he is for it.  If the advice from the Attorney General is absolute, as the Taoiseach today acknowledged, surely there is a case for a constitutional referendum, not to allow judicial pay cuts — I do not believe we should have these — but to allow broad based levies, such as the pension levy to apply to judges if they apply to everyone else in a particular sector.</p>

          <speech by="#JohnCurranFF" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Justice,_Equality_and_Law_Reform" eId="spk_501">
            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Deputy John Curran)</from>
            <p eId="para_1603">The Deputy has raised a matter on the Adjournment that has been the subject of much comment in recent days.  There are two aspects to the matter.  First, the question of amending the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest Act 2009 to make the Judiciary subject to the deduction, commonly known as the public service pension levy, introduced by section 2 of the Act.  Second, the issue of an amendment to Article 35.5 of the Constitution.  On the first question the Government's decision not to make the members of the Judiciary subject to the public service pension levy was made on the advice of the Attorney General.  The advice had regard to Article 35.5 of the Constitution which is entirely clear.  In express terms, it imposes a prohibition on the reduction of a judge's remuneration during the judge's continuance in office.  A judge's remuneration has been interpreted in previous decisions as including pension rights.  The levy is without doubt a reduction in remuneration and the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest Act 2009 makes clear it is not a tax.</p>
            <p eId="para_1604">The salary of every judge at the time of appointment is clearly subject to income tax at rates to be determined from time to time.  The imposition of income tax does not involve a change in the terms of appointment or an alteration in the remuneration to which a judge is entitled because that remuneration is always subject to tax.  The protection in Article 35.5 provides for the financial independence of the Judiciary, a key component of judicial independence.  Judges are not employees of the Government or of Government bodies.  They are also specifically prevented by the Constitution from holding any other paid appointment.</p>
            <p eId="para_1605">The second question posed by the Deputy is whether there should be a Constitutional referendum to amend Article 35.5 to allow the Judiciary to be subject to the pension-related deduction.  Again, this is an idea that has been well ventilated in recent days.  The Deputy acknowledges the importance of maintaining judicial independence.  However, it is difficult to see how a referendum on this issue could take place without the risk of doing some violence to that judicial independence.</p>
            <p eId="para_1606">The independence of the Judiciary is enshrined in the Constitution for very good reason.  Financial independence is integral to this independence.  The Judiciary ensures that the Constitution is respected and the laws are upheld.  To do this effectively, it must be independent of the Executive and of the Legislature.  To interfere with that independence in any way would have extremely adverse and unforeseen results and would undermine an essential protection of the rule of law which in turn is vital to the protection of citizens' rights.</p>
            <p eId="para_1607">The Constitution deliberately does not permit the Executive to reduce judges' remuneration, notwithstanding that, like citizens generally, judges are subject to taxation.  It is with this fundamental principle in mind that the Government has no plans to amend the Constitution to provide that the remuneration of judges could be reduced by way of the pension levy.</p>
            <p eId="para_1608">The Chief Justice has made it clear that he expects strong and continuous participation by judges in the scheme put in place by the Revenue Commissioners.  I welcome the Judiciary's initiative in this regard and I am pleased the Chief Justice has high expectations of that scheme.  This arrangement with the Revenue Commissioners means the judges can pay an equivalent amount monthly, quarterly or on an annual basis.  The Judiciary as a whole is understood not to have been notified of the arrangement until 11 May and any suggestion that judges have refused to make a voluntary contribution is not correct.  The Government has always respected the independence of the Judiciary and the constitutional protections provided in respect of that independence.  It is essential that we continue to do so.</p>

          <heading>Special Educational Needs.</heading>
          <speech by="#OliviaMitchell" eId="spk_502">
            <from>Deputy Olivia Mitchell</from>
            <p eId="para_1609">I stated previously in the House that I welcome the principle of introducing a preschool year for children.  All the research indicates that children do better when they have had that opportunity.  It is particularly valuable for disadvantaged children.  Disadvantage comes in many forms.  It may be financial or social disadvantage or due to poor quality parenting.  All these children would benefit from such a scheme.</p>
            <p eId="para_1610">I want to speak tonight about a group of children who will not benefit and these are children with special needs.  In some cases such children have significant obstacles to overcome if they are to benefit from later educational opportunities.  The contribution a year in preschool can make for these children is of great value in helping them to cope with either mainstream school or a special needs school, if this is what is appropriate.  Under the new scheme this is the one group which will not benefit.  They will be excluded from the preschool year and may be excluded from playschool opportunities altogether for that particular year.</p>
            <p eId="para_1611">As the scheme is currently devised, from September 2010 it will only pay the preschool providers for a 15-hour week.  For many special needs children, 15 hours is not a possibility as it is too long a time for them.  Even if it is not too long, they will need a special needs assistant in order to attend playschool.  The current practice is for them to attend for whatever period of time the special needs assistant is available to them.  The special needs assistants' hours are being reduced.  I am not aware of any case where a child had an assistant for 15 hours.  The reality is they have no opportunity to attend because the State will only pay for them if they attend for 15 hours.</p>
            <p eId="para_1612">They cannot attend without assistance so the most disadvantaged children will be the only children who will not be able to benefit from the scheme.  The scheme is not just inequitable, but it is daft and very short-sighted in that it will only build up problems and more expense for the future and great frustration for both the children and their parents.</p>
            <p eId="para_1613">From the perspective of the playschool providers, it will not be possible for them to allocate their limited school places to children who will only turn up for three or four hours a week and where the State will only pay for those who attend for 15 hours a week.  The private playschool sector is facing significant upheavals in its business, moving virtually overnight from a situation where they were independent businesses tailoring their hours and times to the needs of their customers to becoming customers themselves of a one-size-fits-all State monopoly.</p>
            <p eId="para_1614">I do not know what forethought went into devising this scheme because it is fraught with issues which have been raised before.  If all the children who are eligible for this scheme — numbering between 70,000 and 80,000 — turned up looking for a place in January, only a fraction of places will be available.  I do not know how Dublin playschools will survive because the fee being offered is way below anything being charged in the Dublin area.</p>
            <p eId="para_1615">A scheme that effectively excludes children with special needs cannot be introduced.  The irony is that the very Department which recognises the need for special needs assistants for disabled children attending school is the very Department which recognises the need for a preschool facility, yet this Department has devised a scheme which excludes the group that need it most and who would benefit most.</p>
            <p eId="para_1616">The Minister of State knows the additional burden and stress and worry that a special needs child places on a young, struggling family.  Many families are discovering now that their child will not benefit from this scheme.  In the coming months more families will discover that the scheme does not seem to accommodate their children.</p>
            <p eId="para_1617">I have to believe that this anomaly was not intentional and that the Minister will amend the scheme to ensure that disabled children can avail of it.  I have to believe the Minister will amend it in a way that does not require either the preschool providers or the children's families to take the hit because many families are wondering whether they will have to pay.  They wonder if their children will be allowed into the playschools because the limited number of places will inevitably be given to those who will attend for 15 hours a week.</p>
            <p eId="para_1618">There is still time to retrieve this situation and I ask the Minister of State to do so as quickly as possible and cause the least amount of anxiety and stress to the families and parents of these disabled children.</p>

          <speech by="#JohnCurranFF" eId="spk_503" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Justice,_Equality_and_Law_Reform">
            <from>Deputy John Curran</from>
            <p eId="para_1619">I will reply on behalf of my colleague, the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Mary Harney.</p>
            <p eId="para_1620">I wish to reaffirm the Government's commitment to people with disabilities and to the national disability strategy and its long-term goals and objectives which we will continue to pursue in the coming years in partnership with all the key stakeholders.</p>
            <p eId="para_1621">The early childhood care and education scheme is being introduced from January 2010 as a free scheme to benefit children in the key developmental period prior to commencing school.  The scheme will allow eligible children to avail of a free preschool place in the year before they commence school.  The scheme is open to all private and voluntary preschool services which are notified to the Health Service Executive or registered with the Irish Montessori Educational Board.  Participating services will be required to provide an educational programme consistent with the principles of Siolta and appropriate to the age of participating children.  As a free preschool year, participating services must agree to provide the service in return for a capitation fee of some €2,450 per annum.</p>
            <p eId="para_1622">The scheme is a general one and participating services will be required to make reasonable accommodation for children with special needs in accordance with the Equal Status Acts 2000 to 2004.  However, the scheme takes account of a number of issues to accommodate children with special needs.  While the age range in which children will qualify for the scheme is, generally, between three years three months and four years six months on 1 September each year, exceptions are allowed where a child has been assessed by the HSE as having a special need which will delay his or her entry to primary school.  In such cases, the preschool year relevant to such children will be taken as their qualifying year.  Additionally, the general requirement that a child would be expected to attend four or five days each week will not apply to children with special needs where a shorter week would be more appropriate to their needs.  Where a preschool service is a specialist one providing a service to children with special needs and additional flexibility in the arrangements for the scheme is required, this will also be considered.</p>
            <p eId="para_1623">Since 2005, the Government has provided significant additional resources for services and supports for effecting real change in the development of services for people with disabilities and as a demonstration of the ongoing commitments to people with disabilities, an additional €10 million was provided in the 2009 budget to continue the development of services for children with disabilities.  A critical element of the ongoing development of disability services is the requirement to provide financial support for the development and implementation of a wide range of services provided to children with disabilities.</p>
            <p eId="para_1624">In the current challenging economic environment, there is a responsibility on all publicly funded services to review the way in which services are delivered and ensure resources are used to maximum effect.  The HSE and voluntary disability service providers are working together to ensure that all of the existing resources available for specialist disability services are used in the most effective manner possible.  This involves a collaborative approach at local health office level in dealing with arising situations, development of criteria for identifying needs in a consistent manner nationally, identification of capacity to increase provision within existing resources, reviewing existing service arrangements in the context of appropriate response and service efficiency and developing innovative responses to meet requirements.</p>
            <p eId="para_1625">There is no additional capitation available under the ECCE scheme to preschools on foot of having children with special needs.  However, <i>ad hoc</i>  arrangements have been made in some local health offices utilising home support-personal assistant resources to support children with specific difficulties accessing mainstream preschool services.  The provision of such supports is dependent upon the assessed needs of the child and the resources available.  In the current challenging financial environment, there are many competing priorities and the HSE is obliged to use the resources available to it in the most efficient and effective manner possible.  The Department of Health and Children and the HSE are working closely to manage the considerable budgetary challenges in this regard.  The cross-sectoral team on disability comprising representatives from the Department of Health and Children, the Department of Education and Science, the HSE and the National Council for Special Education will be considering the provision of educational supports to children with disabilities in the coming months.  Additionally, the Office of the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs will continue to fund training in the child care sector, including training courses which equip child care workers with the skills to support the integration of children with special needs into mainstream services.</p>

          <speech by="#MichaelRing" eId="spk_504">
            <from>Deputy Michael Ring</from>
            <p eId="para_1626">I thank the Ceann Comhairle for allowing me to raise the decision to suspend the transport service in seven rural areas of east and west Cork, Cavan, Sligo, Roscommon, Donegal and Laois.  I cannot understand why the Government has done this.  This service was established on a pilot basis in 2007.  I have raised this matter with the Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs many times during Question Time and on each occasion he has remarked on the success of the scheme.</p>
            <p eId="para_1627">This decision is an attack on elderly people, who are the most vulnerable in society.  In rural areas we do not have Luas, Dublin Bus or any of the transport facilities available in cities.  We depend on the rural community to provide rural services.  This scheme was working very well but the Minister has now withdrawn funding.  Given that the scheme is so successful in the seven pilot areas I expected the Government to allocate further funding to extend it to other rural areas.</p>
            <p eId="para_1628">Age Action is very upset by this decision.  This is the Government's third attack on elderly people this year.  Its first attack was on medical cards and its second on safety alarms.  In some rural areas this service provides elderly and vulnerable people with their only opportunity to get their shopping, go to bingo or to meet people.  This is a major setback for rural Ireland and for the elderly.</p>
            <p eId="para_1629">A small amount of money was working very well.  I complimented Deputy Ó Cuív and his Department on how this money was being spent.  It was targeted at vulnerable groups in rural Ireland.  Another service is now being taken away.  Post offices have gone and Garda stations are going.  Bus Éireann has announced that it will cut its services by 15%.  We now expect more rural services to be taken away.</p>
            <p eId="para_1630">This is a shame; it is a mean and petty attack on the most vulnerable who are most in need of services, the elderly in rural Ireland.  I am surprised at Deputy Ó Cuív and his Department.  I cannot understand why such crucial decisions are being taken in order to save such small amounts of money.  The Minister of State assures me that the safety alarm scheme will be up and running in September.  I hope he and the Minister will sit down with their officials tomorrow and reverse their decision, continue the pilot transport scheme and extend it to other rural areas.  The agents appointed by the State are not doing the job for rural Ireland and now the Government is also letting rural people down.</p>

            <from>Deputy John Curran</from>
            <p eId="para_1631">I thank Deputy Ring for raising this important issue.  The safety alarm scheme is under review.  Before the recent elections, Deputy Ring asked me if the scheme was an election gimmick. We are now on the far side of the elections.  The review is ongoing and the scheme will be reintroduced after the summer with new guidelines and criteria.  I am glad to be able to say this after the elections.</p>

            <p eId="para_1633">I am sure the Deputy will.  Applications on hand before the suspension of the scheme will continue to be processed.  Deputy Ring might have noticed that approximately half of those have been cleared.  I hope that gives him some confidence in the future of that scheme.</p>
            <p eId="para_1634">To return to the matter in hand, all of us here with an interest in rural development issues know how important an issue transport is for rural areas.  The Government's rural transport programme, which is the responsibility of my colleague, the Minister for Transport, aims to deal with what was previously the unmet public transport needs in rural Ireland.  Substantial funding of €11 million is provided to support this service under the rural transport programme.</p>
            <p eId="para_1635">As Minister with responsibility for rural development, Deputy Éamon Ó Cuív very much welcomes the service this programme provides to our rural areas and the fact that it has been expanding its services over the years.  Given his responsibility, he was also conscious of the specific issue of evening and night transport services for rural areas which he examined in conjunction with the Department of Transport, in 2007.</p>
            <p eId="para_1636">As a result of that consideration, the pilot rural transport night scheme was launched in 2007 and the Minister was glad to be able to fund it as a pilot exercise from within his Department.  However, the Deputies will appreciate that the mainstream provision of transport services, including rural transport, is a matter for the Minister for Transport and Department of Transport and, accordingly, it was always the intention that the more limited resources of the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs could be used to support this pilot initiative.</p>
            <p eId="para_1637">Our focus with this pilot scheme was to facilitate a limited number of the groups who already operate under the rural transport programme to run an evening and night service and to have the opportunity to look at the impact on the ground of meeting the needs of night time services in rural Ireland.  The pilot service, even though operated in seven areas only, has allowed rural dwellers to get involved and participate in various activities in the evening that they may not have had the opportunity to in the scheme's absence.</p>
            <p eId="para_1638">The seven groups who have operated the pilot scheme were: West Cork Rural Transport; Avondhu Development Group in East Cork; Meath Accessible/Kilnaleck Community Cavan; County Sligo Leader Partnership; Tumna Shannon Development Company Roscommon; Síob Teoranta Donegal; and Laois Trip.</p>
            <p eId="para_1639">The Department will have provided funding of approximately €950,000 from the commencement of the pilot scheme in early summer 2007 up to 10 July next when the pilot will cease.  The experience of my own Department in operating the pilot scheme, in conjunction with Pobal, who also manage the rural transport programme, has been that it has had a beneficial impact and has been endorsed by those involved in rural transport.</p>
            <p eId="para_1640">That is why, in the context of the pilot scheme coming to an end on 10 July next, the Minister recently met with representatives of the groups involved with the pilot scheme and with Pobal.  At this meeting the groups' experiences of operating the pilot evening scheme was discussed.  It discussed how it might be incorporated into the rural transport programme going forward.</p>
            <p eId="para_1641">There is to be further examination of this issue at a follow-up meeting this week between the groups and Pobal.  Of course, the challenge will be to deliver the services within existing resources, but I should emphasise that the rural transport programme gives flexibility for the groups to identify the priority transport needs of their own areas, in terms of routes, frequency and timing of services.  Neither the Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, Deputy Ó Cuív, nor the Minister for Transport seeks to tell the groups what services they should provide; this is something into which they have a strong input.</p>
            <p eId="para_1642">Overall, Deputy Ó Cuív is glad to see the further consideration that evening services are now getting within the rural transport programme, following on from the pilot he was able to fund.  Historically, services under the rural transport programme have been generally delivered between morning and late afternoon to reflect local needs prioritisation with the available resources.  The Minister understands that some groups provide evening services within the rural transport programme and he would welcome changes that would further extend the service to evening-night time routes where this is both needed and possible.</p>

          <heading>Special Educational Needs.</heading>
          <speech by="#TomSheahan" eId="spk_508">
            <from>Deputy Tom Sheahan</from>
            <p eId="para_1643">"Let no man write my epitaph; no man knows my motives."  This is very pertinent to the current Minister for Education and Science.  The parents of special needs children cannot understand his motives for removing special needs classes.  My colleague, Deputy Michael Ring, spoke about rural transport and removing necessary services from the elderly.  This appears to be the route the Government has taken — it is hitting the most vulnerable in society.  It tried to take the medical cards from people over 70 years of age and now it is removing rural transport.</p>
            <p eId="para_1644">A society is judged by how it treats its most vulnerable members.  Special needs children are undoubtedly the most vulnerable members of our society.  The removal of classes is a budgetary measure.  I am disappointed the Minister is not present tonight.  What will be saved by removing classes from special needs children?  We take great pride in the aid we give to foreign countries, yet our own people are suffering.  Not very long ago these children would have been locked away in attics and the back rooms of houses or put into mental institutions.</p>
            <p eId="para_1645">A special needs class is being removed from St. Oliver's national school in Killarney.  I can stake all my input into political life that the school is a centre of excellence.  Children travel from every corner of County Kerry and even from beyond the county boundaries to the school because it is a centre of excellence.  Does the Minister realise the consequences of his action and the consequences for the children concerned?  Many parents have approached me to ask that this action be stopped.  Some of them are parents of children who have left St. Oliver's, gone on to mainstream secondary schools, have done well and now have jobs.  Some are parents of children who are currently in St. Oliver's.  I have also met parents who are seeking a place in St. Oliver's for their child, which will not be available with the removal of this class.</p>
            <p eId="para_1646">The principal is put in the position of having to decide who is and is not entitled to a place in this centre of excellence.  That is an awful predicament.  Will we have to appoint a Minister for Education and Science who has a special needs child to deal with this and to realise what is involved?  Another parent called to my clinic recently.  I am as tough as any man in this House but this woman brought me down to size.  She told me her son is paralysed, has minor learning difficulties and is fitted with a feeding tube.  She asked where her child could go when he does not get a place in St. Oliver's.  I could not answer.  I would hate to be in that position or for any of my constituents to be in that position.</p>
            <p eId="para_1647">This is due to a budgetary measure by the Minister.  Where will the money be saved?  The child I mentioned is entitled to one hour of special needs education per day in his national school.  The centre of excellence in St. Oliver's must be retained for the people in my constituency.  I am sure this is an issue in every other constituency.  The savings are minimal.  A child with only mild learning difficulties would be able for mainstream education if they had an I.Q. of between 50 and 70.  However, this is not the case and it is up to the principal to decide who gets the places and who does not.  The only savings will be in school transport.  The parents of the children I am representing would be more than willing to bring their children to this centre of excellence if the class is retained.</p>

            <from>Deputy John Curran</from>
            <p eId="para_1648">I thank Deputy Tom Sheahan for raising this matter and apologise on behalf of the Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Batt O'Keeffe, who could not be present.  I am pleased to have the opportunity to clarify the position on the matter raised by the Deputy.</p>
            <p eId="para_1649">The Deputy will be aware that allocations to schools typically increase or decrease depending on pupil enrolment.  In the case of special classes for pupils with a mild general learning disability, MGLD, the normal pupil teacher ratio that applies is 11:1.  The Department of Education and Science, however, allows for a small reduction in this number and permits schools to retain a teaching post where it has a minimum of nine pupils in the class.  The school in question has three special classes for MGLD.  A total enrolment of 31 is required to retain the three classes.  The enrolment in the three classes as returned by the school in September 2008 was 21 pupils.  The minimum enrolment required to retain the third class has therefore not been fulfilled and the school no longer qualifies to retain the third special class.</p>
            <p eId="para_1650">The school in question appealed the Department's decision to suppress the class.  The Department has considered the appeal and has advised the school that the decision to suppress the third class remains.</p>

            <from>Deputy John Curran</from>
            <p eId="para_1652">However, it would appear that some of the children who are enrolled in the MGLD classes in the school in question may fall within the low incidence disability category and may qualify for resource teaching support through the National Council for Special Education, NCSE.  Officials in the Department have been in contact with the NCSE and I understand that the school has initiated contact with the special educational needs organiser, SENO, in this regard.  I understand also that the SENO will convey a decision to the school as soon as this process has been completed.</p>
            <p eId="para_1653">The pupils in the class being suppressed will continue to receive additional teaching support through the teaching resources allocated to primary schools under the general allocation model.  Schools decide how best to use this allocation based on the needs of the pupils and how to adjust their support in line with the changing needs of pupils as they mature.  The Department issued a circular SP ED 02/05 to all schools to assist them in deploying the general allocation model resources.</p>
            <p eId="para_1654">The Department of Education and Science promotes a continuum of assessment and intervention.  These interventions range from support from the classroom teacher to support from the resource/learning support teacher.  Where a school considers that these interventions are not meeting the child's needs, it should seek the advice of its National Educational Psychological Service, NEPS, psychologist.  Schools without an assigned NEPS psychologist can avail of the scheme for commissioning psychological assessments.  Advice may be also sought from the local special educational needs organiser.  The Deputy will be aware of the unprecedented investment in providing supports for children with special needs in recent years.  There are now about 19,000 adults in our schools working solely with children with special needs.  There are more than 8,000 resource and learning support teachers in our schools, compared with just 2,000 in 1998.  More than 1,000 other teachers support children in our special schools.  Some 86 classes for children with mild general learning disability are being retained where there are nine children or more in these classes.</p>
            <p eId="para_1655">The Minister for Education and Science wishes to emphasise that priority will continue to be given to provision for children with special educational needs.  The establishment of these classes for mild general learning disability pre-date many of the developments in special education policy in recent years and we now have a system for providing schools with supports for children with high incidence special needs through the general allocation model.</p>
            <p eId="para_1656">In raising the matter, the Deputy specifically asked whether there was a need to appoint a Minister who has a special needs child.  The Minister of State responding to him tonight has been in that position and had a child in that situation who availed of mainstream education.  As a conscientious parent, I did not have an opportunity to avail of this class.  However, I can say that the services provided through the other supports provided me, my family and our daughter with a very positive educational experience.</p>
            <p eId="para_1657">I thank the Deputy again for giving me the opportunity to clarify the position with regard to this matter.</p>

        <b>Minister for Defence</b>
          the breakdown of the consumables costing €14.334 million which is to be spent under subhead G on defensive equipment in 2009; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

            <p eId="para_1659">The Defence Forces are required to maintain sufficient stocks of ammunition for all weapon types currently in use, as well as other stocks of an explosive ordnance nature.  This is to provide for operational training of all personnel and for specialised operational training prior to overseas deployment.  In addition, the Defence Forces must maintain sufficient reserves of ammunition and explosives to allow for any contingent requirements.</p>
            <p eId="para_1660">The provision in 2009 for the acquisition of defensive equipment under Subhead G of the Defence Vote is €37 million, of which an amount of €14.47 million is designated for the acquisition of ammunition consumables.  Given the nature of the ammunition business, there is a very considerable lead in time for the delivery of orders. In that respect, €10.38 million of the €14.47 million available this year is accounted for by ammunition orders placed in 2008 and which are due for delivery and payment in 2009. The breakdown of the main consumables covered in the provision of €14.47m is given in the form of a tabular statement, which I set out below.</p>

        <b>Deputy Pat Rabbitte</b>
         asked the 
        <b>Minister for Defence</b>
          the impact on the Defence Forces of the guarantee in regard to military neutrality obtained from the EU in relation to the Lisbon treaty; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

            <from>Minister for Defence (Deputy Willie O’Dea)</from>
            <p eId="para_1687">The provisions of the Lisbon Treaty in the security and defence area are fully consistent with Ireland's traditional policy of military neutrality.  In particular, the existing safeguard that the Union's policy in this area "shall not prejudice the specific character of the security and defence policy of certain Member States" is maintained, along with the requirement for unanimity in relation to the launching of any mission.</p>
            <p eId="para_1688">The legal guarantee confirms that the Lisbon Treaty will have no impact on the Defence Forces.  National security will continue to remain the sole responsibility of each member state. In addition, the Treaty will not have any impact on Ireland's traditional policy of military neutrality.  Any decision by Ireland to participate in EU-led military crisis management operations will be for sovereign decision on a case-by-case basis and in line with Irish constitutional and legislative arrangements. The "triple lock" provisions requiring a Government decision, Dáil approval, and UN authorisation will continue to apply in relation to the overseas deployment of contingents of the Irish Defence Forces for service in peace support and crisis management operations.</p>
            <p eId="para_1689">The guarantee confirms that there is absolutely no provision in the Lisbon Treaty, or in any other EU treaties, which would facilitate the establishment of a European Army or the introduction of conscription to any military formation.  The obligation to military service is strictly a matter of policy for individual member states, which in Ireland's case, is entirely voluntary and will remain so.</p>
            <p eId="para_1690">The guarantee clearly states that the European Union has no authority to determine how, where and in what manner we spend money on defence, or indeed how much we spend on defence.  These are solely matters for individual decision by each Member State.</p>
            <p eId="para_1691">The guarantee also confirms Ireland cannot be obliged to participate in any common defence arrangement. Ireland's participation in such an arrangement would require the specific approval of the Irish people in a separate referendum.  Regarding Mutual Assistance, whereby if a Member State is attacked it can ask for help, military or otherwise, from other EU Member States in accordance with Article 51 of the United Nations Charter, Ireland would retain the right to take its own sovereign decision on whether and how to come to another member state's assistance, taking account of our traditional policy of military neutrality.</p>
            <p eId="para_1692">Regarding the European Defence Agency and Permanent Structured Cooperation, it is a matter for each Member State to decide on the level of its participation in any such arrangement in accordance with its national constitutional and legislative provisions.</p>
            <p eId="para_1693">From an Irish perspective, the guarantees confirm that there is no provision in the Lisbon Treaty which impacts on Ireland's sovereign right to decide for itself all matters relating to defence and the Defence Forces.</p>

            <p eId="para_1695">As the Deputy is aware, there has been very significant investment in equipment and infrastructure in the Defence Forces over the past twelve years.  The acquisition of new and replacement equipment for the Defence Forces remains a key focus for me as Minister for Defence.  It is, however, imperative that my Department and the Defence Forces look to whatever efficiencies we can make, taking into account the current difficult economic environment and the overall financial envelope available for the Department for military equipment over the coming years.</p>
            <p eId="para_1696">We have been able to identify the areas from which a reduction in the order of €30m can be achieved:</p>
            <p eId="para_1697">The reduced costs of the Chad mission consequent on its changeover to a UN mission from March 2009 — approximately €10 million.</p>
            <p eId="para_1698">A deferment of certain building and refurbishment projects for the remainder of 2009 — saving approximately €6million on new building and €3million on refurbishment. In that regard, it should be noted that over €400 million has been spent on upgrading barracks, buildings and infrastructure across the Defence Forces since 1997.</p>
            <p eId="para_1699">Reduced fuel and utility costs — approx €2 million.  It is hoped that these savings can be achieved through price reductions and energy efficiency;</p>
            <p eId="para_1700">The balance will be achieved by the implementation of economies across the entire Defence organisation, i.e <i>. </i>savings on pay and allowances and recruitment advertising etc.</p>
            <p eId="para_1701">Several important equipment purchases will be advanced in 2009 and 2010 including the acquisition of Light Tactical Armoured Vehicles, ¾ Ton 4 x 4 vehicles and two Heavy Recovery Vehicles for the Defence Forces. The Naval Service Vessel replacement programme will also be advanced this year.</p>
            <p eId="para_1702">The extensive equipment investment programme implemented over the past 10 years has positioned the Defence Forces well to deal with the reductions which have had to be made in defence expenditure given the resources now available.  Whilst no major equipment programmes have been cancelled altogether, careful planning and monitoring of all funding will continue to ensure that any possible impact on operations is mitigated and that the procurement of essential replacement equipment is prioritised.</p>

            <p eId="para_1704">The issue of workplace childcare has been addressed in recent National Wage Agreements under the Social Partnership heading.  As the Deputy is aware, the Government is fully supportive of measures to improve childcare facilities.</p>
            <p eId="para_1705">A crèche however must be viable if it is to succeed. There must be sufficient demand and it must be capable of meeting ongoing running costs.</p>
            <p eId="para_1706">The Defence Forces Partnership Steering Group Report assesses the viability of a workplace childcare facility in the Curragh Camp for members of the Defence Forces and the Department of Defence.</p>
            <p eId="para_1707">The key issues covered in the Report were the demand for a crèche and the capital and current costs for developing and running a crèche. The Steering Group were not asked to make a recommendation as to whether the project should proceed.</p>
            <p eId="para_1708">The results of a staff survey undertaken as part of the Report indicate that there is likely to be a demand for a crèche in the Curragh. The capital cost of developing a 50-place facility in the Curragh was estimated as being in the region of €2.1 million. The likely running costs were not established as they would depend on the actual level of uptake.</p>
            <p eId="para_1709">This issue has been under consideration for some time. However, and notwithstanding the merit in the proposal, the obligation to review and control every aspect of public expenditure mean that a new project of this nature is not feasible at this time.</p>

            <p eId="para_1714">On 15 March 2009, MINURCAT, the United Nation's led mission in Chad and the Central African Republic assumed operational control of the United Nations force of 2,085 personnel, including 1,877 troops re-hatted from eight EUFOR contributors.</p>
            <p eId="para_1715">In the weeks following the takeover of the force by MINURCAT, the mission faced a number of challenges, including fuel shortages in Chad. The fuel problems encountered by MINURCAT were common to the whole of Chad, as there was a country-wide fuel crisis at the time.  The fuel situation was exacerbated by the rebel incursion into Chad in early May 2009. The UN was fully exercised on the issue and all possible sources of fuel for MINURCAT contingents were investigated by the UN to meet the mission's needs.  This included the airlifting of fuel from a neighbouring UN mission.</p>
            <p eId="para_1716">Significant progress has been made by the United Nations in the past month and I am pleased to inform the House that the fuel situation as it applies to the Irish Infantry Battalion in Goz Beida has essentially been resolved. Sufficient stocks are now in place in Camp Ciara which will provide for the Unit's needs going forward. In addition, extra fuel is stored in the new UN fuel farm adjacent to the Irish camp. The UN also have a facility to fly in quantities of fuel at any stage.</p>
            <p eId="para_1717">The Defence Forces continue to monitor the fuel-supply situation and are maintaining close liaison with the UN authorities on the ground. For now, I am satisfied that the necessary measures have been taken by the UN to address the fuel issue.</p>

            <p eId="para_1719">Arising from an accident involving a troop carrying vehicle in Granard, Co.

            <p eId="para_1735">The Government decision of 14 October 2008 approved a programme for consolidation of Defence Forces formations and the closure of four barracks at Monaghan, Longford, Rockhill and Lifford in Donegal.  These barracks closed at the end of January 2009.</p>
            <p eId="para_1736">Most of the costs at the level of the individual soldier are once off or short-term costs arising from payment of Change of Station Allowance and the provision of transport on a temporary basis. Actual expenditure on Change of Station can only be determined once all claims have been received and processed. While a number of claims have been received to date, it is expected that there may be other personnel, who might have an entitlement, but have not yet submitted a claim. As a result, the detailed cost per soldier is not yet available.</p>
            <p eId="para_1737">The evacuation and movement of personnel and equipment from the closed barracks to the new locations was completed using Defence Force transport assets and, as such, no substantive additional costs were incurred in the move.</p>
            <p eId="para_1738">The costs incurred to date in 2009 at Monaghan are as follows: maintenance/repairs etc. €Nil, utilities €10,318, and provision of security €3,462.75.</p>
            <p eId="para_1739">The costs in relation to Longford are as follows: maintenance/repairs etc. €7,786.40, utilities €4,915, and provision of security €1,530.90.</p>
            <p eId="para_1740">The costs for Rockhill in 2009 are: maintenance/repairs etc. €6,365.65, utilities €2,784.88, and provision of security €2,741.04 and for Lifford are: maintenance/repairs etc. €7,478, utilities €2,664.19, and provision of security €2,128.68.</p>
            <p eId="para_1741">I'm sure Deputies will understand the need to secure the properties and maintain them in reasonably good order so as they do not fall into disrepair, are subject to vandalism or become eyesores in the towns in which they are located. The maintenance of the properties will also be important in ensuring my Department secures a reasonable price for the properties when they are disposed of.</p>

            <p eId="para_1766">I propose to take Questions Nos. 46, 66, 79, 85 and 369 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_1767">The development of the Medical Corps in the Defence Forces forms part of the agreed programme for Government. I am committed to providing a sustainable medical service to meet the needs of the Defence Forces both at home and abroad.</p>
            <p eId="para_1768">As you are no doubt aware the challenges in the medical arena have been recognised for some time and a review of the provision of medical services has been ongoing as part of the Modernisation Agenda for the Defence Forces.</p>
            <p eId="para_1769">In view of the complexity of the challenge facing the Defence Forces in this area, I decided to engage PA Consulting to make recommendations on the best means of meeting the medical requirements of the Defence Forces.</p>
            <p eId="para_1770">In order to meet this objective PA Consulting reviewed the medical services required for the Defence Forces in light of their roles and operations as assigned by Government, assessed the current arrangements for the provision of medical services and proposed a model for future delivery of Medical Services.</p>
            <p eId="para_1771">The Consultants have recommended a programme of major change.</p>
            <p eId="para_1772">Their Report makes a number of recommendations. These include:</p>
            <p eId="para_1773">a centralised command structure</p>
            <p eId="para_1774">the creation of a Medical Services Management and Administrative function. This structure will provide strategic planning, resource allocation and overall responsibility for the management and delivery of the medical service.</p>
            <p eId="para_1775">The development of medical officer lead care teams together with a re-focussing of medical staff on appropriate clinical tasks.</p>
            <p eId="para_1776">The report also recommends steps leading to a reduction in the number of doctor interventions, medical assessments and better management of health services outsourcing.</p>
            <p eId="para_1777">The structure and systems recommended have been designed to meet the demands and needs of the modern Defence Forces at home and overseas and provide Medical Officers with a fulfilling and rewarding career.</p>
            <p eId="para_1778">The Report reaffirms the need for a dedicated Medical Corps and addresses the challenges facing the Defence Forces in recruitment and retention of Medical Officers.</p>
            <p eId="para_1779">Implementation of the recommendations will result in major change at both strategic and operational levels in the Defence Forces.  Thankfully in these difficult times, the Report shows that major additional investment is not needed to meet the medical needs of the Defence Forces. Change will be achieved in the main through better use of the available resources.</p>
            <p eId="para_1780">The PA Report is an important milestone in addressing the challenges to the provision of medical services in the Defence Forces. Implementation will take time and commitment. This will be achieved in consultation with the Representative Associations. I have asked that implementation of the recommendations of this report proceed immediately.</p>
            <p eId="para_1781">The Report makes a number of recommendations regarding a governance structure for change delivery in this area.  The structure recommended, including a high level steering group composed of both military and civilian personnel, will be used.  At a lower level a dedicated programme group with civilian and military representatives will manage the delivery of a suite of projects, which have been identified by the Consultants.</p>
            <p eId="para_1782">I welcome the recommendations and fully support their implementation. Implementation by the Military authorities will commence immediately. Certain recommendations will require further elaboration. Consultation with the Representative Associations will also take place.</p>

            <from>Minister for Defence (Deputy Willie O’Dea)</from>
            <p eId="para_1787">I propose to take Questions Nos 47, 53, 60, and 68 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_1788">Defence Forces contingents were first deployed to Chad in February 2008 with the UN-mandated EU-led operation in the Republic of Chad and the Central African Republic, EUFOR Tchad/RCA. EUFOR's mandate expired on 15 March 2009 and the operation was replaced by the United Nations Mission in the Central African Republic and Chad (MINURCAT).</p>
            <p eId="para_1789">Approximately 400 Irish personnel deployed in Chad with EUFOR transferred to the authority of MINURCAT on 15 March 2009.</p>
            <p eId="para_1790">In his latest report, in April 2009, to the United Nations Security Council on the MINURCAT mission, the Secretary-General indicated that the build-up of the force will be phased, with a period of consolidation prior to the beginning of the rainy season in June 2009. The force was expected to reach its full troop strength of 5,200 by the end of 2009 but this has now been revised downwards to 4,700 by that date. As of 19 June 2009, the MINURCAT force strength is 2,456 troops. The pace of troop generation has been attributed to the brief period allowed between the United Nation's authorisation of the military component of MINURCAT and the deployment of military personnel.</p>
            <p eId="para_1791">Despite the initial challenges faced by MINURCAT, the mission is building on the solid foundation laid by EUFOR, which has helped prepare the way to build future successes and contribute to the long-term beneficial impact of a safe and secure environment. It is expected that the security situation at local level will continue to improve as the MINURCAT mission is fully deployed.</p>
            <p eId="para_1792">All costs associated with deployment of personnel and equipment to the EUFOR Tchad/RCA mission are borne by the troop contributing countries. All EU Member States, irrespective of participation, contributed to the common costs of the operation. The cost to the Defence Vote arising from the Defence Forces participation in this mission amounted to approximately €61m for the period October 2007 to April 2009.</p>
            <p eId="para_1793">Certain costs associated with the deployment of the Defence Forces to MINURCAT will be offset by reimbursements from the UN mainly in the form of Appropriations-in-Aid to the Exchequer. The amounts to be reimbursed are in the process of being finalised by my Department with the United Nations.</p>
            <p eId="para_1794">The incidence of repatriations of Irish personnel from Chad has not been significantly different to repatriations from other missions in which members of the Permanent Defence Force have served.  Since the Defence Forces were first deployed to Chad in February 2008, 20 personnel have been repatriated on compassionate grounds and 13 on medical grounds. Of the 33 personnel repatriated, 6 individuals returned to duty in Chad.</p>
            <p eId="para_1795">In May 2009, as part of the routine troop rotation process, personnel of the 99th Infantry Battalion were moved in groups from the Irish Battalion HQ in Goz Beida in South Eastern Chad to a UN transit camp in the capital N'Djamena approx 1,000 kms away, whilst they awaited a scheduled charter flight back to Ireland on 22 May 2009 at the end of their tour of duty. Whilst there, twenty six (26) Irish personnel contracted gastroenteritis. They were provided with immediate medical assistance by an Irish Battalion Medical Team, who were also due to fly home. All personnel had recovered by 22 May 2009 and were repatriated, as scheduled, on the Irish Chartered Flight under the supervision of the returning Battalion Medical Team.</p>
            <p eId="para_1796">I understand that a full hygiene audit of the transit camp was undertaken immediately by the United Nations Medical Section and remedial action was affected.  I might point out that, due to the challenging conditions pertaining in Chad, incidence of such gastric illnesses are not unexpected.</p>

            <from>Minister for Defence (Deputy Willie O’Dea)</from>
            <p eId="para_1799">I propose to take Questions number 48 and 378 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_1800">The Naval Service provides the maritime element of the Defence Forces and has a general responsibility to meet contingent and actual maritime Defence requirements.</p>
            <p eId="para_1801">In the 2000 White Paper on Defence, the Government decided that the Naval Service would be based on an 8-ship flotilla and committed to a modernisation and replacement strategy to maximise the operational capacity of those 8 vessels consistent with the roles assigned to the Naval Service. All eight ships are involved in coastal and offshore patrolling and surveillance for the State in that part of the seas where State jurisdiction applies such as Internal Waters, Territorial Sea and the Irish Sector of the Exclusive Economic Zone.  As a matter of standing policy, Naval Service assets are not deployed on overseas peace support operations and there are no plans to develop such capacity at this time.</p>
            <p eId="para_1802">The White Paper specifically provides that "New vessels will be brought on stream to replace older ones as these fall due for replacement".  Naval Service Vessels are replaced when they have come to the end of their useful life, which is normally around 30 years. Three ships are due for replacement now and over the next few years — LE Emer, commissioned in 1978, LE Aoife, commissioned in 1979 and LE Aisling, commissioned in 1980.</p>
            <p eId="para_1803">Following a detailed examination of the needs of the Naval Service within my Department a vessel replacement strategy for the Naval Service was put in place.</p>
            <p eId="para_1804">Following Government approval in July 2007, a tender competition for the purchase of replacement vessels for the Naval Service commenced. The competition is for the purchase of two Offshore Patrol Vessels (OPVs) with an option of a third and one Extended Patrol Vessel (EPV) with an option on a second. The options provide an effective value for money opportunity, at locked in prices, to provide replacements for Naval Service vessels, which will reach the end of their service life in the years immediately following the current replacement programme.</p>
            <p eId="para_1805">Following a short-listing process, detailed tender responses were returned to my Department by the shipbuilders on the 11 November 2008.</p>
            <p eId="para_1806">The Tender evaluation commenced immediately and continued for a number of weeks, with the assistance of consultants who were engaged under contract.  A preferred bidder was selected, after which detailed and extensive contract negotiations commenced and are now close to conclusion. No contract has yet been signed. However, I expect to bring this matter to Government very shortly.</p>
            <p eId="para_1807">Subject to Government approval on funding, it is expected that the new vessels will be delivered for acceptance by the Naval Service during the first quarters of 2012 and 2013 respectively. The Department does not propose to exercise the option available under the terms of the tender competition to purchase a third OPV, although it is intended in due course to examine the opportunities that may be presented by doing so. The exercise of any such option would obviously be subject to a further Government decision.</p>
            <p eId="para_1808">In the current difficult economic environment, it is important that we look to the efficiencies which all parts of the public sector can make so as to continue to deliver high quality public services within a more constrained financial resource envelope.  However, it is also important that we continue to invest in public services so as we can maintain service levels into the future.  Within the resources available to us, to maintain capacity, we need to continue the process of modernisation and reinvestment in the Defence Forces generally, into the future.  The Naval Service Vessel Replacement Programme is part of this process.</p>
            <p eId="para_1809">The acquisition of these modern new vessels will ensure that the Naval Service will be fully equipped to carry out its day to day roles in enforcing the State's sovereign rights over our waters and our fisheries and meeting Ireland's obligations in the area of maritime safety and security and fisheries protection.</p>
            <p eId="para_1810">In relation to the larger EPV, the Department intends to complete the contract negotiations in relation to the OPV before the second stage of the EPV competition is initiated. As with the OPVs, any decision to award a contract for the purchase of an EPV must be approved by the Government.</p>
            <p eId="para_1811">The strategy combined with a continuous process of refurbishment will ensure that the operational capability of the Naval Service is maintained at a satisfactory level.</p>

            <p eId="para_1813">The Defence Forces signed a contract at the end of May 2008 with a UK company, Air Partner Commercial Jets, for the charter of two Mi -8T helicopters to support its operations with EUFOR in Chad.  The helicopters arrived in theatre in June 2008 and were contracted to March 2009.</p>
            <p eId="para_1814">The Defence Forces contracted the helicopters for the operational deployment of troops in EUFOR and to facilitate the rapid movement of supplies, stores and equipment from the Forward Logistic Base in Abéché to the Battalion base in Goz Beida in the South East of Chad, where the main body of Irish troops is located.  The contract for the helicopters includes the provision of crew, maintenance and insurance.</p>
            <p eId="para_1815">On 15 March 2009, MINURCAT, the United Nation's led mission in Chad and the Central African Republic assumed operational control of the United Nations force of 2,085 personnel, including 1,877 troops re-hatted from eight EUFOR contributors, including Ireland.</p>
            <p eId="para_1816">In order to ensure that sufficient helicopter support was retained in support of the Defence Forces contingent in Goz Beida for the duration of the transition period from EUFOR to a UN mission, the contract for the helicopters was extended for a further 6 months to October 2009.  It is considered essential to the continued participation of the Defence Forces in the mission that helicopters are available, particularly during the rainy season.</p>

            <p eId="para_1865">The recent Government Decision on savings measures on public service numbers is being implemented in the Defence Forces.  I am in contact with my colleague, the Minister for Finance about the implications of the measures for the Permanent Defence Force.  My focus is on the ongoing operational capability of the Defence Forces.  Until there is an outcome to this process the savings measures continue to apply.</p>
            <p eId="para_1866">The Defence Forces have improved in every respect since 2000 through the implementation of the White Paper.  This represents a significant public service success story.  The organisation is therefore in a healthy state both in terms of personnel and equipment.</p>
            <p eId="para_1867">The economic reality is such that the Government decision must be implemented.  While it is not possible at this time to predict the impact that the suspension of recruitment will have on the Defence Forces, it can be anticipated that further flexibility and re-structuring will be required arising from the implementation of these measures and I intend, within the resources available, to retain the capacity of the organization to operate effectively across all roles.  This will represent a significant challenge in the coming years and one in respect of which I will work closely with the Chief of Staff.</p>
            <p eId="para_1868">I am advised that the Defence Forces retain the capacity to undertake the tasks laid down by Government at home and overseas.</p>

            <p eId="para_2033">The White Paper on Defence 2000 outlines the blueprint for the Reserve Defence Force (RDF). The RDF Review Implementation Plan provides for the phased enhancement of the Reserve over the period to end 2009.  The Plan proposed an establishment of 9,692 for the non-integrated element of the Reserve (9,292 Army Reserve and 400 Naval Service Reserve) and revised organisational structures to give effect to this proposal were introduced on 1st October 2005. The Reserve Defence Force Training Authority, which is intended to be part of the integrated Reserve was also established on a temporary non-integrated basis in October 2005 and has an establishment of 55 members.</p>
            <p eId="para_2034">In addition, the plan provides for the development of an integrated element of the Reserve with a proposed strength of 2,656. In line with the plan, a pilot scheme for the development of the integrated Reserve was conducted in 2007 and continued into 2008. Approximately 300 Reservists completed the pilot training. The numbers participating in the integrated Reserve pilots were disappointing and the Military authorities have decided to suspend integrated training this year.</p>
            <p eId="para_2035">As the Reserve Defence Force Review Implementation Plan is reaching its conclusion, options for the future development of the Reserve, including the development of the integrated Reserve, will be considered.  This will be informed by the lessons learned from the implementation process, including the integration pilots.  In addition, the Reserve Defence Force has been selected for review as part of the 2009 — 2011 phase of the Government's Value for Money and Policy Review initiative.  It is anticipated that this review will also assist in informing decisions regarding the future of the Reserve.</p>

            <p eId="para_2037">In 2003 a Military Law Review Board, established to review the adequacy, effectiveness and fairness of the military justice system as laid down in Part V (Discipline) of the Defence Act 1954, recommended the amendment of some 76 sections within Part V of the Act. In 2005, the Government approved the drafting of a Bill based on the recommendations of the Board. During drafting of the Bill it was decided to focus on only those Heads which were essential to ensure that the provisions of Part V relating to summary procedures and courts-martial were compliant with the European Convention on Human Rights.  The Bill was published as the Defence (Amendment) Bill 2006 and was enacted in April 2007. Subsequent to the passing of the 2007 Act work was completed on publishing revised Court-Martial Rules, Rules of Procedure and Courts-Martial (Legal Aid) Regulations etc., and on completing necessary amendments to Defence Force Regulations, to give effect to the new Act. The new military justice system has been in operation since September 2008.</p>
            <p eId="para_2038">My Department, in conjunction with the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel, is now in the process of drafting a further Defence (Amendment) Bill to deal with the remaining provisions of Part V of the Defence Act 1954 which the Military Law Review Board recommended should be amended. These provisions primarily relate to offences against military law and extended provisions for arrest and detention. I would expect that work on this Bill will be largely complete by the end of 2009 and that it will be published in late 2009 or in early 2010.</p>
            <p eId="para_2039">My Department will also publish the European Defence Agency Bill 2009. Ireland participates in the framework of the Agency and contributes to the operational budget of the Agency which funds the Annual work programme.  The Agency undertakes a range of other projects outside of the work programme to which members can opt in or opt out.  The European Defence Agency Bill 2009 is designed to regulate Ireland's participation in relation to these particular projects.</p>

            <p eId="para_2041">The frequent and ongoing piracy attacks off the coast of Somalia have been threatening commercial shipping and fishing in the region since the beginning of Somalia's civil war in the early 1990s.  A very severe consequence of this piracy has been the impediment to the delivery of humanitarian assistance to hundreds of thousands of Somalis.</p>
            <p eId="para_2042">In December 2008, the European Union launched Operation ATALANTA to contribute to the deterrence, prevention and repression of acts of piracy and armed robbery off the Somali coast.  The UN Security Council welcomed the launch of the operation to combat piracy off the coast of Somali and to protect vulnerable ships bound for Somalia.</p>
            <p eId="para_2043">From the outset, Ireland has fully supported the objectives of Operation ATALANTA. Following approval by the Government at its meeting on 9 June 2009, two (2) Naval Service officers deployed to the Operational Headquarters of Operation ATALANTA at Northwood in the UK on 12 June 2009.

            <p eId="para_2074">Cyber security, cyber crime and internet security represent challenges that are constantly evolving and require vigilance and appropriate responses. Cyber security is multi facetted. The nature of the threat and the potential impact also varies considerably depending on the approach and objective of those with malicious intent.</p>
            <p eId="para_2075">In the first instance, each State agency, business and individual should take every precaution with regard to their security. Awareness of security, the risks and available safeguards, can be seen as the first line of defence for the security of information systems and networks.  I am aware of considerable activity in this regard.  My colleague the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources has undertaken a number of awareness campaigns aimed at individuals, SMEs , the education sector, the public Sector and business.  My colleague the Minister for Justice and the Garda Síochána are also active in areas such as cyber crime and cyber bullying. The legislative programme includes the Criminal Justice (Cybercrime and Attacks against Information Systems) Bill, being prepared by the Department of Justice. This Bill gives effect to the Council of Europe Convention on Cybercrime as well as to the EU Framework Decision on attacks against Information Systems.</p>
            <p eId="para_2076">My Department and the Defence Forces focus on the risks and threats arising in the context of the roles laid down by Government for the Defence Forces. My Department and the Defence Forces implement a programme of continuous review in relation to ICT security in order to keep up to date with current threat levels.  This risk assessment is carried out by a high-level Board comprising civil and military personnel and is supported by sub-groups who carry out specific reviews where a security risk is identified. Detailed policies and guidelines are provided to all users of ICT systems and considerable resources are invested in assessing weaknesses and protecting systems against cyber attack and malicious security breaches. I would also point out that the Defence Forces take comprehensive measures with regard to the security of their information and communications systems when deployed, in Ireland and overseas. Details of measures taken are not publicised for security reasons, but given the levels of upgrading and increased protection put in place in recent years, the vulnerability to such attacks has been greatly minimised.</p>

            <from>Minister for Defence (Deputy Willie O’Dea)</from>
            <p eId="para_2080">I propose to take Questions Nos. 81, 380 and 384 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_2081">The Naval Service provides the maritime element of the Defence Forces and has a general responsibility to meet contingent and actual maritime defence requirements. The Naval Service operates eight general purpose patrol ships. All eight ships are involved in coastal and offshore patrolling and surveillance for the State in that part of the seas where State jurisdiction applies. The Naval Service intends to further enhance its surveillance capabilities by utilising both Automatic Identification Systems (AIS) and Long Range Identification and Tracking (LRIT) which identify merchant shipping in and approaching Irish waters.</p>
            <p eId="para_2082">The primary day-to-day tasking of the Naval Service is to provide a fishery protection service in accordance with the State's obligations as a member of the European Union. However, as the need arises, Naval Service vessels are deployed to other duties such as aid to the civil power, search and rescue or recovery, and drug interdiction operations.</p>
            <p eId="para_2083">The current Exclusive Fishery Limits extend to 200 miles offshore and cover an area of 132,000 nautical square miles. The Naval Service currently patrols the entire 200 mile limit and periodically patrols beyond these limits to protect specific fisheries. These patrols are carried out on a regular and frequent basis and are directed to all areas of Irish waters as necessary. The number of Patrol Vessels on patrol in Irish waters at any one time varies between three and eight. The Naval Service is committed to having at least three vessels on patrol within the Irish Exclusive Economic Zone at any one time. All vessels are multi-tasked in the sense that they also undertake general surveillance, security and other duties while on patrol.</p>
            <p eId="para_2084">Naval Service patrols are complemented by assistance provided by the Air Corps. The Air Corps Maritime Squadron carries out aerial surveillance of our Exclusive Economic Zone using the two CASA maritime patrol aircraft.</p>
            <p eId="para_2085">The Irish Coast Guard has overall responsibility for the provision of maritime Search and Rescue services within the Irish Search and Rescue region. In accordance with the roles assigned to them by Government in the White Paper on Defence, the Defence Forces are committed to providing support to the civil authorities including in relation to Search and Rescue. In this regard, the Naval Service and Air Corps provide support to the Coast Guard as the need arises and within their available capability.</p>
            <p eId="para_2086">Responsibility for the prevention of drug trafficking rests primarily with the Customs Service of the Revenue Commissioners. Responsibility for the prevention of crime, including people trafficking, rests primarily with An Garda Síochána. However, the White Paper on Defence provides for a security role for the Naval Service and the Air Corps to assist and support the civil authorities in this important work.</p>
            <p eId="para_2087">Government measures to improve law enforcement in relation to drugs, including the establishment in 1993 of a Joint Task Force involving An Garda Síochána, the Customs Service and the Naval Service, have helped to maximise the effective use of Naval Service resources in combating drug trafficking. The Air Corps provide air support and, on occasion, carry the Customs National Drugs Team in an observational capacity for the purpose of monitoring vessels suspected of drug trafficking and other illegal activities. There is close co-operation between the civil authorities and the Naval Service and the Air Corps in discharging this important mission.</p>
            <p eId="para_2088">I am satisfied that the Permanent Defence Force is fully resourced to meet all its operational requirements.  There are no plans, nor is there any requirement to increase the authorised strength of the Defence Forces having regard to their assigned roles including in relation to the support they provide in the areas of search and rescue, coastal surveillance, drug interdiction or people trafficking.</p>

            <p eId="para_2100">His contribution is perhaps best captured in the Citation from the Distinguished Service Medal that I very recently awarded to General Nash following his successful leadership of the EUFOR mission in Chad. This read: "For distinguished service as Operational Commander of the UN mandated EUFOR TCHAD / RCA Mission, which he led, from initiation to successful conclusion, displaying throughout outstanding qualities of leadership, resourcefulness, resolve and devotion to duty. His leadership, coupled with his diplomatic, communication and negotiation skills, was central to the success of this mission, and earned him widespread praise internationally thereby greatly enhancing the reputation of the Defence Forces in Peace Support operations"</p>
            <p eId="para_2101">General Nash enlisted in the Defence Forces on 19th October 1964 and was commissioned on 26th September 1966. He served in numerous appointments beginning in the 1st Motor Squadron in 1966 and eventually rising to the post of Deputy Chief of Staff (Operations) in 2005.</p>
            <p eId="para_2102">During his time in the Defence Forces, General Nash served overseas on many occasions and in many locations including, Cyprus, Lebanon and Yugoslavia.

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach (Deputy Pat Carey)</from>
            <p eId="para_2179">The Deputy's question was accompanied by correspondence which contained information on an individual enterprise.  The Central Statistics Office (CSO) cannot comment on matters relating to an individual enterprise.</p>
            <p eId="para_2180">Ireland is obliged under EU law to provide extensive data on business activity to the European Commission and the European Central Bank (Appendix 1 details the main legal obligations).  The CSO is the government body mandated to supply these data requirements.  In addition, the CSO fulfils data demands from other international bodies such as the OECD and the UN, and also from national users such as government, the social partners, economists, and universities.  In the majority of cases, such data requirements cannot be fulfilled by drawing on administrative sources (such as other government bodies) and must be obtained by conducting statistical inquiries directly to businesses.</p>
            <p eId="para_2181">The Government has set a target of reducing administrative burden on business by 25% by 2012.  The Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment is co-ordinating the Government programme to measure and reduce administrative burdens.  As part of this overall effort, the CSO has identified the most burdensome regulations and surveys on business and is devoting resources to the Government programme to measure and reduce these administrative burdens.</p>
            <p eId="para_2182">The CSO recognises that statistical surveys impose an administrative burden on those businesses, particularly small businesses, which are included in surveys.</p>
            <p eId="para_2183">In its <i>Statement of Strategy 2008-2010,</i> the Central Statistics Office (CSO) identified as a corporate priority the minimising of response burden on CSO inquiry respondents.  To achieve this, the CSO is taking a number of actions, including increasing the use of electronic reporting methods, adopting better sampling techniques, increasing the co-ordination between surveys, and making greater statistical use of administrative records.  A number of burden-reduction measures have already been implemented.  These include reducing sample sizes, reducing the number of questions asked on inquiry forms, instigating changes to payroll software to facilitate the automated completion of inquiries on employment and earnings, and expanding the use of administrative data, especially that of the Revenue Commissioners.</p>
            <p eId="para_2184">In the context of the overall administrative burden imposed by government regulation, it should be noted various studies suggest that the burden imposed by statistical inquiries is relatively low and only accounts for around 2% of the overall administrative burden.  Eurostat studies also show that the statistical burden imposed on businesses in Ireland is consistent with that of other EU member states of a similar size.  In the 2006 Business Regulation Survey, conducted by the Economic and Social Research Institute on behalf of the Department of the Taoiseach, 9.4% of businesses reported that making CSO returns was a heavy burden, while 1% of businesses identified CSO returns as the single most significant administrative burden on their business.</p>
            <p eId="para_2185">Appendix 2 presents figures on the reporting burden imposed on Irish business by the CSO, as taken from the <i>Report on Response Burden placed on Irish Businesses by CSO inquiries in 2008</i> (published on 23 June 2009):-in 2008, less than one-third (32.8%) of Irish business enterprises were surveyed by the CSO, i.e., more than two-thirds of enterprises did not receive a single CSO inquiry form.  If the total number of CSO inquiry forms issued in 2008 is divided by the population of business enterprises, the resulting average is 1.3 CSO inquiry forms received per enterprise.  In terms of the time expended on completing CSO inquiries, and again based on the entire population of Irish business enterprises, on average each enterprise spent less than one hour (54.5 minutes) in responding to the various CSO inquiries issued in 2008.  These figures are based on time information supplied by business enterprises themselves in returning the inquiry forms. (Refer to Appendix 2 Table A.)</p>
            <p eId="para_2186">In terms of the distribution of CSO inquiry forms by size of business, the figures in this report demonstrate the efforts made by the CSO to limit the response burden on small businesses.  In 2008, just over 70% (70.6%) of Irish businesses employing less than 20 people were not surveyed at all by the CSO (i.e., received no CSO inquiry form), while 20% (20.2%) of businesses in this size category received just one CSO inquiry form; this means that more than 90% of businesses in the smallest size category received a maximum of one CSO inquiry form in the course of 2008.  Overall, more than two-thirds (67.2%) of Irish businesses were not surveyed at all by the CSO in 2008. (Refer to Appendix 2 Table B.)</p>

         the length of time criteria for a person (details supplied) in County Donegal who was made redundant on 31 December 2008 and is willing to participate in a community employment scheme in June 2009; and if she will make a statement on the matter.

            <p eId="para_2287">Community Employment (CE) is an active labour market programme designed to provide eligible long term unemployed people and other disadvantaged persons with an opportunity to engage in useful work within their communities on a fixed term basis.  CE helps unemployed people to re-enter the active workforce by breaking their experience of unemployment through a return to a work routine and to assist them to enhance/develop both their technical and personal skills.</p>
            <p eId="para_2288">The criteria for participating on the Community Employment programme are based on age and length of time in receipt of various social welfare payments.  In general, the Part-time Integration Option is for people of 25 or over who are receiving social welfare payments for one year or more, and people of 18 years or over in receipt of disability-related payments.  The Part-time Job Option is for people who are 35 or over and in receipt of social welfare payments for three years or longer.</p>
            <p eId="para_2289">Certain groups such as Travellers and refugees aged 18 or over are eligible for both options.  If a person qualifies under the criteria but does not wish to take up the option themselves, there are certain conditions under which a spousal swap can take place.  The maximum duration that individuals can remain on CE is dependent on the participant' eligibility status.  Typically, participants can avail of periods of between one and six years.</p>
            <p eId="para_2290">To cater for older workers in particular, in November 2004 the standard three year CE cap was revised to allow those of 55 years of age and over to avail of a six-year period on CE (based on participation since 3 April 2000).  Subsequently, the participation limit for persons eligible for CE based on a Social Welfare disability linked payment (including those under 55) was increased by one year.  These measures were introduced in recognition of the fact that older participants and participants with a disability may find it more difficult to progress into the open labour market.</p>

        <b>Deputy Brendan Howlin</b>
         asked the 
        <b>Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment</b>
         if, in the case of a person (details supplied) in County Wexford, the owner of two fishing trawlers who has been refused funding by their bank, her attention has been drawn to the fact that without a bank loan to fund the survey which is required to obtain a certificate of compliance in order that their fishing licence can be renewed in October 2009, the only option will be to attempt to sell one vessel in the currently depressed market, with consequent loss of four jobs; if she will offer assistance or advice which would resolve this person’s dilemma in order that jobs could be retained; and if she will make a statement on the matter.

            <from>Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Deputy Mary Coughlan)</from>
            <p eId="para_2293">The Government's efforts over recent months in addressing the banking sector have had a central focus on the needs of the wider economy including the enterprise sector.  A proper functioning banking sector is central to our economic recovery, as this will facilitate appropriate lending to our entrepreneurs, especially to SMEs.</p>
            <p eId="para_2294">There are instances being reported of viable businesses being refused credit and some representative bodies are suggesting such refusals are in the majority.  As against this, banks reporting refusals are slight and that falling demand for credit accounts for reduced lending levels.  There is a perception that there is limited credit availability and this can be damaging at a time of fragile business and consumer confidence.</p>
            <p eId="para_2295">As part of the banks' recapitalisation package, the Government decided to have an independent review of bank lending to try to have an objective assessment of the current lending situation.  This process is under way and although originally only the two recapitalised banks agreed to participate and fund the review, now all the six leading banks are engaged in the project.  The results of this review will be available at the end of this month and this should allow all stakeholders have an objective view of the state of lending.</p>
            <p eId="para_2296">The recapitalisation package also included many supports for enterprises and SMEs in particular.  The recapitalised banks have committed to increasing their lending capacity to SMEs by 10% over 2008.  Irish SMEs are covered by the Code of Conduct on Business Lending to SMEs.  This code was published by the Financial Regulator and came into effect from 13 March 2009.  Lenders covered by the code are required to offer their customers an option for an annual review meeting, to include all credit facilities and security, including collateral.  Banks are also required to treat all credit applications on their merits, to inform customers of the basis for decisions made and to have written procedures for the proper handling of complaints. Where a customer gets into difficulty the banks will seek to agree an approach to resolve problems and provide reasonable time and appropriate advice.  Entrepreneurs applying for bank facilities, therefore, have a direct means to enquire from their banks why lending decisions are being made and to challenge any unreasonable terms being applied through the formal complaints procedure.  Responsibility for the operation of the code rests with the Financial Regulator.  Three banks are providing funding for SMEs on foot of €300 million facilities provided by the European Investment Bank to assist developing SMEs.  A €100 million environmental and clean energy innovation fund is also being established by each bank as well as a further €15m each to new or existing seed capital funds.</p>
            <p eId="para_2297">The Minister for Finance and I have also established a Credit Supply Clearing Group with bank, business (including ISME and SFA) and State representation.  This group is responsible for identifying patterns of events where the flow of credit to viable businesses appears to be blocked and for seeking to identify credit supply solutions relating to these patterns.  The group is however, not an appeals mechanism for cases where credit has been refused by the banks.  Individual business decisions remain the responsibility of the banks.</p>
            <p eId="para_2298">The group met for the first time on 28 May 2009 and will next meet following the conclusion of the Independent Review of Bank Credit.</p>
            <p eId="para_2299">Government has now introduced formal arrangements to reduce the payment period by central Government Departments to their business suppliers from 30 to 15 calendar days.  This commitment has effect on all valid invoices received on and from 15 June 2009 and should help ease cash flow difficulties for SMEs.  Individuals who have difficulty in getting access to bank credit should approach their banks to ascertain the reason for such refusals and should consider to what extent the relevant bank is operating within the Code of Conduct on Business Lending to SMEs.  If the Deputy is aware of any pattern of events within the fishing sector where the flow of credit to viable business appears to be blocked, information on these patterns can be sent to the Credit Supply Clearing Group care of my Department.</p>

            <p eId="para_2304">FÁS Job Clubs were introduced in 1999 to assist people who were actively seeking employment by providing support for the job search process and an environment in which it could be carried out.  Independent sponsor groups are contracted by FÁS on a year to year basis to run the programme.</p>
            <p eId="para_2305">Job Clubs are seen as an important resource and intervention for those who have recently completed training programmes or have recently become unemployed.  They provide both a formal and structured input as well as a drop-in resource facility.  They also help the individual in overcoming the personal effects of unemployment by providing a mutual support forum from people in a similar situation.</p>
            <p eId="para_2306">56 Job Clubs nationwide provided formal programmes to the following numbers of clients for the past three years: 2006, 6,417; 2007, 7,100; 2008, 8,814.  I understand that the number of "drop-ins" would be approximately double these figures.</p>

            <p eId="para_2367">My Department has no record of an application for statutory redundancy in the case of the individual concerned.  Under the redundancy payments scheme all eligible employees are entitled to a statutory redundancy lump sum payment on being made redundant.  A redundancy situation arises in general where an employee's job no longer exists and he/she is not replaced.  An employee is entitled to two weeks pay for every year of service, plus a bonus week, subject to a maximum of €600 gross weekly pay.  It is up to the employer concerned in the first instance to determine whether or not in fact a redundancy situation obtains and to notify my Department using an RP 50 form which can be downloaded from the Department's website at www.entemp.ie.</p>

            <p eId="para_2499">The Work Placement Programme was jointly launched by the Minister for Social and Family Affairs, Deputy Mary Hanafin, and I on 27 May last.  My Department and FÁS are co-operating closely in relation to its roll-out.  Under the programme there are two streams each consisting of 1,000 places of six months duration.  The first stream is for graduates who before this year have attained a full award at level seven or above on the National Framework of Qualifications and who have been receiving Job Seeker's Allowance for the last six months.  The second stream is open to all other individuals who have been receiving Job Seeker's Allowance for the last six months.</p>
            <p eId="para_2500">To date 106 people have made applications under both streams, 76 under the graduate placement programme and 30 under the programme which is open to all other individuals.  In terms of employer interest, FÁS have received 108 requests for information and 27 employers have been registered.  As FÁS are currently in the process of managing placements under both programmes it is too early in the process to provide specific information on placements by sector at this time.</p>
            <p eId="para_2501">I am determined that placements under both programmes are organised as quickly as possible to ensure that the valuable work experience opportunities which they offer are available to all who wish to avail of them.</p>

            <p eId="para_2504">The objective of the Work Placement Programme is to provide invaluable work experience for unemployed persons, including graduates, to improve their skills and to help them into employment as soon as possible.  Specifically focusing on persons who have been on the live register for a period of at least six months ensures that participants have been allowed every opportunity to actively search for employment and, if not successful, benefit from the full range of training suites available from FÁS.  This, in turn, ensures that participants are job ready, will make the most of their work placement and are better placed to avail of new job opportunities when they become available.</p>

            <p eId="para_2507">The EGF application must be assessed by Commission experts and thereafter approved by the full European Commission whereupon it will be forwarded for sanction for payment of the approved level of co-financing to the European Council and the European Parliament.  This process will take some months to complete in full.  The amount of funding to be allocated from the Fund will be decided by the European Commission; while the final amount accruing to the Exchequer will be determined by the numbers availing of training under the scheme.</p>

            <p eId="para_2509">My Department is charged with leading the cross-Government drive to reduce administrative burdens on business.  We are doing this in a prioritised way, drawing on the experiences of other Member States who are also involved in this international effort.  Departments are currently identifying the "Information Obligations", contained in their legislation, likely to be causing the biggest burdens for business.</p>
            <p eId="para_2510">When the top Information Obligations have been identified, these priorities will be measured and, following this, simplification plans will be developed, detailing how the reductions are to be carried out.  Work is now well advanced in my own Department in measuring information obligations in  Company Law, Employment Law, and Health &amp; Safety Law.</p>
            <p eId="para_2511">My Department has identified 34 priority Information Obligations across these three areas.  Details of these priority obligations are set out below.  The priorities were identified through consultation with business groups and experts, and by comparison with the results of the UK measurement exercise.  Other Departments are currently listing and prioritising the Information Obligations contained in the legislation under their responsibility.</p>
            <p eId="para_2512">On 13 of May I met the Director General of CSO, Gerry O'Hanlon, to discuss the issue of administrative costs for business and how we might work together to reduce such costs, where feasible.</p>
            <p eId="para_2513">In its Statement of Strategy 2008-2010, the Central Statistics Office (CSO) has identified as a corporate priority the minimising of response burden on CSO inquiry respondents. To achieve this, the CSO is taking a number of actions, including increasing the use of electronic reporting methods, adopting better sampling techniques, increasing the co-ordination between surveys, and making greater statistical use of administrative records. A number of burden-reduction measures have already been taken.  For example, in the past year, the CSO has instigated changes to payroll software to facilitate the automated completion of the greater part of the Earnings, Hours and Employment Costs (EHECS) inquiry form, reduced the sample sizes of large-coverage surveys such as the Business Register Inquiry, and reduced the number of questions asked in structural surveys such as the Annual Services Inquiry. Another recent development is the publication of the Revenue Statistical Potential of Administrative Records (SPAR) report, which made a number of recommendations as to how the CSO can make greater use of administrative data held by the Office of the Revenue Commissioners; once implemented, these recommendations will contribute significantly to the reduction of the overall administrative burden placed on Irish businesses.</p>
            <p eId="para_2514">In this connection the Deputy will be interested to know that a report published by the CSO today, dealing with the response burden placed on Irish businesses by CSO inquiries in 2008, shows that the average number of inquiry forms received by a business entity in 2008 was 1.3, and that 93.5% of all firms received four or fewer forms in 2008.</p>

            <p eId="para_3048">At the end of 2008, there were approximately 564,000 mortgage accounts in respect of which mortgage interest relief was being paid through the main lenders.  Using the information already available through its own systems and by working with the lenders, the Revenue Commissioners were able to establish the entitlement status of 430,000 mortgage accounts (76% of the total of 564,000 mortgage accounts) under the new seven-year rule for the payment of tax relief as announced in the Supplementary Budget measures.  Of those, 276,000 were determined as eligible for tax relief post 1 May. 242,000 of that 276,000 have been getting the relief since 1 May, the remaining 34,000 have been getting the relief since 1 June and any arrears of  mortgage interest relief due for the month of May is also being paid automatically through the TRS system.  154,000 were determined as ineligible for tax relief post 1 May.</p>
            <p eId="para_3049">In the case of the remaining approximately 134,000 mortgage accounts (24% of the total) definitive entitlement or non-entitlement to mortgage interest relief could not be established by the Revenue Commissioners without making direct contact with the mortgage account holder.  The Revenue Commissioners have now written to the majority of these mortgage account holders advising them of the new seven year rule.  Where these account holders feel they have an entitlement to mortgage interest relief they are asked to provide certain information about the account to the Revenue Commissioners.  The remaining more complex cases involving top up loans are in the course of being written to by the Revenue Commissioners.</p>
            <p eId="para_3050">From the responses received, the Revenue Commissioners have acquired the additional information needed to determine continued eligibility in the case of a further 26,000 accounts.  Arising from this information the Revenue Commissioners will now recommence mortgage interest relief from 1 July for these 26,000 accounts.  Any arrears of tax relief due back to 1 May will also be paid automatically through the TRS system.</p>
            <p eId="para_3051">A breakdown of tax relief paid through TRS by range of the amount on the lines sought by the Deputy is not available to Revenue Commissioners.  Similarly, information on the number of recipients who are on fixed, variable or tracker mortgages is not available to the Revenue Commissioners.</p>

            <p eId="para_3055">I propose to take Questions Nos. 122 to 124, inclusive, together.</p>
            <p eId="para_3056">The position in relation to mortgage interest relief is as set out in my Supplementary Budget on 7 April 2009.  The Government believes that in these times of scarce resources support should be targeted at those most in need.  Accordingly, from 1 May 2009 mortgage interest relief has been limited to the first seven years of a mortgage.  The relief is now targeted at those who bought their home when prices were at their peak while also supporting those who wish to move, improve or buy for the first time.  As house prices fall the provision of mortgage interest relief will be kept under review with a view to eventual abolition.</p>
            <p eId="para_3057">I appreciate, of course, that fixed rate mortgage holders do not benefit from the recent reduction in interest rates.  However, my understanding is that over 60% of fixed rate mortgages are fixed for between one and three years and this cohort should be able to avail of the current low interest rates once the fixed period has expired.</p>
            <p eId="para_3058">I am aware that the Commission on Taxation is considering the issue of mortgage interest relief and I will be informed by its proposals on this matter.  I am not aware of the day to day consultations and discussions the Commission is undertaking in its consideration of the issue.  This is of course, a matter entirely for the Commission itself as it sees fit.  The terms of references of the Commission on Taxation are broadly defined, far-reaching and allow for consideration of all aspects of the taxation system.  This would naturally include a consideration of mortgage interest relief.</p>

            <p eId="para_3061">I propose to take Questions Nos. 125 and 126 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_3062">I announced on 18 June that the Government had agreed a range of reforms of the structures for regulation of financial services in Ireland.  The key change is the establishment of a single fully integrated regulatory institution, the Central Bank of Ireland Commission.  The Central Bank Commission will be chaired by the Governor of the Central Bank and will be responsible for both the supervision of individual firms and the stability of the financial system generally.  The approach taken in these reforms mirrors arrangements proposed at EU level and will ensure a cohesive approach between the two critical elements of effective financial regulation.</p>
            <p eId="para_3063">The new Commission will include expert, highly experienced and authoritative non-executive members.  This new structure will replace the current board structure of the Central Bank and the Financial Services Regulatory Authority to achieve the highest performance standards for the new organisation.  These reforms will underpin a more effective and efficient financial services regulatory system aligned with best international practice.</p>
            <p eId="para_3064">Two top-level posts will be established within the Central Bank of Ireland as ex-officio members of the Commission.  A Head of Financial Supervision will report to the Commission on the regulatory and supervisory functions and objectives of the new structure while a Head of Central Banking will report on the performance of central banking functions (other than those that relate to the independent role of the Governor under the EC Treaty and Eurosystem and ECB structure).  The reforms will be supported by a significant expansion of regulatory capacity within the new structure with the appointment of substantial additional staff with the skills, experience and market-based expertise to meet the objectives of the new structures including in relation to the regulation of the international financial services sector.</p>
            <p eId="para_3065">The consumer information and education role, currently carried out within the Consumer Directorate in the Financial Regulator will be reassigned to the National Consumer Agency (NCA).  The NCA is being amalgamated with the Competition Authority.  The functions to be merged in the new body are highly complementary and share a common goal of enhancing consumer welfare.</p>

         if his attention has been drawn to the findings of the Financial Regulator which found that 41% of bank branches were not adhering to the Irish Bankers Federation Voluntary Switching Code; if he will introduce legislation to put the code on a statutory basis in order that it is adhered to by financial institutions; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

            <from>Minister for Finance (Deputy Brian Lenihan)</from>
            <p eId="para_3067">The Irish Banking Federation Personal Voluntary Switching Code was introduced in 2005 on a voluntary basis.  It is aimed at assisting customers in switching their personal current or savings account and making the process of switching as smooth and easy as possible.</p>
            <p eId="para_3068">In March 2009, the Financial Regulator (FR) published the findings of its mystery shopping exercise, which examined the ease of switching personal accounts between banks.  This exercise was carried out in November 2008 as part of the FR's role in monitoring compliance with the Irish Banking Federation (IBF) Voluntary Personal Switching Code.  Fifty-one branches of seven banks were visited by Financial Regulator staff, posing as customers wishing to switch their main current account from another bank.  The mystery shopper rated each branch to be either ‘satisfactory' or ‘unsatisfactory', taking into consideration:</p>
            <p eId="para_3069">The accuracy of the information provided,</p>
            <p eId="para_3070">The helpfulness of the bank assistant,</p>
            <p eId="para_3071">The bank assistant's awareness of the switching process, and</p>
            <p eId="para_3072">The provision of a switching pack.</p>
            <p eId="para_3073">The findings from this exercise show that only 59% of branches visited were found to be ‘satisfactory'.  The main reasons for the other 41% of branches being deemed ‘unsatisfactory' were:</p>
            <p eId="para_3074">In some cases, the mystery shopper was not encouraged to use the switching process by virtue of the information provided,</p>
            <p eId="para_3075">Staff, in some branches, were unable to provide sufficient information on the switching process,</p>
            <p eId="para_3076">In some cases, the mystery shopper was actively discouraged from using the switching process, and</p>
            <p eId="para_3077">Switching packs were not referred to or provided in some branches.</p>
            <p eId="para_3078">The Financial Regulator has asked the IBF to consider the findings of this exercise in its ongoing development of the switching process and to revert with its proposals for improving the service to its customers.  The IBF is expected to actively engage with its members on this issue, particularly in respect to staff training and effective monitoring of compliance within branches.  The FR will continue to carry out mystery shopping exercises to assess the ease of switching.</p>
            <p eId="para_3079">Notwithstanding the findings of this exercise the Deputy may wish to note that, up to April 2009, the IBF has facilitated the switching of approximately 61,000 personal accounts.</p>
            <p eId="para_3080">Furthermore, the European Banking Industry Committee has drawn up voluntary common principles regarding switching of accounts, which draw upon the IBF's Code.  These principles have been accepted by the EU Commission and are due to be implemented by November this year.</p>
            <p eId="para_3081">Accordingly, it is my view that the Irish Banking Federation Personal Voluntary Switching Code does not need to be put on a statutory basis.</p>

            <p eId="para_3086">The Bank Guarantee Scheme is a major benefit not only to the covered institutions but also to their customers and the economy as a whole.

            <p eId="para_3087">My Department and the Financial Regulator have set up mechanisms for monitoring the financial institutions in relation to the guarantee.  The auditors of each covered institution are reporting quarterly on compliance with the scheme, including section 44.  The regulator has advised me that two reports, one for the quarter ended December 2008 and one for the quarter ended March 2009 have been received to date.</p>

            <from>Minister for Finance (Deputy Brian Lenihan)</from>
            <p eId="para_3090">I understand the Deputy is referring to the decision announced in the Supplementary Budget 2009 to terminate the property-related accelerated capital allowance schemes in the health sector, among which is a scheme for registered nursing homes.  I should explain that the rationale behind the decision to terminate these schemes is to broaden the tax base so that, in conjunction with other measures announced in the Supplementary Budget, everyone would make a contribution to resolving our fiscal difficulties, including those availing of tax relief under these schemes.</p>
            <p eId="para_3091">A scheme of capital allowances in respect of expenditure incurred on the refurbishment or construction of a nursing home that is registered under section 4 of the Health (Nursing Homes) Act 1990, has been in place since December 1997.  Under the scheme, qualifying expenditure can be written off against a person's tax liability at the rate of 15% per annum for the first six years with the remaining 10% in year seven.</p>
            <p eId="para_3092">However, as announced in the Supplementary Budget on 7 April last and as reflected in section 8 of the Finance Act 2009, this scheme is to terminate on 31 December 2009 along with certain other health-related capital allowances schemes, subject to transitional arrangements for pipeline projects.  Under the transitional arrangements, if certain qualifying criteria are met, the termination date for qualifying expenditure is extended.</p>
            <p eId="para_3093">The qualifying conditions depend on the type of work to be carried out and whether or not the work requires planning permission.  Where the work to be carried out does not require planning permission, the termination date is 30 June 2010 so long as at least 30% of the construction or refurbishment costs have been incurred on or before 31 December 2009.</p>
            <p eId="para_3094">Where planning permission is required in relation to the work to be carried out, the qualifying condition for a termination date beyond 31 December 2009 is that a valid application for full planning permission be submitted on or before that date and be acknowledged by the relevant planning authority.  In such cases, the termination date for qualifying expenditure is 30 June 2011.  Thus, where planning permission for a nursing home has already been obtained, Finance Act 2009 provides for qualifying expenditure to be incurred up to 30 June 2011.  I consider that the transitional arrangements now in place for pipeline projects will minimise the impact of the termination of the scheme of capital allowances on planned nursing home developments.</p>

These include the Money Advice and Budgeting Service which have recently launched a Joint Protocol with the Irish Banking Federation to ensure effective co-operation when dealing with debt problems of personal debtors.  In addition, the mandatory Code of Conduct for Mortgage Arrears (February 2009) requires that when a borrower is in difficulty, the lender shall make every reasonable effort to agree an alternative repayment schedule.</p>
            <p eId="para_3480">Under the Code, consideration should be given case by case to alternatives such as deferral of payments, extending the term of the mortgage, changing the type of mortgage, and capitalising arrears and interest.  In any case, lenders will not commence legal action for repossession until six months after the arrears arise.  As part of the subscription agreement for their recapitalisation, Bank of Ireland and AIB will not commence court proceedings for repossession of a principal private residence until 12 months after the arrears appear when the customer continues to co-operate with the bank.</p>
            <p eId="para_3481">On 26 March I undertook to raise the concerns about the level of redemption fees with the Consumer Director of the Financial Regulator who provided a statutory mandate to safeguard customers' interests.  At the beginning of April my Department wrote to the consumer director to request confirmation that redemption fees charged for switching from fixed rate mortgages only covered funding costs and that no other costs were included.</p>
            <p eId="para_3482">To date, the Financial Regulator has been able to confirm to my Department that all mortgage lenders have responded and provided the formula they use when they calculate the early redemption fee that applies to fixed rate mortgages.  The Financial Regulator is awaiting independent verification by an actuary that the fee charged by a number of lenders recoups only the costs incurred by the lenders when they finance the fixed rate mortgage.  However, the verifications received show that the formulae applied by the relevant lenders seek to recoup the loss to them arising from the early redemption of the fixed rate mortgage and do not seek to apply a penalty charge to the borrower.</p>
            <p eId="para_3483">The Financial Regulator is also examining whether any other costs are being charged such as administrative fees.  Any such charges may be subject to approval by the Financial Regulator under section 149 of the Consumer Credit Act 1995 and will be examined further in that light.  To date, the responses indicate that most lenders do not levy additional charges in the case of early redemption of fixed rate mortgages.  The Financial Regulator has advised that further analysis may be necessary once all the information is received and reviewed.  Should the remaining analysis by the Financial Regulator indicate that further consideration of this issue is required, it will be carried out.</p>

Provided the individuals referred to in the question are members of such schemes and the lump sum payments comply with the relevant legislation and Revenue rules in this area, there is no liability to income tax on the retirement lump sums.

            <p eId="para_3527">A core Government objective is to free up lending on a commercial basis into the economy to support economic growth.  In the context of the bank guarantee scheme and recapitalisation the banks have made important commitments to support business lending.</p>
            <p eId="para_3528">A Code of Conduct for Business Lending to Small and Medium Enterprises was published by the Financial Regulator on 13 February and took effect on 13 March.  This code applies to all regulated banks and building societies and will facilitate access to credit, promote fairness and transparency and ensure that banks will assist borrowers in meeting their obligations, or otherwise deal with an arrears situation in an orderly and appropriate manner.  The business lending code includes a requirement for banks to offer their business customers annual review meetings, to inform customers of the basis for decisions made and to have written procedures for the proper handling of complaints.  Where a customer gets into difficulty the banks will give the customer reasonable time and seek to agree an approach to resolve problems and to provide appropriate advice.  This is a statutory code and banks will be required to demonstrate compliance.</p>
            <p eId="para_3529">In addition, as part of the recapitalisation package announced on 11 February, Allied Irish Bank and Bank of Ireland reconfirmed their December commitment to increase lending capacity to small and medium enterprises (SMEs) by 10% and to provide an additional 30% capacity for lending to first time buyers in 2009.  If the mortgage lending is not taken up, then the extra capacity will be available to SMEs.  AIB and Bank of Ireland have also committed to public campaigns to actively promote small business lending at competitive rates with increased transparency on the criteria to be met.  Compliance with this commitment is being monitored by the Financial Regulator.  Officials from my Department are also in regular contact with the banks concerned in relation to their progress on implementing these measures.</p>
            <p eId="para_3530">My colleague the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment has recently set up a clearing group including representatives from the main banks, business interests and state agencies, which is chaired by officials in the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment.  The purpose of the group is to identify specific patterns of events or cases where the flow of credit to viable businesses appears to be blocked and to seek to identify credit supply solutions.  Any questions on the clearing group should be directed to my colleague the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment.</p>
            <p eId="para_3531">An independent review of credit availability, funded by the banks but managed jointly by the banks, Government and business representatives is also underway and will be completed shortly.  Amongst the issues covered by this review will be changes in bank lending, repayment terms and a comparison with customer experiences prior to the onset of the financial crisis.  I am satisfied that this review, along with the quarterly reports from the recapitalised institutions, will give a clear picture regarding the flow of credit in the Irish economy which will inform future policy.</p>
            <p eId="para_3532">It is a primary goal of the Revenue Commissioners that all taxpayers and business meet their tax obligations in a timely fashion.  I know that Revenue is very conscious of how the current economic and financial environment is impacting on some businesses in regard to meeting their tax payment obligations on time even where they are fully committed to so doing.  Revenue is disposed to and is actively working with such businesses and taxpayers to find a way through these difficulties provided there is a positive and honest engagement with Revenue and the fundamentals of the underlying business are sound.  I am fully supportive of the efforts of the Revenue Commissioners in their efforts in that regard and of the way that they have openly encouraged businesses that may be experiencing difficulties to engage with them at an early stage.</p>

            <p eId="para_3556">A supplementary pension may be paid in certain circumstances to a person whose occupational superannuation benefits are co-ordinated with the State Pension (Contributory).  A supplementary pension may be paid to pensioners in respect of periods during which the pensioner is not employed in any capacity which involves a social insurance contribution and, due to causes outside his/her own control, fails to qualify for social insurance benefit or qualifies for such benefit at less than the maximum personal rate.</p>
            <p eId="para_3557">The supplementary pension is equal to the difference between (i) the occupational pension which would have been payable if it had been based on pensionable remuneration (i.e. gross pay plus pensionable allowances) instead of net pensionable remuneration (i.e. gross pay plus pensionable allowances minus twice the rate of  State Pension (Contributory) payable to a single person) and  (ii) the aggregate of the actual occupational pension payable and the actual rate of social insurance benefit payable (including any payments for dependants).</p>
            <p eId="para_3558">A supplementary pension is not paid under the incentivised early retirement scheme (ISER) until a person reaches pension age (age 60 for the bulk of civil and public servants), which is similar to the arrangements under the cost neutral early retirement (CNER) scheme.  The ISER is essentially based on the CNER arrangements except that the benefits are not actuarially reduced and only a portion of the lump sum is paid on leaving the employment.  There are no proposals to amend the ISER as suggested by the Deputy, which would erode the savings yield from the scheme.</p>

            <p eId="para_3562">As the Deputies will be aware the Supplementary Budget announced the introduction of a Margin Scheme for second-hand cars, with effect from 1 July 2009.  Under the scheme, dealers would be taxed for VAT purposes on their margin (i.e. the difference between the prices at which the dealer purchased and subsequently resold a vehicle) in regard to second-hand cars they acquired and resold after that date.  In conjunction with the introduction of the Margin Scheme, special transitional arrangements were to be put in place regarding second-hand cars in stock on the introduction of the Scheme.</p>
            <p eId="para_3563">The Margin Scheme would have replaced the existing Special Scheme for second-hand cars, under which dealers/garages are entitled to immediate input credit for the residual VAT included in the price of a second-hand car acquired either through purchase or trade-in.  Under the Special Scheme, dealers, when they resell the car, are required to repay this VAT input credit or VAT based on the resale price of the car, whichever is the greater.</p>
            <p eId="para_3564">Further discussions on the matter took place with SIMI and the motor industry decided, on balance, that it would not be in its overall best interest for the Margin Scheme to be introduced at that time.  Consequently, the proposed Margin Scheme and transitional arrangements regarding existing stock of second-hand cars was not introduced in the 2009 Finance Act.  There will be ongoing dialogue over the coming months with SIMI as to what measures might be introduced to assist the motor industry, particularly with regard to reducing the stock of second-hand cars held by dealers.  I have no plans to introduce a car scrappage scheme.</p>

        <b>Deputy Joan Burton</b>
         asked the 
        <b>Minister for Finance</b>
          if he will report on recent press reports that a bank (details supplied) is to engage in a debt swap to strengthen its balance sheet by offering a coupon rate of 12.5% on newly issued bonds; how such banks will rank in terms of seniority of liabilities; if they will rank above or below the €3.5 billion in preference shares being injected by the Exchequer and which carry a coupon rate of 8%; if he will explain the coupon differential of some 4.5% between these two liability classes; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

            <p eId="para_3632">I am advised that the Exchange Offer, referred to by the Deputy, was proposed by the bank as a means of increasing its core capital (similar to other such proposals) subject to commercial considerations.  The bank expects that this exchange will have a positive impact on its Core Tier 1 capital position without significantly impacting its overall capital position.  The instruments being issued by the bank as part of its exchange offering with a coupon of 12.5% will rank ahead of the preference shares held by the State.  At the time that the preference shares held by the State were structured the coupon was limited to a 7% to 9.3% corridor by the EU.</p>
            <p eId="para_3633">However, I am further advised that the new instruments are not directly comparable with those held by the State which form part of an integrated deal which includes warrants to subscribe for 25% of the enlarged ordinary share capital of the bank (or 33% of its ordinary share capital prior to the deal being announced).  The State's preference shares also include a step-up feature which provides that redemption after the fifth anniversary of the issue must be at 125% of par value, which further adds to the value of the State's interest.  In addition, the bank's exchange offering will create a significant level of distributable reserves which will act as a buffer against loan impairments, protecting the interest of the State.  Those distributable reserves rank below the preference shares held by the State, as they are available to offset losses incurred by the bank in the normal course of business.</p>

            <p eId="para_3702">The table below shows gross current expenditure for the years 1997 to 2009, both Voted and non-Voted. Voted current expenditure is divided by Department based on the current allocation of Ministerial responsibilities. Non-Voted expenditure is predominantly made up of the servicing costs of the National Debt and contributions to the EU budget.</p>
            <p eId="para_3703">The gross Voted expenditure figures between 1997 and 2007 are taken from the Appropriation Account for the relevant years, while non-Voted current expenditure is derived from the appropriate Finance Accounts for the relevant years. GDP and GNI figures for these years are taken from the <i>National Income and Expenditure Account</i>, published by the Central Statistics Office (CSO).</p>
            <p eId="para_3704">The gross Voted expenditure breakdown figures for 2008 are provisional outturns, while the 2009 figures are expenditure Estimates. These figures were published in the <i>Revised Estimates Volume 2009 </i>on 23 April 2009.</p>
            <p eId="para_3705">The non-Voted current expenditure figure is as published in the end 2008 Exchequer Statement, while the 2008 GDP figures are from the <i>Quarterly National Accounts</i> for the fourth quarter, published by the CSO. Both the non-Voted current expenditure and the GDP figures for 2009 are those published in the April Supplementary Budget.</p>

            <p eId="para_4579">The Government announced on 11 February 2009 that the recapitalisation of Allied Irish Banks and Bank of Ireland through the purchase of preference shares to the value of €3.5 billion in each bank would be funded through the National Pensions Reserve Fund (NPRF), with €4 billion coming from the Fund's resources and €3 billion to be provided by front-loading the Exchequer contributions for 2009 and 2010. Following the enactment of the Investment of the National Pensions Reserve Fund and Miscellaneous Provisions Act 2009, the recapitalisation of Bank of Ireland was effected on 31 March 2009 and the recapitalisation of Allied Irish Banks on 13 May 2009 through the purchase of the preference shares by the National Pensions Reserve Fund.</p>
            <p eId="para_4580">The preference shares held by the NPRF pay a fixed dividend of 8% payable in cash or ordinary shares in lieu. These shares can be repurchased at par up to the fifth anniversary of issue and at 125% of face value thereafter. Warrants attached to the preference shares give an option to purchase up to 25% of the existing ordinary shares of each bank calculated on a post-dilution basis. The warrants can be exercised from the fifth to the tenth anniversary of the purchase of the preference shares.</p>
            <p eId="para_4581">I expect that this participation by the NPRF in the recapitalisation of Allied Irish Banks and Bank of Ireland will yield a satisfactory return for the Fund over time and will assist the Fund in its purpose of meeting as much as possible of the cost to the Exchequer of social welfare pensions and public service pensions from 2025.</p>
            <p eId="para_4582">As the Deputy will be aware, the Government has also decided to provide €4 billion in capital to Anglo Irish Bank. We are currently in the process of obtaining EU approval in this regard.</p>

          <speech by="#BarryAndrewsFF" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Health_and_Children" eId="spk_615">
            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Deputy Barry Andrews)</from>
            <p eId="para_4604">The Helping Hands Adoption Mediation Agency is a registered adoption society that is registered by the Adoption Board and was, until very recently, licensed by the Government of the Socialist Republic of Vietnam.  Helping Hands remains registered as an adoption society in Ireland under the Adoption Acts, 1952–1998.</p>
            <p eId="para_4605">As the Deputy is aware, I was informed by the Department of Foreign Affairs on 12 June last that the Vietnamese licence held by Helping Hands had been revoked by the Vietnamese authorities.  The Government had previously requested that this licence be suspended rather than revoked in light of the on-going discussions with Vietnamese officials on a strengthened bilateral inter-country adoption agreement.  Unfortunately, in the absence of a full agreement between Ireland and the Socialist Republic of Vietnam, the Vietnamese Government was not in a position to make any exception to the granting of a licence to Helping Hands.  As a consequence, 20 applications, which are currently in Hanoi, will be returned to the respective applicants.  These applicants were not given referrals before the 1 May 2009 deadline.</p>
            <p eId="para_4606">This is obviously disappointing news for all concerned.  I subsequently advised the representative groups on these developments, and the applicants involved were also contacted by Helping Hands.  Despite these events, I must emphasise that all of the applicants who have already received a referral in respect of a child from the Socialist Republic of Vietnam will have their applications processed to conclusion, and applicants will be supported by Helping Hands in that process, by agreement with the Vietnamese authorities.</p>
            <p eId="para_4607">The reinstatement of the Helping Hands Adoption Mediation Agency's licence would be a necessary part of any interim or new inter-country adoption agreement with the Socialist Republic of Vietnam.  As such, the Government is actively trying to establish the status of its request for an interim inter-country adoption agreement, presented to the Vietnamese authorities on 20 May last, and the associated licensing requirements.</p>
            <p eId="para_4608">The Socialist Republic of Vietnam is a sovereign state and the decisions that it makes regarding the internal regulation and management of its adoption services must be treated sensitively as appropriate to a sovereign state. My priority is to conclude discussions with the Vietnamese Government on a strengthened bilateral inter-country adoption agreement and avoid any debate outside of that process that could potentially jeopardise or interfere with these discussions.</p>
            <p eId="para_4609">I can assure the Deputy that the work to prepare for and advise the Government on a strengthened bilateral inter-country adoption agreement with the Socialist Republic of Vietnam has been given, and continues to be given, the highest priority.  I have explained the reasons for the renegotiation of the existing agreement and am acutely aware of the stress and anxiety that this process has caused to many prospective adoptive parents.</p>

            <p eId="para_4623">In order to implement savings measures on public service numbers,  the Government introduced a moratorium on recruitment, promotion, or payment of an allowance for the performance of duties at a higher grade with effect from 27 March 2009 to end 2010.  A HSE circular has issued which gives effect to the Government decision in the public health services and other specific aspects of the employment control framework for the health services.</p>
            <p eId="para_4624">The HSE will be focussing on the scope that exists within the health services for reorganising and restructuring of work in order to minimise the impact on essential service delivery. The redeployment and reassignment of existing staff will also support the reorientation of care from hospitals to the community and to facilitate the development of integrated care. It is seeking a high level of flexibility from staff and unions to achieve this.</p>
            <p eId="para_4625">The Government decision has been modulated to ensure that key services are maintained as far as possible in the health services, particularly in respect of children at risk, older people and persons with a disability.</p>
            <p eId="para_4626">In addition, the employment control framework specifically exempts the following front line grades in the health sector from the moratorium: Medical Consultants, Speech and Language Therapists, Occupational Therapists, Physiotherapists, Clinical Psychologists, Behaviour Therapists, Counsellors, Social Workers, and Emergency Medical Technicians. The framework actually allows for a growth in the number of those posts within the overall approved employment ceiling (111,800 whole-time equivalents) for the health sector. The framework also includes provision for the creation of 225 new development posts this year for cancer and disability services. In addition, special provisions apply in relation to Clinical Engineering Technicians, Dosimetrists, Physicists, and Radiation Therapists, which are specialist grades under the National Cancer Control Programme.</p>
            <p eId="para_4627">The focus on these key grades is in line with existing Government policy on the prioritisation of certain development areas, for which significant funding has already been provided. The overall result will be to assist in the reorientation of health employment to services delivered in primary and community care.</p>
            <p eId="para_4628">I wish to advise that as part of the Employment Control Framework for the health sector, the Joint Employment Control Monitoring Committee, comprising officials from my Department, the Department of Finance and the HSE, meets regularly to monitor health employment levels and to review the implementation of the moratorium and any issues arising.</p>

I am informed by the Medical Council that it notifies all EU medical regulatory authorities when a doctor has been struck off in this jurisdiction.

These Guidelines for the Protection and Welfare of Children were published in September 1999.  These are national over-arching guidelines that apply to all individuals and agencies that deal with children. The key message of the Children First Guidelines is that anyone who works with, has responsibility for, or comes into contact with, children should be aware of the signs of abuse, be alert to the possibility of abuse, and be familiar with the basic procedures to report their concerns.</p>

          <speech by="#MaryHarney" as="#Minister_for_Health_and_Children" eId="spk_636">
            <from>Minister for Health and Children (Deputy Mary Harney)</from>
            <p eId="para_4664">I propose to take Questions Nos. 193 and 197 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_4665">My Department issued a suite of three circulars to the HSE on 15 May 2009, which provided for the Incentivised Scheme for Early Retirement (8/2009), the Incentivised Career Break Scheme (Circular 9/2009) and the Shorter Working Year (10/2009), as announced by the Minister for Finance in his Supplementary Budget Statement of 7 April 2009.</p>
            <p eId="para_4666">The purpose of these circulars is to facilitate a permanent, structural reduction in the numbers of staff employed along with an associated restructuring of organisation and operations, in as timely a manner as possible and in line with the 2009 Employment Control Framework for the Public Health Sector.  While the reduction in numbers achieved under these schemes is intended to contribute significant and ongoing savings to the Exchequer, this must be done in a way that does not undermine essential service provision.</p>
            <p eId="para_4667">The schemes do not apply, therefore, to grades exempted from the moratorium on recruitment and promotions under the 2009 Employment Control Framework for the Public Health Sector in order to meet the requirements of integrated health care delivery and, in particular, to address needs in the community in respect of care of the elderly and people with disabilities.</p>
            <p eId="para_4668">Members of all other grades who meet the eligibility criteria will have access to these schemes, provided the grades/staff groups concerned cooperate with the requirements in relation to redeployment, mobility, skill mix and flexibility which are outlined in the employment control framework: this is designed to allow individuals to avail of the schemes while still protecting services.  Because staff who retire under the schemes will not be replaced (save in very exceptional cases), employers must pay particular attention, when considering applications, to the scope that exists within the organisation for reorganising and restructuring work in order to minimise the impact on essential service delivery.  Staff co-operation and flexibility in that regard is essential.</p>
            <p eId="para_4669">My Department has been informed by the HSE that the majority of health service trade unions have recently issued a directive instructing their members not to cooperate with redeployment and reassignment requests from management.  This instruction severely restricts the ability of management to organise/restructure work practice and contravenes the qualification criteria for the scheme.</p>
            <p eId="para_4670">However, I understand that applications can still be made to the relevant employer in anticipation of a resolution of the industrial relations issues.  Applications can be made under the ISER scheme from the 18th May to the 18th September with a final leaving date of 30th November. Applications can be made under the Special Incentive Career Break scheme from 18th May to the 1st July, with a commencement date no later than 1st September 2009, except in certain circumstances such as the person being on maternity leave or the business needs of the work area.  There is no closing date for the Shorter Working Year scheme.</p>
            <p eId="para_4671">The HSE have provided the following data in relation to the number of enquiries made and applications received in respect of the Incentivised Scheme for Early Retirement and the Special Incentive Career Break Scheme, as at 15 June 2009.</p>

          <speech by="#BarryAndrewsFF" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Health_and_Children" eId="spk_638">
            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Deputy Barry Andrews)</from>
            <p eId="para_4686">As the Deputy is aware, I have responsibility for the National Childcare Investment Programme 2006-2010 (NCIP).  The NCIP is an ongoing multi-annual investment programme designed to improve the availability and quality of childcare options, primarily through capital grant-aiding the construction and refurbishment of childcare facilities and through current support grants for community services.</p>
            <p eId="para_4687">The total allocation to the Programme was €575m over five years, of which €358m was in respect of capital and €217m was in respect of current expenditure.  By the end of 2008, approximately €180m of the NCIP's capital allocation had been committed, with almost €100m drawn down, of which some €15m was drawn down in 2007 and some €79m was drawn down in 2008.  With the exception of a small number of priority projects approved earlier this year, no further commitments are expected to be made in respect of capital grant funding under the NCIP in light of the current economic climate, and the total capital allocation is now €222m.  €60m in capital funding has been allocated for, and is expected to be drawn down, in 2009.  Capital funding to cover the remaining commitments will be allocated in 2010.</p>
            <p eId="para_4688">The bulk of the NCIP current funding is expended on the Community Childcare Subvention Scheme (CCSS).  The framework for the CCSS was finalised in December 2007 and the Scheme was introduced with effect from January 2008.  The CCSS has a total allocation of approximately €160m over the three years 2008-2010.  The funding supports community-based childcare providers, enabling them to charge reduced childcare fees to disadvantaged parents.  The Scheme is designed to be transparent and effective in targeting disadvantaged parents through the implementation of tiered fee structures based on the ability of parents to pay.</p>
            <p eId="para_4689">While CCSS funding for community-based childcare services is normally based on the actual parent profile and level of service provided, where a new community service has received capital grant aid a higher level of funding is generally provided to assist the service during the start-up phase.</p>

            <from>Minister for Health and Children (Deputy Mary Harney)</from>
            <p eId="para_4691">In the context of the current economic difficulties and in accordance with a recent High Court settlement agreement between the Irish Medical Organisation (IMO) and the Health Service Executive (HSE), a two phased process is underway to reduce the working hours of non-consultant hospital doctors (NCHDs) to comply with European Working Time Directive (EWTD) requirements to increase flexibility in the working day of NCHDs and to achieve other cost containment measures including a reduction in NCHD overtime.</p>
            <p eId="para_4692">The first phase of talks under the auspices of the Labour Relations Commission (LRC) concentrated on the introduction of EWTD compliant work patterns, rotas, rosters and on-call arrangements and ended on 22 May, without agreement. Under the terms of the settlement agreement outstanding issues were referred to the Labour Court for adjudication.  On 15 June 2009 the Labour Court made the following recommendations:</p>
            <p eId="para_4693">NCHDs should undertake to operate 5/7 working with effect from 1 July 2009.</p>
            <p eId="para_4694">The core working day should run from 8am to 9pm Monday to Friday and from 8am to 7pm at weekends.</p>
            <p eId="para_4695">The minimum length of a shift should be six hours Monday to Friday and 5 hours at weekends.</p>
            <p eId="para_4696">The number of rostered weekends will be kept to a minimum.</p>
            <p eId="para_4697">The total daily working hours should not be less than six hours (weekdays) / five hours (weekends) and not more than 13 hours (weekdays) / eleven hours (weekends)</p>
            <p eId="para_4698">The new rostered working arrangements are to be introduced from 1 July 2009.</p>
            <p eId="para_4699">The effect of the Labour Court Recommendation would mean a reduction in long hours for NCHDs and improved patient safety. The recommendation will be the subject of a ballot of IMO members to be concluded on or before 25 June 2009.  LRC negotiations on all other NCHD contract issues will be dealt with in Phase 2 of the process and must conclude by 16 October. All outstanding issues will be referred to binding adjudication by the Labour Court with a ruling by 20 November 2009.  I have asked the HSE to investigate the manpower implications for small hospitals and to reply directly to the Deputy.</p>

            <p eId="para_4709">The National Treatment Purchase Fund (NTPF) was established to tackle the issue of excessive waiting times for hospital treatment for public patients.  The Fund has been very successful in fulfilling this remit and has arranged treatment for over 145,000 patients to date. On average, public patients are now waiting 2.6 months for their operations, down from two-to-five years before the NTPF was established.  For reasons of patient safety, highly specialised and complex paediatric cases like scoliosis cannot usually be provided within the private sector and it is best clinical practice that these patients are treated through the public hospital system.</p>
            <p eId="para_4710">The NTPF has arranged treatment for a limited number of patients with scoliosis to undergo surgery in a public hospital.  No additional remuneration accrued to the treating consultant in respect of these exceptional cases, which involved patients whose medical condition was deemed clinically suitable for treatment in another hospital.</p>
            <p eId="para_4711">Contrary to recent claims, scoliosis procedures arranged by the NTPF do not cost two to three times that of similar procedures in the public sector. The NTPF negotiates competitive prices and no premium is paid for work done through the NTPF.  The Fund will continue to deal with exceptional cases, having regard to the patients' medical condition, suitability and safety, as well as length of time waiting for treatment.</p>

            <from>Minister for Health and Children (Deputy Mary Harney)</from>
            <p eId="para_4739">There has been a growing demand for, and investment in, occupational therapy services over the last number of years. A particular priority for my Department and the Department of Education and Science in recent years has been the expansion of the supply of therapy graduates. The Government has also invested heavily in the education and training of such personnel in order to secure a good supply of graduates to provide for the healthcare needs of the population into the future.  In this regard, since 1997, the number of training places for occupational therapy has been increased from 29 to 110 which represents an increase of 279%.</p>
            <p eId="para_4740">Almost 130,000 people work full-time or part-time in our public health services.  In recent years, the Government's ongoing high level of investment in health has achieved and maintained significant increases in the numbers of doctors, nurses and other healthcare professionals employed in the public health services. The numbers employed in occupational therapy has also grown significantly, from 291 whole time equivalents employed in December 1997 rising to 1,093 whole time equivalents employed in March 2009, which represents an increase of 276%. The Government is committed to ensuring continued adequate recruitment of professional staff across a range of community settings to ensure the continued development of community services. Additional funding of €20 million has been provided in 2009 for health and education services for children with special educational needs. This funding will provide a total of 125 additional therapy posts in the HSE targeted at children of school-going age. 90 of these will be in the disability services, including occupational therapists, speech and language therapists and physiotherapists.</p>
            <p eId="para_4741">My Department recently wrote to the Health Service Executive setting out the overall approved employment control ceiling for 2009<b>. </b>As part of this approval, written confirmation has been provided to the HSE that the general moratorium on recruitment, promotion and the payment of acting up allowances does not apply to specific designated grades. Delegated sanction has been given to the HSE for the creation and filling of frontline posts including occupational therapy, speech and language therapy and physiotherapy posts. The approval indicated that vacancies in existing posts in these grades may continue to be filled. New<b> </b>posts may also be created in these grades, up to a specified limit, provided that the HSE is satisfied in each case that there is no scope to redeploy an equivalent post from the hospital sector to the primary and community care sector. This moratorium exemption provides for an increase in the number of therapy posts, in line with Government policy, in order to meet the requirements of integrated care delivery and primary care needs particularly in respect of children at risk, the elderly and those with disabilities. The recruitment and retention of these key front line therapy posts, including occupational therapists, is vital to ensure continued progress in the development of community settings. Subject to overall parameters set by Government, the Health Service Executive has the responsibility for determining the composition of its staffing complement. It is a matter for the Executive to manage and deploy its human resources to best meet the requirements of its Annual Service Plan for the delivery of health and personal social services to the public. With regard to occupational therapy posts in the mid-western region, as this is a service matter it has been referred to the HSE for direct reply.</p>

            <p eId="para_4755">The Medical Council is charged with responsibility for the registration of medical practitioners and the regulation of their activities.  The Medical Practitioners Act 2007 provides for a clear compulsory requirement for registration for all medical practitioners, including cosmetic surgeons.</p>
            <p eId="para_4756">In January 2007, as part of the government's commitment to ensuring patient safety and quality in our health service, I established a Commission on Patient Safety and Quality Assurance to develop clear and practical recommendations to ensure that quality and safety of care for patients is paramount within the healthcare system.  The Commission's Report — ‘ <i>Building a Culture of Patient Safety</i>’ was published in August 2008.  The Commission recommended that there should be a mandatory licensing system in Ireland to cover both public and private healthcare providers.  It further recommended that the licensing system should commence with application to the acute hospitals and other facilities based on analysis of potential risk to patient safety and that this list should include facilities where the following treatments are provided:</p>
            <p eId="para_4757">medical treatment under anaesthesia or sedation</p>

            <p eId="para_4762">The Government recently accepted the Commission's report and approved the commencement of work on the drawing up of detailed proposals for legislation to give effect to its central recommendation on the licensing of both public and private healthcare providers.  This legislation will be complex and it is anticipated that the Bill will be published in 2011.  The Government also supported the establishment of a Steering Group, chaired by the Chief Medical Officer of the Department of Health and Children, to drive the implementation of all the report's recommendations.  This Steering Group has now been established.

When invasive procedures are being arranged, persons would be advised to check that the services are provided by a medical practitioner who is appropriately registered with the Medical Council.  In addition, before agreeing to undergo any procedure, persons should ascertain the level of follow-up medical support which will be available to them after the surgery has been completed.</p>
            <p eId="para_4764">The Medical Council produces a Guide to Ethical Conduct and Behaviour which includes guidance for doctors on the required standard for practice premises and standards in relation to centres of health care.  The Council is in a position to consider alleged breaches of the guide in respect of doctors who are registered with it.  Where a concern arises about the professional activity of a registered medical practitioner, the Medical Council has the power to investigate the circumstances of the complaint, and, if a prima facia case exists, to conduct an inquiry.  Where a finding of professional misconduct or unfitness to practise is made against a doctor, the Council has the authority to suspend, limit or revoke the registration of that individual.</p>

            <p eId="para_4817">The scheme will allow qualifying children to avail of a free pre-school place in the year before they commence primary school.  It has been designed to provide children with access to an appropriate level and quantity of programme based activities over the course of the year, which is reflected in the requirement that 3 hours a day, 5 days a week over 38 weeks is provided in the case of sessional playschool services, and 2 hours, 15 minutes a day, 5 days a week over 50 weeks is provided in the case of full or part-time daycare services.  Children will qualify in respect of one year's provision.</p>
            <p eId="para_4818">Participating children must, normally be aged between 3 years 3 months and 4 years 6 months on 1st September of each year.  As the child referred to by the Deputy will be almost 4 years and 1 month of age at 1 September 2009, she will be eligible for the pre-school year in January 2010.  If the child in question will not commence primary school until a date later than September 2010, due to having been assessed by the HSE as having a special need which makes this appropriate, she can, alternatively, avail of the pre-school year at a later date to coincide with her actual pre-school year.</p>

            <p eId="para_4822">The Incentivised Scheme of Early Retirement in the HSE is provided for in Circular 8/2009, which issued on 15th May, 2009.  Applications can be made under the scheme from the 18th May to the 18th September with a final leaving date of 30th November.</p>
            <p eId="para_4823">The ISER does not apply to grades exempted from the moratorium on recruitment and promotions under the 2009 Employment Control Framework for the Public Health Sector in order to meet the requirements of integrated health care delivery and, in particular, to address needs in the community in respect of care of the elderly and people with disabilities.</p>
            <p eId="para_4824">Members of all other grades who meet the eligibility criteria will have access to the ISER provided the grades/staff groups concerned cooperate with the requirements in relation to redeployment, mobility, skill mix and flexibility which are outlined in the employment control framework: this is designed to allow individuals to avail of the ISER while still protecting services.  Because staff who retire under the scheme will not be replaced (save in very exceptional cases), employers must pay particular attention, when considering applications, to the scope that exists within the organisation for reorganising and restructuring work in order to minimise the impact on essential service delivery.  Staff cooperation and flexibility in that regard is essential.</p>
            <p eId="para_4825">My Department has been informed by the HSE that the majority of health service trade unions have recently issued a directive instructing their members not to cooperate with redeployment and reassignment requests from management.  This instruction severely restricts the ability of management to organise/restructure work practice and contravenes the qualification criteria for the scheme.</p>

            <p eId="para_4849">I propose to take Questions Nos. 247 to 251, inclusive, together.</p>
            <p eId="para_4850">The Health Service Executive (HSE) has the operational responsibility for the General Medical Services (GMS) Scheme.  The Executive is anxious to ensure that one of the key principles underpinning the scheme, (i.e. a choice of doctor) is maintained and supported to the fullest extent possible.  This includes having regard to available medical manpower and facilitating access to a female doctor on the part of female patients in managing their care.  This, however, is not always possible where, for example, there is only one doctor available in an area.  In these circumstances the choice available to patients is necessarily limited.</p>
            <p eId="para_4851">The HSE indicates that as a result of the emergence of group practice arrangements, GP contractors are increasingly employing additional medical personnel in their practices, a development which has contributed to an increase in the number of female doctors to treat patients.</p>
            <p eId="para_4852">The development of Primary Care Teams, which is a key priority for the Executive, will also ensure that patients have access to a wider range of medical and other professionals, which in turn will enhance the gender composition of primary care resources.  In addition, over the past number of years, the majority of participants on GP vocational training courses are female and this trend will contribute further to increasing the number of female GPs into the future.  Significant investment in structured GP out-of-hours arrangements over the past decade or so has also enhanced the attractiveness of general practice for female graduates.</p>
            <p eId="para_4853">I would point out that patients have a right to choose a GP under the GMS Scheme or on a private basis.  Medical Council Ethical Guidelines state that doctors who consider that they don't have the necessary skills/facilities to undertake management of a patient should refer to a colleague who does.  Doctors must also facilitate a patient's request for a second medical opinion.</p>
            <p eId="para_4854">In relation to the Deputy's questions regarding the number and percentage of women GPs in the GMS Scheme, by local health area, and the situation regarding the availability of female GPs in the area specified by the Deputy, my Department has requested the Parliamentary Affairs Division of the Executive to arrange to address these matters and to have a reply issued directly to the Deputy.</p>

            <p eId="para_4871">The Incentivised Scheme of Early Retirement in the public health sector is provided for HSE employees in Circular 8/2009 which issued on 15th May, 2009. Applications can be made under the scheme from the 18th May to the 18th September with a final leaving date of 30th November.  The ISER does not apply to grades exempted from the moratorium on recruitment and promotions under the 2009 Employment Control Framework for the Public Health Sector in order to meet the requirements of integrated health care delivery and, in particular, to address needs in the community in respect of care of the elderly and people with disabilities.</p>
            <p eId="para_4872">Members of all other grades who meet the eligibility criteria will have access to the ISER provided the grades/staff groups concerned cooperate with the requirements in relation to redeployment, mobility, skill mix and flexibility which are outlined in the employment control framework: this is designed to allow individuals to avail of the ISER while still protecting services.  Because staff who retire under the scheme will not be replaced (save in very exceptional cases), employers must pay particular attention, when considering applications, to the scope that exists within the organisation for reorganising and restructuring work in order to minimise the impact on essential service delivery.  Staff cooperation and flexibility in that regard is essential.</p>
            <p eId="para_4873">My Department has been informed by the HSE that the majority of health service trade unions have recently issued a directive instructing their members not to cooperate with redeployment and reassignment requests from management.  This instruction severely restricts the ability of management to organise/restructure work practice and contravenes the qualification criteria for the scheme.</p>
            <p eId="para_4874">However, applications can be made to the relevant employer in anticipation of a resolution of the industrial relations issues.</p>

            <p eId="para_4879">Major strides have been made in recent years in bringing the quality of resources, readiness, training and management up to a level in Ireland that is second to none in Europe at present.  The Irish Coast Guard, a Division of my Department, has contracted civilian Search and Rescue helicopters, based in Dublin, Shannon, Waterford, and Sligo.  These helicopters are available on a 24 hour 365 day basis for emergency response on any part of the coastline.  The Coast Guard manages and operates 3 co-ordination/communication centres at Dublin, Malin Head and Valentia, remote VHF sites, voice repeater sites and 55 coastal emergency response stations providing shore coverage.</p>
            <p eId="para_4880">In addition to its own resources, the Irish Coast Guard has a number of declared resources available to it on a 24 hour basis all year round.  These include the RNLI which has lifeboat stations around the coast and  Community Inshore Rescue Service boats based in strategic locations.  It can also call on the Department of Defence naval vessels and divers, the Air Corps fixed wing aircraft, the Gardai and their divers and the UK Coastguard and all vessels at sea in a marine emergency situation.  In addition, many local volunteer groups, such as sub-aqua clubs assist in searches and I would like to put on record my appreciation of the work done by all those involved.</p>
            <p eId="para_4881">We are constantly assessing the case for improving resources, based on risk assessment by location.</p>
            <p eId="para_4882">Discussions are ongoing with the UK to expand the Irish Search and Rescue Region to the north-west to coincide with the Irish Pollution Responsibility Zone, which includes the ocean areas where it is the custom and practice for Irish fishing vessels and the Irish Naval Vessels to operate.</p>

          </question>
          <speech by="#NoelDempsey" as="#Minister_for_Transport" eId="spk_700">
            <from>Minister for Transport (Deputy Noel Dempsey)</from>
            <p eId="para_4915">I am deeply disappointed at the suspension of some of Aer Lingus' transatlantic services for the Winter season, as recently announced by the Company. I am particularly concerned at the impact on connectivity of the Mid-West region to the wider US market from both a business and tourism perspective. I made these concerns known on behalf of the Government to the Aer Lingus Chairman when he informed me of the proposals on 11 June.</p>
            <p eId="para_4916">Aer Lingus is a private Company and has to take its own commercial decisions. It would be inappropriate for me to directly intervene to seek a reversal of this decision and to do so would ultimately be damaging to the airline and its customers. In law, the Directors are responsible for managing the company's business and the shareholders are not entitled to overrule management's decisions on business issues.</p>
            <p eId="para_4917">The State's three nominated directors on the Board were issued with a mandate on the date of their respective appointments requesting them to seek to ensure that all future decisions of the company that have significant implications for wider Government, aviation or regional development policies are considered at board level. In any such decisions they are directed to seek to reconcile commercial and public policy objectives.</p>
            <p eId="para_4918">The Chairman of Aer Lingus informed me of the proposals on 11 June. I immediately wrote to the State's three directors to remind them of their mandate and requested that they take account of Government policy on connectivity, regional development and industrial development in the Board's consideration of this matter. It is acknowledged that the duties of the State nominated directors on the Board of Aer Lingus derive from the Companies Acts and that they are obliged to pursue the best interests of the Company.</p>
            <p eId="para_4919">The suspension of a number of transatlantic services from both Shannon and Dublin for the winter season is reflective of the extremely difficult trading conditions in the air transport sector in general and in the long haul market in particular in recent months.</p>
            <p eId="para_4920">I recognise the harsh realities of the marketplace at present and the impact that reduced demand has had on long-haul operations globally in the past few months.  The International Air Transport Association, which represents 230 airlines, comprising 93% of international air traffic, has projected industry wide losses of €9 billion this year. Revenues are expected to fall by 15%, which is more than double the rate of decline experienced following the September 11 terrorist attacks.</p>
            <p eId="para_4921">From Shannon, Aer Lingus's winter schedule will see the suspension of the Chicago service and a reduction in frequency on the Boston route. Aer Lingus is also suspending its services from Dublin to Washington and San Francisco for the winter season.</p>
            <p eId="para_4922">I understand that the proposed changes to transatlantic services were necessitated by the continuing losses on these services.  In the case of the Shannon — Chicago route, for example, I understand that Aer Lingus carried less than 11,000 passengers on the route during the previous winter season and industry projections indicate that passenger volumes may fall by a further 10-20% for winter 2009/10.</p>
            <p eId="para_4923">Notwithstanding the commercial realities of the decision, my immediate concern is to ensure that the widest range of alternative connectivity options are available during the winter months.  I have urged Aer Lingus and the relevant airport authorities to explore ways of minimising the impact these decisions will have on tourism and business.</p>
            <p eId="para_4924">I understand that daily one-stop services will continue to be offered to San Francisco and Washington in cooperation with Aer Lingus US partners — Jetblue and United Airlines. Continental Airlines also operates a regular service from Shannon to its New York hub at Newark Airport, which facilitates easy onward connectivity to over 50 U.S. cities, including Chicago and Boston.  Proposals by Aer Lingus to increase the frequency of the strategically important Shannon-Heathrow route and to improve timings to facilitate better connectivity to and from Heathrow are a welcome development.</p>
            <p eId="para_4925">The Government has allocated €47.25m, for the overseas marketing of Ireland as a tourist destination this year. Included in this amount is over €4.5m for regional marketing activity including the "Discover Ireland's Wonderful West" Campaign. The campaign is overseen by Tourism Ireland who will continue to work closely with Fáilte Ireland, Shannon Airport, Shannon Development, and the local tourism industry in the mid-west to vigorously promote the Shannon region through cooperative marketing campaigns. I understand that their campaign has generally been very well received to date.</p>
            <p eId="para_4926">Looking to the future, the challenge will be to ensure that Irish aviation is well positioned to take advantage of the economic recovery when it comes. I firmly believe that when trading conditions improve there is considerable potential for additional services by Aer Lingus and other carriers availing of new opportunities under the EU-US Open Skies agreement. It is precisely in this context that the full potential of the new US preclearance facilities at Dublin and Shannon will be realised. I am currently bringing legislation through the Oireachtas to give legal effect to our preclearance agreement with the U.S.</p>

            <p eId="para_4930">I have met and communicated with the Chairman and the State-appointed directors of Aer Lingus on a few occasions over the last 2 years but I do not have a definitive list detailing all of the communications I have had with them in that time.</p>
            <p eId="para_4931">The nature of my communications and meetings with the Aer Lingus Chairman and the State-appointed directors has primarily been in the context of my responsibility for national aviation policy.

            <p eId="para_4933">In the context of my role as guardian of the State's shareholding in Aer Lingus, I am briefed by the Chairman periodically on the company's financial performance as announced to the Stock Exchange.  In this context, I met with the Chairman on 29 April 2009 to discuss the company's full year results for 2008, which were released on 11 March 2009, and the Company's Interim Management Statement, which was released on 28 April.</p>

            <p eId="para_4935">As the Deputy is aware in 1968 the then Department of Transport and Power, communicated to Dublin County Council in the case of Dublin Airport a scheme showing restrictions on developments considered necessary in the vicinity of the airport to provide for aircraft and public safety.</p>
            <p eId="para_4936">In notifying Dublin County Council of the area in which the Department was of the opinion that planning should be restricted the Department was merely advising Dublin County Council that development should be restricted on the grounds that it would either infringe the safety standards contained in the Chicago Convention or would constitute an unacceptable risk to the safety of people or property on the ground.  The Department of Transport did not then, and does not now have the power to compel planning authorities to apply its recommendations or advice in relation to red zones.</p>
            <p eId="para_4937">This was an input into the planning process.  The legal justification for any subsequent action is a matter for the relevant local authority.</p>

These recommendations are the basis for the provisions on board structure in the Bill.

            <p eId="para_4964">The Drug Treatment Court, which originally operated on a pilot basis in the North inner city of Dublin, has been placed on a permanent footing and extended to the Dublin 7 area.  The Court uses a multi-disciplinary approach and involves a range of Government Departments and agencies charged with dealing with various aspects of the problem of drug misuse.  The Court operates with the assistance of a team which includes a probation and welfare officer, an addiction nurse, a Garda liaison officer, an education/training representative and counsellors.</p>
            <p eId="para_4965">A review of the operation of the Drug Treatment Court was ongoing prior to the publication of the recent report by the Comptroller and Auditor General.  My Department is examining the operation of the Court having regard to the Exchequer position and officials are looking at best practice elsewhere to see how the Court's throughput levels might be increased.  It is intended to conclude the examination over the coming months. My Department will, of course, take cognisance of the report in concluding the review.</p>

            <p eId="para_4973">I propose to take Questions Nos. 275 and 276 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_4974">The Government Alcohol Advisory Group submitted its Report containing recommendations for reforms in statutory provisions on the public order aspects of the sale and consumption of alcohol in March 2008. Its key recommendations, including the recommendation that alcohol products be displayed separately from other food products and beverages in mixed trading outlets (supermarkets, convenience stores and garage forecourts) were subsequently given statutory effect in the Intoxicating Liquor Act 2008. Section 9 of the Act gives effect to the "structural separation" requirement.</p>
            <p eId="para_4975">During the period leading up to enactment of the 2008 Act, I met with representatives of the mixed trading sector and agreed to consider their proposal to implement a voluntary code of practice as an alternative to implementing section 9 of the Act. I subsequently agreed to defer implementation of the statutory provisions in favour of an agreed voluntary Code and stated that if independent audit and verification were to show that the Code was being implemented effectively across the country, and achieving the objectives of structural separation, it might not be necessary to commence section 9. If not, I indicated that I would not hesitate to implement the statutory provisions.</p>
            <p eId="para_4976">This is the background against which I launched the Code of Practice on the Sale and Display of Alcohol Products in Mixed Trading Premises on 12 May last. The Code represents a voluntary commitment by the mixed trading sector to separate the display of alcohol as far as possible from other food products and beverages in mixed trading outlets.  It also contains additional commitments on responsible sale of alcohol.</p>
            <p eId="para_4977">As regards independent audit and verification, the position is that a new body — Responsible Retailing of Alcohol in Ireland ( RRAI) — has been established by the mixed trading sector to oversee implementation and enforcement of the Code. The sector has appointed Mr. Pádraic White as Chairperson of the new body. Mr White will submit the first RRAI implementation report to me in September next. It will contain details of progress made by retailers across the mixed trading sector in implementing the Code and will provide a basis for assessing whether or not the Code is in practice achieving the objectives of structural separation.</p>

            <p eId="para_5006">The majority of children committed to industrial schools were committed by the District Court under section 58(1) of the Children Act 1908.  I should emphasise that this was not a criminal procedure.  The provision allowed any person to bring a child before the District Court to have that child committed to an industrial school on the basis that the child was found begging, was homeless, had parents who did not exercise proper care, was destitute or was associating with criminals or prostitutes.  In practice, the applications for such committals were most frequently made by the ISPCC, the Gardaí, school attendance officers, the Society of St. Vincent de Paul, parish priests etc.  The report of the Ryan Commission has clearly identified the abuses that arose from the system of detaining children in industrial schools and its findings have been fully accepted by all members of the Government, including myself but also the Minister for Education and Science and the Minister for Health and Children.</p>
            <p eId="para_5007">I as Minister have no power to overturn decisions or orders of a court nor can I intervene in any criminal proceedings.  There are procedures in place to allow decisions of courts to be appealed or judicially reviewed.</p>

However, if the Deputy can provide me with any further information I will make further enquiries and provide as much assistance as possible.  I should explain that the procedure for returning a child who fled from a certified industrial school that was provided for under  section 72(2) of the 1908 Act did not involve the issue of any type of arrest warrant.  I would also point out that the provisions of the Children Act 1908 were repealed by the Children Act 2001.</p>

            <from>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Deputy Dermot Ahern)</from>
            <p eId="para_5010">The Deputy will be aware that my Department is currently engaged in a review of the immigration regime for full time non-EEA students, including the English language sector.  Initial consultation with the relevant Government Departments is well advanced and, subject to the matter being brought before Government, I expect to publish draft proposals in the near future.  At that time, it is envisaged that all relevant stakeholders will be afforded the opportunity to make submissions on the draft proposals and on student immigration issues more generally before any final proposals are settled.</p>
            <p eId="para_5011">The purpose of the review is two fold.  First, there is a need for greater coherence in the way we deal with non-EEA students via a transparent system that is consistent with Irish immigration policy generally.  Secondly, it is generally accepted that there is a need for greater regulation in the student area.  It is commonly accepted that the behaviour of a minority of educational establishments has damaged the reputation of the sector as a whole.  The fact that the Government is taking significant steps in overhauling the regulation of student immigration can only be of benefit to reputable providers.  The English language sector provides useful employment in this country and clearly there is potential for its further development.</p>
            <p eId="para_5012">The correspondence to which the Deputy refers criticises the visa process and appears to argue without significant justification that this is the main reason why certain other destinations have a larger market share. References to refusal rates while not irrelevant need to be understood in context.  Direct comparisons as to refusal rates can only be made if they relate to applications of equal credibility. It should also be noted that many of the persons attending courses in Ireland are from the EU and are clearly not visa required.  The way to increase acceptance rates is not to lower standards but rather to ensure that Ireland is the destination of choice for credible applicants.  Reform of the regulatory environment and increased transparency are key to this process.</p>
            <p eId="para_5013">I would however like to comment on the issue of processing times for visas applications.  Although the INIS website states that visa applications are processed in six to eight weeks, in fact most applications are processed much faster than that.  In our dedicated overseas offices, visa applications are processed typically in two to three weeks.  Applications referred to Dublin are generally being turned around within five days of receipt in Dublin.</p>

            <p eId="para_5015">As the Minister for Finance has made clear, the moratorium on recruitment and promotions in the Public Service applies to the Garda Síochána, both members and civilian support staff.  By its nature, it has no application to the Garda Reserve, whose members are unpaid volunteers who do not occupy public service posts.</p>
            <p eId="para_5016">The moratorium is due to remain in place until the end of 2010, and can only be deviated from in exceptional circumstances with the consent of the Minister for Finance.</p>
            <p eId="para_5017">While the situation will be kept under review the fact that the strength of An Garda Síochána has increased very significantly in recent years means that it is in the best possible position to absorb the impact of moratorium.</p>

            <p eId="para_5019">My proposals on firearms control measures were announced last November and are contained in the Criminal Justice (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2009 which completed Committee Stage on 18 June 2009.  I am aware of the points raised in the correspondence submitted by the Deputy.</p>
            <p eId="para_5020">I met with the Firearms Consultative Panel two weeks ago and listened to their views.  While I undertook to reflect on the points they made, I reiterated the Government's reasons for restricting access to handguns.  I have always made it clear that this ban was not brought forward in the context of tackling gangland crime.  The situation which has come about in recent years was not as the result of any considered policy decision and, in particular, it has been made clear that the Government does not wish a handgun culture to take hold here.  I consider that handguns are different because they are easy to conceal, because they can discharge a large number of bullets rapidly and because they feature so often in gun rampages.  It is after such rampages that gun laws are invariably tightened up as can be seen in many countries around the world.  Experience in other countries shows us that any relaxation of controls on gun ownership very quickly results in dramatic growth in firearms with many longer term negative downstream consequences.</p>
            <p eId="para_5021">While it is not my function to create a hierarchy of merit among the various target shooting disciplines, Olympic shooting activities would be generally recognised as being in a special category.  At the other end of the spectrum not all shooting activities are as legitimate and credible as some of their proponents would claim to be.</p>
            <p eId="para_5022">With the passage of this Bill, while the law will be tighter, people who hold firearms now will be able to apply to license their firearm under the new licensing system. The Garda Commissioner will have the additional powers he needs to address matters relating to firearms licensing.</p>
            <p eId="para_5023">I am conscious, however, of the medium and longer term strategic and developmental issues for shooting sports in Ireland and as a result of my meeting with the Panel I will write to the Minister for Arts, Sports and Tourism in relation to a number of points.</p>

More complicated cases can at times take more than the current average while an element of straight forward cases are now being dealt with in less than that time scale.  There is a limit to the reduction in the processing time that can be achieved as applications for naturalisation must be processed in a way which preserves the necessary checks and balances to ensure that the status of citizenship is not undervalued and is only given to persons who genuinely satisfy the necessary qualifying criteria.</p>

            <p eId="para_5039">The Reception and Integration Agency (RIA) is responsible for the accommodation of asylum seekers, through the Government policy of Direct Provision, while their applications for asylum are being processed. Unless asylum seekers are placed under ‘report and reside' arrangements, they are free to leave accommodation provided by RIA, or opt not to avail of the facilities that lie therein from their day of arrival in the State. In circumstances where an asylum seeker decides to leave his/her accommodation centre and provides a forwarding address to RIA, the details are notified to the ORAC.</p>
            <p eId="para_5040">The Deputy should note that the Immigration Act 2003, which commenced on the 15th September, 2003, contained a number of key changes to the Refugee Act, 1996 which enabled the processing of asylum applications to be speeded up and enhanced our ability to deal with abusive applications. These changes included the imposition on applicants of a clear statutory duty to actively pursue their asylum applications and co-operate at all times with the processing agencies or face having their application deemed withdrawn. An application can be deemed withdrawn, amongst other reasons, where an applicant fails to co-operate with the Refugee Applications Commissioner, or fails to notify the Commissioner of his or her postal address or change of address. The ORAC does not engage in tracking down asylum seekers who disappear. Instead, ORAC recommends to the Minister that such applications should be deemed withdrawn under the provisions of the 2003 Act. Section 13(2) of the Refugee Act (as amended) provides that there is no right of appeal against a recommendation to deem an application withdrawn.</p>

Current policing plans in the area are designed to address issues of crime and public order offences, including the prevention of crimes of violence against persons and property and the maintenance of an environment conducive to the improvement of the quality of life of residents.

            <p eId="para_5225">The Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act, 1956, as amended, provides that the Minister may, in his absolute discretion, grant an application for a certificate of naturalisation provided certain statutory conditions are fulfilled. These conditions are that the applicant must: be of full age; be of good character; have had a period of one year's continuous residency in the State immediately before the date of application and, during the eight years immediately preceding that period, have had a total residence in the State amounting to four years; intend in good faith to continue to reside in the State after naturalisation; have made, either before a Judge of the District Court in open court or in such a manner as the Minister for special reasons allows, a declaration in the prescribed manner, of fidelity to the nation and loyalty to the State.</p>
            <p eId="para_5226">In the context of naturalisation, certain periods of residence in the State are excluded. These include: periods of residence in respect of which an applicant does not have permission to remain in the State; periods granted for the purposes of study; periods granted for the purposes of seeking recognition as a refugee within the meaning of the Refugee Act, 1996.  In light of the changes to the Constitution regarding citizenship by virtue of birth in Ireland (the twenty-seventh amendment of the Constitution), revised arrangements, known as the IBC/05 Scheme, for the non-EEA parents of children born prior to 1 January, 2005, were put in place. Under the IBC/05 Scheme some 16,693 parents of Irish citizen children were granted permission to remain in the State under Stamp 4 conditions.</p>
            <p eId="para_5227">Persons granted permission to remain under Stamp 4 conditions are entitled to work without the need for a work permit and to set up a business without seeking the permission of the Minister. Furthermore, the permission granted counts as "reckonable residency" for the purposes of citizenship. Therefore, while there is no separate procedure for the parents of Irish citizen children such persons, having met the required period of residence in the State, may apply for citizenship if they so wish. Such applications are dealt with in the same manner and under the same procedures and provisions as all other applications for citizenship.</p>

            <p eId="para_5229">The Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act, 1956, as amended, provides that the Minister may, in his absolute discretion, grant an application for a certificate of naturalisation. Applications for naturalisation are generally dealt with in chronological order as this is deemed to be the fairest to all applicants. Applications from foreign nationals working as doctors in public hospitals are correctly given the same priority as other applications. Lodging an application for a certificate of naturalisation should not give any applicant a legitimate expectation that the application will be successful.</p>
            <p eId="para_5230">Following the decentralisation of the Citizenship Division to Tipperary Town, substantially increased resources have been made available to it in order to reduce backlogs and provide a better quality service to all applicants. This has had a positive impact on processing times and has enabled certain categories of applicant to be dealt with more expeditiously. These include refugees, spouses of Irish citizens and minors.  The Deputy will appreciate that a certificate of naturalisation is an exceptional and important document that facilitates a non-national becoming a citizen of Ireland. Therefore, there is a limit to the reduction in the processing time that can be achieved as applications for naturalisation must be processed in a way which preserves the necessary checks and balances to ensure that the status of Citizenship is not undervalued and is only given to persons who genuinely satisfy the necessary qualifying criteria. The procedures involved have been developed and refined over a number of years and I am satisfied that they are necessary to maintain the integrity of the naturalisation process.</p>

            <p eId="para_5232">The Second Interim Report of the Joint Oireachtas Committee on the Constitutional Amendment on Children is being examined in my Department with a view to Government approval being sought for a particular course of action. One of the recommendations of the Committee is that it should be an offence for adult persons in authority to engage in sexual acts with children under 18 years of age. The question of also making it an offence to offer children money or some other consideration in exchange for engaging in a sexual act will be considered in that context.</p>
            <p eId="para_5233">Under the law at present, it is an offence to solicit or importune a child under 17 years of age, whether or not for the purposes of prostitution, for the purposes of the commission of an act that would constitute an offence under section 2 or 3 of the Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Act 2006 or referred to in section 2 of the Criminal Law (Rape) (Amendment) Act 1990. Actually engaging in a sexual act with a child under 17 years of age is an offence under section 3 of the 2006 Act.</p>

            <from>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Deputy Micheál Martin)</from>
            <p eId="para_5236">I propose to take Questions Nos. 318 and 328 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_5237">I have been following, with increasing concern, developments in Iran in connection with the Presidential election which took place on 12 June. Turnout in the election is reported to have been a record 85% with more than 38 million Iranian votes casting their ballots. According to the official results of the election, the outgoing President, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, was deemed re-elected, receiving 63% of the votes, compared to 34% for his nearest rival, former Prime Minister Mir Hussein Mousavi.</p>
            <p eId="para_5238">The election on 12 June had been preceded by a lively and vigorous campaign, with unprecedented live TV debates taking place between all four Presidential candidates and extremely large rallies in support of the principal candidates taking place in Tehran and other Iranian cities.  There is no doubt that the outcome of the election, particularly the speed with which results were announced and the subsequent handling by the Iranian authorities of large-scale peaceful protests by supporters of Mr. Mousavi and the other defeated candidates, have given rise to very serious concerns internationally. Ireland fully supports the Conclusions adopted by the European Council on 19 June, preceded by the External Relations Council on 15 June, which stressed that the outcome of the Iranian elections should reflect the aspirations and choices of the Iranian people and which reiterated that there were legitimate questions over the conduct of the election which need to be fully investigated.</p>
            <p eId="para_5239">I firmly condemn the use of violence against protesters in recent days which, according to unconfirmed reports, have resulted in the deaths of at least seventeen people. I also regret the continuing crackdown by the Iranian authorities on media reporting and personal communications as well as the large-scale arrests of those protesting the election results. The Government has made known its concerns bilaterally to the Iranian Government, at a meeting on 16 June between the Iranian Ambassador and officials from my Department.</p>
            <p eId="para_5240">A partial re-count of disputed votes is now being conducted by the Guardian Council, the body which retains ultimate responsibility for confirming the final results of the election. In the meantime, I would urge the Iranian Government to comply with its international obligations and permit peaceful protest as well as protect freedom of expression at this sensitive time. Such official investigations must be credible, if the current situation is not to deteriorate further.  The Irish Embassy in Tehran is continuing to monitor and report on events and maintain close contact with Irish nationals resident in or currently visiting Iran. Travel advice is being regularly updated by my Department. People currently visiting or intending to visit Iran in the near future are recommended to avoid any large political gatherings or demonstrations and also to comply fully with the terms of their visas.<b> </b>They should also register with the Department’s on line registration facility on www.dfa.ie.</p>
            <p eId="para_5241">Looking to the future, we must continue to encourage Iran to engage with the international community, particularly on such issues as the nuclear question and human rights. Both the EU and the US, under President Obama, have stated clearly their wish to work to improve and develop relations with Iran, once it demonstrates a willingness to respond to international concerns and to comply with its obligations, including those set down in various UN Security Council resolutions.</p>

            <p eId="para_5243">Under the Vienna Convention, the Consular role of the Minister for Foreign Affairs only extends to Irish citizens. In the circumstances, I would suggest that the South African national in question contacts his own authorities in the South African Embassy regarding the incident at a UK airport. If, as I understand is the case, the UK now requires a visa for South African citizens transiting the UK, the person concerned would be well advised to seek such a visa if he intends to transit the UK. The stamping of the person's passport by the UK Border Agency is a matter for the UK authorities and one which the person concerned might wish to take up with the Embassy.</p>

            <p eId="para_5245">The process on this matter has been on-going for many months now and the dialogue with the Vietnamese Authorities is continuing. Many Deputies have sought guarantees and specific timeframes for the conclusion of a new agreement with the Socialist Republic of Vietnam. I must reiterate previous remarks made on this point.</p>
            <p eId="para_5246">At this juncture, all options, including an interim inter-country adoption agreement, are actively being pursued by the Government to allow for the conclusion of discussions on a strengthened bi-lateral agreement and to facilitate continuity of the strong and positive relationship between both jurisdictions. It is not possible for me to either give a timetable or anticipate when discussions on the agreement will be finalised. Discussions on a new bilateral agreement remain live and the request regarding the negotiation of an interim arrangement has been made. It is now a matter for the Vietnamese authorities. My officials and the Embassy in Hanoi are in constant contact with officials in the Office of the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs. As the House is aware, I was recently in direct contact with the Vietnamese authorities regarding the matter. The Irish Government is actively trying to establish the status of the request for an interim agreement and the associated licensing requirements.</p>
            <p eId="para_5247">We remain completely committed to concluding discussions on the text of the bi-lateral inter-country adoption agreement with the Socialist Republic of Vietnam and have explained the reasons for the renegotiation of the existing agreement. The policy objective is the protection of children. The Government seeks to provide the best possible assurances around international adoption and to improve standards for children and the families who apply to adopt from abroad, in line with our commitment to ratify the Hague Convention on the Protection of Children and Co-operation in Respect of Intercountry Adoption.</p>

            <p eId="para_5249">Every applicant for an Irish passport must first establish that he or she is an Irish citizen. In this case, the person in question applied for a passport on 28 July, 2008. As evidence of citizenship, she submitted her birth certificate which established that she was born in the UK. This certificate provided the names of both parents and stated that their place of birth was Ireland. The applicant also submitted her father's birth certificate which confirmed that he was born in County Laois.</p>
            <p eId="para_5250">Where, as in this case, a person born abroad to an Irish-born parent, applies for a passport for the first time, the marriage certificate of the parents is also sought. This requirement is also stated in the detailed notes that accompany the passport application form. The reason for seeking a marriage certificate, where available, is to further verify the link between the applicant and an Irish-born parent and thereby reduce the potential for fraud. However, a marriage certificate is frequently not obtainable and this practice is currently under review by the Passport Office.</p>
            <p eId="para_5251">Unfortunately, the applicant in question did not submit her parents' marriage certificate with her application. On 31 July, 2008 my Department wrote to her requesting the submission of her parents' marriage certificate. No reply to this letter has been received by my Department to date.  It is open to the applicant to pursue her application for a passport. If she wishes to do so, she should contact Mr Kevin Walzer of the Passport Office at (01) 6733215 or by e-mail to kevin.walzer@dfa.ie.</p>

            <from>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Deputy Micheál Martin)</from>
            <p eId="para_5298">In June and December 2008, the General Affairs and External Relations Council decided in principle to agree to an Israeli request to further develop or ‘upgrade' relations between the EU and Israel.  This took place in the context where the Action Plan setting out the details of EU-Israeli cooperation, principally in practical spheres such as transport, health, etc., was coming up for renewal.  It is perhaps unfortunate that the prevalence of the term ‘upgrade' has suggested that what was envisaged was moving relations with Israel to a different, more privileged level than with other States. In fact the more ambitious political contacts proposed by Israel were not by and large taken up in the Council decisions in June and December, and we would envisage relations with all our Mediterranean partners, including the Palestinian Authority, being progressively deepened in this way, at speeds dictated by mutual capacity and progress already achieved.</p>
            <p eId="para_5299">Nonetheless, we were conscious of the possible political signal which might be sent, and the Government consistently maintained that the development of the EU-Israel relationship must take place, and be seen to do so, in the context of the achievement of our agreed goals, including overall progress in the Middle East Peace Process. At the insistence of Ireland and a number of other partners, language making this linkage was included in the Council's decision of principle.</p>
            <p eId="para_5300">In recent discussions, leading up to the General Affairs and External Relations Council meeting on 15 June, a broad consensus has emerged that now is not the time to be proceeding with implementing the upgrade decisions of last December and that any such decision must be linked to, and take account of, overall developments in the peace process. This message was conveyed by the Presidency on behalf of the Union to Foreign Minister Lieberman at the meeting of the EU-Israel Association Council in Luxembourg on 15 June.</p>
            <p eId="para_5301">The decision in principle to enhance relations stands, but the Council has decided that for the moment relations with Israel will continue to be governed by the existing Action Plan.</p>

            <from>Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism (Deputy Martin Cullen)</from>
            <p eId="para_5303">The information requested by the Deputy is below in tabular format.</p>
            <p eId="para_5304">Under the Local Authority Swimming Pool Programme, which is administered by my Department and which has been closed to new applicants since July 2000, grant aid to a maximum of €3.8 million is provided to Local Authorities towards the capital costs of new swimming pools or the refurbishment of existing pools, subject in both cases to the total grant not exceeding 80% of the eligible cost of the project or, in the case of projects located in disadvantaged areas, 90% of the eligible cost.  Proposals must comply with the standards set out in the Department's "Procedures for the Planning, Approval and Financing of Swimming Pools and Technical Guidelines."</p>
            <p eId="para_5305">Under the Guidelines there are four principal stages in a swimming pool project following the submission of a feasibility study.  These, in order of progress, are: Preliminary Report; Contract Documents; Tender and Construction.  Grant-aid is allocated only when tenders have been approved for the project and is capped at the time of allocation.  The Department and its technical advisers, the Office of Public Works, evaluate each stage and local authorities cannot proceed to the next stage of a project unless prior approval issues from the Department of Arts, Sport &amp; Tourism.</p>
            <p eId="para_5306">Where a project is being undertaken by an organisation other than a local authority, the proposal must be considered, supported and submitted by the relevant local authority.  Before supporting a project, the local authority would have to be satisfied that the proposal was viable, that the balance of funding required to complete the project was available and that the project, when completed, would have a satisfactory level of public access.  The Local Authority is responsible for making satisfactory arrangements for the management and maintenance of the facility.</p>
            <p eId="para_5307">The policy since 2000 has been to give priority to the completion of the 57 projects within the current round.  Of these 57 projects, 43 have been completed and are open to the public, 4 are under construction, all of which have been grant aided.  Ten other projects are at various stages of the Programme: 7 at contract documents stage and 3 at preliminary report stage.</p>
            <p eId="para_5308">Cumulative grant expenditure by the Department under the programme from 2000 to the end of May this year is  €135.5m and this grant aid has leveraged total investment of some €399.9m in public swimming pool facilities.  Under the National Development Plan 2007 — 2013, €184m has been allocated for the provision of public swimming pools under the Local Authority Swimming Pool Programme, with €12.4m provided in the Revised Estimates for 2009.</p>
            <p eId="para_5309">The Department has completed and published a Value for Money and Policy Review Report of the Local Authority Swimming Pool Programme.  The Report examined, among other things, how the programme has worked to date and what changes, are required to ensure its effective and efficient delivery.  The Report was published in 2008.  The terms and conditions of any new round of the Programme will be devised taking into account the recommendations of the Report.</p>
            <p eId="para_5310">However, given the current budgetary constraints, it is not intended to launch a new round of the Local Authority Swimming Pool Programme at this time.  The matter will be reviewed again later this year.</p>

         his views on the performance of the US market for tourism in 2007, 2008 and for the first quarter of 2009; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

            <from>Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism (Deputy Martin Cullen)</from>
            <p eId="para_5478">2007 was a record year for Irish tourism with the highest number of overseas visitors ever recorded. Figures published by the Central Statistics Office show that in 2007, there were 1,073,000 visitors to Ireland from North America. The figure fell very marginally in 2008 to 1,005,000. Figures for the first four months of 2009 show that over 219,000 visitors from North America came to Ireland representing a reduction of 4.6% on the corresponding period of 2008.</p>
            <p eId="para_5479">While any downturn in visitor numbers is disappointing, the performance must be seen in context. The downturn in the world economy has significantly affected tourism and travel globally and travel to Ireland has been no exception. The economic difficulties in the United States are clearly having a negative impact on the affordability of overseas travel for many American consumers and the situation has been exacerbated by currency fluctuations. It should be noted that Ireland is still performing relatively better than many of our European competitors. For example, figures show a fall of 13% in overseas visitor numbers to the United Kingdom in the first quarter of 2009, compared to a reduction of just over 9% in Ireland. Furthermore market intelligence suggests that there was a drop of 12.3% in trips from the US to Europe in the first two months of 2009 compared to the drop of 10.1% in visitors from the US to Ireland.</p>
            <p eId="para_5480">To assist the tourism sector through this current difficult period, an extensive range of marketing, product development, festival and sporting events, training and business supports are being rolled out by the Tourism State Agencies under the Tourism Services budget of the Department.  For example, despite cutbacks in public expenditure, the core overseas marketing spend has been maintained in 2009 at over €47 million, in recognition of the key contribution which tourism makes to the Irish economy.</p>
            <p eId="para_5481">This funding has allowed Tourism Ireland to undertake an intensive marketing campaign for Ireland in the United States and in other key markets this year. In addition to the rollout of Tourism Ireland's new "Go Where Ireland Takes You" campaign in the United States, an additional marketing campaign under the banner "Ireland's Wonderful West Awaits You" is also underway in key gateway cities and catchment areas in the US for travel to Shannon and the West. These campaigns have been developed to take account of the current economic challenges and I am assured that Tourism Ireland is keeping all of its marketing programmes for 2009 under review to ensure they maintain the flexibility and responsiveness that is required.</p>
            <p eId="para_5482">I  remain confident that the tourism sector has the capacity to manage the current challenges and  I know that the tourism agencies are doing all they can to ensure that we see a return to growth in overseas visitor numbers, including those from the US, as soon as possible.</p>

            <p eId="para_5495">The London 2012 Olympics and Paralympics Task Force Report concluded that only a relatively small number of existing sports facilities have the potential to attract international athletes and teams in the lead up to the London 2012 Games.  This was based on an assessment of the suitability of existing and planned future sports facilities.  The objective was to focus on existing facilities which were deemed to be of Olympic/Paralympic standard and the upgrades which would be required to bring facilities at other centres up to the requisite standard which for the most part were to be found on university campuses and national sports–specific centres.  These facilities were then assessed against current Olympic and Paralympic standards.</p>
            <p eId="para_5496">In addition to high quality sports facilities, Olympic and Paralympic teams and athletes also require certain ancillary facilities such as adjacent sports physiotherapy and medical facilities, proximity to an airport with direct international flights, meeting, secure storage and treatment rooms. The facilities at Irishtown stadium while very important in a national context were not among those identified by the Task Force.</p>

            <p eId="para_5498">The London 2012 Olympics and Paralympics Task Force was established in August 2006 to ensure Ireland can identify and maximise the complete range of opportunities arising from our proximity to the Olympic and Paralympic Games in London 2012.  The Task Force included experts from the sport, tourism, cultural and business sectors and was supported by staff within my Department.</p>
            <p eId="para_5499">The Task Force report, which was published last February, makes a number of recommendations arising from an audit carried out of high quality sports facilities in Ireland and the findings of a report by Indecon International Economic Consultants on the economic evaluation of the benefit to the island of Ireland of the London 2012 Olympic and Paralympic games.  It highlights the opportunities for Ireland from the London 2012 Games in the sport, tourism, cultural and business sectors.</p>
            <p eId="para_5500">On the sporting side, the Task Force report puts forward proposals for investment in sports facilities which would increase our attractiveness as a training destination for Olympic teams in the lead up and during the Games.  However, given the current economic conditions it is unlikely that the necessary resources will be available in the short term.</p>
            <p eId="para_5501">My Department is engaging with the relevant sporting, tourism and cultural agencies on how best to promote Ireland internationally in the lead up to the London 2012 Games.

            <p eId="para_5525">The Department of Health and Children has the main responsibility in this area.  Under the Misuse of Drugs Acts, the importation, exportation, production, supply and possession of a range of named narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances are regulated and controlled.  The list of scheduled substances is kept under review on an ongoing basis.  In particular, the Department of Health &amp; Children reviews any evidence that substances are being abused and are causing significant harm to public health.  Such reviews would encompass EU decisions in regard to any substances, as recently happened in regard to BZP (Benzylpiperazine), the sale of which has been made illegal.</p>
            <p eId="para_5526">As ‘legal highs' are currently not controlled substances, there is no authority under the Misuse of Drugs legislation to prevent their sale in headshops.  However, the activities of these establishments will continue to be monitored with a view to endeavouring to minimise any risks, especially in regard to the potential that the substances involved might have to encourage experimentation with illegal drugs.</p>
            <p eId="para_5527">One of the actions in the National Drug Strategy 2009-2016, which was very recently approved by Government, provides for the monitoring of the activities of headshops, and all businesses involved in the sale of psychoactive substances, with the objective of ensuring that no illegal activity is undertaken.  It also recommends that steps are taken to reform legislation in this area where this is deemed to be appropriate.</p>

            <p eId="para_5532">The RAPID Programme aims to ensure that priority attention is given by Departments and statutory agencies to tackling the spatial concentration of poverty and social exclusion within designated RAPID areas.</p>
            <p eId="para_5533">Following a review in 2006, I am in the process of re-focussing the programme around seven strategic themes: family support, community safety &amp; anti-social behaviour, health, physical environment, youth support, education and employment &amp; training.</p>
            <p eId="para_5534">A key mechanism for the programme is the RAPID Area Implementation Team (AIT) in each RAPID area, made up of relevant statutory, local and community interests and co-ordinated by the relevant local authority. These groups identify local priorities to be addressed by the individual lead Departments and agencies under the programme.</p>
            <p eId="para_5535">Deputies will be aware that it is the role of my Department, supported by Pobal to co-ordinate the implementation of the RAPID programme. It is, therefore, a matter for lead Departments to report on the implementation of the programme regarding proposals that fall within their remit.</p>
            <p eId="para_5536">I recently announced a Government decision to include five new areas in the RAPID Programme: Ballina, Co. Mayo; Dungarvan, Co. Waterford; Enniscorthy, Co. Wexford; Mullingar, Co. Westmeath and Rathkeale, Co. Limerick.  This brings the number of designated RAPID areas from 46 up to 51. These changes follow an independent review of the findings of the 2006 Census returns. My Department is in consultation with the Department of Environment, Heritage and Local Government regarding the implementation of the decision.</p>
            <p eId="para_5537">Separately, in 2004 I introduced the RAPID Leverage Schemes to support mainly small-scale projects identified locally by the Area Implementation Teams in each of the RAPID areas.  Under these schemes my Department co-funds initiatives by lead agencies that focus on estate enhancement, graffiti removal, traffic calming, community closed-circuit television, health and sports facilities, and the provision of playgrounds and multi-use games areas.  In addition Dormant Accounts funding in support of priority projects in RAPID areas has been available in recent years.

The rates of child benefit have increased significantly since 2001 having trebled for the first two children and increased by over 185% for the third and subsequent children.  Expenditure on child benefit grew from just under €965 million in 2001 to nearly €2.5 billion in 2008 as a result of the increase in rates and growth in the number of eligible children.</p>

I am aware of the difficulties that some free travel pass holders have in accessing public transport and my officials have discussed this issue with the Commission for Taxi Regulation. Various alternatives to the existing system, including the use of vouchers, have been examined. A study, "A Review of the Free Schemes", published in 2000 by the Policy Institute, Trinity College Dublin, concluded that a voucher type system, which would be open to a wide range of transport providers including taxis and hackneys, would be extremely difficult to administer, open to abuse and unlikely to be sufficient to afford an acceptable amount of travel.

            <p eId="para_5561">Details of suspected fraud can be given in any of the following ways: a.by post: to Central Control Section, DSFA, Shannon Lodge, Carrick- on-Shannon, Co Leitrim; b.by email: to the Department at central.control@welfare.ie or c. by phone: (01) 704 300, ask for Central Control Section or (071) 9672648.  We have publicised these contact details in the media and they are available on the Department's website. It is clear from the huge increase in anonymous reports made by the public to date this year (714% increase on the same period in 2008) that the public is aware of the importance of reporting cases of suspected fraud.</p>
            <p eId="para_5562">In light of this it is questionable whether a media campaign would provide value given the cost involved. However this will be kept under review.  I am committed to ensuring that social welfare payments are available to those who are entitled to them.</p>
            <p eId="para_5563">The control programme of the Department is carefully monitored, and the various measures are continuously refined to ensure that they remain effective.</p>

He has appealed this decision and his file was forwarded to a Social Welfare Inspector for re-examination of his means. The inspector will be in touch with him shortly in this regard. Under Social Welfare legislation decisions in relation to claims must be made by Deciding Officers and Appeals Officers. These officers are statutorily appointed and I have no role in regard to making such decisions.</p>

I recently met with representatives of the trustees of this company's pension scheme and understand their concerns. On foot of discussions, I undertook that my officials would liaise with the Department of Enterprise Trade and Employment in relation to the matters raised. My officials will notify the representatives of the trustees in due course.</p>
            <p eId="para_5786">I would like to reiterate that recent changes to the Pensions Act do provide for a more equitable distribution of assets of pension schemes which wind up in deficit and this may benefit those current and former members of the company who have not yet reached retirement age.</p>

            <p eId="para_5788">There are over 600 staff in the Department at local regional and national level whose work involves some element of control activity in relation to the prevention, detection, deterrence of fraud and pursuit and recovery of overpayments. This number includes 392 Inspectors serving in the Department of which 88 Inspectors are attached to the Department's Special Investigation Unit (SIU).</p>
            <p eId="para_5789">The Inspectors' remit includes investigation of claims to all means tested payments to ensure the conditions regarding entitlement are satisfied, the review of such payments to ensure ongoing entitlement to same and the combating of fraud and abuse of all the schemes administered by the Department.  The SIU is the Department's dedicated fraud investigation unit, and Inspectors attached to the SIU are involved full time in control work and in the investigation of fraud, including the preparation of cases for legal proceedings where appropriate.</p>
            <p eId="para_5790">Arising from the increase in the Live Register and due to the extra demands being made on the resources of the Social Welfare Inspectorate, it was decided in January 2009 to increase the number of Inspectors by 16.  More recently, it was decided in May to assign a further 24 Inspectors and the recruitment process for these posts is currently in train.</p>
            <p eId="para_5791">In relation to measures to combat fraud in border regions, the Special Investigation Unit is actively engaged in control work across the country, not just in border regions. Clearly, however, the border regions have the additional risk of people living in another jurisdiction claiming benefits in this country and activities in these areas incorporate measures to combat this. These measures include stronger preventative measures at claim stage in the case of people with a former address in Northern Ireland which involves a home visit in all such cases and a series of residency checks, during the lifetime of the claim. The Department also engages in multi-agency vehicle checkpoints with other agencies, including the Gardaí and Revenue Commissioners. These checkpoints can identify people travelling from across the border to claim in this jurisdiction.</p>
            <p eId="para_5792">I am committed to ensuring that effective controls against possible abuses of the Social Welfare system are in place. This issue is kept under constant review and additional measures will be implemented where required.</p>

This figure is reduced by a child disregard of €254.00 leaving a balance of €7,546.00. This amount is then assessed at 70%, giving an annual means of €5,282.20. Accordingly, her weekly means, derived from farm income, are assessed at €101.58. She has also been assessed with a bank deposit (capital value) of €28,759.92, €20,000.00 of which is disregarded and the balance assessed at a weekly rate of €1.00 per thousand euro, rounded down to the nearest thousand. This results in a weekly means derived from capital of €8.00.</p>

            <p eId="para_5867">The Defence Forces are obliged to carry out the procurement of food products in an open and transparent manner and in line with National and EU Public Procurement Guidelines.  The Defence Forces have absolutely no discretion in this regard.</p>
            <p eId="para_5868">The previous contract for the provision of fresh poultry products for the Defence Forces expired on 31 May 2009.  In anticipation of this deadline, an open tender competition was advertised on the Department of Finance's e-tenders website and published in the Official Journal of the European Union in February 2009.</p>
            <p eId="para_5869">The tender documentation indicated that the contract would run over a period of two years and that a potential tenderer could tender for any or all of the 18 Defence Forces locations throughout the State.  The closing date for the receipt of tenders was 7 May 2009.</p>
            <p eId="para_5870">A total of nine tenders were received and a three person Defence Forces Evaluation Team evaluated the tenders.  The contract was subsequently awarded to Crossgar Food Products, County Down on the basis of cost.  The contract value is in the region of €350k over two years.</p>
            <p eId="para_5871">All poultry products provided by Crossgar Food Products under the contract are produced on the island of Ireland.  The chickens are reared by individual poultry farmers in Northern Ireland.  When ready for slaughter they are then processed by O'Kane Poultry, based in Northern Ireland, who have Board Bia certification.  I am advised that the Defence Forces are fully satisfied that the poultry products from Crossgar Food Products are fully certified in all respects and that the products meet the required Irish, English and EU specifications.</p>

            <p eId="para_5873">The Government decision on decentralisation provides for the transfer of the Department's Dublin-based civil service staff, together with a number of military personnel, to Newbridge, Co. Kildare and for the decentralisation of the Defence Forces Headquarters (DFHQ) to the Curragh.</p>
            <p eId="para_5874">The number to be relocated to Newbridge is approximately 200 civil service posts together with some 60 military personnel.  A further approximately 410 military personnel are to decentralise to the new Defence Forces Headquarters (DFHQ) building in the Curragh.</p>
            <p eId="para_5875">While the procurement of the new building at the Curragh is a matter for the OPW in the first instance, I wish to inform the Deputy that a state owned site has been chosen for a new building.  In April 2009, the OPW received Expressions of Interest from contractors who wish to be invited to tender for the project, and these applications are currently being evaluated by the OPW.  The OPW hope to be in a position to proceed to tender in July 2009 with the expectation that work can commence on the project in the first quarter of 2010.  It is estimated that the project will take approximately 18 months to complete.</p>

            <p eId="para_5877">I am satisfied that each of the services, Army, Air Corps and Naval Service are fully equipped to meet the roles assigned to them by Government.</p>
            <p eId="para_5878">On the issue of training, I am satisfied that military training techniques are up to date in all respects.  Defence Forces training plans are structured to provide the capabilities needed to execute the roles assigned to them by Government under the White Paper on Defence of February 2000.  The challenges of preparing military units for participation in overseas missions constitute the major dimension of Defence Forces collective training.  The primary focus of this training is the attainment of a capability for military interoperability in order to conduct overseas operations to international standards.</p>
            <p eId="para_5879">Significant investment has taken place in recent years across all facets and elements of the Defence Forces.  This investment has been assisted by pay savings arising from the reduction in the strength of the Permanent Defence Force in the context of the White Paper of 2000, which have been fully re-invested in the provision of equipment and infrastructure for the Defence Forces.  The level of investment has ensured that Defence Force's personnel have the most modern and effective range of equipment to carry our their day-to-day roles both at home and overseas and for training purposes.</p>

            <p eId="para_5944">In the five-year period 2004 to date in 2009, the strength of the Army and Naval Reserves (there are no reservists serving with the Air Corps) decreased from 12,767 on 31 December 2004 to 7,461 on 30 April 2009.</p>
            <p eId="para_5945">This decline in numbers coincides with the launch of the Reserve Defence Force Review Implementation Plan which was formally launched in July 2004 and provides for the phased enhancement of Reserve capabilities over the period to the end of 2009.</p>
            <p eId="para_5946">The plan sets out the proposed establishment of the Reserve.  The establishment of the Non-Integrated element of the Reserve was set at 9,692.  This establishment came into force in October 2005 when the Reserve was re-organised.</p>
            <p eId="para_5947">In addition, the plan provides for the development of an Integrated element of the Army Reserve with a proposed establishment of 2,656 personnel.  In line with the plan, a pilot Integration project was initiated in 2007 and whilst numbers participating were less than expected, valuable lessons were learned.</p>
            <p eId="para_5948">I have previously acknowledged that numbers in the Reserve have declined over recent years.  This trend in reduced volunteerism is not confined to the Reserve but is indicative of broader societal trends.  It should also be noted that, as part of the implementation process, a more rigorous approach is now taken to removing the names of non-effective personnel from Unit rolls.  This accounts for part of the apparent fall in numbers over recent years.</p>
            <p eId="para_5949">In the context of the Government decision on the implementation of savings measures on public service numbers and the reduced budgetary provision available for 2009, all recruitment to the Reserve Defence Force (RDF) was suspended.  Following a subsequent review and examination of RDF personnel numbers and budgets for 2009, I was satisfied that there is sufficient provision to allow for paid training for existing members of the Reserve this year.</p>
            <p eId="para_5950">Accordingly, on 19 May last I announced that limited recruitment to fill vacancies arising due to existing Reserve members resigning, or being discharged this year in the normal manner could proceed.  The numbers recruited will depend on the numbers leaving.  This limited recruitment will be monitored and kept under review in the light of the uptake of paid training within the RDF and the future budgetary provision.</p>

            <p eId="para_5954">Ireland participated in the Nordic Battlegroup (NBG), which was on standby from 1 January 2008 to 30 June 2008.  The other members of the Nordic Battlegroup were Sweden, acting as Framework Nation, Finland, Norway and Estonia.  The Defence Forces contribution to the NBG was an Explosive Ordnance Disposal and Improvised Explosive Device Disposal (EOD/IEDD) contingent with its own security detail.  Battlegroups have been on standby in the European Union since 1 January 2007.  To date no Battlegroup has been deployed.</p>
            <p eId="para_5955">With regard to Ireland's participation in future Battlegroups, we are committed in principle to participation in the Nordic Battlegroup (NBG), which will be on stand-by for the first six (6) months of 2011.  Other contributors to the Nordic Battlegroup are Sweden, acting as Framework Nation, Finland, Norway and Estonia.</p>
            <p eId="para_5956">Informal discussions have also taken place between staff in the Department of Defence and representatives from Austria, Germany, Czech Republic, Croatia and the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia (FYROM) regarding Ireland's possible participation in the proposed Austrian/German Battlegroup.  This Battlegroup will be on stand-by for the second six (6) months of 2012.  Government approval will be required before participation in either Battlegroup is finalised.</p>
            <p eId="para_5957">There are no proposals at this time to participate in any other battlegroup or rapid response forces.  Among the objectives of the EU battlegroup is to be able to respond in support of a UN mission, to act as an initial entry force or to reinforce an existing mission.  While no battlegroup has been deployed to date, all ESDP military missions launched by the European Union have been in support of the UN and under a UN mandate.</p>

            <from>Minister for Defence (Deputy Willie O’Dea)</from>
            <p eId="para_6077">I propose to take Questions Nos 376, 377 and 383 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_6078">Ireland has offered, through the UN Standby Arrangements System (UNSAS), to provide up to 850 military personnel for overseas service at any one time.  This figure equates to some 10% of Ireland's standing Army (excluding Reserves) and demonstrates Ireland's commitment to the cause of international peace.  This is the maximum sustainable commitment that Ireland can make to overseas peacekeeping operations.</p>
            <p eId="para_6079">Ireland is currently contributing 759 Defence Forces personnel to 13 different missions throughout the world.  Full details of all personnel currently serving overseas are listed in the tabular statement below.</p>
            <p eId="para_6080">The main overseas missions, in which Defence Forces personnel are currently deployed, are the United Nations Mission in the Central African Republic and Chad (MINURCAT) with 418 personnel, the NATO-led International Security presence (KFOR) in Kosovo with 239 personnel and the EU-led operation in Bosnia and Herzegovina, ALTHEA, with 44 personnel.  Other personnel are serving as monitors and observers with the United Nations and the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE).  Staff are also deployed at the organisational headquarters of the EU, OSCE and NATO.</p>
            <p eId="para_6081">The commitment to MINURCAT will be for an initial period of 1 year to 14 March 2010.  Subject to the renewal of the mandate, a satisfactory review of the mission and available resources, I would propose, subject to Government approval, to extend the Defence Forces participation on a year to year basis thereafter.  Participation by the Defence Forces in the NATO-led International Security presence (KFOR) in Kosovo is reviewed by the Government on an annual basis.  Later this Month, I propose to bring proposals to Government to extend the Defence Forces participation in this mission for a further twelve months from July 2009.</p>
            <p eId="para_6082">EUFOR's Operation "ALTHEA" in Bosnia and Herzegovina is expected to change from its current configuration of some 2,200 troops, to a support and training operation, which will involve some 200 military personnel.  The timelines for the transition to a training operation and the subsequent drawing-down of the Operation ALTHEA Force will be discussed at the next Peace Implementation Council meeting, scheduled to take place in late June 2009.  Once agreed, the transition should take approximately six (6) to nine (9) months to complete.  Irish troops will continue to serve in Bosnia and Herzegovina until the current Government approval expires in December 2009.</p>
            <p eId="para_6083">With regard to future deployments, Ireland receives requests, from time to time, in relation to participation in various missions and these are considered on a case-by-case basis.  In response to a recent request from the European Union, the Government approved the deployment of two (2) naval service personnel, for a period of up to 6 months, to the Operational Headquarters (based in Northwood in the UK) of the EU-led anti-piracy operation Atalanta off the coast of Somalia.</p>

            <p eId="para_6167">I would refer the Deputy to his previous question of 10th March 2009 which stated that "a Government decision, on 15 July 1998, approved a programme of closure and disposal of six barracks considered surplus to military requirements.  The barracks in question were located at Ballincollig, Fermoy, Naas, Castleblayney, Kildare, and Islandbridge, Dublin.</p>
            <p eId="para_6168">Five of these properties have been disposed of with net receipts as follows: Murphy Barracks, Ballincollig €44.5 million, Fitzgerald Camp, Fermoy €973,889, Devoy Barracks, Naas €9.3 million, Castleblayney Barracks €761,843, and Clancy Barracks, Islandbridge €25.4 million.</p>
            <p eId="para_6169">The Government decided on 1 July 2003 that Magee Barracks, Kildare would be among the State lands released to Kildare County Council for inclusion in the Sustaining Progress Affordable Housing Initiative.  My Department is currently finalising contracts with the Chief State Solicitor's Office.  There is no financial consideration in relation to the transfer of this property.</p>
            <p eId="para_6170">The Government decision of 14 October 2008 approved a programme for consolidation of Defence Forces formations and the closure of a further four barracks at Monaghan, Longford, Rockhill and Lifford in Donegal. It is anticipated that these barracks, which closed in January 2009, will be disposed of, taking account of market conditions, so as to maximise the return to the Defence Forces and generate funding for reinvestment in Defence Forces equipment and infrastructure in accordance with Government policy."</p>

            <p eId="para_6172">Emergency planning in this country is developed on the ‘lead department' principle. This means that each department is responsible for planning for emergencies that fall within its area of responsibility. National emergency plans are in place for a number of specific emergency scenarios such as a nuclear incident or an influenza pandemic.</p>
            <p eId="para_6173">The Framework for Major Emergency Management is the document that sets out a structure enabling the Principal Response Agencies (An Garda Síochána, the Health Service Executive and Local Authorities) to prepare for, and make a coordinated response to, major emergencies resulting from events such as fires, transport accidents, hazardous substance incidents and severe weather. As Chairman of the Government Task Force on Emergency Planning I receive regular updates from the National Steering Group on progress made in the implementation of the Framework.</p>
            <p eId="para_6174">The Government Task Force for Emergency Planning supports coordination of emergency planning across departments and key agencies. The Task Force, which I chair, meets on a regular basis and there have been 60 meetings held since it was established in 2001. It provides a forum for sharing information and keeping emergency planning high on the agenda of all government departments.</p>
            <p eId="para_6175">In my role as Chairman of the Government Task Force on Emergency Planning, I make an Annual Report to Government on Emergency Planning.

While an Garda Síochána have the primary responsibility for law and order, one of the roles assigned to the Defence Forces is the provision of aid to the civil power, meaning in practice to assist, when requested, an Garda Síochána.

            <p eId="para_6200">I propose to take Questions Nos. 391, 393 and 402 to 405, inclusive, together.</p>
            <p eId="para_6201">The applicable interest rate paid by local authority borrowers on fixed rates is set by reference to prevailing fixed interest rates at the time of loan draw down. The rate for 5 year fixed term loans will be reduced from 5.5% to 4.4% as of 1 July, while the variable rate charged to borrowers is currently 2.25%. The loans in respect of which interest rates in excess of 10% apply were issued by local authorities prior to 1991 and reflect the long-term costs of the funds to the Housing Finance Agency (HFA) prevailing at the time these loans were advanced. Rates were fixed for the life of the loan (generally 25 — 30 years).  The introduction of variable interest rates for local authority mortgages provided borrowers with increased flexibility and choice.</p>
            <p eId="para_6202">Borrowers with these long term fixed rate local authority mortgages, which are no longer available, are permitted to redeem such loans without any interest rate penalty and refinance them in the private sector.  This represents a significant concession, having regard to the redemption penalties (of up to six months interest or more), applied by commercial lending agencies in the event of early redemption of such mortgages. In 2001, the position regarding high fixed interest rates on local authority loans was reviewed in consultation with the Department of Finance. This review determined that a State subsidy to reduce such interest rates would not be appropriate.</p>
            <p eId="para_6203">Local authorities may allow borrowers with shorter 5-year fixed rate mortgages to redeem early, or convert to a variable rate within the fixed 5-year period.  However, in line with practice in the private sector, the HFA requires that it must be compensated for any losses it may suffer through prepayment of or conversion from a fixed loan.  Breakage costs incurred by the Agency will therefore be charged to local authorities, who, in turn will charge the borrowers wishing to redeem or convert. My Department will be issuing further guidance to local authorities on this issue in the coming days.</p>

            <p eId="para_6206">I propose to take Questions Nos. 392 and 417 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_6207">In February 2009, my Department set out details of the financial requirements for local authorities relating to the overall management of their capital and current accounts. These arise from the requirements for Government finances as a whole to be managed in accordance with the Stability and Growth Pact established under the Maastricht Treaty, and the associated limitation on budget deficits. This is not a new requirement for 2009, but current economic and budgetary considerations require all sectors, including local authorities, to ensure effective control and management of public finances.</p>
            <p eId="para_6208">In order to stay within the overall limit for the General Government Balance, it is necessary for local authorities to manage their finances and to maintain their current and capital accounts broadly in balance for 2009. Within this general requirement, there is capability for borrowing by local authorities for capital infrastructure. To achieve the objective of the aggregate change in the General Government Balance, my Department is issuing loan sanctions allocated for capital projects on a prioritised basis.</p>
            <p eId="para_6209">Development contributions have been an important addition to the capital funding resource of local authorities but they are only one element.  Local authorities generate capital income from a variety of sources. The only restriction on local authorities is that in aggregate capital income equal capital expenditure in the year. There is no restriction on Councils spending Development Contributions as balance is only required at an overall level. These requirements do not conflict with the continuing emphasis on capital investment in necessary infrastructure critical to economic recovery and sustaining the economy at local level. The Government and local authorities will continue to progress capital investment projects that can maximise economic, social and environmental returns. Accordingly, the prioritisation of investment opportunities, and targeting of available resources to labour intensive activity and the support of economic recovery, will continue to be the key focus of capital expenditure in the local government sector.</p>
            <p eId="para_6210">My Department will continue to work closely with local authorities, including Fingal County Council, to ensure that within the overall financial limits to be met, decisions on these matters are taken in a way which gives the necessary prioritisation to environmental, economic and social infrastructure as part of the overall contribution to economic recovery.</p>

            <p eId="para_6215">Houses sold to first time buyers under the various affordable housing schemes at a significant discount from market value contain a clawback provision, in order to prevent short-term profit taking on the resale of the house, to the detriment of the objectives of the schemes.</p>
            <p eId="para_6216">As signalled by the Minister for Finance in Budget 2009, a new single streamlined scheme is to be introduced in relation to the sale of affordable housing. Under this new arrangement the purchase transaction will be largely unchanged from the affordable purchaser's perspective. However, instead of units being sold at a discounted price, with the value of the discount being subject to a reducing clawback, the State will take an equity stake in affordable units sold.

If such a location should become necessary, the masts and antennae should be designed and adapted for the specific location. In the vicinity of larger towns and in city suburbs, operators should endeavour to locate in industrial estates or in industrially zoned land. The guidelines further advise that, only as a last resort, and if all the alternatives are unavailable or unsuitable, should free-standing masts be located in a residential area or beside schools. Under Section 28 of the Planning and Development Act, 2000, planning authorities are required to have regard to any Ministerial guidelines, in the performance of their functions.

            <p eId="para_6232">I am aware that there is some public concern about the scale and nature of postering that arises around the time of elections/referenda.  On foot of this, I held a public consultation in autumn 2008 regarding the control of postering for elections and referenda. There were 117 submissions made, containing a variety of recommendations, including measures to restrict the proliferation of posters.</p>
            <p eId="para_6233">A number of local authorities pilot — tested voluntary measures in the recent local and European elections to assess the practical issues around introducing such restrictions.

This will inform any future policy development in this area.</p>

            <p eId="para_6243">A number of distinct issues are raised in the correspondence.</p>
            <p eId="para_6244">Section 30 of the Fire Services Act 1981 provides that every person who knowingly gives or causes to be given a false alarm (whether by means of a street fire alarm, a telephone communication, a direct statement, a message or otherwise) to a fire brigade maintained by a fire authority is guilty of an offence.</p>
            <p eId="para_6245">With regard to the issue of continuously sounding fire alarms from a noise nuisance perspective, there are a number of measures currently in place to deal with falsely activated alarms. It is open to local authorities under section 107 of the Environmental Protection Agency Act 1992 to require measures to be taken to prevent or limit noise causing nuisance from a premises.  The Environment Section of the local authority is the appropriate point of contact in this regard.</p>
            <p eId="para_6246">Under the Environmental Protection Agency Act 1992, it is open to any person, or group of persons to seek an order in the district court to have noise giving reasonable cause for annoyance abated. The procedures involved have been simplified to allow action to be taken without legal representation. A public information leaflet outlining the legal avenues open to persons experiencing noise nuisance is available at www.environ.ie</p>
            <p eId="para_6247">The Programme for Government contains a commitment to introduce comprehensive legislation on noise pollution within the lifetime of this Government.  The Government recently approved the drafting of a Noise Nuisance Bill with a view to its publication later in 2009.</p>
            <p eId="para_6248">With regard to the issue of abandoned cars, section 71 of the Waste Management Acts 1996 to 2008 prohibits the abandonment of vehicles on any land, creates an offence in this regard and enables local authorities to enter on any land upon which vehicles have been abandoned to remove and store such abandoned vehicles.  Such vehicles may subsequently become the property of the authority if not reclaimed by the registered owner within a period of four weeks.  Prosecution under the Waste Management Acts may result in fines of up to €3,000 and/or to a term of imprisonment not exceeding 12 months on foot of a summary conviction.</p>
            <p eId="para_6249">A local authority may also seek reimbursement of the costs for the removal and storage of abandoned vehicles from the registered owners of such vehicles.  For the purposes of the Acts, ‘abandoned', in relation to a vehicle, includes left in such circumstances or for such period that it is reasonable to assume that the vehicle has been abandoned.  In this context, local authorities have reasonable discretion when determining whether or not a vehicle has been abandoned and may take a number of factors into consideration.</p>
            <p eId="para_6250">Section 32(1) of the Acts also provides that a person should not hold, transport, recover or dispose of waste in a manner that causes or is likely to cause environmental pollution.  In broad terms, this imposes a general duty of care on the registered owner of a vehicle to arrange for its disposal at end-of-life in an environmentally sound manner (i.e. by transferring it to an authorised treatment facility which has been permitted for the disposal of end-of-life vehicles).</p>
            <p eId="para_6251">Where an abandoned vehicle, which has been removed and stored by a local authority for the period prescribed in the Acts, is not reclaimed by the registered owner and the local authority decides to dispose of the vehicle, then the vehicle concerned becomes an end-of-life vehicle within the meaning of the Waste Management (End-of-Life Vehicles) Regulations 2006 and must be deposited at an authorised treatment facility for appropriate treatment and recovery.</p>
            <p eId="para_6252">Finally, on the issue of planting trees in urban areas, this is a matter, in the first instance, for each local authority. I understand that local authorities engage in tree planting programmes, especially during National Tree Week, in conjunction with the Tree Council of Ireland.</p>

            <p eId="para_6258">My Department directed all local authorities, in line with Government policy on reducing Public Sector pay costs, that travel and subsistence rates and all allowances based on travel and subsistence rates were being reduced by 25% with effect from 12 March 2009.</p>
            <p eId="para_6259">Local authorities were also reminded of their responsibilities to ensure that only essential travel is undertaken; that the number of employees travelling for official purposes is kept to a minimum and that expenditure on travel and subsistence should be critically appraised and monitored. My Department did not impose a cap on travel and subsistence.</p>
            <p eId="para_6260">Under section 159 of the Local Government Act 2001, each County and City Manager is responsible for staffing and organisational arrangements necessary for carrying out the functions of the local authorities for which he or she is responsible. Accordingly, arrangements regarding payment of allowances unrelated to travel and subsistence are a matter for each local authority.</p>

            <from>Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government (Deputy John Gormley)</from>
            <p eId="para_6304">Litter is a scourge on our landscape and, apart from the substantial clean up costs incurred by local authorities, there can be negative consequences for society at large.  I am pleased that recent results from Irish Business against Litter (IBAL) and the soon to be published results from my Department National Litter Pollution Monitoring System (NLPMS) point to a steady reduction in litter levels across the country.  IBAL reported last week that 68% of areas monitored are now ‘Clean to European Norms', up from 14% in 2002.  This statistic is reflected in the 2008 NLPMS report which shows that 68% of areas surveyed displayed high levels of cleanliness compared to 48% in 2002.</p>
            <p eId="para_6305">The NLPMS has been in operation for 10 years and has generated a considerable body of data on litter levels and causes nationwide over that time, with over 5000 separate surveys per annum now being collated from local authorities by the Litter Monitoring Body.  This information is a very valuable tool in the ongoing efforts of both my Department and local authorities to tackle the litter problem, allowing planners to allocate resources in a more effective, targeted manner.  It has also enabled us to evaluate the success of the initiatives being undertaken on litter levels countrywide.</p>
            <p eId="para_6306">Education is a key component in resolving our litter problem; it is crucial that we continue to foster an attitude across society that views littering as unacceptable.  My Department supports a number of anti-litter initiatives which are enjoying increasing success in achieving this objective. National Spring Clean motivated almost 500,000 volunteers across Ireland to take part in litter-picking activities in April, while the Green Schools Programme, which has litter control as a core activity, has achieved a high level of success.  Other initiatives supported by my Department, such as TidyTowns, the Protecting Uplands and Rural Environments (PURE) project, the Blue Flag  Awards and the Clean Coasts initiatives also involve litter clean-up actions.</p>
            <p eId="para_6307">These are in addition to the enforcement, clean-up and public awareness work undertaken by the local authorities.  The total amount granted to local authorities by my Department for anti-litter and anti-graffiti awareness initiatives is in excess of €8.7 million since the Litter Pollution Act was introduced in 1997.  I am satisfied that our response to Ireland's litter problem is achieving the desired result and my Department will continue to keep our anti-litter activities under constant review.</p>

        <b>Deputy Liz McManus</b>
         asked the 
        <b>Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government</b>
         his views on the difficulties faced by building energy rating contractors who have invested significant amounts in training, insurance and registration and who are faced with low take up of BER certificates; the number of BER contractors and the amount of BER certificate applications since the beginning of the scheme; the steps he will take to ensure further take up of this scheme; if he will introduce a waiver for registration for persons who are unemployed; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

            <from>Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government (Deputy John Gormley)</from>
            <p eId="para_6312">I propose to take Questions Nos. 421 and 424 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_6313">There are currently some 2,700 persons registered with Sustainable Energy Ireland (SEI) as Building Energy Rating (BER) assessors for dwellings with some 270 registered as BER assessors for buildings other than dwellings.  At present there are some 50,000 Building Energy Rating (BER) certificates in place in respect of dwellings and almost 1,000 BER certificates in place for buildings other than dwellings.</p>
            <p eId="para_6314">While a significant level of BER activity is taking place, it is clear that the number of registered assessors for dwellings is far higher than is required to meet current and anticipated demand for BER certificates in the market place.  There are no proposals under consideration by my Department at present in relation to the waiver of registration fees in respect of unemployed persons who are interested in becoming BER assessors.</p>
            <p eId="para_6315">I understand that SEI strongly advises that applicants for registration review the number of BER assessors who are already servicing their intended target area in order to ensure that they are satisfied with the potential business opportunity before investing money in registering with SEI.  A database of all registered BER assessors, searchable by county, is included on SEI's webpages (www.sei.ie).</p>
            <p eId="para_6316">The BER Certificate is accompanied by an advisory report outlining a number of improvements that might be made to improve the energy efficiency of the building but there is no obligation on a landlord to carry out any of the recommended improvements.  The BER certificate and advisory report serve to enable prospective tenants to take the energy performance of a building into account when making decisions in relation to lettings and to compare in a standard format the energy performance of a range of buildings available to them.  In this way it is intended that the BER system will promote greater awareness of energy efficiency in the property market and encourage building owners to take cost effective steps to improve the energy rating, and hence the overall energy performance, of such buildings.</p>
            <p eId="para_6317">In relation to the steps being taken to encourage BER activity in the market place I refer to the reply to Question Nos. 372 and 377 of 28 April 2009.  The planned media campaign previously referred to is currently underway.  My Department will continue to work closely with the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, SEI and the 37 local Building Control Authorities to promote awareness of the obligations which arise under the Regulations.</p>

            <p eId="para_6320">I propose to take Questions Nos. 422 and 423 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_6321">In the period 2008-2012, Ireland is required to meet a challenging greenhouse gas emission reduction target under the Kyoto Protocol; this target is binding in international law.  In addition, by 2020, Ireland is committed under the EU climate and energy package agreed in December 2008 to achieve a 20% reduction on 2005 levels of greenhouse gas emissions in the sectors of the economy not covered by the EU emissions trading scheme.  This 20% target is binding in EU law, as will any adjustment to it in the light of the outcome to the Conference of the Parties to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change in Copenhagen later this year.  The question of national legislation on climate change will be considered in the context of the review of the Programme for Government.</p>
            <p eId="para_6322">The objective of the ongoing international negotiations under the Framework Convention on Climate Change is to reach agreement on a comprehensive global response to climate change at the Copenhagen conference.  Ireland fully supports the EU position set out in the conclusions adopted by the Council on 2 March 2009 and subsequently.  It is of the utmost importance that a new agreement is reached in Copenhagen in order to avoid any gap in the response to climate change when the Kyoto Protocol expires at the end of 2012.  A key element of an effective outcome at Copenhagen will be continued leadership by developed countries in tackling climate change and I believe that a new agreement must set binding post-2012 greenhouse gas emission limitation or reduction targets for developed countries.</p>
            <p eId="para_6323">The EU position in the international negotiations and the Irish Government's support is underpinned by the scientific advice from the InterGovernmental Panel on Climate change.  In its 4th Assessment Report, the Panel found that the warming of the climate system is unequivocal and that climate change currently contributes to the global burden of disease and premature deaths.  It also found that projected climate change-related exposures are likely to affect the health status of millions of people, particularly those least able to adapt to changing conditions.  This would be particularly evident in increased malnutrition; increased deaths, disease and injury due to heatwaves, floods, storms, fires and droughts; increased diarrheal disease; malaria and cardiorespiratory diseases.</p>
            <p eId="para_6324">I intend to participate in the Ministerial segment of the Copenhagen conference; the other members of the Irish delegation will be decided closer to the time.  While it is possible that the conference will be elevated to the level of Heads of State and Government, I am not aware of any decision to that effect and the issue of the Taoiseach attending does not therefore arise at this time.</p>

These include the Salmon and Trout Conservation (Draft Nets and Snap Nets)  Bye-law No. 856, 2009, which set out the opening and closing dates for the commercial fishing season and prohibits draft net and snap net fishing for (salmon and trout) in all districts other than those rivers mentioned in the bye-law.</p>

            <p eId="para_6409">In order to ensure the highest quality and safety standards of work for all homeowners in receipt of grants under the Home Energy Saving Scheme, Sustainable Energy Ireland (SEI) has set a number of conditions which contractors must meet, in order to be registered to carry out works under the Scheme.  These conditions include a requirement to carry employers' liability insurance of €13 million and public/products Liability (PL) insurance of €6.5 million.</p>
            <p eId="para_6410">I am informed by SEI that the specified level of employers' liability insurance is the minimum level available in the Irish market, while the specified level of public/product liability insurance is the same as required of electricians to register with the Register of Electrical Contractors in Ireland (RECI).  SEI set these requirements on the advice of its insurance brokers and after consultation with stakeholders, including the Construction Industry Federation.  To date, over two thousand contractors have successfully registered with the Scheme.</p>

            <p eId="para_6412">In designing the National Broadband Scheme (NBS), which was approved by the EU Commission, my Department needed to strike a balance between reaching as many unserved premises as possible and minimising the impact of the scheme on businesses already providing broadband services in rural areas, thereby minimising market distortion in accordance with EU state aid rules.</p>
            <p eId="para_6413">EU State aid and competition rules govern how states can intervene in areas where there are existing service providers.  The nature of broadband networks is such that they provide a coverage footprint over a certain area rather than an individual link to isolated premises.  It was essential to guard against the NBS coverage footprint spilling over to an extent which would be unacceptable from a State aids perspective, onto surrounding areas already served by existing service providers.</p>
            <p eId="para_6414">Accordingly, to try to include individually unserved premises that are located within EDs deemed to be already served within the scope of the NBS would have given rise to an unacceptable level of market distortion and therefore, such areas had to be excluded.  My Department is examining how broadband could be made available to those remaining customers who for a variety of different reasons are in areas, which are not served by either the NBS or alternative coverage.</p>

            <p eId="para_6416">EirGrid, with the approval of the Government, is developing the East West Interconnector to schedule.  The Government is fully committed to the cost effective delivery of the interconnector in the interests of consumers as a key strategic energy infrastructure project.</p>
            <p eId="para_6417">The Government decided in 2006 that the interconnector will, as a national strategic asset, remain in public ownership and will be owned and operated by EirGrid.  The contract for the development of the East West interconnector was awarded to ABB on foot of an open, competitive tender process conducted by EirGrid under the regulatory oversight of the CER.  I am satisfied with EirGrid's assurance that the contract represents value for money and will ensure cost-effective delivery of the project to schedule.</p>
            <p eId="para_6418">The Government has also been advised by EirGrid and the Commission for Energy Regulation (CER) that over the lifetime of the interconnector, the benefits will more than outweigh the development costs.  The benefits for the economy, the energy market and consumers include:</p>
            <p eId="para_6419">Enhancing security of energy supply by delivering additional capacity to the all-island electricity market and linking it to the UK, which is in turn, connected to mainland European markets;</p>
            <p eId="para_6420">Underpinning delivery of Ireland's renewable generation targets by providing additional back-up at times of low wind and enabling the export of wind energy from Ireland at times of high wind generation;</p>
            <p eId="para_6421">Supporting further competition in the electricity market and exerting downward pressure on prices;</p>
            <p eId="para_6422">Diversifying the national fuel mix and supply sources by reducing our dependence on electricity generated from imported natural gas; and</p>
            <p eId="para_6423">Providing EirGrid, as the system operator, with important back-up and reserve services.</p>
            <p eId="para_6424">In a strong endorsement by the European Union, Ireland has secured €110 million for the East West Interconnector under the European Economic Recovery Plan.  This funding will be an important component of the overall financial package to the project.  In making cost comparisons it is the case that each electricity interconnector project is a unique development.  Interconnectors may vary in terms of capacity, length, diversity of terrain and the proportion of the project that is sub-sea or on land.</p>

            <p eId="para_6430">The Home Energy Saving Scheme, which I launched in February, has funding of €49m in 2009.  Already over 12,000 householders have been approved for grant aid under the scheme and there is potential for up to 30,000 householders to benefit from the range of energy efficient measures available by the end of the year.</p>
            <p eId="para_6431">It is important to strike an appropriate balance between value for money in relation to the cost of the investment in delivering energy efficiency savings measures and the value of those energy savings to the economy.  Sustainable Energy Ireland (SEI) has put in place a requirement that applicants to the scheme install measures attracting a minimum grant payment of €500.  The administrative cost to SEI of processing grants under the Scheme is relatively fixed, regardless of the amount of the grant payment concerned.  SEI has worked to keep the administrative costs of the scheme as low as possible.</p>
            <p eId="para_6432">The administrative cost of disbursing grants for relatively low cost measures such as attic insulation would be unacceptably high if these were permitted on their own.  It is likely that many householders would return to the scheme at a later date seeking support for other measures, giving rise to multiple administrative charges on the scheme.  The minimum grant threshold is designed to ensure value for money to the Exchequer, while encouraging homeowners to take a holistic approach from the outset to improving the energy efficiency of their homes.</p>

            <p eId="para_6434">Where the Department enters into contracts relating to exploration for or production of oil and gas, it does not revoke such contracts unless there is a breach of the contract terms by the other party.  The Department is actively engaged in promoting opportunities for exploration for oil and gas offshore Ireland with the aim of attracting an increased share of mobile international exploration investment to Ireland.  It is only by growing the level of exploration activity that Ireland will be able to properly benefit from its indigenous natural resources of oil and gas.</p>
            <p eId="para_6435">Where a commercial discovery is made and is then brought to development, the principal financial return to the State will be through the tax system.  Under the Finance Acts a special rate of corporation tax applies to profits from the production of oil and gas.  Profits are liable to tax at a rate of between 25% and 40%.</p>
            <p eId="para_6436">The current tax regime was given effect to through the 2008 Finance Act.  The changes made at that time resulted from a review of Ireland's licensing terms that was undertaken in 2007.  The regulatory framework put in place post the 2007 review reflects the fact that Ireland's Atlantic Margin is relatively under-explored and also reflects the high cost and technical challenges associated with undertaking exploration in the area.  Since 1970 some 128 wells have been drilled in Irish waters which, over the period have resulted  in four commercial discoveries.</p>

Where queries have arisen from homeowners regarding interpretation of the terms and conditions of the scheme, SEI has worked to include any necessary clarifications in additional or amended material.</p>
            <p eId="para_6439">One such clarification related to the requirement for homeowners to ensure that the measures they install represent an optimal solution in terms of both energy efficiency and value for money.  This matter was the subject of some correspondence to SEI, with both homeowners and contractors seeking clarification regarding so called ‘partial solutions'.  SEI's clarification on this subject has since been included in Scheme documentation and on its website.</p>
            <p eId="para_6440">In relation to insulation, contractors registered with the scheme are required to ensure that an optimal, whole-element solution is provided.  This means for example, that in order to avail of a grant for wall insulation, all exposed walls must normally be either internally or externally insulated as appropriate and for a grant for roof insulation, that the whole surface of the ceiling or roof space must normally be insulated.  Where only partial coverage is achieved, this must be detailed in the Declaration of Works returned to SEI with the claim for payment and the contractor should inform the homeowner that this may impact on their eligibility for a grant.</p>
            <p eId="para_6441">Partial solutions will only be accepted by SEI in exceptional cases, where it can be shown that a whole-element solution is either not physically or economically possible.  For example, it may not be physically possible to provide complete roof insulation coverage due to small inaccessible areas of the roof.  Internal dry-lining of all exposed walls in a particular dwelling may not be economically viable where it would require that kitchen units are removed.  Justification for these exceptional partial solutions must be given in the Declaration of Works.</p>
            <p eId="para_6442">The criterion of economic viability of a whole element solution, does not relate to the economic cost for the homeowner concerned but relates to the economic benefit of the solution in terms of energy and CO2 savings, versus the cost of works.  It is the case that some homeowners may not be in a position to afford the cost of insulating their entire home and may wish to insulate just one or two rooms.  However, the heat loss in such a situation through the un-insulated walls means that grant payment for such work could not be justified.</p>
            <p eId="para_6443">Those who cannot afford to insulate their homes may qualify to have works done at token cost under the Warmer Homes Scheme.  This scheme provides cavity wall and roof insulation, as well as draught-proofing measures, boiler lagging jacket and energy efficient lighting, to those in receipt of Fuel Allowance, Invalidity or Disability Benefit.  I have increased the budget available to the Warmer Homes Scheme to €20 million in 2009, including a contribution from Bord Gáis and ESB, and this level of funding will allow up to 15,000 low income homes to benefit from energy upgrades this year alone.</p>

            <p eId="para_6450">All marine aquaculture licences issued under the Fisheries (Amendment) Act, 1997 require a corresponding foreshore licence.  Section 19A(4) of that Act, as inserted by section 101 of the  Sea-Fisheries and Maritime Jurisdiction Act, 2006, provides that:</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_6451">A licensee who has applied for the renewal or further renewal of an aquaculture licence shall, notwithstanding the expiration of the period for which the licence was granted or renewed but subject otherwise to the terms and conditions of the licence, be entitled to continue the aquaculture or operations in relation to aquaculture authorised by the licence pending the decision on the said application.</p>
            <p eId="para_6452">Therefore, while the aquaculture licence and the foreshore licence may have expired the licensee is entitled to continue his activities pending a determination of the renewal application.</p>

            <p eId="para_6455">My Department has no direct contractual arrangements with the company named.  The company was engaged by Teagasc to develop the eREPS system.  The eREPS system is managed by Teagasc on my Department's behalf and is hosted by the company named, which continues to be responsible for maintaining the system and for introducing new functionalities as requested by my Department.  The eREPS is funded by my Department, and the total amount of funding provided for the development and enhancement of the system and for the hosting and support of the facility since 2005 is €1,494,413.  The current contract is for five years and expires in 2010.</p>
            <p eId="para_6456">eREPS is a useful tool to assist REPS planners in preparing REPS plans.  Planners use the facility free of charge in preparing plans. It obviates the need to purchase paper maps for the preparation of plans as access is provided to existing electronic maps and it assists by automatically calculating areas and other calculations, thereby reducing the scope for error.  In this way it minimises the effort required by the planner and consequently the fees that they must charge to farmers. eREPS was developed and is managed by Teagasc on behalf of the Department and is funded by the Department.</p>
            <p eId="para_6457">In general, the eREPS system has functioned well. The majority of REPS planners chose to use the system since its introduction and a large proportion of all REPS plans have been prepared using this facility.

There have been a number of specific problems with system this year, and Teagasc, on behalf of my Department, is pursuing these with the contractor.</p>

            <p eId="para_6533">In 2005, Ireland adopted a fully decoupled area based scheme, the Single Payment Scheme, which was based on the average monetary value of all subsidies paid to farmers during the reference period years (2000, 2001 &amp; 2002) divided by the average number of hectares held during these years. Under EU Regulations governing the implementation of the Single Payment Scheme, an applicant must declare an eligible hectare for each Single Payment entitlement held in order to benefit from the full Single Payment. This requirement was set out clearly in documentation provided to farmers each year since the introduction of the Single Payment Scheme in 2005.</p>
            <p eId="para_6534">In relation to commonage lands at Glenary, there is an ‘over-claim' involving various parties and the overall area of land claimed exceeds the area of land on the Commonage. In such circumstances the Department is obliged under EU legislation to establish who are the applicants with rights to claim the Single Payment Scheme.Payments in respect of Glenary and to ensure that each of the eligible applicants has an eligible hectare of land per entitlement claimed. Such ‘over-claims' have been common throughout Ireland in relation to commonages since the introduction of area based payments.</p>
            <p eId="para_6535">There have been many other disputes relating to commonages around the country and the vast majority of these have been resolved through a combination of involvement by this Department and the required flexibility from the parties involved. A similar approach was adopted in relation to Glenary as has been successful in resolving the vast majority of such disputes.</p>
            <p eId="para_6536">In anticipation of moving to this scheme, and having regard to the title/claims on this mountain, a public meeting was called to attempt to resolve the position in relation to Glenary. This was done at the behest of and in co-operation with all parties and a meeting was held in Clonmel, attended by all parties. Unfortunately, my Department's efforts at that meeting and subsequently have not yielded an agreement under which payments can issue.</p>
            <p eId="para_6537">My Department remains committed to resolving this matter in the same way as has proved successful in relation to other commonages throughout the Country.  I can confirm that parties who have requested in writing to be paid on their other land (while withdrawing without prejudice their claim to the unregistered portion of Glenary Commonage from their applications) have been paid on such areas only, pending a resolution of the overall dispute in relation to the Commonage. Some applicants have been able to prove their right to claim a small portion of the Commonage and have been paid accordingly.</p>

Due to the historical nature of the FEOGA scheme in so far as it relates to aquaculture and given staffing restrictions, it will take a period of weeks before the relevant information can be obtained from the archives.

            <p eId="para_6571">My Department's contribution to the Fallen Animals Scheme ceased with effect from Tuesday 14th April 2009. This was as a result of budgetary constraints and also reflects the greatly reduced incidence of BSE in this country. However I did provide continued financial support for the collection of certain dead animals, in particular bovines over 48 months of age, for sampling, as required under the ongoing national BSE surveillance programme.</p>
            <p eId="para_6572">The disposal of dead farm animals is subject to EU Regulations, notably Regulation (EC) No 1774 of 2002. These regulations require that animals, which die on-farm, must generally be disposed of through approved knackeries and rendering plants.  Farmers may continue to use the existing collection network or, in the alternative, may transport dead animals by prior arrangement to approved knackeries, provided they transport the carcasses in leak-proof, covered containers or vehicles.</p>
            <p eId="para_6573">Burial of fallen animals is only permissible under licence in remote areas i.e. islands and listed mountain/bogland areas. Farmers who wish to bury animals on-farm should apply to their local District Veterinary Office for a burial licence.  It is also a legal requirement on all keepers of bovine animals to notify movements of all bovines (live or dead) off their holdings to my Department.  With the ending of the Fallen Animals Scheme the cost of collection and rendering for animals not covered by the new scheme is now a matter for negotiation between the individual collectors/rendering plants and their customers.</p>
            <p eId="para_6574">Within the boundaries of legal requirements my Department is making every effort to facilitate measures to maximise flexibility and enable reduction of costs in the rendering/collection system. This includes allowing cross border trade, permitting direct delivery by farmers to authorised plants, considering removal of some costs currently built into the rendering process and encouraging indigenous use of meat and bone meal (MBM) for energy.</p>

            <p eId="para_6586">I propose to take Questions Nos. 468, 469, 508 and 534 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_6587">I am committed to providing information in relation to the allocation of teachers to schools and as a new feature on my Department's website. The process has begun with the provision earlier this year of initial information on the allocation of mainstream classroom teachers to primary schools under the revised schedule for 2009/10.  In terms of the position at individual primary school level the key factor for determining the level of resources provided by my Department is the pupil enrolment at 30 September 2008. The annual process of seeking this enrolment data from schools took place in the autumn and the data has since been received and processed in my Department enabling the commencement of the processes by which teaching resources are allocated to schools for the school year that begins next September.</p>
            <p eId="para_6588">My Department has written to the primary schools that are projected to have a net loss or gain in classroom teaching posts in September, 2009. As part of my efforts to ensure that relevant information is openly available to the public detailed information on the opening position for primary schools is published on my Department's website. This provisional list sets out the details on individual schools that, taken collectively, are projected to gain 128 posts and to lose 382 posts — a net reduction of 254 posts. It is my intention to have this information updated and ultimately to set out the final position when the allocation processes are completed.</p>
            <p eId="para_6589">The final position for any one school will depend on a number of other factors such as additional posts for schools that are developing rapidly and posts allocated as a result of the appeals processes. The operation of redeployment arrangements also impacts on the final position as a teacher can remain in his or her existing school where a suitable redeployment position does not exist.  The final staffing position for all schools will therefore not be known until the autumn. At that stage the allocation process will be fully completed for mainstream classroom teachers and appeals to the Staffing Appeals Board will have been considered.</p>
            <p eId="para_6590">I understand that the schools referred to by the Deputies submitted an appeal to the Primary Staffing Appeal Board. Following consideration of each case at its meeting on 14 May 2009, the Board refused the appeals. The Boards of Management of the schools referred to have been notified in this regard. The primary Staffing Appeal Board operates independently of the Department and its decision is final.</p>

The lack of progression of the site issue was impeded as the initial search for a greenfield site in the area had not been successful.

            <p eId="para_6618">I wish to advise the Deputy that my Department has considered the  correspondence submitted by the schools in question appealing the decision to  suppress a class for pupils with a Mild General Learning Disability (MGLD) in  each school. My Department recently advised both schools that the decision to  suppress the classes remains.</p>
            <p eId="para_6619">All children with MGLD who are in the classes being suppressed will be able to  receive teaching support through the teaching resources allocated to primary  schools under the General Allocation Model. Schools decide themselves how best  to use this allocation based on the needs of the pupils and how to adjust their  support in line with the changing needs of pupils as they mature. My Department  provided a circular SP ED 02/05 to schools to assist them in deploying the  General Allocation Model resources.</p>
            <p eId="para_6620">There may be instances where children who are enrolled in a MGLD classes fall  within the low incidence disability category. These children may qualify for  resource teaching support through the National Council for Special Education  (NCSE) and it is open to the schools to liaise with the local Special  Educational Needs Organiser (SENO) in this regard.</p>
            <p eId="para_6621">My Department promotes a continuum of assessment and intervention. These  interventions range from support from the classroom teacher and support from  the resource / learning support teacher. Where a school considers that these  interventions are not meeting the child's needs they should seek the advice of  their National Educational Psychological Service (NEPS) psychologist. Schools  without an assigned NEPS psychologist can avail of the Scheme for Commissioning  Psychological Assessments. Advice may also be sought from the local Special  Educational Needs Organiser.</p>

            <from>Minister for Education and Science (Deputy Batt O’Keeffe)</from>
            <p eId="para_6635">I have consistently said that the 2009 Budget required difficult choices to be made across all areas of public expenditure. These decisions were made to  control public expenditure and to ensure sustainability in the long run. In  this respect Education, while protected to a much greater extent than most  other areas of public expenditure, could not be totally spared. The various  impacts at school level were included in the Budget day announcements and in  view of the ominous financial circumstances that we are facing I am not in a  position to reverse any of the decisions taken.</p>
            <p eId="para_6636">Teacher allocations to all second-level schools are approved annually by my  Department in accordance with established rules based on recognised pupil  enrolment. In accordance with these rules each school is required to organise  its subject options within the limit of its approved teacher allocation. The  deployment of teaching staff, the range of subjects offered and ultimately the  quality of teaching and learning are in the first instance a matter for the  Board of Management of the school.</p>
            <p eId="para_6637">In accordance with existing arrangements, where a school management authority  is unable to meet its curricular commitments within its approved allocation, my  Department considers applications for additional short term support i.e.  curricular concessions. This concession is available as a short term support to  enable essential curricular provision to continue. An application for  curricular concessions was received in my Department from the school referred  to by the Deputy. The school has been notified of the outcome.</p>
            <p eId="para_6638">The allocation processes also include appellate mechanisms under which schools  can appeal against their allocation of teachers. The Board of Management of a  school can submit an appeal under certain criteria to an independent Appeal  Board which was established specifically to adjudicate on appeals on staffing  allocations in post — primary schools. This Board operates independently of my  Department. The school in question did not lodge an appeal.</p>
            <p eId="para_6639">Discrete allocations are also made to schools to cater for pupils with Special  Educational Needs and those with Language difficulties for example. The National Council for Special Education (NCSE) is responsible through its  network of local Special Education Needs Organisers (SENOs), for allocating  Special Needs Assistants (SNAs) to schools to support children with special  needs. The NCSE operates within my Department's criteria in allocating such  support. All schools have the names and contact details of their local SENO.  Parents may also contact their local SENO directly to discuss their child's  special educational needs, using the contact details available on www.ncse.ie.</p>

            <p eId="para_6644">I have already signalled that it is not my intention to recommend that any new  form of student contribution should be introduced before 2010.  In the event  that it is decided to introduce a form of student contribution from a future  point, such arrangements would also apply, from that time, to those students  who would have entered higher education this year i.e. 2009.</p>

            <p eId="para_6676">The State Examinations Commission has statutory responsibility for operational matters relating to the certificate examinations including the publication of the timetable for the oral, practical and written examinations.</p>
            <p eId="para_6677">The leaving certificate examination timetable is developed and finalised each year following extensive consultation with all of the education partners involved, including representatives of school management bodies, teacher groups and parents. The timetable for the leaving certificate examination reflects several important considerations including the length of the school year, which limits to 13 days the time available for the conduct of the written tests in June.  The written examinations take place over 13 days in June each year, during which period 49 individual leaving certificate subjects are tested, three of which encompass double exam question papers (Irish, English and Mathematics).  The 13 days are in turn divided into two sessions per day, morning and afternoon, providing a total of 26 examination sessions to accommodate the 52 examination papers in question.</p>
            <p eId="para_6678">In these circumstances the Commission's approach of scheduling the most populous subjects, that is, those taken by large numbers of candidates in comparison to other subjects, at the start is designed to allow candidates both a wide curriculum choice and to provide that the potential for situations, where candidates have to sit examinations in three subjects on one  day is minimised to the greatest extent possible.</p>
            <p eId="para_6679">In the interests of candidates every consideration is, of course, given to arranging that the potential for such situations is minimised and the commission is mindful of emerging and changing patterns of subject selection by examination candidates in developing and finalising the timetable for the written examinations each June.  However, given the timeframe in which the  written examinations are required to be held, the number and duration of the examinations, and the wide subject choices available to candidates it is not possible to avoid a situation where some subjects, are timetabled concurrently.</p>
            <p eId="para_6680">In 2009 this situation arose in the case of some 100 candidates out of the total of more than 55,000 candidates.  In these cases a balance must be found between protecting the integrity of the examination, which entails inter alia all candidates nationally sitting their examinations at the same time, and allowing the candidate to have access to a state examination within the prescribed examination period.  Appropriate arrangements are made, therefore, in consultation with the school authorities  for the candidate to sit one of the subjects later in the day of the date scheduled for that subject. This involves examination superintendents making arrangements so that the affected candidates do not have any opportunity to access the examination paper taken by the generality of candidates earlier that day.</p>

            <p eId="para_6682">The school transport system is arranged on the basis of return journeys to and from school and arrangements are put in place to ensure each pupil travelling on a school transport service is allocated an individual seat.

            <p eId="para_6683">The school transport scheme, which is operated by Bus Éireann on my Department's behalf, is a major logistical operation that facilitates the transportation of over 135,000 children to primary and post-primary schools each day; it involves about 42 million journeys and over 82 million kilometres on 6,000 routes every school year.</p>
            <p eId="para_6684">While I appreciate the Deputy's concerns, it is necessary for second-level students to pay the charges for the full service even where they do not intend to avail of the service for their journey home from school.</p>

            <p eId="para_6691">All children with MGLD who are in the class being suppressed will be able to receive teaching support through the teaching resources allocated to primary schools under the general allocation model.  Schools decide themselves how best to use this allocation based on the needs of the pupils and how to adjust their support in line with the changing needs of pupils as they mature. My Department provided a circular SP ED 02/05 to schools to assist them in deploying the general allocation model resources.</p>
            <p eId="para_6692">My Department promotes a continuum of assessment and intervention. These interventions range from support from the classroom teacher and support from  the resource / learning support teacher. Where a school considers that these  interventions are not meeting the child's needs they should seek the advice of their National Educational Psychological Service, NEPS, psychologist. Schools without an assigned NEPS psychologist can avail of the scheme for commissioning  psychological assessments.  Advice may also be sought from the local special educational needs organiser.</p>

Details of the criteria for appeal of mainstream staffing are contained in the staffing schedule, Circular 0002/2009.</p>
            <p eId="para_6715">In light of the Budget 2009 decision my Department has now published a circular for schools, Circular 0015/2009, which sets out how the new arrangements will operate for the allocation of language support teachers from September 2009.  The circular sets out a structured and transparent approach for the operation of the alleviation measures that were announced in the budget for schools that have a significant concentration of newcomer pupils. The alleviation measures mean that these schools can qualify for up to 4 language support (EAL) posts with the possibility of additional post(s) also being approved through the independent staffing appeals mechanism.</p>
            <p eId="para_6716">The process of allocating mainstream and EAL posts is a fair and equitable method of distributing valuable resources. I am satisfied that the current criteria for appealing the allocation of these posts allows for a transparent and objective method of addressing a range of specific challenges faced by schools. It is open to the Appeal Board to make recommendations in relation to the appeal criteria from time to time and the operation of the appeals process is kept under regular review in my Department.</p>
            <p eId="para_6717">The Appeal Board normally meets in May, June and October each year to consider cases submitted. Appeals must be submitted to Primary Allocations Section, Department of Education and Science, Athlone, on the standard application form, clearly stating the criterion under which the appeal is being made. The standard application form is available from Primary Allocations Section or on my Department's website. Closing dates for receipt of staffing appeals in the current year are 29 April, 29 May and 9 October 2009. In order to facilitate the additional appeals arising from the inclusion of EAL appeals under circular 0015/2009, the Board will hold an additional meeting in August this year. The closing date for receipt of appeals for this meeting is 31 July 2009.  The Appeal Board operates independently of the Department and its decision is final.</p>

            <p eId="para_6727">An audit of school enrolment policies which looked at issues such as the enrolment of traveller children, newcomer children and children with special education needs in almost 2,000 schools at primary and post-primary level was carried out in 2007.  The results were published on my Department's website in April 2008.

            <p eId="para_6738">English language schools and institutions offering international education are providers of an important service for thousands of learners who wish to enhance their education.  The sector is also a major contributor to the Irish economy and recent estimates put its total economic impact at around €500 million.  It is important, therefore, that institutions offering English language courses and other programmes of education to international students should operate in a regulatory environment which is robust and appropriate, and which has credibility both domestically and in the international market.</p>
            <p eId="para_6739">The existing regulatory regime for English language schools is operated by ACELS — the Advisory Council for English Language Schools — a body under the aegis of my Department. Institutions offering English language programmes must meet a set of standards in areas such as learning and teaching provision, teacher qualifications, premises and facilities. Compliance with these standards is assessed through an inspection regime operated by ACELS. Only programmes of education which meet these standards, and have been subject to inspection can be added to my Department's internationalisation register, which allows access by non-EEA students to employment, subject to certain conditions.</p>
            <p eId="para_6740">I am planning to introduce new arrangements for the promotion, marketing and regulation of the international education sector.  As I have previously told the House, as part of these new arrangements, the National Qualifications Authority of Ireland will be taking on responsibility for the development of further regulation of the international education sector, including the English language sector. This will include the development of a Quality Mark and a code of practice for international education providers. I am currently exploring the possibility of using the forthcoming Qualifications (Education and Training) Bill to provide a statutory underpinning for these developments.</p>

These services may include on-campus medical and counselling facilities for students, access and disability services, careers office, student facilities, student clubs and societies etc.  This charge of €900 for 2008/09 academic year does not represent the total allocation made towards student services from institutions' budgets.</p>
            <p eId="para_6751">The Government is willing to accept increases in the Student Services Charge to bring it to up to a limit of €1,500 (from €900) for the 2009/10 academic year in individual higher education institutions. The increase in the charge would have the effect of bringing the amount contributed by students more into line with the cost of providing services. This increase of up to €600 is agreed on the understanding that the revenue generated by the level of increase to be adopted by each institution is required to defray the cost of items that fall to be funded by the student services charge.</p>

In addition, where two or more children are pursuing an approved course at the same time, the reckonable income limit may be increased by €4,815 for each additional child.</p>

            <p eId="para_6764">I take it the Deputy is referring to the Dormant Accounts-funded Small Scale ICT Scheme for schools included in DEIS (Delivering Equality of Opportunity in Schools).</p>
            <p eId="para_6765">In April 2007, my Department announced details of this once–off scheme, which was approved for support in 2007 under the Educational Disadvantage category of the Dormant Accounts Fund.  Eligibility for the scheme was restricted to the primary and post-primary schools that are participating in my Department's School Support Programme under DEIS.  The scheme provides for small-scale grants, primarily for the purchase of the following types of ICT equipment to support children's learning and development:  Digital Camera; Digital Video Camera; Laptop; Tablet PC; Other Computer; Data Projector; Interactive Whiteboard (including software); Wireless mouse and keyboard; Educational Software.</p>
            <p eId="para_6766">The school referred to by the Deputy applied for a grant of €6,500 to purchase 10 computers, 1 digital camera and 1 digital video camera.  In October 2007, the Government approved a grant of €6,500.  The full grant was paid to North Tipperary VEC in July, 2008.</p>

          <speech by="#BattOKeeffe" as="#Minister_for_Education_and_Science" eId="spk_926">
            <from>Minister for Education and Science (Deputy Batt O’Keeffe)</from>
            <p eId="para_6768">As the Deputy will be aware, the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) is responsible, through its network of local Special Educational Needs Organisers (SENOs), for allocating resource teachers and Special Needs Assistants (SNAs) to primary and post primary schools to support children with special needs. The NCSE operates within my Department's criteria in allocating such support.</p>
            <p eId="para_6769">Applications for SNAs may be considered by the NCSE where a pupil has a significant medical need for such assistance and where there are identified care needs arising from a diagnosed disability. A pupil's level of care may diminish over time as the child matures. Pupils may move to a different school or on to post-primary school. In such situations, the NCSE will review and adjust the SNA support required in the school. This may mean that some pupils who had previously been supported by a full time SNA may have their needs met through the shared support of an SNA or perhaps they may have no need for SNA support.</p>
            <p eId="para_6770">The NCSE will undertake to review a decision taken by a SENO on foot of a request from a school or parents/guardians, when accompanied by relevant additional information, which may not have been to hand at the time of the decision. The NCSE has outlined this process in its Circular 01/05.</p>
            <p eId="para_6771">The Deputy will be aware that the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) has arranged for its Special Educational Needs Organisers (SENOs) to review Special Needs Assistant (SNA) allocations in all schools with a view to ensuring that the criteria governing the allocation of such posts are properly met.</p>
            <p eId="para_6772">In this context, my Department recently published circular letter SP ED 0037/2009 on the Department's website www.education.ie.  Given the proximity of the end of this school year and, in the light of the fact that those schools yet to be reviewed will have prepared for the new school year in advance of being reviewed, my Department is allowing exceptional transitional arrangements for schools where the SNA allocation is being adjusted. With the exception of cases where a child with SNA support is leaving a school, schools may, if they so wish, retain the existing cohort of SNAs until 31 January 2010.  All schools have the names and contact details of their local SENO. Parents may also contact their local SENO directly to discuss their child's special educational needs, using the contact details available on <i>www.ncse.ie.</i>
                        </p>
            <p eId="para_6773">I have arranged for the information provided by the Deputy to be forwarded to the NCSE for a direct reply.</p>

            <from>Minister for Education and Science (Deputy Batt O’Keeffe)</from>
            <p eId="para_6778">I am committed to providing information in relation to the allocation of teachers to schools and as a new feature on my Department's website. The process has begun with the provision earlier this year of initial information on the allocation of mainstream classroom teachers to primary schools under the revised schedule for 2009/10.</p>
            <p eId="para_6779">In terms of the position at individual primary school level the key factor for determining the level of resources provided by my Department is the pupil enrolment at 30 September 2008. The annual process of seeking this enrolment data from schools took place in the autumn and the data has since been received and processed in my Department enabling the commencement of the processes by which teaching resources are allocated to schools for the school year that begins next September.</p>
            <p eId="para_6780">My Department has written to the primary schools that are projected to have a net loss or gain in classroom teaching posts in September, 2009. As part of my efforts to ensure that relevant information is openly available to the public detailed information on the opening position for primary schools is published on my Department's website. This provisional list sets out the details on  individual schools that, taken collectively, are projected to gain 128 posts and to lose 382 posts — a net reduction of 254 posts. It is my intention to have this information updated and ultimately to set out the final position when the allocation processes are completed.</p>
            <p eId="para_6781">Within the terms of the staffing arrangements for primary schools there is provision for additional posts, referred to as developing school posts, to be assigned to schools on the basis of projected enrolments for the next school year. Under these arrangements, a developing school post may be sanctioned provisionally where the projected enrolment at 30th September of the school year in question equals or exceeds a specified figure. If the specified figure is not achieved on 30th September, sanction for the post is withdrawn.</p>
            <p eId="para_6782">The final position for any one school will depend on a number of other factors such as the additional posts to which I have referred and posts allocated as a result of the appeals processes. The operation of redeployment arrangements also impacts on the final position as a teacher can remain in his or her existing school where a suitable redeployment position does not exist. The final staffing position for all schools will therefore not be known until the autumn. At that stage the allocation process will be fully completed for mainstream classroom teachers and appeals to the Staffing Appeals Board will have been considered.</p>

In these cases, it is sometimes necessary for officials from various divisions of my Department to engage with the patron, trustees or management of the school to ensure that the need for improvement and change is fully understood by the school and those responsible for its management. These discussions also seek to identify how improvement may take place and the supports, such as those from the school support services that may be made available to the school. Self-review by the school and further inspection visits may be used to monitor the progress of improvement.</p>

            <p eId="para_6815">I have consistently said that the 2009 Budget required difficult choices to be made across all areas of public expenditure. These decisions were made to control public expenditure and to ensure sustainability in the long run. In this respect Education, while protected to a much greater extent than most other areas of public expenditure, could not be totally spared. The various impacts at school level were included in the Budget day announcements and in view of the ominous financial circumstances that we are facing I am not in a position to reverse any of the decisions taken.</p>
            <p eId="para_6816">These decisions included the withdrawal of teaching posts which have been historically provided under previous disadvantage schemes to non-DEIS schools and the increasing of the pupil teacher ratio across all second-level schools from 18:1 to 19:1. In the case of fee-charging post-primary schools, there is an additional one-point adjustment to 20:1.</p>
            <p eId="para_6817">Teacher allocations to VEC schemes are approved annually by my Department in accordance with established rules based on recognised pupil enrolment. In accordance with these rules each VEC is required to organise its subject options within the limit of its approved teacher allocation. The deployment of teaching staff, the range of subjects offered and ultimately the quality of teaching and learning are in the first instance a matter for the VEC's.</p>
            <p eId="para_6818">In accordance with existing arrangements, where a school management authority is unable to meet its curricular commitments within its approved allocation, my Department considers applications for additional short term support i.e. curricular concessions.</p>
            <p eId="para_6819">An application for curricular concessions was received from Roscommon VEC and the VEC was allocated an additional four whole-time equivalent teacher posts for the 2009/10 school year. This concession is available as a short term support to enable essential curricular provision to continue. This was in addition to a disadvantaged post that was re-allocated to the VEC Scheme by the Social Inclusion Unit of my Department.</p>
            <p eId="para_6820">An independent appeals mechanism is available to school authorities who wish to appeal the adequacy of their teacher allocation. The Independent Appeals Committee are currently assessing the appeal lodged by Roscommon VEC and a decision will be forwarded to the VEC shortly. As the Appeals Committee operates independently of my Department in taking its decisions, you will  appreciate that it would not be appropriate to intervene in any such decision.</p>
            <p eId="para_6821">Discrete allocations are also made to VEC schools to cater for pupils with Special Educational Needs and those with Language difficulties for example.</p>
            <p eId="para_6822">The main focus of Social Inclusion measures is to retain resources in DEIS schools. There is a need to focus targeted resources on the schools in most need and this approach is in line with the broad thrust of the recommendations of the Comptroller and Auditor General which are set out in his report on Primary Disadvantage of 2006, which recommended that my Department should focus  its educational disadvantage measures on those schools serving the most disadvantaged communities.</p>

            <p eId="para_6827">I am committed to providing information in relation to the allocation of teachers to schools and as a new feature on my Department's website. The process has begun with the provision earlier this year of initial information on the allocation of mainstream classroom teachers to primary schools under the revised schedule for 2009/10.</p>
            <p eId="para_6828">In terms of the position at individual primary school level the key factor for determining the level of resources provided by my Department is the pupil enrolment at 30 September 2008. The annual process of seeking this enrolment data from schools took place in the autumn and the data has since been received and processed in my Department enabling the commencement of the processes by which teaching resources are allocated to schools for the school year that begins next September.</p>
            <p eId="para_6829">My Department has written to the primary schools that are projected to have a net loss or gain in classroom teaching posts in September, 2009. As part of my efforts to ensure that relevant information is openly available to the public detailed information on the opening position for primary schools is published on my Department's website. This provisional list sets out the details on  individual schools that, taken collectively, are projected to gain 128 posts and to lose 382 posts — a net reduction of 254 posts. It is my intention to have this information updated and ultimately to set out the final position when the allocation processes are completed.</p>
            <p eId="para_6830">The final position for any one school will depend on a number of other factors such as additional posts for schools that are developing rapidly and posts allocated as a result of the appeals processes. The operation of redeployment arrangements also impacts on the final position as a teacher can remain in his or her existing school where a suitable redeployment position does not exist.</p>
            <p eId="para_6831">The final staffing position for all schools will therefore not be known until the autumn. At that stage the allocation process will be fully completed for mainstream classroom teachers and appeals to the Staffing Appeals Board will have been considered.</p>
            <p eId="para_6832">It is open to the school referred to by the Deputy to submit an appeal to the Primary Staffing Appeals Board as set out in the Staffing Circular 0002/2009 which is available on my Department's website. My Department has no record of an appeal to date.</p>
