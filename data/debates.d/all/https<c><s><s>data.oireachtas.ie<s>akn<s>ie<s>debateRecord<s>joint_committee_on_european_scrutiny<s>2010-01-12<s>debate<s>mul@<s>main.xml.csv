Under the EuroMed agreement the European Union and Israel have specified the products which can be traded between them but the agreement is subject to conditions.  Various committees and the Dáil have held debates on what occurred a year ago in Gaza.  The situation remains the same as prior to the onslaught last year.  The citizens of Palestine cannot go about their normal business or be involved in production or the type of industrial development we associate with a normal society.  The agreement is contrary to good practice and human rights law because those citizens cannot involve themselves in production of the pharmaceutical and medical products mentioned in the proposal.  They cannot buy them because they cannot get them into Gaza and they cannot produce them to trade with the rest of the European Union or the State of Israel.The European Union needs to send out a message that it is opposed to any additional benefits accruing to Israel by means of additions to the existing agreement.  The agreement should be suspended pending Israel's recognition of breaches of human rights law and, in the interim, there should be no advance on the existing position taken by the European Union towards Israel.

Part 5 of the reply concerns the broader issue of trade relations with Israel.  It notes that the proposed upgrade of EU-Israel relations focused especially on political links and not so much on trade links.  It states that the proposed upgrade was put on hold at the beginning of 2009, following Israel's military operation in Gaza, and that the suspension of the upgrade did not affect the normal development of practical co-operation and trade under the current EU-Israel agreement.What was the nature of the upgrade if it did not affect normal co-operation in trade and other areas?  What does the suspension of the upgrade mean?  I am not clear as to how the upgrade of European Union-Israel relations was suspended after the Gaza intervention if it did not affect political matters or the normal development of practical co-operation and trade.  It seems a meaningless formula and no more than verbiage.  I would like clarification on what the EU decided.  The European Union recently terminated a trade relationship it had with the Republic of Guinea on the basis of its human rights record.  I do not know if it was this committee or the Joint Committee on European Affairs which tabled a motion on this subject but the motion must be proceeded with.
