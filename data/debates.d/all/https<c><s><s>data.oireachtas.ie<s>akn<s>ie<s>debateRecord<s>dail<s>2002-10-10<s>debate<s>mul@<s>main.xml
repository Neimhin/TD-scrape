He has indicated that he intends to give as much detail as possible. Will the Tánaiste clarify whether Opposition Members will be entitled to ask supplementary questions or will the Taoiseach give extra time to take questions on his statement?</p>
          <p eId="para_15">Based on the answer the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources gave to a Priority Question from Deputy Gilmore yesterday, will individual Ministers take questions from Opposition Members in the debate on the Flood tribunal report?

          <from>Ms B. Moynihan-Cronin</from>
          <p eId="para_237">I am pleased to have the opportunity to contribute to this motion. It is a timely motion and I commend the Fine Gael Party for tabling it.</p>
          <p eId="para_238">On the Order of Business this morning, a Cheann Comhairle, you said we cannot use the word "lie" in the House any more. That is unfair. To be truthful, bare faced lies were told by the Fianna Fáil Party during the course of the general election campaign, particularly about cutbacks. On 13 May the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Martin, said there would be no cutbacks and on 13 May the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, said there would be no cutbacks whatsoever, planned secretly or otherwise. No sooner  was the general election over than the floodgates opened and the avalanche of cutbacks began to pour from Government Buildings on a daily basis.</p>
          <p eId="para_239">The first of those miserly cutbacks was the increase in income eligibility limits for the drugs refund scheme. Of all the vulnerable groups to be targeted to bear the brunt of the spending cutbacks, the long-term ill, who rely on the scheme, should be exempt from the axe of the Minister for Finance. By raising the limits the Government is hitting at those with long-term illnesses, many of whom are on expensive medication and low incomes. This is a sinister and cynical attack on the vulnerable and is a hallmark of the Government.</p>
          <p eId="para_240">I can deal only with a couple of the cutbacks in the short time available to me. I condemn outright the proposal and the threat to re-introduce third level fees. Despite what the Tánaiste said this morning, and what the Taoiseach states, I still believe the Government will re-introduce third level fees. The manner in which the Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Dempsey, has handled the matter is a thundering disgrace. He threatened to re-introduce third level fees days before thousands of students received their offers from the CAO. This appalling attack on students came at a time when many were stressed. Many of those students may have been influenced as to their chosen course given that the Minister raised the issue of the re-introduction of third level at that time.</p>
          <p eId="para_241">Last week the Minister was told off by the Tánaiste and we were promised that it was not the Government's policy to re-introduce fees. However, yesterday, in another policy U-turn, the Minister again threatened not to rule out the re-introduction of third level fees. It is time the Taoiseach got a grip on the issue. Is it, or is it not, the policy of the Government to re-introduce third level fees? If it is the Minister's policy to slam the gates of colleges on many thousands of students by re-introducing fees, the Labour Party will fight it tooth and nail.</p>
          <p eId="para_242">Has the Minister for Education and Science any understanding of the significant costs entailed when a family member takes up a place in a third level institution? It is obvious the Minister is not from a constituency like Kerry South where every student who wishes to attend a university has to travel away from home. Instead of re-introducing third level fees it would be more in the Minister's line to increase the maintenance grant for students who struggle to live, study and work to keep themselves in college.</p>
          <p eId="para_243">The Minister has to be condemned outright for increasing registration fees. His only interest is in saving a few miserly pounds in his Department. He is not encouraging students who have worked hard to enter third level with a view to securing a proper future for themselves.</p>

        <speech by="#MichaelDHiggins" eId="spk_228">
          <from>Mr. M. Higgins</from>
          <p eId="para_244">I welcome the opportunity to say a few words on the motion dealing with the  mismanagement of the economy. The other day, a young economics student suggested to me that the actions of the Minister for Finance had nothing to do with economics, that they were really the story of a gambler's spree. I wish to put a few questions directly to the Minister who is on the Front Bench. Why was it that we canvassed internationally and got the largest number of votes ever received by a temporary member of the Security Council on the basis that we would meet our overseas development aid target of 0.7% of GNP? The first of the stealth cuts was in overseas development aid, which affects the poorest people in the world. It was done in a disgustingly deceitful way – I hope that is near enough to the word we cannot use. It was announced as a cut of €32 million but turned out to be a cut of €42 million. I have only five minutes but I want to say also that I agree entirely with what Deputy Breeda Moynihan-Cronin said about third level fees.</p>
          <p eId="para_245">It would be nice to hear from those heads of third level colleges who have said they have nothing against the re-introduction of fees. What are their views, for example, in relation to access over the years since the poverty conference in 1974-75 in Kilkenny? Why did they not say they wanted more money for access and so that the numbers coming to third level could be increased? They said they might have nothing against the return of fees. Egalitarians they are not, so let us hear from them on the other issues now that they have broken their silence.</p>
          <p eId="para_246">I now come to the main point I want to make about the mismanagement of the economy. Why, in a Finance Act, was speculation in housing allowed to receive such an enormous mandate as it did from the present Minister for Finance? I challenge the Minister present, Deputy Coughlan, to go to the Cabinet and make a proposal for a survey of who owns how many houses now in Ireland. Under section 50, which is related to tax reliefs for student accommodation, you can become involved in that one tax remission and make all of your rental income tax exempt anywhere in the State.</p>
          <p eId="para_247">What kind of society can accept that it is right to make speculators tax exempt for all rental income at a time when housing is tearing the heart out of the economy? It is immoral and wrong. The Minister for Finance at the same time is involved in the extraordinary exercise of putting millions into the pension reserve fund at a time when the yield to the public is extraordinarily low. Professional economic opinion tells him it is daft, and at the same time he will borrow on the market to meet current needs. Where is the economic justification for that? It is quite extraordinary.</p>
          <p eId="para_248">Minister McCreevy stands up regularly and on the odd occasion when he finishes a sentence he suggests that he is writing books about his performance as Minister for Finance. I challenge him to ask his advisors, both new and longstanding, to answer a simple question. Will he look at the  capital accumulation in this country during his period in office and contrast it with what is happening in relation to wages? He has shifted resources from the poor and made their situation a great deal worse, particularly in relation to housing, which is destroying our society. At the same time he announces, for example, that the richest with the most surplus disposable income can spend €250 per month and get an additional 25% back from the public. What kind of madness is this transfer of benefits to those who already have resources?</p>
          <p eId="para_249">Sometimes I get very irritated about different topics but the one that astounds me above all others is what has happened in relation to housing. It has affected young couples, it has doubled the housing lists and it has had a huge effect on rental income, and all of this is in the name of some strange economic muddle which reflects the gambling mentality of the Minister for Finance as he goes to the races with all of our resources. How pathetic it is that when things are going well he suggests that the expansion and the growth rate are the achievement of the Government, but when things go wrong it is all down to external factors.</p>
          <p eId="para_250">Bluntly – Fianna Fáil Deputies can answer these points – who has benefited from the economic growth? Have some people benefited disproportionately? What is the basis, for example, for giving to those who already have? What are their proposals for dealing with housing? It is very interesting that after the report on the private rented sector the Government rushed in with its response on behalf of the landlords. Meanwhile we are still waiting for the legislation which would have given the basic protection that other European countries have for tenants. That tells us an awful lot. We have an ideologically-driven Minister for Finance who really should be in the Progressive Democrats because what he effectively did was deliver the Fianna Fáil Party – which had many decent people in it – into the thinking of the Progressive Democrats. We are all paying the price for it. The advise he is receiving is illiterate in economic terms. I repeat for the record that it is economic illiteracy and morally disgraceful.</p>

          <p eId="para_259">I can sleep very well with my conscience clear. Why were the policies of Deputy Higgins's party not seen as visionary? Why were its policies not seen as the only way forward for our country, and why was the party's time in Opposition so fruitless?</p>
          <p eId="para_260">The confidence of ability and vision brought us into the European Union. Today we stand on the brink of a new Europe with a new horizon, and as a confident nation we can take that step and vote "Yes" for Europe and "Yes" for Ireland. Against this background of achievement, in particular in the five years of the previous Administration, this Government has resulted in the creation of approximately 300,000 new jobs. Let us ponder that figure for a moment. That is over 1,000 jobs per week for the past five years or new jobs for 100 classes of leaving certificate students each week.</p>
          <p eId="para_261">Government debt has been reduced from 74% of GDP at the end of 1996 to 36% at the end of 2001. Those figures probably do not mean much to most people but if you translate them into euro and cent, it means less taxpayers' money is going to service a Government overdraft or loan account. Instead, that money is being pumped into the health services, education, social welfare payments and improving our infrastructure, mak ing Ireland a more attractive location for industrialists which at the end of the day means more jobs.</p>
          <p eId="para_262">A radical and extensive programme of tax reform was introduced, resulting in more money being put back into the pockets of our taxpayers. This amounted not just to a few euro or a few cent but to almost €5 billion in personal income tax and PRSI reductions. Outside of economic issues, which we have kept to the fore, there is the necessity to solve one of the greatest problems besetting our island nation – the inter-community strife in Northern Ireland. On an historic day we witnessed the endorsement of the Good Friday Agreement when our people on both sides of the Border endorsed a shared aspiration for peace in our time. That work continues and today our thoughts and hopes are with all of those who are involved in that work for peace.</p>
          <p eId="para_263">In my own area of social and family affairs, in which I have long held a professional and personal interest, the Government has worked hard to use this period of national opportunity to invest in vital social services and to lift huge numbers of people out of poverty. I was proud that our recent election campaign highlighted the major achievements in regard to sustained social progress. We told the electorate that we had made inroads in this area but that there was more to do, and we are committed to achieving that. The people gave this Government a ringing endorsement because they knew we had a track record in caring for people and ensuring we did our best in advancing social policy. The electorate knew we would adhere to that.</p>

          <from>Mary Coughlan</from>
          <p eId="para_265">I want to highlight a number of milestones that marked progress in social policy. Before the 1997 election we promised to raise the old age pension to €127. This year, the contributory pension reached €147 and the non-contributory pension reached €134. Well over €100 million has been allocated to community and voluntary activity underpinning the ethos and aspirations of communities throughout the country. We reduced the number of long-term unemployed, one of the greatest causes of poverty, from 86,000 to 24,000. We reduced poverty to historically low levels which took tens of thousands of people out of the tax net, and child benefit has been increased substantially with the rate now treble the 1997 rate.</p>
          <p eId="para_266">The Minister for Finance has stressed his prudent management of the economy. We have seen the benefits of sound fiscal policy. This country has one of the strongest budgetary positions in Europe. That brings me back to the question of confidence. The international economy has not recovered as strongly as expected. Equities, IT and other markets have taken a hit. Confidence is at stake, and we have seen what happens when investors lose confidence in a product. We have seen the value of shares in international brands  fall through the floor. Confidence is a necessity in Ireland today. We must not lose the confidence to face the future. We must be bold and imaginative to progress in building this country.</p>
          <p eId="para_267">Those who shout from the rooftops about our budgetary position are trying to damage our country's confidence. They do a disservice to their own political heritage, whether it be blue, red or some technical hue, but that is not surprising. They do a disservice to preceding generations who worked hard to build this country, and to those who took the confident step of investing here. They do a disservice also to our children who anticipate working in a nation striving towards its destiny, its head held high, its eye fixed firmly on the horizon and with hope in its heart.</p>

        <speech by="#FrankFahey" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Enterprise,_Trade_and_Employment" eId="spk_240">
          <from>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Mr. Fahey)</from>
          <p eId="para_268">Last night I listened carefully to what the Minister for Finance said in his recall of developments in relation to the public finances since the beginning of the year. Having served at the Cabinet table throughout 2001, and particularly during the Estimates and budget period towards the end of last year, I was acutely aware of the economic slowdown which was or at least should have been obvious to all.</p>
          <p eId="para_269">Despite the protestations of those opposite, it is the worldwide economic slowdown which is at the heart of the difficulties experienced in the public finances in 2002. When the Minister introduced his 2002 budget, he projected a modest surplus of only €170 million compared with surpluses of up to €3 billion in 2000. The impact of the economic slowdown, given the marginal nature of the proposed surplus, was evident.</p>
          <p eId="para_270">I recall in the new year the absolute determination of the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, to ensure that spending did not breach the target level of increase. The Minister introduced the presentation of monthly expenditure reports to the Government, constantly emphasising the need for careful management and prudence in relation to spending. I am not breaching Cabinet confidentiality when I say that following frank discussions in February and April, during which the Minister refused to allow any increase in expenditure, €11 million had to be found, mainly from the Estimates of other Departments to allow for shortfalls in the on-the-spot fine system and in drugs and homelessness programmes. Again in April, €19 million had to be found for the primary schools building programme. This was funded by cuts, or adjustments, in the Department of Education and Science and contributions from eight other Departments, including the Department of the Marine and Natural Resources. I recall also a no-nonsense meeting in the office of the Minister for Finance, as part of the Estimates process last year, during which the Minister walked over to the door, opened it and told me to "Get out". From my experience, the Minister for Finance did not deceive the people  prior to the last election. He has consistently held the line on the absolute necessity for a tight fiscal regime.</p>
          <p eId="para_271">Last night the Opposition talked about a con job being perpetrated on the people by the Minister for Finance and the Government. That is not correct, and the facts speak for themselves. It has also been suggested in the recent media onslaught that the Taoiseach is a good leader in good times but is unable to lead in bad times. I assure the House that the Taoiseach stood by his Minister for Finance against the rest of us when it might have been easier to give in and soften the approach being taken in the lead up to the last election.</p>
          <p eId="para_272">The reality is that in the 12 months prior to the last election, the Government contained public expenditure. That was due to the resilience of the Minister for Finance in ensuring that we did not allow expenditure to get out of control. It is clear from what the Minister said last night that dramatic changes took place around the time of the election. As he said at the end of May, the Revenue Commissioners indicated that Revenue receipts were €300 million off target. By the end of June, the Revenue Commissioners said Revenue receipts would be €500 million off target. That information only became available at the end of June.</p>
          <p eId="para_273">The charges being made by the Opposition also cast a slur on the Department of Finance and its officials. Any suggestion that the Department of Finance officials in any way colluded with the Minister or the Government in withholding information is completely unacceptable, yet that is the charge being made. Whatever we may say about the Department of Finance officials, and we often criticise them, they guard their impartiality irrespective of Government or politics. That is recognised by all parties. To suggest, as has been done, that a con job was presided over by the officials in the Department of Finance is a major slur on them and one that I reject.</p>
          <p eId="para_274">The reality is that the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, was right then and is right now. Fianna Fáil Governments were rightly criticised in the early 1980s for allowing public finances to go out of control and resorting to borrowing requirements which we could not sustain. If the Minister for Finance were to accept the range of expenditure proposals put forward by the Opposition parties, he would be wrong in that action and should be roundly criticised.</p>
          <p eId="para_275">I fail to understand the onslaught on the Minister for Finance for doing the right thing, especially from financial analysts in the newspapers whom one expects would know better.</p>

          <p eId="para_277">As I explained to the Deputy, it was quite clear at all times – I gave some examples – in the lead-up to the election. It was made clear umpteen times by the Minister for Finance  that there had to be a tight fiscal regime and that was there before the election. He also clearly pointed out that there would be no cutbacks above and beyond what would be required in the adjustments.</p>
          <p eId="para_278">There will be cutbacks next year, but let us put those in perspective. We had increases in public expenditure of up to 20% in recent years and 14% this year. There will be a substantial increase in public expenditure this year of up to 8%, a figure that many economies throughout Europe would be happy with. However, to reduce increases from 20% to 14% to 8% does involve cutbacks. It involves difficult decisions. We are lucky to have a Minister for Finance who has the courage and determination to ensure that those difficult decisions are taken. As a letter writer to the <i>Irish Examiner </i>said this morning, he should be complimented for his courage in taking unpopular decisions to ensure the future health of this economy.</p>

Deputy Hayes referred to a letter to the former Leader of the Opposition, Deputy Noonan, from the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy. I wish to quote another sentence from that letter that may have escaped the attention of Deputy Hayes but definitely escaped the attention of the media and the Opposition parties in general. In the letter, dated 13 May, the Minister assured Deputy Noonan that there were no plans for cutbacks and went on to say that Fine Gael and most commentators had conveniently chosen to ignore that fact. He goes on to state that with a Government spending programme of €40 billion this year, some programmes will under-spend and others will over-spend. He further points out that, in the history of the State, there is no example of a year when there were no changes whatsoever to initial spending plans. That is an important sentence in the letter to Deputy Hayes's former leader. Deputy McCreevy outlines in the letter the factual position regarding the public finances.</p>
          <p eId="para_280">The Minister has not misled anyone. Last January he briefed the secretaries general of all Departments on the absolute need to contain spending in 2002 within the budgetary allocation that had been given to each Department. The Minister has repeated, before and since the election, and again in the House last night, that there would be an increase in expenditure this year of 14% on the out-turn for 2001 and that not one cent less will be spent by Government this year. It baffles me that the Opposition and some media commentators can talk about cutbacks when there are no cutbacks. The reality is, as the Minister has repeated, that the spending programme put in place at the commencement of this year is the one being adhered to by the Government. If anybody can be accused of misrepresentation it is the Opposition parties and some ill-informed media commentators.</p>
          <p eId="para_281">I am glad to have the opportunity of complimenting Deputy McCreevy on his stewardship of the public finances and the Department of Finance since 1997 and I look forward to his continuing his positive and practical stewardship of that Department for the next four and a half years. In the period from 1997 to 2002 around 300,000 additional jobs were created. The unemployment rate was more than halved, the general Government debt was substantially reduced and there was a massive programme of personal taxation reform. The reality is that, at present, we have one of the strongest budgetary situations in Europe. Unfortunately that is not what is being said by the media and by some of the Opposition parties.</p>
          <p eId="para_282">The reality is that, in recent years, there have been major economic developments and all parts of the country have benefited. I compliment the Minister on his decision to introduce the rural renewal scheme, in which the western part of my own county of Cavan is included. The Minister initiated that scheme to assist those areas that had suffered significant depopulation over the years. The scheme has brought, and is still bringing, people back to live in those areas and has contributed to job creation in industry and the tourism sector.</p>
          <p eId="para_283">The Minister also had the courage, determination and foresight to ensure that the previous Government gave Objective One status to the Border, midlands and west region. I remember the debates in which Fianna Fáil backbenchers were advocating the introduction of Objective One status for those areas. Deputy Noonan and other members of the then Fine Gael Front Bench did not come down on any side. They did not have the guts to stand up and say they would divide the country, but the Minister and his colleagues had, although at that time he was leaving out his own county of Kildare.</p>
          <p eId="para_284">The Minister has been particularly conscious of the need to bring development and economic regeneration to the less developed parts of the country. I wish to see those policies continue during the lifetime of this Government. I appeal to the Minister and the Government to ensure that if we are ever facing a slowdown in economic activity, we put in place the necessary infrastructure in the less developed parts of the country.</p>
          <p eId="para_285">Over the past few years we have not had good value for money in construction projects. I know from speaking to a former member of the National Roads Authority that there was a significant variation in the costs of projects between the Connacht-Ulster area and the rest of the country. In the former areas there was good value for money while in Leinster and Munster there was very poor value.</p>
          <p eId="para_286">I would like to see the Minister for the Environment and Local Government and the NRA ensure that the necessary projects in the west, the north-west and the north-east are fast-tracked and brought to construction stage as soon as possible. If there is to be a slowdown in economic  activity in the private sector, that is the time when the Government should be investing more in necessary infrastructural projects, particularly in the less developed areas. When there is further growth in the international economy in a few years we want to be in a position to ensure that the less developed areas can attract inward investment to create the necessary jobs and increase their populations.</p>

        <speech by="#TonyKilleen" eId="spk_244">
          <from>Mr. Killeen</from>
          <p eId="para_287">The election campaign last May was about choosing a Government to manage the economy during an international downturn and a slowdown in growth in Ireland. This time last year everybody was fully aware of the facts about the foot and mouth disease crisis and the fallout from the events of 11 September and there was great concern about their possible impact. There were also difficulties in the IT sector which, if anything, have been much worse since then. Everyone except the Opposition parties appears to have been aware of this reality since last autumn. During the election campaign, when the Government parties were clearly pointing out the difficulties besetting the economy, some of the other parties were engaging in madcap schemes and promises of paying compensation to Eircom shareholders, taxi plate owners and so on.</p>
          <p eId="para_288">In his budget speech last December the Minister for Finance predicted Exchequer deficits of almost €3 billion in 2003 and almost €4 billion in 2004. He set out clearly the economic parameters within which we needed to operate. In a sense this debate is about political credibility. Up to now it has been about the credibility of the Government but in many respects it is even more about the credibility of the Opposition. In the run-up to the election Deputy McCreevy made it clear that he intended to abide by our responsibilities under the stability and growth pact. The manifesto stated that any spending would be predicated, and dependent on, continued growth in the economy.</p>
          <p eId="para_289">The people proved during the election campaign that they are no longer fooled by auction politics. Unfortunately, things change and since then a number of people have come to the view that they were conned last May. They are clearly wrong in that belief and it is our job to remind them. Perhaps Opposition parties will have to learn to fight elections before polling day and not after.</p>
          <p eId="para_290">One of the areas where Mr. McCreevy comes in for much criticism is in regard to health expenditure and health services. There has been an enormous increase in expenditure under this heading, with almost €1 billion more this year than last year. There has been an increase of 114% since 1997 and a huge increase in the range of services. The full range of budget expenditure, with a 14.6% increase, will be expended this year. In fact, the difficulty will be to keep it within those parameters. In County Clare we were perfectly well aware this time last year of the budgetary difficulties. The Ennis bypass project, for  example, was put on hold. There were five or six other projects similarly on hold. As little as €100 million would have enabled all five of them to start but it was very clear that kind of money was not available. The Minister made it clear that he was not prepared to put it up front prior to the election, therefore no one can say it was something they learned about following the election. Sometimes it is annoying that no credit is given for the tremendous expenditure in regard to the Newmarket-on-Fergus and Smithstown bypasses.</p>
          <p eId="para_291">Parliament, and the Government in particular, needs to ensure there is no repeat of the 1980s failure to contain public expenditure. We have a responsibility in that regard to current and future generations. When previous Governments went down the road of not controlling public expenditure the cost was enormous.</p>

        <speech by="#ConorLenihan" eId="spk_245">
          <from>Mr. C. Lenihan</from>
          <p eId="para_292">I thank my colleague for speaking so volubly about what the Government has and has not done. As we debate this motion on the economy and public finances it is important to understand that there are three significant contributory reasons why this side of the House is now in Government and not in Opposition. First was the fear and uncertainty occasioned by the economic slow-down resulting from the technology bubble collapsing and the 11 September episode which released a degree of uncertainty into the world financial picture to the extent that voters decided to vote for the <i>status quo.</i> In other words, in the recent election there has been a twofold swing, a swing to the <i>status quo</i> and a swing to the left. There has been greater fragmentation on the Opposition side with a greater presence of Independent left-wing and Sinn Féin Deputies. This is an example of the swing to the left which occurred in political life during the election. Together with that swing to the left was a swing to the centre and the <i>status quo,</i> represented by Fianna Fáil continuing in Government and improving its position in the general election. I would like to think that much of this is as a result of Fianna Fáil's wonderful manifesto. However, the truth is that it has to do with a perception among voters that we are the party and organisation which is able to manage our economic fortunes in a prudent manner. That was not the perception voters had about Fine Gael in the recent election. The perception formed by voters, fortunately or unfortunately depending on whether one believes we should have one single strong Opposition party, was that Fine Gael was making reckless and quite dishonest promises to the electorate both in regard to the Eircom shareholders and taxi drivers. They were shamelessly playing on what I can only describe as the “compo” mentality whereby compensation is there for everyone and the State will pay up at the drop of a hat. That is why Fine Gael lost the election. Deputy Killeen spoke a lot of sense when he said Fine Gael has yet to learn the lesson of the general election, why it lost, why its vote decreased, why there was a swing to the left  and to the fragmentary smaller parties of the left and Independents and why there was a simultaneous swing to the centre and to Fianna Fáil and, to a certain degree, the Progressive Democrats. That is the essential message they failed to learn. In their desperation in Opposition they are adopting the famous dictum of Goebel in trying to believe they can arrogantly tell the public a big lie, that they would be susceptible to the big lie rather than the small lie. There were no lies told by this side of the House in regard to the economic picture of the country.</p>

        <speech by="#ConorLenihan" eId="spk_247">
          <from>Mr. C. Lenihan</from>
          <p eId="para_294">One of the biggest contributory factors for our election success was precisely the fear in the public mind that if that gang and crowd across this House were allowed to manage the affairs of the country we would be in a far worse state than we are today.</p>
          <p eId="para_295">People on the other side, including Deputy Michael Higgins, used the phrase "economic illiteracy". I challenge that assertion. The Opposition is guilty of a kind of economic dyslexia where they cannot even read the basic figures the Minister for Finance produced both prior to and following the election. We simply cannot spend what we do not generate in terms of income.</p>
          <p eId="para_296">There is a serious decline in regard to income and revenue receipts from tax. Much of this is related to an economic slowdown or the failure of a recovery in the world economy in the second half of this year and last year. There were great expectations that there would be a recovery but that has not materialised. There is a criticism of the Department of Finance which is fair. In the boom times it underestimated the level of receipts from taxation and in the harsher times, which we are now witnessing, it was off target in its predictions in regard to revenue receipts. That is a fair criticism of the Department and the way in which it collects figures. However, it is hardly as serious a misdemeanour as the Opposition indicates.</p>

        <speech by="#TomHayes" eId="spk_248">
          <from>Mr. Hayes</from>
          <p eId="para_297">I wish to share time with Deputies P. Breen, Perry, Healy, Crowe and F. McGrath.</p>
          <p eId="para_298">Next Monday marks 150 days since the general election, 150 days of spin, cover up, leaks, incompetence and mismanagement. It marks 150 days since Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats fooled the public into voting for them. No matter what Deputy Lenihan or others say the reality is that the people were fooled into voting for them. It marks 150 days since it became clear that this Government has mortgaged the country's future in an effort to re-elect an inefficient Government. The facts speak for themselves. There is a €750 million deficit despite assurances from the Minister for Finance that the country would remain in the black this year. However, the Government has promised €900 million in cutbacks despite  promises in a letter on 13 May to Deputy Michael Noonan that there were no cutbacks planned, either secretly or otherwise.</p>
          <p eId="para_299">Cutbacks in the Department of the Environment and Local Government amount to €150 million. The sewage in my county is leaking into what were once beautiful rivers and there are no plans to put proper sewerage schemes in place. Despite promises during and prior to the election, plans for new roads and bypasses are now put on hold. Cutbacks in the Department of Education and Science amount to €150 million, in the Department of Social and Family Affairs to €100 million and in the Department of Health and Children to €50 million, including penalising the poorest people in the world by a €54 million cutback in overseas aid. There are new charges on ordinary workers, including farmers and business people, to pay for the Government's mismanagement. This includes a 60% increase in entry fees to third level colleges despite the fact that it was never more difficult on families to keep children in third level college because of the increasing costs of living away from home. There is a 26% increase in casualty charges, a 21% increase in the drugs refund scheme, an 18% increase in local authority rents, an 18% increase in VHI charges, a 13.25% increase in consumer activity charges and an increase in the VAT rate which will cost average householders €250 euro per year.</p>
          <p eId="para_300">These increases are ample evidence that the Minister engaged in nothing less than a spending splurge in the run up to the election to buy votes. This spending has now been pulled back to the detriment of vulnerable people in our society. The Government can dress up the cuts, deceit, mistrust and spin as much as it likes, and its backbenchers can do the same, but the truth is totally different. We know the truth and, above all, the people know it. They will not be fooled again.</p>
          <p eId="para_301">I am appalled by the behaviour of the Government but I also know that this debate offers it an opportunity. For the first time since the election, I am asking the Fianna Fáil-Progressive Democrats alliance to come clean, end the shameful cover-up and salvage something of its reputation by apologising to the people for its deception.</p>
          <p eId="para_302">I call on the Government to do something to end the cynicism that is in danger of overwhelming this House due to its actions. Any of us on the campaign trail for the Nice treaty are aware that the people know what is happening. The people have a right to know where their taxes have gone. They have the right to know if their public services are being hit and if the quality of their children's education is to be reduced. The people have the right to know if the standard of their health care is to be lowered and if their public transport, so vital to our country, is to be delivered.</p>

        <speech by="#PatBreen" eId="spk_249">
          <from>Mr. P. Breen</from>
          <p eId="para_303">I welcome the opportunity to speak on the motion before the House. It is clear that the Taoiseach and the Minister for Finance  grossly misrepresented the State's budgetary position in the run up to the last election. This misrepresentation was a key plank in their electoral strategy. So important was it that when the then leader of Fine Gael, Deputy Noonan, sought clarification of the State's finances, he was told the following on 13 May 2002:</p>
          <p eId="para_304">I can confirm that there are no significant overruns projected and no cutbacks whatsoever are being planned, secretly or otherwise.</p>
          <p eId="para_305">This will, in time, be viewed as one of the most disgraceful moments in the life of this disgraceful Government. It is now clear that the Government's strategy is to withhold as far as possible the reality of its mismanagement of the State's finances from the public and the Dáil.</p>
          <p eId="para_306">Rather than take advice from the Department, the Minister for Finance prefers to take advice from the Fianna Fáil posters. The Government parties may be good at getting money into their own party coffers, but they are not good at managing the State's money.</p>
          <p eId="para_307">When the Minister was advised by his officials not to engage in the SSIA scheme, he went ahead with it anyway. We now hear that, rather than the original cost estimate of €127 million which the Minister gave to the Dáil, the scheme will cost €500 million per year. Either the Minister is incompetent and could not estimate properly the cost of the scheme that he implemented or he is not telling the truth. Either way, he should publish immediately the basis for the original estimate of €127 million.</p>
          <p eId="para_308">People in my constituency will be getting windfalls from this scheme just in time for the next scheduled election if the Government stays in power for four to five years. Perhaps the Government thinks it can buy votes, but one must remember the scheme is costing over €2.5 billion at a time when we urgently need projects and infrastructure. Earlier, Deputy Killeen referred to the Ennis bypass in my constituency, which was promised by the Taoiseach when he visited the constituency last April but which is now postponed until at least 2003. The Ennis bypass and other projects, including the bypass of Cashel, from where Deputy Hayes comes, are badly needed if we are to have growth in these areas.</p>
          <p eId="para_309">There is a €50 million cutback in the health services. In the general hospital in Ennis, an extra unit is out of order since last January and the funding is not being made available by the Department to the health board to replace it. Elderly people are waiting up to three months for extra units.</p>
          <p eId="para_310">VHI contributions have gone up by 18% and the threshold for the drugs refund scheme has gone up by 22%. Yesterday, 6,000 students marched in Limerick to protest against the 70% increase in registration fees. Cutbacks of €150 million, resulting in the postponement of many new capital projects, have taken place. For example, two schools in Tulla and Kilmihil in my  own constituency now have to make do with extensions.</p>
          <p eId="para_311">With regard to job losses, 165,300 people are now on the live register, up 24,000 from last year. If this continues all the industrial and manufacturing jobs created since 1997 will be gone by Christmas, including Tellabs in Shannon airport, where 450 job losses were announced. Those employees will be gone before Christmas. How much more of this kind of thing is going on?</p>
          <p eId="para_312">The sort of information is never volunteered by the Government. Freedom of information inquiries and parliamentary questions are required to acquire this type of information. The revelation in the recent Cabinet memo calling for €900 million in budget cutbacks dates back to a time when the Minister for Finance promised no cutbacks or plans for cutbacks, secretly or otherwise.</p>
          <p eId="para_313">How much more is being withheld? In mismanaging the nation's finances, the Government has created so much spin that the people are dizzy. The people do not trust the body politic now and I find it very hard to blame them. Therefore, I call on the Government to come clean, purge itself and let us move forward economically. After all, Ireland's economy does not belong to Fianna Fáil or the Progressive Democrats.</p>

          <from>Mr. Perry</from>
          <p eId="para_314">The budget should seek to develop our infrastructure, improve public services, promote equity, encourage enterprise and investment and do so in a way that sustains fiscal policy. The Minister has failed on all four counts. I compare the Government to the board of Enron, which totally deceived its shareholders. There are huge comparisons to be made. The electorate definitely received a clear indication of a totally different economy. Today we heard people applauding themselves and stating that Fine Gael were the bearers of bad news that the electorate did not want to hear. The Government had many spin doctors who told the electorate clearly about the huge spend on the economy and that the good times were going to roll on. The Minister for Finance was in celebratory mode.</p>
          <p eId="para_315">The Minister, in his last budget announcement, was at pains to announce the health strategy, the blueprint for the development of the health services over the next ten years. He was encouraging in respect of the treatment purchase fund, which has already been cancelled. This fund was very much a part of the manifesto of the Progressive Democrats. There are people waiting on lists and the fund has been automatically cancelled.</p>
          <p eId="para_316">The Minister should note that there are 25,000 people on waiting lists. We have heard about additional beds, but where are they? What about the range of services for older people? I had people in my clinic who could get only one hour of home help. That is how bad matters are and that is the nature of the increased services.</p>
          <p eId="para_317">We hear of the BMW region, the national development plan and Objective One, but that is mere talk. There is no infrastructural development whatsoever. The plan pertaining to the pro posed development of infrastructure by 2006 will not be implemented by 2016. There has been so much deception. The electorate has been totally deceived. There are crude charges associated with student grants and maintenance fees. We are spending people's money, the management of which will lead to many questions in each Department in the future.</p>
          <p eId="para_318">It is not acceptable that the Minister, who has the third most important position in the State, can come in here and indicate that he is cooking the books to ensure that there will be a pay day. The Minister announced his budget in December with an election in sight. The purpose of indirect taxation was to give the illusion of spending. Also, the introduction of the euro was used, and every piggy bank was robbed, to ensure the best spin on the economy so the electorate would see it in a positive light. Unfortunately, they did so.</p>
          <p eId="para_319">In coming years, the Government will have to face job losses, which are happening daily. Today we heard a story of 330,000 jobs, but what about all the jobs that have been lost in the past year? The Minister made no reference whatsoever to the number of jobs that were lost and the dwindling level of small enterprise.</p>
          <p eId="para_320">Small enterprises and companies are the backbone of the economy. Speaking from vast experience of the role of county enterprise boards, it is clear they are getting little or no funding. Approximately €26 million has been allocated in total.</p>
          <p eId="para_321">I wish the Minister of State well in his new post. While he was not part of the previous Government, the Progressive Democrats have supported the Minister in his deception. There are many parallels with the board of Enron which failed to disclose figures to its shareholders. The Government failed to disclose the true state of the economy to the electorate before the general election.</p>
          <p eId="para_322">People want integrity and the truth. A truth commission is required to ascertain if the Government is telling the truth. Every Government announcement should be tested for its veracity. If not, it should be exposed as more spin. People have worked hard to pay their taxes and do not need their money to be spent badly. More importantly, those who get least from the Government are on lower incomes. It is outrageous that they still pay tax.</p>
          <p eId="para_323">I advise the Minister of State not to become too smug because there are many parallels with what happened in 1977. The electorate will send a clear message to the Government in the forthcoming local and European elections.</p>

          <from>Mr. Healy</from>
          <p eId="para_324">I thank the Fine Gael Party for agreeing to share time. Deputy Conor Lenihan said the Fianna Fáil Party told no lies during the last general election campaign. His idea of the truth is unusual. We are all aware of the letter sent by the Minister for Finance to the then Fine Gael Party leader, Deputy Noonan. It clearly  stated no cuts, either secret or otherwise, were being planned.</p>
          <p eId="para_325">The Government had planned these cutbacks because on 5 December 2001 it furnished the details to the European Union as part of its compliance with the Union's stability and growth pact. These include the cutbacks reported in the newspapers in recent months. They affect spending on health, education, the environment, roads and in various other areas. The total amount involved is approximately €1 billion. This is in addition to cuts in spending of approximately €450 million, introduced within weeks of the Government taking office.</p>
          <p eId="para_326">The Government was totally dishonest about these cuts during the general election campaign. It was a campaign of fraud and deception on the electorate. We were told the Celtic tiger was alive and well, that it would have cubs and that things would never be the same again, that there was plenty of money and that once the Government was re-elected the good times would continue. However, as far back as last December these cuts were planned by the Government in a fraudulent, deceptive and dishonest manner.</p>
          <p eId="para_327">These cuts attempt to make the ordinary people, including PAYE workers, social welfare recipients and small business people, pay for the mismanagement of the public finances by the Fianna Fáil and Progressive Democrats Government over the past five years. It is seeking to make ordinary people pay for the huge amounts of money shovelled into the pockets of the rich. CORI has outlined how the gap between rich and poor has widened over the past five years. For example, the income gap between a person earning €50,000 a year and one getting long-term unemployment benefit has widened by €240 per week. It is rip-off time for the rich while there is little or nothing for ordinary people. The Government now wants ordinary people to pay again by way of these cuts. People will not accept this. They no longer trust the Government, which will get its answer in the Nice treaty referendum.</p>
          <p eId="para_328">The Minister does not need to make these cuts. In the past ten days, especially at a meeting in Brussels on Tuesday, he confirmed that there will be a current budget surplus in 2002 of €4.5 billion. There is no necessity for these cuts. The Government is being dishonest. The cuts in expenditure of €450 million for this year and the projected cuts of €1 billion for next year could be easily offset by the budget surplus for this year.</p>

          <from>Mr. Crowe</from>
          <p eId="para_329">During the general election campaign we were told the economy was in great shape. Ministers travelled throughout the country telling people of the great work they were doing. Perhaps in some instances they did some good work, but now, only a couple of months later, we are told the economy has gone pear shaped. If the last Administration had lost the election, it would probably blame the incoming one for this.</p>
          <p eId="para_330">Backbenchers from various parties have said the country is rudderless. Perhaps this is because  they have been kept in the dark about the economy. The cutbacks are hurting the least well off. Deputy Conor Lenihan speculated as to the reason people voted they way they did. They voted for different reasons. Perhaps some were happy with the outgoing Administration and opted for a steady ship.</p>
          <p eId="para_331">I believe people voted for change. They voted for an Ireland of equals and the reinforcement of the peace process. They wanted to see an end to hospital waiting lists, they do not want their children to have to wait six to nine months for an operation. They also wanted to see the housing crisis resolved. Threshold has referred to a local authority housing waiting list of 55,000. The list is getting longer in my local authority area and this seems to be replicated around the country.</p>
          <p eId="para_332">The Minister for the Environment and Local Government has suggested that the 20% social and affordable housing development provision in the Planning and Development Act, to be imposed on new developments, may be scrapped. This is another example of the Government helping out its friends – speculators, developers and so on. The Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Dempsey, chose the most vulnerable section in the education system for his cutbacks. It is nothing less than lunacy to cut planned initiatives to reduce the school drop out rate, schemes aimed at attracting students from disadvantaged areas to third level and adult education courses.</p>
          <p eId="para_333">There are few areas where we have not heard of possible cutbacks, but they are not actually cuts – we are told they are adjustments. I can imagine some spin doctor sitting up all night to come up with this new term and God knows how much it costs the taxpayer to have them do that. This is Orwellian-speak to say they are adjustments rather than cuts but the reality is that they are cuts. People are asking how the Government got elected on such a shaky platform but clearly anyone who did vote for it is having second thoughts now. It is clear that the Government's popularity has dropped. The Taoiseach or Tánaiste do not have to go around north County Dublin climbing trees to find out what is wrong. People feel they were conned, that they were asked to vote for a particular programme yet it was clear within a matter of days of the election results that we would have a U-turn on these policies.</p>
          <p eId="para_334">The well-off are getting better off and the gap between rich and poor is widening. We do not have a situation of greater equality and it is becoming harder for people to gain access to essential services. We are actually being asked to commend the Government rather than condemn it for its ineptitude regarding the handling of the economy. A number of vanity projects have been put forward and we have wasted the wealth of the boom years. We should not be commending the Government but condemning it.</p>

          <from>Mr. F. McGrath</from>
          <p eId="para_335">I welcome the debate on the management of the public finances. This is a very important debate but it should have been held earlier in the summer. There should have been an early recall of the Dáil to discuss the matter.</p>
          <p eId="para_336">We have a major crisis in the public finances and this is a great concern for everybody. The situation has been caused by bad management of the economy over the past five years. The Minister for Finance has to take responsibility for his actions. He was elected on the hard man image of tough management of the economy, yet within five years his policies have gone way out of line. He has adopted the Maggie Thatcher philosophy of life which is not acceptable. I would give him two out of ten for his performance.</p>
          <p eId="para_337">The Government has squandered the resources of the Celtic tiger. The 33 poorest schools in the country have to operate on a budget of €7,000 per year and they submit their figures every June and give their costings for literacy programmes, disadvantaged programmes and art programmes. They are always on budget and on time yet we have a Minister for Finance who cannot even do that.</p>
          <p eId="para_338">Some 20% of our people are still living in poverty and that is not acceptable. There is a crisis in the health services with 7,000 people in the Dublin area on waiting lists. Of course we have to address the issue of from where the resources come. The first item on the agenda we have to face up to is that tax cuts for the wealthy over the past number of years were harmful to the economy. We have to be creative and radical and look at alternative ways of raising revenue. We have to revisit the debate on corporation tax, although I know some people have concerns about investment. Smokers in Ireland contribute €1 billion to the economy. If one takes the amount of money taken in taxation on alcohol over the past few years there is room to take in more money.</p>
          <p eId="para_339">We have to prioritise spending. Investment in poor and disadvantaged areas needs to be the first priority. I do not accept the line that is being spun with regard to the health services, that it is a waste of public money to invest in the health service. Let us take the situation of St. Michael's House in Ballymun which has a waiting list of 345 adults with disabilities. Seven of the parents of these adults are terminally ill yet they cannot access the service. It would cost in the region of €11 million to €15 million to provide the service. We took in €17 million as a result of the Ansbacher investigations.</p>
          <p eId="para_340">We also have a situation of economic madness where adults with disabilities in the Dublin region are receiving services in County Westmeath. The services are outside the area in which they live. This does not make social, political or economic sense. Another example of this is a playgroup in Edenmore that looks after autistic children that is €20,000 short this year to appoint a member of staff to work with these children. The health board cannot get the money to run the service. I do not accept that. We need a taxation system  which allows us to look after our people, particularly the poor and those with disabilities.</p>
          <p eId="para_341">We have a crisis and something needs to be done about it, but the bottom line is that cuts are not the solution. I concur with the points made by previous speakers about some parties making big promises. I disagree with big promises being made before elections. The best thing to do is to be straight and honest with the people and they will respect one for it. The public was misled before the general election. We are now facing cuts of €900 million. Those who agree with them should think of people on the waiting lists, the poor, adults and children with disabilities as well as those with literacy problems who are losing out in the €150 million education cuts. Managing the public finances has to be a priority but it should not be at the expense of the poorer members of society.</p>

          <from>Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mr. Parlon)</from>
          <p eId="para_342">I am glad of the opportunity to speak on this motion and to explain how the Government has shown its commitment to prudent management of the public finances. We set out our policy in this regard in the programme for Government, where we clearly stated that we are committed to responsible fiscal policies within the context of the EU stability and growth pact. That pact requires that we keep the general Government finances at least close to balance and that we take corrective action when there is an actual or expected divergence from this aim. The Government will keep this commitment.</p>
          <p eId="para_343">It was to make sure that this commitment is met and that public spending growth this year is kept to its target increase of 14%, or €2.8 billion over 2002, that a new system of monthly expenditure reports to Government was introduced at the beginning of this year. When this process identified potential spending overruns, action was taken to deal with them.</p>
          <p eId="para_344">With regard to the statements on the alleged misrepresentation of the budgetary position to the public, I believe the record will show that there is no basis for this. The Minister explained yesterday in the House how at the end of every month this year, Exchequer statements were published by the Department of Finance clearly showing the outturn for receipts and expenditure and the overall Exchequer position. In addition, at the end of every quarter this year there has been a media briefing. This briefing gave details of the expected end of year position on tax receipts, spending and the overall Exchequer balance. This represents a clear system of reporting to the public on the Exchequer's finances. In this way the public has been kept fully informed of the developing situation regarding the public finances, both before and after 17 May.</p>
          <p eId="para_345">The record shows that while the position of the public finances was disappointing in the early months of the year, it was not unreasonable to  believe before the end of May that the budget targets were achievable.</p>

          <p eId="para_349">Facts are facts and unfortunately that is the real world in which we live.</p>
          <p eId="para_350">The record shows that the position of the public finances was disappointing. At the end of May the year-on-year increase in expenditure showed a sharp increase to 27% which increased concern about the end of year spending outturn. To ensure spending for the year came into line with the original planned increase of 14% or €2.8 billion action had to be taken. This type of mid-year adjustment is a frequent occurrence in the management and control of public expenditure.</p>
          <p eId="para_351">On 19 June, in a written statement, the Minister for Finance stated the forecast Exchequer balance for the end of the year was still for a surplus of €170 million – the budget day target. On publication of the end of June Exchequer statement the Minister published a press statement which noted the Exchequer surplus at the time and stated this was in line with achieving a surplus for the year as a whole, with extra non-tax and other revenues compensating for the shortfall in taxes then projected. However, the budgetary position forecast for the end of the year deteriorated by the end of September.</p>
          <p eId="para_352">The facts for every month show the deteriorating position, which was flagged by the Department of Finance and the Minister. There is no basis for the statements that the public was misled about the state of the public finances or about the limits—</p>

          <p eId="para_362">The public finances are in crisis. The Minister of State was not involved, yet he defends it. I am surprised by that. The public was misled during the general election. We heard from the Minister of State's party and Fianna Fáil, especially the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, that the level of spending and services during the good times would continue during the lifetime of the current Government. Despite this, within three weeks of taking office, it began to cut and slash and we have seen revealed in a Sunday newspaper a detailed memorandum of cutbacks, something the Government did not want us to see. This was known to the Government prior to the general election. Unfortunately, the cuts will affect the poorer and weaker sections of society, especially the elderly.</p>
          <p eId="para_363">I asked in a parliamentary question yesterday about work to be completed under the special housing aid for the elderly scheme. These are essential works for elderly people living alone or with an elderly partner. In the Mid-Western Health Board area 1,385 elderly people await work to be completed on their houses by the board. In the Midland Health Board area 1,077 await work to be completed on their houses under the scheme. Overall, 9,700 elderly people await work to be completed on their houses. We have been told by our health board it hopes finance will be made available to do this work this month. Will adequate finance be available to give 9,700 elderly people some form of decent accommodation under the scheme?</p>
          <p eId="para_364">The key issue in the general election was health. The people were told that waiting lists would disappear in two years. With the present cutbacks, surely that does not have any credibility. The first action taken after the Government assumed office was to direct health boards to return some of the money previously allocated to them.</p>

          <p eId="para_372">The treatment of children at risk is a key issue. It may be considered minor because it does not have many votes in it, but it is important nonetheless. Will the promised seven psychiatric units catering for children and adolescents be constructed in the lifetime of the Government? I do not believe they will. A working group established in 2000 recommended the development of child and adolescent psychiatry and presented its report to the Minister for Health and Children in March. It contained proposals for the development of services for the management and treatment of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and child and adolescent psychiatric in-patient units. It recommended the enhancement and expansion of overall child and adolescent psychiatric services throughout the country and closer liaison and interaction with the education system and other areas of community health services. It also recommended that seven in-patient psychiatric units catering for children aged between six and 16 years should be established throughout the country with a focus on assessment and treatment of psychiatric, emotional or family disorders, including major adjustment, anxiety, mood and eating disorders and schizophrenia, using a variety of treatment approaches. I understand this will not happen during the life of the Government. Will the Minister of State confirm this? We were expecting work to commence this year, but believe it may not now happen in the life of the Government. If that is so, it is a disgrace.</p>

          <p eId="para_373">Deputy Richard Bruton has proposed on behalf of the Fine Gael Party that a Bill should be introduced to give fiscal responsibility and accountability in the public finances. This is necessary because it would bring clarity to the  business of public finance and allow for constructive opposition and debate in the House.</p>
          <p eId="para_374">Figures released by the Central Statistics Office this morning show that the growth rate is 4.6% which is less than was envisaged. It has fallen from the 10% to 11% of last year. There has been a change from a rapid rate of growth to a rapid rate of decline. The figures produced by the Government show the extent of the massaging which has taken place, such as taking money from the social insurance fund, the Central Bank, State assets and the euro changeover. We are in a position where the ESRI may not be far out in its assessment of the borrowing requirement for next year of €3.2 billion.</p>
          <p eId="para_375">It is clear that the first 125 days of the Government have been nothing short of a shambles. It culminated in the leak of a document into the public domain which came, not from the Department of Finance, but from the Department of Foreign Affairs. If the Government's economic framework is in a shambles, so too is every aspect of its policy – every promise, strategy and initiative. If the money is not available, every promise is a false one. It will cripple ordinary people and not those who were the sole beneficiaries of legislation introduced here or the beneficiaries of the acquisition of sites like the Battle of the Boyne or Irish citizens that the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy McDowell, is now examining named Masri and Mahfouz. I understand he has some documentation which may be of interest to us all.</p>
          <p eId="para_376">The people who will be crippled are those who were conned out of their vote, who face the highest inflation rate in Europe, with casualty charges up by 26%, college registration fees up by 70%, VHI up by 18% and the drugs refund threshold up by 22%. Among them are the 165,000 people on the live register – 24,000 more than last year. If the jobless number increases at the current rate, all job gains since 1997 will be gone. We need a proper and informed public debate on the true state of the public finances and the fiscal responsibility Bill proposed by Deputy Bruton would add greatly to the stature of the House and to the structured debates we should have here.</p>

          <p eId="para_378">The state of the public finances is too serious a matter to shirk because every policy in every Department is affected. The Minister for Finance told Pat Kenny on his radio programme that tax receipts would fall short by €500 million. Five days later he said that the situation would be worse. A week after that, with the Exchequer returns, it was shown to be nearly three times worse with a shortfall of €1.3 billion. He has now embarked on act two of his financial farce. He expects us to believe that after nine months of  almost 20% expenditure growth, that it will be kept to just 3% in the last quarter. Is that feasible or realistic?</p>

          <from>Mr. Kenny</from>
          <p eId="para_380">This is pure rubbish. More than that it is a farce if not a folly. This year will not be salvaged in terms of the Minister's projections. It is not possible to start 2003 with the millstone of deferred 2002 payments around his neck. This would do irreparable damage to the nation's finances, because he will fool himself into believing that somehow it will all go away, but it will not go away.</p>
          <p eId="para_381">The Minister blames economic downturn, but that, too, is rubbish. The reality is that for three years expenditure was allowed to grow at three times the rate of economic growth and it is impossible to slow that down in the last quarter of this year.</p>
          <p eId="para_382">Neither Fianna Fáil nor the Progressive Democrats has a mandate to raise direct taxes. Even if the Minister did, by his own admission he does not know how much a 1% increase would generate. He talked about taxing employment by raising PRSI, but he said last year that the social insurance fund was in surplus and could afford to pay €650 million to the Exchequer. I am not sure that is correct.</p>
          <p eId="para_383">Events in the Middle East may make fuel prices volatile which will further erode our competitiveness. I advise the Minister for Finance to spell out his best estimate and not a "guesstimate" for 2003. He is predicting a deficit of €750 million for 2002. How much once-off income is included in arriving at this? The Minister must explain how much he is saving by deferring items to 2003. That is a simple enough task. He must spell out for the House, the social partners and the people, how much will be available for public services next year. We spend €31 billion a year. Some €5 billion is spent on social welfare and of the remaining €26 billion, over half is absorbed by health and education. If cutbacks, or adjustments as the Government calls them, must be made these areas will be hit. If the Minister will not call a spade a spade, he should at least have the honesty to admit that spending more money than last year does not mean services are improved. The public understands the concept of inflation, as it should because it has had enough experience of it.</p>
          <p eId="para_384">Over the next eight weeks, we will be presented with three vital things: the abridged Estimates volume, the White Paper on income and expenditure and the 2003 budget. It may well be the most important budget for many years. If the Taoiseach, the Tánaiste and the Minister for Finance continue to hide from the truth, as Government speakers have done repeatedly in this debate, then this critical budget will be another creature of spin over substance.</p>
          <p eId="para_385">The time for that debate and clear information is now. The Government should agree with the proposal of Deputy Bruton to introduce a fiscal responsibility Bill to allow clarity about the truth of the public finances which would in turn give  us clarity in terms of constructive opposition and presentation of our ideas in the House.</p>

        <speech by="#SimonCoveney" eId="spk_281">
          <from>Mr. Coveney</from>
          <p eId="para_399">I wish to share my time with Deputy Naughten. I do not take any pleasure in making a contribution to this debate on the issue of the Flood tribunal's interim report into certain planning matters and payments. This is an issue of huge importance. No political report published in my political lifetime has caused such public anger and revulsion. I have read large sections of the report and I understand why this is the case. I commend Mr. Justice Flood for his direct use of language and his ability to go directly to the point with bluntness and relative simplicity, considering the complexities of what his tribunal is investigating.</p>
          <p eId="para_400">The contents of this report are a damning description of bribery and corruption at the top of Irish politics and business under the Fianna Fáil banner. The message is clear that there was a time not so long ago when favours could be bought from a certain Minister for commercial end within a golden circle where business, politics, bribery, corruption and profiteering were all intertwined.</p>
          <p eId="para_401">Lest anyone listening to this debate thinks I am exaggerating in my description of the contents of  this report, I recommend that they read chapter 16, summary of conclusions. In a little over two pages, Mr. Justice Flood outlines his list of evidence and comments in no uncertain terms on the many corrupt activities of Mr. Ray Burke as a councillor, a Deputy and a Minister.</p>
          <p eId="para_402">I refer to a number of short extracts from the report to remind people just how damning it is in relation to the former Minister. Chapter 16, under the heading offshore bank accounts, states that a payment of £50,000 sterling on 21 December 1982 was a corrupt payment made by Mr. Tom Brennan to Mr. Burke. It states that a payment of £35,000 sterling to Caviar Limited on 19 April 1984 was a corrupt payment to Mr. Burke, probably made to him by Mr. Tom Brennan and his associates. It further states that a payment of £60,000 sterling to Caviar Limited in November 1984 was a corrupt payment to Mr. Burke and that a payment of £15,000 to the account of Caviar Limited on 19 April 1985 was a corrupt payment to Mr. Burke which was funded jointly by Mr. Tom Brennan and Mr. Joseph McGowan.</p>
          <p eId="para_403">When referring to a meeting at Mr. Burke's home and a payment of £80,000, Mr. Justice Flood states that Mr. Burke assured those present at the time of the payment of moneys to him that he understood that the payment was made in connection with the proposal to alter the planning status of the Murphy lands and further assured those present that he would honour his commitment to do so. The report states that the payment received by Mr. Burke amounted to a corrupt payment and all present at the meeting were aware that it was such.</p>
          <p eId="para_404">This report has confirmed in the minds of many people their worst fears of just how crooked certain senior politicians were in the past. We have a job to do as politicians to convince people that those murky days are now behind us but the only way to do that is by exposing the whole truth, punishing by law those who deserve it, moving on, learning the lessons of the past and putting safeguards in place to ensure that such events cannot happen in the future. The final part of the Fine Gael motion attempts to do that.</p>
          <p eId="para_405">The Flood and Moriarty tribunals are playing a vital role in achieving the first part of this goal – finding the truth. People outside this House may not know it but there are four Deputies in their 20s and six Deputies under the age of 35 in my party, starting out a career in politics with all the right motivations for public service. There are many others in this House who have never met Mr. Ray Burke. I can truthfully say I have never met him, yet we, as politicians of the present and the future, must counteract the cynicism and anger directed at us following the activities of certain people in a different generation of politicians on a daily basis. With this in mind, was it too much to ask the Taoiseach to voluntarily answer questions as part of this debate and to explain why he made the decisions he did in relation to  the appointment of Mr. Ray Burke as Minister for Foreign Affairs?</p>
          <p eId="para_406">The Taoiseach said yesterday that he had no questions to answer on this matter. Let me tell him that we have questions to ask. If he has nothing to hide, why not, in the interests of transparency and co-operation in this House, of being up front with this country and the electorate who re-elected him as Taoiseach and of the 100,000 people who purchased or downloaded this report, make himself available for an hour or two for an open question and answer session? This is not a time to be obstructive to open debate or to frustrate the Opposition, which has valid questions to try to clear up – questions we have raised in the media and questions being asked in every pub and every political household in the country.</p>
          <p eId="para_407">I have responsibility for the area of communications in Fine Gael. Unfortunately, Mr. Burke's corrupt activity was not solely confined to planning matters. While he was Minister for Communications in 1989, he was, as Mr. Justice Flood outlines, also involved in receiving a corrupt payment and acted in the interests of those who paid him, not in the interests of the public who elected him. Again in chapter 16, Mr. Justice Flood gives us a very concise description of Mr. Burke's relationship with the promoters of Century, the corrupt payment he received and the actions he took. I will read into the record exactly what was said. Under the heading Century Radio, the report states:</p>
          <p eId="para_408">16-12 The Ministerial Directive obliging RTE to provide its facilities to Century issued by Mr. Burke as Minister for Communications on the 14th March 1989, was issued to advance the private interests of the promoters of Century and not to serve the public interest.</p>
          <p eId="para_409">16-13 The payment of £35,000 to Mr. Burke by Mr. Barry on the 26th May 1989 was a corrupt payment made in response to a demand for the £30,000 cash by Mr. Burke, and was not intended by Mr. Barry to be a political donation to Mr. Burke or to Fianna Fáil.</p>
          <p eId="para_410">16-14. In proposing legislation which would have had the effect of curbing RTEs advertising, altering the format of 2FM, and diverting broadcasting licence fee income from RTE to independent broadcasters, Mr. Burke was acting in response to demands made of him by the promoters of Century and was not serving the public interest.</p>
          <p eId="para_411">16-15 The payment of £35,000 to Mr. Burke by Mr. Barry ensured that he was available to serve the interests of Century's promoters, as is evidenced by his willingness to meet with their bankers and to give them assurances that he would take steps, including, if necessary, the introduction of legislation which would be to Century's financial benefit.</p>
          <p eId="para_412">The difference between corrupt decision making relating to zoning matters and decisions relating to Century Radio is that ministerial directives and  the proposing of legislation require Cabinet approval and carry collective responsibility. I ask the Taoiseach whether anybody raised an eyebrow at Mr. Burke's favourable treatment of Century Radio at the time and the curbing of RTE's ability to raise revenue. In the light of what we have heard from Mr. Justice Flood, will the Taoiseach instigate investigations into other key directives or decisions made by the then Minister, Mr. Burke? If a corrupt payment was accepted in return for ministerial decisions in the broadcasting area, is it not reasonable to at least ask questions about other decisions made by Mr. Ray Burke and the motivations for these decisions when he was a Minister – for example, the circumstances surrounding the changes made to oil and gas exploration licensing when he was Minister for Energy and Communications?</p>
          <p eId="para_413">These are the type of issues we, as an Opposition, wish to tease out with the Taoiseach by way of a question and answer session in this House, but he has refused to do that. There is now no provision to ask supplementary questions. If we are not clear on the answers provided to us in the prepared script which the Taoiseach will read, we have no facility to come back and question him. We cannot, therefore, do our job as an Opposition and hold the Taoiseach to account for decisions he and his Governments have taken in the past.</p>
          <p eId="para_414">The signal going out to the public from this debate is that politicians will not answer straight questions and will not give straight answers. Mr. Justice Flood has served the public well in his work and in the publication of this report by shining a bright light into a dark corner of shady political dealings in the recent past. Unfortunately, the Taoiseach is not helping his cause with his attitude towards this debate.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#DenisNaughten" eId="spk_282">
          <from>Mr. Naughten</from>
          <p eId="para_415">I welcome the opportunity to contribute to the debate. "He always tried to do the right thing and do it by the rules. History will judge him for his achievements, not unsubstantiated innuendo that may well fall away now that its purpose has been achieved."  Those were the comments of the Taoiseach in this House on 8 October 1997. The Taoiseach was speaking of the same individual who was found by Mr. Justice Flood to be corrupt and to have acted in a corrupt manner.</p>
          <p eId="para_416">The Taoiseach claims that there was no evidence of corruption surrounding Ray Burke at the time of his appointment, yet on three separate occasions over three decades there were major exposés in national publications raising serious questions about Ray Burke and the issue of planning which go back to 1974, 28 years ago.</p>
          <p eId="para_417">In November 1994 the former Taoiseach, Mr. Albert Reynolds, warned the Taoiseach not to appoint Ray Burke. He provided the Taoiseach with information which concerned Mr. Reynolds and which was enough not to appoint Mr. Burke in 1992. This should have set the alarm bells ringing. Mr. Reynolds also referred the Taoiseach  to Máire Geoghegan-Quinn, the then Minister for Justice, who expressed her concerns. Deputy Michael Smith had previously carried out an investigation into land rezoning and subsequently declared that land rezoning in the Dublin area had become a bankrupt currency. This report has shown how correct Deputy Smith was.</p>
          <p eId="para_418">The Taoiseach also knew, prior to Mr. Burke's appointment in 1997, that he had received €100,000 in today's terms from JMSE, but the damning indictment was the fact that while Ray Burke told the Taoiseach that he had received the money, at the same time a JMSE executive, Joseph Murphy Jr., stated that he had not given this money to Mr. Burke in evidence given to Deputy Dermot Ahern when he met Mr. Murphy Jr. in London. It is incomprehensible why the Taoiseach's alarm bells did not ring when he had a stark contradiction regarding the information which was provided to him by Mr. Ray Burke and Deputy Dermot Ahern. How did he square the circle? He must tell us. Why did he not resolve this issue prior to Mr. Burke's appointment? Why did he not meet with Mr. James Gogarty about the claims he had made? This is the key flaw in the Taoiseach's defence. Would he not have checked with Fianna Fáil headquarters as to the source of the £10,000 donation from Ray Burke? Surely, if there was a question mark over from whom Mr. Burke had received it, he should have checked that with the party. However, the Taoiseach claims that he did not ask the question. If he had, he would have found out that the £10,000 came from Rennicks and not JMSE.</p>
          <p eId="para_419">In the Dáil on 28 May 1998, speaking on whether the Taoiseach knew of the £30,000 payment to Ray Burke prior to his appointment, he gave three different accounts of the story in the same debate. Initially he stated:</p>
          <p eId="para_420">On the day I appointed the then Deputy Burke as Minister I was working on the understanding that no money had been given to him.</p>
          <p eId="para_421">In his second explanation, referring to Mr. Burke, he stated:</p>
          <p eId="para_422">I cannot recall if I asked him if he received money from Murphys or JMSE. I was more worried as to what it was all about. In terms of any discussions I would have had with him, he did not tell me about that contribution.</p>
          <p eId="para_423">In the same debate, he later stated:</p>
          <p eId="para_424">Ray Burke told me the story before he came into this House to make the statement. The fact was I then knew that Ray Burke had received a contribution of £30,000.</p>
          <p eId="para_425">We want the Taoiseach to clarify his position regarding the three contradictory statements that he gave the House on 28 may 1998.</p>
          <p eId="para_426">On 8 October 1997, he told the House that there was still an element of uncertainty as to the sum invested in the Mahfouz passport case, which was directly handled by Mr Ray Burke. In addition, the then Minister, Máire Geoghegan- Quinn, when she investigated, raised serious concerns regarding those passports and questioned whether they should be withdrawn or not. The Taoiseach stated in the House on that occasion that he had no difficulty in having this, or any other aspect of this matter, further examined.</p>
          <p eId="para_427">I ask the Taoiseach to account for the supposed £20 million that was proposed to be invested in businesses in this country. He has had enough time over the past five years to check this out and investigate it thoroughly. Of the £20 million, up to £9 million, or €11.4 million, remains unaccounted for. Of the £11 million pounds invested here, £2 million was invested in the equestrian centre in Millstreet yet Noel C. Duggan denies ever receiving the sum. There is a further discrepancy in relation to that. Mr. Duggan's denial should have sent alarm bells ringing for the Taoiseach.</p>
          <p eId="para_428">Yesterday in the House the Taoiseach stated that he was not prepared to answer questions directly as it would set a precedent. He was not prepared to set down the standard for transparency and accountability in the Dáil and this has resulted in the frustration on this side and among the public about the lack of answers from him. This tribunal has set a new precedent, which is the finding of corruption by a Minister appointed by this House and nominated by the Taoiseach. That puts a black mark on each and every one of us in this House. Some may pass this off, but many new Members on both sides of the House are being tarred by the same brush as Ray Burke. To ensure clarity, accountability and transparency, the Taoiseach should answer questions. This report has set a precedent because never before in the State's history has any Minister been found to have acted in a corrupt manner, and that Minister was appointed by the Taoiseach. There were serious question marks over that Minister prior to his appointment. The previous Taoiseach and leader of the Fianna Fáil Party provided the Taoiseach with information and expressed concerns about Mr. Burke.</p>
          <p eId="para_429">One issue, which I expect Deputy Michael Smith, the Minister for Defence, can throw some light on in his contribution today, is the decision to tax designate the Golden Island site. This issue has been teased out in every pub in Athlone over the past ten years. I ask the Minister to clarify how a greenfield site out of town was designated for the purposes of tax relief when the Labour Party had walked out of Government and against the advice of his departmental officials. I ask him to clarify that matter.</p>

          <p eId="para_432">The publication of the report of the Flood tribunal marks the beginning of a new era in Irish politics. It has established the facts. Documents have been obtained through discovery, witnesses have been cross-examined and banks have been required to deliver up private accounts. Clear and conclusive findings of corruption have now been made. The report is a resounding statement of this State's determination to root out and expose corruption. In this Republic nobody is above or beyond the law.</p>
          <p eId="para_433">Mr. Justice Flood has already referred his report to the Director of Public Prosecutions, and it raises issues within the remit of a number of statutory agencies including the Criminal Assets Bureau, the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement and the Revenue Commissioners. The steps that will be taken by these agencies of the State – which are invested with statutory powers – will mark the next phase in the process of rooting out corruption in public life. Some of those who acted corruptly went to extraordinary lengths to cover their tracks, but the veil of secrecy has at last been torn down. Corruption has been exposed in the unforgiving light of day. We owe a debt of gratitude to Mr. Justice Flood. On behalf of the Government, the Fianna Fáil Party, and my own behalf, I convey our deep gratitude.</p>
          <p eId="para_434">Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats promised to lay down a fair and honest basis for the conduct of Irish public life. In Government, we proposed and the Oireachtas agreed to the establishment of the tribunals. The interim report of the tribunal is a report to this House. It is a valuable lesson on the past and a wise warning for the future. Politics is about public service first and last. It is not about personal profit. It is not about power for powers sake. It is about doing the people's business honestly and openly. It is about cherishing a deep respect for the trust our neighbours and community gave us when they sent us here on their behalf.</p>
          <p eId="para_435">The first challenge that faced the last Dáil was to ensure that the Flood tribunal proceeded with its work. That was done with great effect. The challenge facing us now is how to respond appropriately to the findings of Mr. Justice Flood. Words are no substitute for action. This Government is determined upon appropriate action. I have already indicated that it is the intention of the Government to ensure the rapid enactment of legislation to provide for a corruption assets bureau. The principal elements of the legislation will be as follows: the creation of a specially trained and dedicated unit devoted to the recovery of assets obtained through corruption or whose value has been enhanced by corruption; a power for the High Court to appoint inspectors to examine the affairs of individuals or companies suspected of involvement in corruption; the entitlement of a senior Garda officer who is applying to the High Court for the appointment of an inspector, to form an opinion on the existence of corruption based on the contents of a tribunal report, regardless of when that report was  published; and the indexing of the value of assets corruptly obtained or purchased with the proceeds of corruption so that the amount which is forfeited is the present day value of those assets. This new law will operate as a civil remedy. It will apply to corrupt acts both before and after enactment of this legislation. It will also apply to the report of a tribunal issued before the passing of the Act. This new legislative framework, underpinned by a determination to rebuild confidence in politics, is the good that has already come out of Flood and other inquires.</p>
          <p eId="para_436">Our society is changing rapidly. It is coming to terms with change in a way that has few parallels in other democracies. The Government has initiated the most far reaching inquiries, not only in the history of this State, but in the recent history of most democratic countries. We are determined to find the truth, whatever it is. In Government we have established: Flood to inquire into payments to politicians, Moriarty to inquire into payments to politicians, Lindsay to inquire into the contamination of blood products, Costello to inquire into the Ansbacher accounts, Dunne to inquire into organ retention in our hospitals, Blaney to inquire into irregularities at National Irish Bank, Murphy to inquire into abuse in swimming, Laffoy to inquire into childhood abuse, Barr to inquire into Abbeylara and Morris to inquire into events in Donegal.</p>
          <p eId="para_437">Lessons are being learnt and times are changing. It is one of the proudest achievements of the last Government that it put in place a modern and comprehensive legislative framework for the conduct of public affairs for the future. To illustrate the elements of the effective regulatory regime now in place for the enforcement of proper ethical standards in politics, I refer among other important legislation passed to a number of Tribunals of Inquiry (Evidence) Acts in 1997 and 1998, Electoral (Amendment) Acts, 1998 and 2001, the Local Elections (Disclosure of Donations and Expenditure) Act, 1999, the Standards in Public Office Act, 2001, the Prevention of Corruption (Amendment) Act, 2001 and the Oireachtas (Ministerial and Parliamentary Offices) (Amendment) Act, 2001.</p>
          <p eId="para_438">Of particular importance is the fact that the Standards in Public Office Commission is empowered to carry out inquires and investigations into the conduct of politicians and those in public life. The commission is chaired by a High Court judge and has powers to order the production of documentation and information. It is a permanent statutory body set up to monitor, investigate and regulate the conduct of those elected to serve the people. This is to ensure the maintenance of high standards in public office. The requirement of this Act imposed on politicians and others is to have their tax affairs in order and to swear a statutory declaration that this is so. This was a recommendation made by Fianna Fáil to the McCracken tribunal. It is now the law of the land. An independent and powerful Standards in Public Office Commission is the best  guarantee that what has happened in the past is unlikely to happen again in the future. The general election for the 29th Dáil on 17 May was the first time the people went to the polls with this new legislative framework in operation. It is a framework for disclosure and provides for accountability in the future.</p>
          <p eId="para_439">Before referring in more detail to the appointment of Mr. Burke I wish to make a general comment about the exposure of those in public life to rumour and innuendo. Slightly over two and a half years ago a very serious allegation of corruption was made against me by Mr. Denis "Starry" O'Brien. The suggestion that I had been paid the sum of £50,000, as a bribe, in the car park of the Burlington Hotel, received massive publicity. It was carried in a Sunday newspaper and covered extensively in other national media. The finger of blame was pointed firmly at me. The rumour machine was in overdrive and the speculation, directed against my character was rampant. However, as we all know, this allegation was baseless, as was established firmly and conclusively in a court of law. If others had formed a judgment about me based on the rumours disseminated by the media and Mr. "Starry" O'Brien, would I have been judged fit to continue in office as Taoiseach?</p>
          <p eId="para_440">More malicious rumours were trotted out by Deputy Enda Kenny as recently as last night. In my absence, Deputy Kenny insinuated that there might be some truth in a rumour that I accepted large bribes between 1989 and 1992. I made my position on this matter crystal clear: I have never received a bribe in my life. It is sad to see that Fine Gael has grown so desperate that it has sunk to recycling discredited rumour.</p>

          <p eId="para_442">Likewise, Deputy Quinn this morning made yet again another baseless allegation against me in relation to Elan. I am neither the first nor the last politician to be the subject of baseless rumours. All of us in political life have long since learned not to judge our colleagues on rumour, but on firm evidence and proven facts. It is neither fair nor just to ruin the career of or pour scorn on any individual on the basis of unsubstantiated rumour or speculation. Political life would rapidly become impossible on all sides of the House if it were sufficient to make an unfounded allegation to force someone out of public life.</p>
          <p eId="para_443">We are a society based on the rule of law. Accusation is not the same as proof. Speculation is not equivalent to evidence. Every citizen is entitled to the presumption of innocence until his wrongdoing is proven. Tribunals establish the facts having examined all of the evidence obtained by the exercise of statutory powers that are backed up by the criminal law and the contempt jurisdiction of the High Court.</p>
          <p eId="para_444">I have been criticised for appointing Ray Burke to the Cabinet in 1997. My decision at the time  was a bona fide one based on Mr. Burke's undisputed political abilities, his categorical assurances that he had done nothing wrong and my own inquiries. The fact that I subsequently described him as "an honourable man" shows that I genuinely believed the assurances of Mr. Burke when I questioned him.</p>
          <p eId="para_445">I want to outline the inquiries that were carried out in respect of rumours and media allegations concerning the payment of moneys in relation to planning matters. All of these are the issues I gave to the Flood tribunal. Prior to the formation of the last Government I spoke with Ray Burke on several occasions about these allegations. He assured me that he had done nothing wrong in relation to any political donation. Mr. Burke stated that, in the context of the 1989 election, he had received a political donation in the sum of £30,000 from a building firm and that he had done nothing wrong in respect of that donation. In addition, the matter was raised with JMSE, Bovale and a number of party members in Dublin. Aside from unsubstantiated rumour, I had no evidence that Mr. Burke engaged in any act of corruption.</p>
          <p eId="para_446">Shortly before the appointment of Mr. Burke, I had a meeting with the Commissioner of An Garda Síochána who I met in connection with, among other things, a briefing on my own security arrangements as Taoiseach elect and for the transport arrangements for the new Cabinet. In the course of that conversation with the Commissioner I took the opportunity to raise with him the issue of allegations of wrongdoing, that had been referred to by Donnelly, Neary, Donnelly, Solicitors, Newry, in respect of the planning process and I asked him if he was aware of the position on any such matters relating to Mr. Burke. I had a subsequent telephone call from the Commissioner who had looked into the investigations of such allegations and, in the light of what I was told by him in respect of Ray Burke and planning matters, my assessment was confirmed that the rumours relating to him were unsubstantiated. I was, therefore, satisfied to proceed with his appointment.</p>
          <p eId="para_447">I have been queried as to why I did not interview James Gogarty prior to the appointment of Mr. Burke. I was told that Mr. Gogarty was at that time refusing to sign any statement for the gardaí. To have sought to interview Mr. Gogarty at this time would not have been prudent or proper.</p>
          <p eId="para_448">In relation to Mr. Joseph Murphy Jnr's denial of a payment by JMSE, I must comment as follows. It was not for me to speculate as to the internal or company reasons for Mr. Murphy's denial in person to Deputy Ahern or any payment of £30,000 to Mr. Burke. The fact is that Ray Burke accepted that he had received this money.</p>
          <p eId="para_449">It is now clear that I was misled, as was this House, by Ray Burke. Since the tribunal's interim report was published, I have made clear my position. I have condemned the corrupt activities and  expressed my sense of betrayal. On the day the interim Flood report was issued I agreed with an interviewer that it was a damning indictment of Ray Burke. On the Sunday following the report I repeatedly expressed the sense of betrayal and disgust felt by Fianna Fáil at the matters which had been disclosed. On the following two days I reiterated, in different statements to RTE, my condemnation and the sense of betrayal I felt as Taoiseach.</p>
          <p eId="para_450">I want to reiterate a point I have made repeatedly since the publication of Mr. Justice Flood's latest report. That point is that of course I would not have appointed Ray Burke to Cabinet if I knew then what we know now. Given the knowledge revealed by Mr. Justice Flood, the judgment of hindsight is clear—</p>

          <p eId="para_456">One's judgment at any given time is formed on the basis of what one believes is true at the time and the evidence then available. My reasons for appointing Ray Burke as Minister for Foreign Affairs have been previously stated. On 3 June 1998 I told this House what those reasons were. I said:</p>
          <p eId="para_457">The first question I am asked is why I appointed Mr. Burke Minister for Foreign Affairs last June. Mr. Burke was an experienced and capable Minister who had participated in an earlier phase of the talks process and in the work of the Anglo-Irish Intergovernmental Conference. As Leader of the Opposition, I had worked very well with him on Northern Ireland and European matters, where his judgment was very good. He was eminently qualified for the job of Minister for Foreign Affairs. When we came into office, I remind Deputies that there was no renewed IRA ceasefire and the talks had been stalled and going nowhere for over 12 months. Even in the short time that he was Minister he made his mark and, working well with the Secretary of State, Dr. Mo Mowlam, we had arrived at a situation by the end of September where both the Ulster Unionists and Sinn Fein were sitting around the same table with others within weeks of a new IRA ceasefire. His decision to resign shortly afterwards was sincerely regretted by most of the talks participants.</p>
          <p eId="para_458">His political abilities were well known and recognised. On Mr. Burke's appointment the former Taoiseach, Deputy Bruton, said that Mr. Burke was "qualified to hold any office". Mr. Burke's predecessor as Minister for Foreign Affairs, Mr. Dick Spring, said he was a "strong willed and able" politician. The current leader of the Green Party, Deputy Sargent, welcomed Mr. Burke's appointment. Not one Deputy expressed any reservation about Mr. Burke's appointment, despite lengthy contributions from Deputy Rabbitte, Deputy Michael D. Higgins and others. Even when, on 10 September 1997, Mr. Burke made his statement to the House concerning the payment of £30,000, there was no demand from the Opposition for his resignation.</p>
          <p eId="para_459">I must now take the opportunity to put right seriously misleading comments made about me in recent weeks. Deputy Ruairi Quinn, Deputy Kenny and others have stated l have misled the House and the public as to whether I was aware at the time of Mr. Burke's appointment of the payment of £30,000 to him. On a number of occasions Deputy Quinn has quoted one particular passage of my speech to the House on 28 May 1998. It is clear from the overall context of my remarks to the Dáil on that day that I had disclosed my knowledge of the £30,000 payment at the time of the appointment. This is a point I have sought to have had clarified on my behalf from as far back as 1999, which is well recorded, and as recently as last week on the RTE programme, "Prime Time". I was aware that Mr. Burke had received this money before I appointed him. I informed the Tánaiste of this fact prior to the announcement of the Cabinet. I have repeatedly disclosed this state of knowledge on my part.</p>
          <p eId="para_460">In <i>The Irish Times</i> of 21 July 1997 I am recorded as having said I was satisfied “with the circumstances surrounding the nature of the donation of £30,000 by a building firm” to Mr. Burke. On 23 May 1997, during the course of the general election, I told one leading journalist that I had “gone through it in detail on four separate occasions as the allegations continued to come up in one newspaper.”  On 29 September 1997 I again confirmed my knowledge about this £30,000. <i>The Irish Times</i> records as follows:</p>
          <p eId="para_461">I asked Ray Burke back in the summer before I set up the Cabinet about this story about the £30,000 and he assured me at that particular time that he had received this money but that he had done nothing for the company and he was involved in nothing wrong.</p>
          <p eId="para_462">The first point I wish to make in relation to passports issued by Ray Burke, as Minister for Justice, is that these are not the subject of the second interim report by Mr. Justice Flood. I will come back to the significance of this. In November 1998 the Government, of which I was Taoiseach, arranged to forward to the Moriarty tribunal 160 files which related to the issuing of passports to investors. They included the passports which had been the subject of recent speculation concerning  the role of Mr. Ray Burke. The Flood tribunal is empowered, by its terms of reference, to investigate any decision made by Mr. Burke which could involve corruption. It is quite clear this is not a point understood by Members of the House which will have an opportunity to debate the passport issue in the context of the reports from the tribunals established by this House and the Seanad.</p>
          <p eId="para_463">I wish to confirm what I have previously said, that I read a note on the passport files in respect of passports issued by Mr. Burke. I did this in 1994. There was nothing on the files that suggested that any corrupt actions by Mr. Burke lay behind the unusual course followed by his Department. No evidence of any such corruption was ever brought to my attention. Moreover, as the House is aware, the Minister for Justice in late 1994 and up and until June 1997 was former Deputy Nora Owen. She carried out an investigation in relation to the issue of these passports. It is reasonable to assume that if any evidence of corruption or impropriety had been established by that investigation, the matter would have been pursued by the Minister with vigour and diligence. So far as I am aware, no further steps were taken by the Minister in respect of the review of the files as part of the investigation other than to attempt to ensure the passport holders were held to their investment commitments.</p>
          <p eId="para_464">I do, however, wish to sound a note of caution in relation to this issue. The House can consider the passports issue in due course and in the context of further reports from the tribunals. It is clear from the judgment of His Honour Judge Haugh in the case of the DPP <i>v.</i> Charles Haughey that comments in this House, in particular, on matters not the subject of a tribunal's report can be of sufficient prejudicial nature so as to prevent a trial proceeding. Having regard to the fact that there is currently a series of criminal investigations into matters covered by the Flood tribunal report I propose to confine my remarks on this issue to what I have said today. I do not believe the people, or this House, would thank me if, in the heat of debate, remarks were made which resulted in a prosecution being thwarted.</p>
          <p eId="para_465">Deputy Kenny last night raised a series of questions, none of which has anything to do with this report. I have previously dealt with all of them, either inside or outside the House. I am happy to make my office available to Deputy Kenny to point him to the record again.</p>
          <p eId="para_466">Irish politics is undergoing a period of profound change. The uncovering of a previously hidden and unacceptable past has undermined confidence in the administration of our affairs. For politics to recover the confidence of the people the facts must be laid bare – and they are. The appropriate lessons must be learned – and they are. Politics is only one aspect of our national life to come under an increasingly critical scrutiny. A succession of revelations about many areas of Irish life previously held in largely uncritical esteem is profoundly changing our cul ture. Increasingly, Ireland is a confident, critical and questioning country. This is good, good for our people and our future.</p>
          <p eId="para_467">For us who have the honour to serve in public life we have a duty to make good the aspirations of the people who elected us. The past must be accounted for and those who have transgressed must face justice as prescribed by law. For the present we who serve in public life must conduct ourselves in a way that fully respects the trust we have been given by the people. For the future we must ensure it is as difficult as is humanly possible to repeat the corruption of the past. It is only by learning the lessons of history that we can hope to avoid repeating them. It is only by enforcing accountability that we can hope to provide credibility for the future.</p>
          <p eId="para_468">In this Republic elected office is the highest trust any citizen can have. The tribunals of inquiry and the laws that have been passed to take account of the events they are investigating are manifest proof that we who are in politics now take that trust very seriously.

          <from>Mr. Penrose</from>
          <p eId="para_493">I wish to share my time with Deputies McManus and Costello, giving five minutes to each Deputy.</p>
          <p eId="para_494">I am glad to have the opportunity to contribute to this debate on the interim report of the Flood tribunal. In dealing with the issue of the Flood tribunal report, it is obviously not desirable to make any comment or criticism of the individuals mentioned in the report because one would not wish to prejudice any steps that might be taken by other bodies in the follow up to the report's conclusion or recommendations. I am taking full cognisance of the dicta of Mr. Justice Haugh in the Haughey case, and obviously this matter is now subject to investigation by the Criminal Assets Bureau, the Revenue Commissioners, the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement and the Director of Public Prosecutions, who I understand is examining the report.</p>
          <p eId="para_495">At the outset I would like to congratulate the Honourable Mr. Justice Feargus Flood on producing an incisive interim report on matters at issue and for articulating his conclusions with great precision and without fear or favour. There have been criticisms in the public and in the media over the past number of years of the role of public tribunals and their suitability to dealing with such matters as those which the Flood tribunal is addressing. This interim report from Mr. Justice Flood should allay, and indeed remove, any public concern there may have been about this question.</p>
          <p eId="para_496">On reading the report I was taken aback at the almost surreal details that emerged from the investigation by Mr. Justice Flood's tribunal staff of the matters under investigation. My colleagues will deal with individual aspects of that, but there was nothing surreal about the conclusions Mr. Justice Flood reached, which were summarised in the report and stated so firmly, without qualification or equivocation. I totally concur with the view that the findings in the Flood report represent a severe blow to the political system.</p>
          <p eId="para_497">Dealing with land use and planning is a complex issue but once it is utterly transparent and fair, and the essential principles of probity are upheld, and are seen to be upheld, the community affected must have a real input to ensure they are satisfied that the vision they set out in the development plans are right and proper for the particular circumstances of the areas. In relation to village plans and areas like that, people are entitled to have a major say and cognisance should be taken of their views so that they are adequately and centrally reflected in any plan brought forward.</p>
          <p eId="para_498">Regard also must be had concerning plans and zoning in a national spatial strategy so that local  plans can complement and be an integral part of such a strategy and not be at variance with the essential principles of a spatial plan. However, the Government has been asleep in that regard over the past few years. Projects were put forward which could be considered to be out of sync with what is required of a national spatial strategy. The Labour Party put forward a clear and precise national spatial strategy so that one can have a hand in glove approach to planning and project siting. Unfortunately, we did not have such a spatial strategy and we ended up taking the cart before the horse approach to planning, and that is where the Government will stand indicted.</p>
          <p eId="para_499">It is a sad day when one's vote for a particular decision can be bought and sold. If that scenario were to be followed, only wealthy people would be in a position to exercise the most influence and the people at the bottom, about whom my colleague, Deputy Burton, spoke on many occasions, are left holding the can when estates are not finished, etc.</p>
          <p eId="para_500">The tribunal has taken a considerable time to reach the conclusions contained in this interim report. Understandably we have all been impatient as the saga unfolded in our daily newspapers and in other media to hear what Mr. Justice Flood would conclude, but due process required that the tribunal took the time necessary to discover the evidence which would enable it to reach such firm judgments and to express such unambiguous conclusions. Our impatience, while understandable, was not justified and the due process of the Flood tribunal has been fully vindicated.</p>
          <p eId="para_501">There has also been extensive public comment about the costs incurred in the work of the public tribunals, including the Flood tribunal, and concern about value for money considerations. As a lawyer, and I must declare that interest, I am aware that legal costs are a significant component of tribunal costs but it may not be considered appropriate that I would comment on this issue. As an elected Member of this House, however, I want to ensure that the public interest is properly and justly served by all the institutions of the State.</p>
          <p eId="para_502">The return which the Flood tribunal has provided to our country is incalculable. It cannot be measured just in euro and cents. We are blessed with a system of values and a set of standards which everyone in this House has an obligation to defend and uphold. These values and standards have been under some threat in an Ireland where selfishness, rather than concern for neighbours, threatens to become the norm and where the benefit to the individual, rather than the good of society, could become the prevailing ethos. The Honourable Mr. Justice Flood has put a shot across the bows of those who would seek to progress along this line, and reducing capital gains tax from 40% to 20% represents exactly that.</p>
          <p eId="para_503">It is fair to question the implications for the planning process arising from Mr. Justice Flood's  interim report. I am utterly committed, as is the Labour Party, to a system of local democracy where decisions on issues such as planning are taken as close to the people directly affected as possible. Local authorities, which have a close knowledge of local conditions, are the appropriate bodies to take planning decisions affecting their communities. The checks and balances of the appeals process through An Bord Pleanála are likewise essential but when the planning process can be suborned, as indicated in this interim report of the tribunal, other checks and controls must be introduced to deal with the issues arising.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#JoanBurtonLAB" eId="spk_317">
          <from>Ms Burton</from>
          <p eId="para_504">The most striking aspect of the Flood report is the public interest it has generated. Mr. Justice Flood can easily rival Roy Keane's claim to best-seller of 2002. The hurrah from the plain people of Ireland for Mr. Justice Flood is that he has laid down a clear marker that nobody is above the law, regardless of the signals to the contrary over the past decade.</p>
          <p eId="para_505">Two findings stand out in the report. First, on page 53, the report bluntly states that the Century payment to Burke was a bribe. The Director of Public Prosecutions has to decide if this merits prosecution, and this is his sole prerogative, but this Parliament has its own decision to make when a tribunal it has established comes to this conclusion. In the rare event that a former Minister is judged by a tribunal or court to have so abused his powers by accepting a bribe, his pension as a Minister should be forfeited. Such deprivation of pension is not a punishment to be lightly or capriciously meted out, but when a tribunal has judged as clearly as Flood has done that a bribe was received, the punishment must fit the offence.</p>
          <p eId="para_506">The second matter that stands out is the judgment on the Burke home. The judge concludes that the house was given to Mr. Burke as a benefit with an improper motive. Mr. Burke has sold this property for close to €4 million. He is living off immoral earnings in comparative luxury because he got a free house from a building company to keep him onside in their dealings with the planning authorities. Can the Taoiseach say whether Mr. Burke will retain these benefits?</p>
          <p eId="para_507">I come now to the evidence of Mr. Tom Savage. Mr. Savage is a true-blue member of the Fianna Fáil family. He reports that he advised the former Taoiseach, Mr. Albert Reynolds, that Ray Burke should not be reappointed to Government. During the Seán O'Rourke interview last week he instanced two clients who had reported to him improper demands for money to secure planning advantages. Mr. Reynolds asserts he passed whatever information he had to the Taoiseach at the time of the handover of the Fianna Fáil leadership in 1994. It would be relevant to ask the Taoiseach what he knew in early 1995 when he decided to reverse the Reynolds political exile order on Mr. Burke and bring him back to the most delicate Front Bench slot possible.</p>
          <p eId="para_508">It is indisputable that within the Fianna Fáil family enough was known to make any return to favour for Mr. Burke unwise and reckless. The Taoiseach was adequately warned that dangers lay ahead. The rot set in at that point, in 1995, when the Front Bench was nominated. With Ray Burke in such a delicate position as spokesperson, it was inevitable that he would be in pole position if Fianna Fáil were ever to return to Government. The Taoiseach claims he had only three weeks after the 1997 election to choose his Cabinet. This is untrue. He had the full two and a half years of his spell in Opposition to check out the Reynolds information. He did not bother and that was reckless. We all now have to live with the results of that recklessness.</p>
          <p eId="para_509">When I made a mild protest at the goings on in the area of planning in County Dublin, I encountered a vicious reaction. For days a procession of motorcycle couriers arrived at my door delivering one libel writ after another. By the end of the week a total of 42 had arrived. I recall that one of the couriers demanded rather peremptorily to see Mrs. Bruton and when I replied that she lived in Dunboyne, he drove off in high dudgeon. He came back an hour later with the writ properly readdressed. What were these people, in Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil, so afraid of simply because a junior Minister, in very mild terms, asked whether there were improper influences at work? I ask the Taoiseach, and Deputy Kenny as leader of Fine Gael, to answer why, to this day, I have received neither an apology nor an explanation for all the trauma I and my family were put through?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#LizMcManus" eId="spk_318">
          <from>Ms McManus</from>
          <p eId="para_510">I will leave it to Deputy Quinn to deal with the unwarranted and unworthy attack the Taoiseach made just now. The Taoiseach did not, in his statement, answer questions that he was asked very clearly. For example, my colleague, Deputy Moynihan-Cronin, asked how many of the people listed in the report as having obstructed, hindered or failed to co-operate with the tribunal were or are members of the Fianna Fáil Party; that answer was not given. How many, if any, of the people on that list have made financial contributions to Fianna Fáil since the Flood tribunal was established? That was not answered either. It is clear that the Taoiseach is refusing to face up to his responsibilities. The Flood report has found that in 1989 Raphael Burke received corrupt payments. For the first time ever, the tribunal determined that a Government Minister had acted corruptly. The amount paid to Mr. Burke that year probably exceeded £100,000. We know of three payments already. It was election year and Mr. Burke vainly tried to argue that these were political payments.</p>
          <p eId="para_511">It is worth reminding ourselves why that election was called. It was called because the Government collapsed over its refusal to provide compensation to haemophiliacs who had had their lives destroyed through contaminated blood products. This compensation, at the time, added  up to a couple of hundred thousand pounds. Political corruption and political callousness were the two features of that Fianna Fáil Government in 1989. There is a terrible symmetry now as the Lindsay report, which covers the extent of the wrong done to those tragic people, was published almost simultaneously with the Flood report, which shows the wrong done to the public good by private avarice and illegality.</p>
          <p eId="para_512">The Taoiseach, Deputy Ahern, is the leader of our nation's Government and his position demands good judgment, full accountability and a willingness to shoulder responsibility. Yet the Taoiseach has shown none of these qualities. Since the publication of the Flood report his actions as Taoiseach have been abject, even cowardly. Initially, outside this House, he responded by claiming that he was the person responsible for setting up the Flood tribunal. Then yesterday inside the House he claimed that he had nothing to answer for, that he had no significant place in the findings. As a consequence he has refused to participate in a question and answer session and he has refused to answer questions put to him legitimately.</p>
          <p eId="para_513">It is not true to say that he was responsible for setting up the tribunal. Everybody knows that Fianna Fáil came kicking and screaming to an agreement on this tribunal. He certainly cannot hide behind the assertion that had he known what he knows now, he would not have appointed Ray Burke. Had Fianna Fáil at the time had another leader, Mr. Burke would not have been made a Minister. If Albert Reynolds, Máire Geoghegan-Quinn or even the Minister, Deputy Michael Smith, who is here now and talked about the debasement of planning in Dublin, had been leader, Ray Burke would not have been appointed a Minister. They were aware of the concerns about Mr. Burke, the allegations and the serious questions.</p>
          <p eId="para_514">In view of the close relationship between the Taoiseach and Mr. Burke, which extends back over 25 years, the question must be answered: why did the Taoiseach make the appointment against wise counsel and common sense? Why has there been no reply to the question put to him about the donation given to Ray Burke and denied by JMSE and his failure to investigate the matter? Why did the alarm bells not ring when the person who received the donation, who was under serious suspicion, admitted to the payment and the donor said there had been none? Why did the Taoiseach not start to investigate the reasons for that anomaly?</p>
          <p eId="para_515">Deviousness and cunning were characteristics attributed to the Taoiseach by his mentor, C. J. Haughey. Certainly, his fudging and obfuscation have got him out of tight corners before now. He should be aware, however, that the crystal clarity of the findings of the Flood tribunal have resulted in a requirement to be forthcoming with the facts. Even if members of the Taoiseach's party are unaware of this new reality, the people outside  this House are only too aware that they have waited long enough for the full truth to come out.</p>

          <p eId="para_516">I pay tribute to Mr. Justice Flood for the fine interim report he has produced and to Colm Mac Eochaidh and Michael Smith who started the ball rolling, but particularly to James Gogarty, who opened the floodgates. I propose that Mr. Gogarty be given the freedom of the city of Dublin for services rendered to the citizens of Dublin in the area of planning and rezoning.</p>

          <from>Mr. Costello</from>
          <p eId="para_518">Mr. Gogarty was the whistleblower. He was the key figure, the hero. He was the octogenarian who stood up in Dublin Castle day after day, week after week, month after month, giving evidence and subjecting himself to very severe cross-examination. He is the person who will have changed utterly the planning and rezoning process in Dublin and the country. For that we should give him the freedom of the city.</p>
          <p eId="para_519">The Flood report clearly shows that there are questions of corruption or corrupt payments in relation to Briargate, the home of Mr. Burke; in relation to the offshore accounts that he had in Jersey and the Isle of Man; and in relation to Century Radio, whose promoters made him a corrupt payment as described by Mr. Justice Flood. I remember in the Seanad in 1990 when Ray Burke, the then Minister for Communications, came to the House and we criticised and castigated him for what we saw as a deliberate attempt to undermine RTE. On 12 July 1990 I said, in relation to Mr. Burke: "the same Minister should not be responsible for the Department of Justice and the Department of Communications". He had been promoted to the Department of Communications and held the portfolio for a brief time. There was always a suspicion as to why he got a second Department. My contribution to the Broadcasting Bill continued as follows:</p>
          <p eId="para_520">This is a dastardly Bill. It is not so much a Broadcasting Bill as it is an act of vandalism against RTE. It is a major attack on free, independent broadcasting under a different guise. It undermines the role that has been pursued by RTE in their public broadcasting function. It is, for the first time, placing a major question mark over RTE's viability, as a public broadcasting service. I regard it as nothing less than scandalous that RTE should be treated in this fashion.</p>
          <p eId="para_521">That was in 1990 when Ray Burke was deliberately nobbling RTE, as we now see and as we pretty much knew at the time. He was ensuring deliberately by way of legislation that RTE's facilities would be made available to Century Radio. He was capping 2FM and diverting the advertising funding from that to Century Radio. It was undoubtedly a dastardly action.</p>
          <p eId="para_522">The Taoiseach and Tánaiste have a lot to answer in this regard. If Albert Reynolds had  received so much information from Tom Savage and other sources, and if he communicated that to Máire Geoghegan-Quinn, and the file was given to the current Taoiseach, why did the Taoiseach not act on it if the previous Taoiseach had deliberately left Mr. Burke out of his Cabinet? This and other serious questions need to be answered, therefore we need a question and answer session with the Taoiseach.</p>
          <p eId="para_523">I said in the Seanad a number of years ago in regard to the former Taoiseach, Mr. Haughey, that we should amend the Criminal Assets Bureau Act so that we could deal with other people in the community other than suspected drug dealers and criminals who had assets and property of such a substantial nature that there was no visible means by which it was acquired. There is a large mansion in Kinsealy, the island of Inishvickillane, a luxury yacht, thoroughbred horses and a lifestyle on which huge sums of money were spent. If that happened in the area of drug dealing the Criminal Assets Bureau would have been in operation long ago. I do not see a reason to set up a corruption assets bureau at this time. Let us simply table a small amendment to the Criminal Assets Bureau Act and get on with the job.</p>

        <speech by="#MichaelSmith" as="#Minister_for_Defence" eId="spk_322">
          <from>Minister for Defence (Mr. M. Smith)</from>
          <p eId="para_524">I wish to share time with Deputy Glennon.</p>
          <p eId="para_525">I am pleased to have the opportunity to address myself to this important motion. Before dealing specifically with the issue I want to answer an accusation which was levelled against me by Deputy Naughten at the end of his contribution. I am always amazed at the ability of Deputies in this House to besmirch and smear their colleagues without a shred of evidence to back it up. I want to reject out of hand the allegation made by Deputy Naughten and state very clearly the circumstances surrounding the designation of the Golden Island site in Athlone.</p>
          <p eId="para_526">As Members know, I was Minister for the Environment between 1992 and 1994. In July 1994 I announced the designated areas for tax incentives for development in Dublin Castle. During the course of that day, I publicly stated that I needed more time to examine the Golden Island site and that I would make a decision before the end of the year. Members will also be aware that the special group established in my Department – people of the highest integrity – were checking out all the sites for designation, including Golden Island. That group, who were people of the highest integrity, recommended it for designation. The Minister of State at the time, Deputy Stagg, visited Athlone where he met representatives, visited the site and recommended that it should be designated. I still was not satisfied to make a final decision and I asked that Athlone Urban Council should meet. The urban council met and by the casting vote of the chairman the local representatives voted for the designation of the site. Therefore, there was a triple  support mechanism. First, the group designated to recommend designation were positive. The Minister of State, Deputy Stagg, who worked tremendously hard in that Department, was also very satisfied with the designation. Athlone Urban Council voted for the designation and it was only then I took the final decision.</p>
          <p eId="para_527">It is interesting to note that when the rainbow Government came into office almost immediately after my decision it, too, carried out an investigation and came back with a solid recommendation upholding the decision which had been taken. I would like, therefore, to put to rest for all time any smear or besmirching of my name in regard to that aspect of my work. I have never accepted a bribe. I have never made a designation only on the basis of the strongest recommendation by everyone involved. I stand over every decision I have taken.</p>
          <p eId="para_528">The Flood tribunal is a sign of a healthy democracy in operation. Having been established on the recommendation of the Taoiseach, Bertie Ahern, in 1997 and subsequently extended in its terms of reference to encompass an inquiry into the acts of Mr. Ray Burke, the Oireachtas by its establishment clearly signalled its intent to face head on any revelations about wrongdoing in public life.</p>
          <p eId="para_529">Public life and public office is about public service. This relates to all who hold it from local representatives to Cabinet Ministers. Quite simply, elected office is the highest honour any citizen can achieve, but with it comes many responsibilities. The party to which I belong, Fianna Fáil, has long held this as a core value to which the Taoiseach, Bertie Ahern, is deeply attached.</p>
          <p eId="para_530">An important test of the true democratic nature of any society is the effectiveness of its response to the exposure of wrongdoing by those in public life. In recent times there has been undoubtedly an erosion of confidence in public life and, deeply conscious of this, the Government has moved to address it. As well as establishing the Flood and Moriarty tribunals, an aggressive and comprehensive legislative response has been initiated. Among the most significant laws now on the Statute Book are the Prevention of Corruption Act, 2001, the Standards in Public Office Act, 2001 and the Oireachtas (Ministerial and Parliamentary Offices) Act, 2001. Ireland now has among the strongest regulatory framework governing ethics in public life of any country. We are determined to enforce and build on it as the citizens deserve no less.</p>
          <p eId="para_531">The publication of the interim report of Mr. Justice Flood should be viewed in the context of this new framework and sends out a clear signal to those who would besmirch the trust placed in them. The report is a clear indication that the State will expose wrongdoing in public life and is a grim awakening for those who engage in corrupt and dishonest behaviour.</p>
          <p eId="para_532">I was appointed to Cabinet in October 1997 as Minister for Defence in a reshuffle necessitated  by the resignation of Ray Burke. None of us knew then what we know now about Mr. Burke. It is true that there had been allegations surrounding the former Deputy for some time. Unfortunately allegations – often unfounded – are an everyday sad part of political life. In recent times we have seen both the Taoiseach and the Tánaiste vindicate their names in court after unfounded allegations besmirching their respective names appeared in the print media.</p>
          <p eId="para_533">In regard to Ray Burke, the Taoiseach made a strong effort to establish the facts surrounding these allegations prior to his appointment to Cabinet. On four occasions, as set out on public record, the Taoiseach went to Mr. Burke about these allegations. No evidence could be established at that time that there was any wrongdoing. It should also be noted that the allegations had been made over a period of time, but when the Taoiseach was forming his Cabinet, the individual making the accusations was refusing to sign a statement. It is undoubtedly true that Ray Burke would not have become a Minister in 1997 if the Taoiseach knew what he knows now. He made an honest attempt to establish the facts as they were known then. He did not have at his disposal the resources and wide-ranging powers of the tribunal which took five years to uncover the unpleasant truth.</p>
          <p eId="para_534">It must also be said that, despite the shrill trumpets of indignation from the Opposition benches, nobody objected to Ray Burke's appointment to Cabinet in 1997. The Opposition cannot have it both ways and say that, with the benefit of hindsight, it would have opposed Mr. Burke's appointment while castigating the Taoiseach for doing so. The public record will show that the new foreign affairs portfolio was actually well received in some quarters of the Opposition and that some elements of the media, so vociferous in the fall-out over the Flood interim report, actually welcomed it.</p>
          <p eId="para_535">There has been a great deal of criticism of the Taoiseach concerning his reaction to the publishing of the report, particularly in respect of the position of Mr. Burke. The facts tell a different story. He demonstrated his deep dissatisfaction on RTE the day the report was published, while on the following Sunday at the launch of the Fianna Fáil Nice campaign in the Burlington Hotel, he said on at least three occasions that he felt betrayed and disgusted by Mr. Burke's behaviour. He also repeated similar comments to RTE correspondent Jim Fahy the following day. In a statement issued to "Prime Time" he expressed his disgust at Mr. Burke's betrayal of the public trust and reiterated his condemnations of Mr. Burke's conduct. To say that the Taoiseach has been lukewarm in his criticism of Mr. Burke in the wake of the report's publication is a gross distortion.</p>
          <p eId="para_536">The Taoiseach is on record as saying at the time of Mr. Burke's resignation that he was hounded out of politics. Predictably, much has been made of this. However, this brings us back  to the issue of hindsight. There is no doubt that the Taoiseach would not have made these comments if he had had the benefit of Mr. Justice Flood's report which arose from five years of thorough investigation. It is all very well for the Opposition to jump up and down, but I ask people in this House to be consistent. In particular, I refer those Deputies who are now damning the Taoiseach to the comments made by Deputy Kenny, who defended Michael Lowry in this House following his resignation and described him as a man of the highest integrity and honour. Hindsight is not always foresight.</p>
          <p eId="para_537">The publication of the interim report of the Flood tribunal is a significant day for democracy in this country. It has laid bare the cold facts of standards of behaviour which let down all of us in public life. The report has already been sent by the tribunal to the DPP, while the Taoiseach has directed that it is to be appraised by the Garda Commissioner, the Criminal Assets Bureau, the Revenue Commissioners and the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement.</p>
          <p eId="para_538">With the publication of this interim report from the Flood tribunal of inquiry, a clear and unequivocal message has been relayed to all in public life. I commend this motion to the House and give way to Deputy Glennon.</p>

          <p eId="para_540">I thank the Minister, Deputy Smith, for sharing his time. I am thankful and proud of my being in a position to make this contribution, my maiden contribution in this House. I thank my family, friends and supporters and, most of all, the people of north County Dublin who have elected me to this position.</p>
          <p eId="para_541">I am very conscious of the obligations, duties and responsibilities imposed on me and that I am here in this House as a representative of the people, and not, as sometimes may seem to be the case, a representative of public bodies going back to the constituency. I am here to represent the people of north County Dublin. They have placed their trust in me, of which I am deeply conscious, and I pledge myself to uphold that trust in any way I can and always with honesty and integrity.</p>
          <p eId="para_542">I believe deeply in parliamentary democracy. It is something which is under considerable threat at the moment from different areas. There is a tradition in my family of public service. My father and his father were both county councillors and a maternal uncle sat on the Labour benches in this House some considerable time ago. I have often tried to picture what their thoughts might be, not only in recent weeks, but in recent years were they to see the goings on that have brought us here today. Their thoughts and attitudes shaped me, and every Member of this House is handed down high standards from his or her preceding generations. Similarly, our thoughts and actions as Members of this House shape society  in general, particularly the future lives of our children.</p>
          <p eId="para_543">We are dealing with a particularly thorny issue at the moment and how we as parliamentarians and as a nation deal with it is the acid test of our democracy. There is no room for equivocation. I am disgusted at the betrayal of public trust involved in the events leading to the setting up of this tribunal.</p>
          <p eId="para_544">I also wish to join with the other speakers and the vast majority of the Irish people who have expressed their respect and admiration for Mr. Justice Flood and his team in the compilation of such a magnificent report. The report is already a best-seller, but its publication will certainly be seen as one of the seminal events in Irish politics and the history of this House.</p>
          <p eId="para_545">I was told this morning that over 100,000 copies of this report have been disseminated to the public. An interesting aside to that is that the recently published Lindsay report on the issue of haemophilia had a demand for only 170 copies. That says a lot about our society. Over 70 people died in the time leading up to the creation and the institution of the Lindsay tribunal. One hundred and seventy copies of that report were required by the public. At the moment, the figure for the Flood interim report is 100,000.</p>
          <p eId="para_546">It is fair to say that there was huge public disquiet at the contents of the Flood report. Nowhere is this public disquiet more pronounced than in north County Dublin, my constituency. It is the area which was central to the bulk of the activities which gave rise to the report, and I am very conscious of comments I may make because the tribunal is ongoing. However, the people of north County Dublin have absolutely no doubt that whatever may have been the cause of their present difficulties, the area in which they live, which has been, and still is, the most rapidly expanding local authority area in the country in terms of population, has been developing for some years on the basis of what was originally a flawed planning process. These people are now paying the price and reaping the whirlwind. Everybody in north County Dublin is aware of the explosion in population of the town of Swords, with a consequent, significant infrastructural deficit. The area of north Fingal has no bus service. There are buses all right, but there is absolutely no service.</p>
          <p eId="para_547">There is a train service that owes more to the standards of Bangalore than it does to the requirements of Balbriggan. There is not a school in Swords that is not bursting at the seams. All these infrastructural difficulties have arisen because of the flawed planning process we have had to endure for probably 20 years. Not only has the area to which I have referred seen the most rapid expansion in population in the country, it is also continuing to expand at the same rate. Over the next seven years the town of Balbriggan is set to treble in population, from a current level of 11,000 to 30,000. This is an opportunity to learn  something from the errors of the past. Lessons should also be learned from the infrastructural difficulties being experienced by the town of Swords. It should mean that Balbriggan does not have to suffer the same difficulties in the coming years.</p>
          <p eId="para_548">It is no wonder that respect for the political system is at such a low ebb. With hindsight we can all throw blame wherever we may, but the reality is that we, in this House, act as politicians and parliamentarians and must deal with it. Remedial steps must be taken. It behoves each Member of the House to examine his or her own place in the system. It is a parliamentary democracy. Historically, such a system was debate driven. Unfortunately, nowadays it is largely image driven, with which we must live. We all came here with our eyes open.</p>
          <p eId="para_549">Our image must be that of a role model. Many of us may not like this, but none of us should abdicate our responsibilities in terms of our leadership role in society. Pop stars or sports stars appear to hog the headlines most of the time. Any time a politician manages to get on the front page of a newspaper or the lead on radio or television news it appears in a negative light. We, in this House, have that state of affairs in our own control. Not only must we be clean, we must also be seen to be cleaner than clean because we set the standards for society. We must be prepared to say, "No," take the unpopular decision and the short-term pain for the long-term gain. We must also show the people that the culture that gave rise to this report is no more.</p>
          <p eId="para_550">I take no pleasure in this my maiden speech to the House. However, I take great pride in being in a position to make it. I take great personal pride in myself, my family, friends and locality, in those who supported and elected me and, especially, the Fianna Fáil Party. This is not one of the most glorious chapters in our history, but I have no doubt that, in time, history will look favourably on this period. It will be seen as the one in which, once again, Fianna Fáil turned adversity into advantage and emerged from the process a much stronger and more vibrant party.</p>
          <p eId="para_551">We have heard the statistics outlined in the interim report and the cost to date of the tribunal, €22 million. We have also heard that as a result of further investigations consequent upon the activities of the tribunal, in excess of €30 million has been collected by the Exchequer. I suggest to the House that any additional funds that may be generated through the efforts of the tribunal and subsequent efforts by any agency are channelled into the infrastructural deficit to which I referred in north County Dublin. The families who bought the houses, the results of these planning applications, have children in the local schools, which are significantly under-equipped and overcrowded. It is only appropriate that such funds be channelled in that direction.</p>
          <p eId="para_552">I thank the Minister for sharing his time with me. I reiterate my comments about my disgust at the betrayal of public trust in the events giving  rise to this tribunal. I again commend Mr. Justice Flood and his team for their tremendous service to Ireland and political life here, both now and in the future.</p>

        <speech by="#MichaelRing" eId="spk_325">
          <from>Mr. Ring</from>
          <p eId="para_553">I congratulate Deputy Glennon on his maiden speech to the House. The country is depending on new people in Fianna Fáil like the Deputy to clean out the rot that was in evidence in the party for a long time. They have a heavy responsibility, but I have no doubt that he and the other new Fianna Fáil Members in the House will succeed.</p>
          <p eId="para_554">I support Deputy Costello's comments on Mr. James Gogarty. I compliment Mr. Gogarty on the job he did for this country. He was a man of great courage and self-belief. The people of the country owe him much and I hope he will be made a freeman of either Dublin or Ireland because he has done the country a service above and beyond the call of duty.</p>
          <p eId="para_555">I congratulate Mr. Justice Flood on his excellent interim report. The people expected it would be like all reports in providing a whitewash and that nobody would be named or blamed. They are delighted with it. To borrow the Fianna Fáil Party slogan used during the general election campaign, there is a lot done, but there is more to do.</p>
          <p eId="para_556">The Taoiseach was not prepared to answer questions from the Opposition. We will have to depend on Mr. Justice Flood because it is clear the House no longer means anything. At a time when everybody, on programmes on RTE and local radio, in every pub and on every platform, can talk about the report, the Houses of Parliament that established it cannot do so. The Taoiseach will not answer questions – he will only read out something scripted by his officials – because he is afraid he might trip himself up. Please God, Mr. Justice Flood will get to the bottom of what happened once and for all and that he will clean up Irish politics.</p>
          <p eId="para_557">As a new Member of the House, I have listened to people tell me that we politicians are all the same. We are not. I am not the same as Ray Burke, nor do I wish to be. Some 99.9% of the Members of this House are here because they wish to serve those who elected them. They do not do it for themselves, their families, but for their county and country. They should stand up and be counted, especially in Fianna Fáil. If they know of wrongdoing in the past, now is the time to appear before the Flood tribunal.</p>
          <p eId="para_558">Mr. Justice Flood and this report have sent out a very strong signal. No more lies or time wasting at the tribunal will be accepted. I, therefore, warn all those who appear before it to tell the truth about what they know in order that this mess can be cleaned up once and for all. This will mean that we, in this House, will no longer have to castigate one another about money taken 20 or 25 years ago, thus enabling us to discuss problems around the country.</p>
          <p eId="para_559">I come from a family of 13 and never saw £30,000 in my life. Ray Burke is reported to have taken some £250,000. For those who have not read the report there are really only two pages to read, pages 138 and 139 of chapter 16. The list of donations to the then Minister, Ray Burke, almost adds up to £250,000. The times were bad and there was great unemployment in the country. People on social welfare lived on less than £70 per week. People could hardly feed their families and the Government of the day could not get enough money in taxes to keep the budget on target, yet we had builders and others who were able to hand over £30,000 to politicians.</p>
          <p eId="para_560">I am not stupid and if one sells a £70 ticket for Fine Gael or Fianna Fáil to somebody, he or she expects something for it. What happens if one gets £30,000 or a free house? How much is expected for that? I hope Mr. Justice Flood deals with these people. I hope the DPP also deals with them and that the next phase of the tribunal's investigations will lead to the courts so that those who gave money and those that accepted it will end up behind bars. That is what people want to see happen because anyone who takes that kind of money or a house, as the tribunal has said, is corrupt. They have not done this House, country, themselves or their families a service. Politics has to be cleaned up once and for all.</p>
          <p eId="para_561">It is evident that there were problems in every ministry in which Ray Burke served. Let us take the example of RTE. I have always been a supporter of RTE on the basis that it is the national broadcaster. It does not do a bad job although we are often critical of it – it is like the politicians, people are critical no matter what we do. However, one should look at what happens when funding is taken away from it – it can no longer compete with Sky for football coverage. When Ray Burke was Minister he looked after his friends, capped RTE's income and nearly put it out of business. Last weekend RTE showed coverage of football, hurling and ladies football.</p>
          <p eId="para_562">I came into this House in June 1994 and can recall three things about the then Minister, Ray Burke. The big issue for the people of Mayo during the 1997 general election was MMDS, multi-channel television. Mr. Burke had given out licences for it. I was on local radio and made a few allegations. Going up the steps of this Chamber I was pulled over by Mr. Burke who said that I went above and beyond the call of duty that day. He said he would be getting a tape and would deal with me in another quarter. I clearly remember what he said but he did not deal with me in the other quarter. Everything he touched from MMDS to RTE to Corrib Gas is now tainted with controversy. I propose in this House today that Department officials investigate every single decision he took to see who benefited from them.</p>
          <p eId="para_563">The Government is currently being taken to task by Europe in regard to Corrib Gas. Questions are being asked about the planning process and why the project was established in such a  way. A period of two months has been given in order to prepare a response. At least the people in Mayo who were complaining will be proven right. Everything this man touched seemed to cause trouble. I do not like making allegations against politicians and I will not make one today but I say to Fianna Fáil that it all started with a famous man who even had a song written about him, Charles J. Haughey. We know what happened to him. We now see from the Moriarty tribunal the lifestyle he had. He had various people around him, big tall men and small men and people that saw what was going on. Then they got a piece of the action. That is where it all started but now it must all be stopped. We must bring back politics to the people rather than to big business. I have never been a supporter of big businesses. They should stay out of the political institutions of this country. They should vote like everyone else but they should not get favours from political parties or individual politicians. This has to stop. The public is disillusioned and why would it not be when it knows somebody got £250,000 in bad times?</p>
          <p eId="para_564">I listened to the Taoiseach yesterday and today and I watched the Fianna Fáil Members applauding him earlier. I am not in this House very long but I remember them clapping him in 1997 when Ray Burke was on the Front Bench. I saw the Minister of State, Deputy O'Dea, in the House a minute ago. Why did the Taoiseach have to pick Ray Burke when there was talk all over the country and within Fianna Fáil itself? Why did he leave out a man like the Minister of State, Deputy O'Dea, who would love to be a senior Minister and feels he should be one? He will probably castigate us all because he is the boot boy for Fianna Fáil and that is part of the job he will do today. Why did the Taoiseach appoint a man about whom so many people had doubts? It now appears that they were justified in having such doubts.</p>
          <p eId="para_565">I came here on a deputation from the UDC in Westport prior to my election to the House. Ray Burke was the then Minister for the Environment. He thought I was a Fianna Fáil member. I could see the Fianna Fáil fellas kicking him to stop. He did not present himself as a very good Minister. He was planning to come down to Mayo by helicopter. I will not tell the full story; I will only tell half of it because I do not want to end up in a tribunal.</p>

I could see the Fianna Fáil fellas kicking him  because he thought all those on the deputation were members of Fianna Fáil. We were looking for money for the Westport sewerage scheme but there was no money and it is only being done now. He was throwing out the information that there was no money available, but he would still see us in the bar. That is the kind of a Minister he was.</p>

          <from>Mr. Timmins</from>
          <p eId="para_570">The ebullient Deputy Ring usually goes over time and I accept his apologies for that. I congratulate Deputy Glennon on his maiden speech and wish him well. Coincidentally, I made my own maiden speech on the terms of reference for the Flood tribunal. It is interesting to go back and read those speeches that are available in the back of the book.</p>
          <p eId="para_571">The purpose of today's debate is to speak about the Flood tribunal, but more so about the political fallout from its second interim report. As a document it speaks for itself. We would never be able to dissect the information and analyse it like Mr. Justice Flood and in the period in which he has done so. I am very conscious of the spate of rumours in the past few years about people from urban councillors to the Taoiseach and everyone in between. People seem to be glad to hear any rumour. Anyone who has information should go to the tribunal and stop dragging people's characters into question. I am critical of the newspapers in this regard, notwithstanding the fact that they unearthed the information that led to the setting up of the tribunal. In the interim they have often been irresponsible with the headings of certain articles.</p>
          <p eId="para_572">The Taoiseach appears to have missed the purpose of this two day debate. When he deviated from his script, the Taoiseach made a comment about "the old Fine Gael tradition of digging up the dirt". Had we in Fine Gael one iota of the ability of Mr. Justice Flood for digging up the dirt, the Taoiseach would not have been able to form a Government in 1997. The Flood report is not about Fine Gael nor is it one our party prepared. It is a report compiled by Mr. Justice Flood whose tribunal was established by the House, not by the Taoiseach, who tried to create the impression when the report was published that he had established the tribunal.</p>
          <p eId="para_573">The Taoiseach has been on the receiving end of a great deal of flak on this issue because, while he is by nature cautious, this caution deserted him when he appointed Ray Burke. The Taoiseach and the Minister, Deputy Michael Smith, have used the defence that Ray Burke was not con demned by other sides of the House when he was appointed. They did not have access to the type of information which was clearly in the possession of some members of the Government at the time. One would not give a person a job in a corner sweet shop if such innuendo existed about him or her. The Taoiseach, even though he is normally cautious, appointed Ray Burke.</p>
          <p eId="para_574">I have some sympathy for the Taoiseach in that he has continually stated over recent years that he has answered these questions and that we should not return to them and continually emphasise them. He had an opportunity today to answer the questions. He is selective. Yesterday on the Order of Business I made a comment that the time was not that important, but I also said that what was important were the answers. The Taoiseach selectively concentrated on the first half of the comment but not on the second. The least he could have done was to have made his contribution at the end of the debate today and not earlier on. He has not done himself any favours because there are questions which have remained unanswered. He may be capable of answering them but he has ignored them or chosen not to answer them for whatever reason.</p>
          <p eId="para_575">He answered several questions but there are others he did not address. One question is what information he had before he appointed Ray Burke. He outlined some of it, but the former Taoiseach, Albert Reynolds, gave the distinct impression that, as he left office, he gave information to the Taoiseach about the former Minister, Ray Burke, that would indicate, based on an interview with Mr. Tom Savage on the national airwaves, that Ray Burke was not fit to be considered for appointment, yet the Taoiseach appointed him. I regret he is not present to answer that. What information did the Minister, Deputy Michael Smith, give him, if any? A quick glance at the Minister's script suggests that is not answered. The Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment told us she was told beforehand that Ray Burke had received a donation of £30,000, which is fair enough.</p>
          <p eId="para_576">It is important to remember that the tribunal was not established quickly. I remember a great deal of confusion and resistance in certain quarters to the tribunal being established. Investigation of the £30,000 donation which was at the kernel of the Flood tribunal was tabled as an amendment to the terms of reference of the Moriarty tribunal but was not accepted by the Government at the time. Did the former Minister, Ray Burke, make any representations to the Taoiseach when the tribunal was being established? Did he threaten to resign from the Dáil if it was established? Did he have any discussions with the Taoiseach in respect of the establishment of the Flood tribunal? Between the appointment of Ray Burke as a Minister and the day he resigned, did the former Taoiseach, Albert Reynolds, the Minister, Deputy Michael Smith, any Cabinet member or member of the Fianna Fáil parliamentary party come forward to the Taoiseach with information  they thought might be relevant to the contribution made by Ray Burke?</p>
          <p eId="para_577">On the point that we did not condemn him on his appointment as Minister, anyone in the Chamber who was not familiar with the rumours believed him. One had to take the man at his word. He proved to be untruthful, however. Some members of the Fianna Fáil parliamentary party had access to information which would have been in conflict with the statement made by Ray Burke. Did they go to the Taoiseach or did he go to them for their information?</p>
          <p eId="para_578">One of the mysteries to me is that the Taoiseach sent the Minster, Deputy Dermot Ahern, to determine if a donation had been given to Ray Burke knowing well it had been because Mr. Burke told him so. Did the Minister ever ask the Taoiseach why he sent him on such a fool's errand?</p>
          <p eId="para_579">There is public outrage at the findings of the tribunal and the people want to see justice done. Perhaps in the legislation to establish the corruption assets bureau the removal of State pensions from an individual found to be corrupt could be examined. That should be considered.</p>
          <p eId="para_580">The Minister, Deputy Cullen, spoke about planning in detail and mentioned that, in the past three years, the authorities in the greater Dublin area have had access to the strategic planning guidelines. Perhaps he should re-examine those. A recent judgment was given in a judicial review sought on the implementation of the guidelines by Meath County Council. Mr. Justice Quirke in his decision stated that the strategic planning guidelines were flawed in that they gave no definition of local growth, an important aspect of the guidelines and one which has been misinterpreted by some local authorities.</p>
          <p eId="para_581">The Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment referred to the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement. The publication of the interim report of the Flood tribunal means the report of the Comptroller and Auditor General went largely unnoticed. It had some issues of concern relating to people not paying their taxes. One man had transactions to the value of €4 million and did not pay a penny in tax. These are issues which need to be addressed.</p>
          <p eId="para_582">It is important for people with information to send it to the Flood tribunal and for it to be in writing and signed. I do not like people having a slur cast on their reputation by maliciously placed rumours.</p>

          <p eId="para_585">The debate so far has concentrated to an extraordinary extent on the appointment of Ray Burke in 1997, despite the fact there is only the most tenuous of connections between it and Mr. Justice Flood's report, if any. The Taoi seach's response has dealt more than adequately with the innuendo and false allegations in this regard. He has also made clear his and Fianna Fáil's revulsion at Mr. Burke's actions.</p>
          <p eId="para_586">Mr. Justice Flood's report is being considered by or has been sent to various bodies, including the Garda Commissioner, the Criminal Assets Bureau, the Revenue Commissioners, the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement and the Director of Public Prosecutions. There are, however, no recommendations for amendments to legislation.</p>
          <p eId="para_587">I welcome the indication by the Minister, Deputy Cullen, that some improvements to planning laws can be and are to be advanced by the Government. He indicated in his speech yesterday that the Government has plans for improvements to planning laws and that there are other areas for which it was in the process of bringing forward legislative initiatives.</p>
          <p eId="para_588">The Dáil and Parliament could have a useful role in considering the implications of Mr. Justice Flood's report. The debate so far does not indicate that many people are of the same view. A great deal of what one has heard indicates that the only interest many people have in the report is in so far as it can be made useful for throwing mud at the Taoiseach or others. The House, having established the tribunal, has a central role in considering the implications of the interim report which does not have specific recommendations at this stage but clearly, on foot of what is set out as the factual position, has matters which need and should be considered by the House, either in the Chamber or in committee. Many issues dealt with by Mr. Justice Flood should be teased out. Parliament should indicate that it does not always wait for Government to come forward with legislative initiatives or the creation of new bodies, where necessary, or giving additional powers to existing ones. At least some of the initiative should come from this House.</p>
          <p eId="para_589">Among the points made by the Minister was that the Department of the Environment and Local Government had been very proactive in introducing legislation in 2000 and 2001 that was addressed in detail on Committee Stage. It has also introduced guidelines for local authorities in relation to residential densities, wind farms, mobile phone masts, child care, landscape protection, etc.</p>
          <p eId="para_590">The issue of zoning has been difficult and fraught in the Dublin area, but for many local authorities it is a new area. Many local authorities are now considering zoning for the first time for various towns. Generally, consultants seem to be employed to make recommendations in relation to a particular area or part of a county. We generally assume they have no contact with anybody who has any beneficial interest in the lands involved. I am not certain they are required to make declarations in that regard, but I understand on occasion they have done so. If there is a grey area, it should be addressed.</p>
          <p eId="para_591">The next step in the process is for the planning staff of the local authority to make their recommendations, which are generally pretty close to those of the consultants. At the final phase the role of the local authority members is to make the decision and consult with communities. The one quality local councillors have that neither the consultants nor the council staff generally have is that of local knowledge.</p>
          <p eId="para_592">One of the difficulties I envisage is that local councillors will see very clearly that the recommendations of the consultants and the planning staff will not lead to lands being available for housing or development, usually because the owners of the designated land are simply not interested in selling it. Sometimes there are very good or sentimental reasons for this, but they are very definite reasons in the minds of the people who own the property.</p>
          <p eId="para_593">Frequently local councillors know quite well that almost all the area being zoned will not be available for housing, but the difficulty for them is that if they are seen to widen the parameters of the zoning by bringing in other areas, they immediately come under the cosh because the point made by Deputy Timmins comes into play and they are open to allegations being made against them because they did not agree with the professional advice of the consultants and planners. It would be a retrograde step to remove the role of local councillors in zoning decisions. In addition to local knowledge they also bring a scarce enough commodity – that of common sense – to the debate. By and large, I have found local authority members and Members of the Houses to be intent on delivering to the benefit of the people of their areas.</p>
          <p eId="para_594">One of the really sad results of this report and the activity which begat it is that it throws a cloud over all of us who are involved in politics. It is not a cloud we should use as an excuse for not doing what we believe is right. The upshot of what is happening in rural Ireland is that quite frequently land zoned around towns and villages is not available and somebody who wants to live in a particular locality cannot get a site in or around the town and naturally will not be allowed to build in the rural area because of planning policy.</p>
          <p eId="para_595">The Minister has indicated there are many other bodies involved such as Comhar, which has a role in relation to sustainable development. Council SPCs have certainly helped enormously in the area of thrashing out the detail. It is also fair to say that since all these activities took place much legislation has been introduced, particularly the Standards in Public Office Acts, 1995 and 2000. Setting up the Standards in Public Office Commission is a move in the right direction, but Mr. Justice Flood's findings deserve close scrutiny by Members of this House which I would prefer to see done at a committee. While no recommendations are made by Mr. Justice Flood, there are undoubtedly implications for legislation or the powers of various existing bodies and perhaps  in some instances the need to set up new agencies.</p>
          <p eId="para_596">The Minister referred to the proposed corruption assets bureau. Some of the powers proposed for this body are very wide ranging. They represent a major change in what has been in position up to now and a reasonable attempt to address the ongoing shortcomings in legislation and agencies to deal with practices of the nature uncovered by Mr. Justice Flood. We should be more proactive in providing such bodies with the power and funding to deal with whatever may be happening.</p>
          <p eId="para_597">People generally say that while the activities inquired into in this report date back in some instances almost 30 years, there is a suspicion in the mind of the public that perhaps quite different activities are now going on. There is an onus on this Parliament to provide the agencies and legislation to ensure it is not left to the people in the next generation to find out what happened, if anything, and that adequate policing and remedies are in place.</p>
          <p eId="para_598">Some of the findings of Mr. Justice Flood deserve to be considered in very great detail, in particular his finding at section 16-04, which states the tribunal has been unable to discover what actions Mr. Burke took. It also states:</p>
          <p eId="para_599">It is the opinion of the Tribunal and the Tribunal concludes that the benefit which was conferred upon Mr. Burke was conferred in circumstances which gave rise to a reasonable inference that the motives for making and receiving this benefit were connected with the public office held by Mr. Burke.</p>
          <p eId="para_600">This finding in its starkness and simplicity has implications for everybody involved in public life and is the kind of finding that deserves to be teased out, not so much in the context of the 1970s, 1980s or 1990s, but 2002.</p>
          <p eId="para_601">Sections 19-06, 19-07, 19-11 and 19-14 of the report should be examined in considerable detail. They deal with the 184 responses to advertisements placed by the tribunal seeking information. These are divided into various subgroups, some of which the tribunal was able to address. However, there is an inference that some of them that could not be dealt with by the tribunal also deal with important matters, which ought to be referred elsewhere for careful consideration. I conclude with the hope those outstanding matters will be debated and considered in detail.</p>

        <speech by="#BarryAndrewsFF" eId="spk_334">
          <from>Mr. Andrews</from>
          <p eId="para_603">I thank Deputy Killeen for sharing his time. Young people in Fianna Fáil could wash their hands of this business and say that 1997 has nothing to do with them as they were not elected then. I made my maiden speech on the Nice treaty which deals with a future of which I would like to be a part and of which Ireland should be a part. This matter relates to the murky past and decisions made in the corridors of Dublin County Council and elsewhere. However, newer Fianna Fáil Members must tackle this, as  many young people who are not Members would like to have a say on the issue. I hope to speak on their behalf.</p>
          <p eId="para_604">Fianna Fáil is now 76 years old and for a long time it was respected, even by people who were non-political. I have heard stories of Seán Lemass refusing to allow his wife to use the State car as that could be seen as an abuse of taxpayers' money. That is the kind of fundamental selflessness that was the hallmark of one of the greatest Fianna Fáil politicians. Somehow that ethic was missing in some cases and unfortunately we, the younger members of the party, are now dealing with the aftermath, which is very difficult. I speak on behalf of the ordinary members of Fianna Fáil who have been canvassing, contributing to local debates and getting involved themselves in local communities: they have contributed to their country and civic responsibility. I speak on their behalf because they are resentful of what emerged in the Flood tribunal. They are disappointed by what was found and ultimately they are the ones who have suffered. The legacy of the Flood tribunal is being felt by them. They have not abused or taken advantage of their positions in Fianna Fáil, yet they are being tarred with the same brush.</p>
          <p eId="para_605">I am sorry Deputy Ring is not here. He told Deputy Glennon and me that we had a responsibility as new Members to clean up Fianna Fáil and to restore it to the state I have just described. Deputy Ring should know it is not just Fianna Fáil councillors who were involved in certain planning matters investigated by the Flood tribunal. An interim finding has been made and further findings will be made. When those are made public Deputy Ring will have to put the spotlight on his party – not personally, I stress. The Opposition should not lecture us on those issues.</p>
          <p eId="para_606">The Opposition tactic has a fairly narrow political goal, as Deputy Glennon said. They are trying to score points against the Taoiseach and to tarnish his reputation. There has not been much from the Opposition about the legacy for those who live in the areas affected by these matters; it is all a matter of the questions that have to be answered. Any person with common sense can see that the Opposition has certain answers which it expects and thinks are true. It feels that until the Taoiseach gives those answers the questions have not been answered. The reality is that the Taoiseach has answered the questions but the answers are not those the Opposition wants. Those answers are the truth and the Taoiseach has made that very clear. He has spoken at length on those issues on a number of occasions. If the Opposition is really concerned about the issues raised by the Flood report it would look into the legacy left to those who live in the affected areas.</p>
          <p eId="para_607">The report of the Lindsay tribunal, regarding the contamination of blood products, was published during the summer. There was no hue and cry for a two-day debate or a question and answer session about that which involved life and death  issues rather than corruption and payments of money. The reason was because it did not involve the narrow political goal of tarnishing the reputation of the Taoiseach. That is not to diminish the losses of those who suffered as a result of the corruption in planning matters. It is not to say that the expenditure of €22 million over five years was not worthy. Mr. Justice Flood's report is one of the healthiest events ever in this State and I hope he continues his work.</p>
          <p eId="para_608">In my three years on the council in Dun Laoghaire-Rathdown I have found the planning process fairly healthy and transparent. I have never experienced any corruption with which I could go to the tribunal. There have been minimal rezonings and most of those have been of social benefit, such as the building of a health centre on what had been an open space. The Government has committed itself to ensuring that planning and development is transparent with the passing of the Planning and Development Act, 2000, and the subsequent Local Government Act.</p>
          <p eId="para_609">I am concerned by the Jackson Way matter, which should be tackled head on. There are suspicions about what happened there and arbitration is ongoing on the issue. If possible, the Flood tribunal should expedite its investigation of that matter because it is a matter of ongoing public concern. The Director of Corporate Enforcement has powers under the companies legislation to investigate ownership, such as powers of discovery of documents and those powers should be used as soon as possible in this matter. I wrote to the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment about it a year ago, asking for it to be investigated in this fashion. Every step should be taken to investigate the Jackson Way matter and I encourage the tribunal to do so as a matter of urgency.</p>

        <speech by="#PaulConnaughton" eId="spk_335">
          <from>Mr. Connaughton</from>
          <p eId="para_610">I propose to share my time with Deputies Crawford, Healy and Sargent.</p>
          <p eId="para_611">The report of the Flood tribunal is one of the most damning indictments I have seen since entering politics. Historians will look back on this period and wonder how so much corruption took place, why it was allowed to occur, who knew about it and why it was not stopped. The report is damning and any reasonable person reading it would surely conclude, concerning Ray Burke's actions, that someone in the Cabinet, including the Taoiseach, knew what was going on. There had to be someone who knew. The Taoiseach avoided the central question when he said his bit and ran out of the Chamber. I would have expected him to stay until 3.30 p.m. and hear everything. That would only be reasonable and if he thought as highly of the Flood report as he seems to, he should be sitting here. There were no Progressive Democrats Members present during the Taoiseach's statement. They chose to run, which speaks volumes.</p>
          <p eId="para_612">The central question is this: why did the Taoiseach appoint Ray Burke? We know about all the  signals he received – I do not have the time to go through them all. However, after all the signals he received through the years that there was some sort of whiff from Mr. Burke, why did he send Deputy Dermot Ahern to the UK? To have a word with Mr. Joseph Murphy Jr.? Did he really think that when he met Mr. Murphy and asked him if he bribed the Minister for Foreign Affairs that Mr. Murphy was likely to say he did? There was another reason for the Taoiseach to send Deputy Ahern to London which I will come to in a minute.</p>
          <p eId="para_613">The Taoiseach said today that before he appointed Mr. Burke in 1997 he asked the Garda Commissioner about him, and I am sure he did. As I understand it, there was a Garda investigation of Mr. Burke back in the late 1970s or 1980s but because of the laws on corruption, nothing could be done about it. Obviously the answer had to have been the same at that stage. Was it not spectacular that the Taoiseach did not send someone to Mr. James Gogarty, or was it because they thought he was a cranky old man with what they saw as a chip on his shoulder and he was not worth talking to? He was the obvious person to ask in order to find out the other side of the story.</p>
          <p eId="para_614">It goes much deeper than that. I believe the Taoiseach got the answers he required and he showed the people of Ireland that he did his best to come to terms with what had happened. He knew well the answer he would get. Why was Mr. Burke given that prestigious job when so many very able people were left out of that Government? There were several people, including the Minister of State, Deputy Gallagher, who would have made an excellent Minister for Foreign Affairs.</p>

          <from>Mr. Connaughton</from>
          <p eId="para_616">Why was the Minister of State, Deputy Gallagher, not appointed? I regret that the Taoiseach is not present because I wanted to say this to his face – I think Mr. Burke had something on him. There must have been some connection that the Taoiseach was afraid that Mr. Burke would speak about if he was not given a Cabinet post. I cannot prove that but I wanted to put it directly to the Taoiseach. Many other people could have done the job equally well and the people want to know why Mr. Burke was appointed. The Taoiseach did not provide the answers to those questions this afternoon.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#SeymourCrawford" eId="spk_338">
          <from>Mr. Crawford</from>
          <p eId="para_617">The Flood report has been sent to many different groups. It is important that thousands of ordinary people have bought copies of the report because its findings have disturbed so many. The Taoiseach appointed Ray Burke as Minister for Foreign Affairs. He also appointed Liam Lawlor to the Ethics committee, Deputy Ellis as chairman of the agriculture committee and Denis Foley to the DIRT committee. The common factor is that they were all appointed by  the Taoiseach but they all had to go for different reasons.</p>
          <p eId="para_618">I met former Deputy Burke the morning after former Deputy Ivan Yates agreed the deal with the Russians which saw my and the Ceann Comhairle's county left out. I had to defend that decision on local radio. I remember Ray Burke saying to me: "Seymour, why on earth did you take on your own obituary?"  I asked him if it was wrong to tell the truth. I was re-elected immediately after that because I told the truth and I was re-elected this time also, whereas Ray Burke has been out of this House for some time.</p>
          <p eId="para_619">Some of my colleagues asked me to resign for telling the truth about the Russian deal. The Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development, Deputy Walsh, recently announced that the excluded counties in the Russian deal would be re-opened. He told the Irish people that it would mean better prices and better trade. He has been re-appointed by the Taoiseach as Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development because of the involvement of big business. Deputy Walsh refused to intervene in the farmers' dispute with the meat processing industry. Is he more sympathetic to the meat industry than to farmers? I believe he should be a Minister for the whole industry and not just for a select few. There are questions to be asked about that appointment.</p>
          <p eId="para_620">The Taoiseach should be in the House now and should be prepared to answer all these questions. The Taoiseach appointed Ray Burke in the full knowledge that Mr. Burke had been the recipient of a £30,000 donation. We know now that he was also given a house and other sums of money. Both the Taoiseach and the Tánaiste knew about the £30,000. I clearly remember Ray Burke saying in this House that people were aware that he had been given £30,000 as if such a sum of money was the norm. It may have been the norm in Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats, but it certainly was not the norm on this side of the House. It frightens me that the Taoiseach knew before he appointed Ray Burke that the money had been paid by one individual. There is an old saying that there is no such thing as a free lunch. I suggest that no £30,000 is given by any individual or business without baggage attached. For that reason I suggest the Taoiseach made a major blunder. Why did the Taoiseach not listen to Albert Reynolds, a former Taoiseach? He had very good reasons for not appointing Ray Burke. They may have been personal reasons, but he gave the Taoiseach the information and yet the Taoiseach went ahead.</p>
          <p eId="para_621">The Flood tribunal has done a good job so far. It will help to cleanse this House and that is badly needed.</p>

        <speech by="#SeamusHealy" eId="spk_339">
          <from>Mr. Healy</from>
          <p eId="para_622">I wish to share my time with Deputy Sargent. In the short time available to me  I wish to ask a few questions. The Taoiseach knew full well in June 1997 that Ray Burke was given the present day equivalent of €100,000 from the engineering firm, JMSE. Why did he still appoint Mr. Burke as Minister for Foreign Affairs? Has Mr. Burke some hold over the Taoiseach? Why did the Taoiseach think that there was nothing disturbing about such a large donation, especially when the Taoiseach was aware that the donor company was lying about the donation? How does the Taoiseach explain the claims made about the thoroughness of his investigation when he failed to check with Fianna Fáil head office the claim that Ray Burke had made a payment of £10,000 to Fianna Fáil? Why did he fail to tell the Minister, Deputy Dermot Ahern, what he knew about the JMSE payment? Why did he not take the advice of the former Taoiseach, Albert Reynolds?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#TrevorSargent" eId="spk_340">
          <from>Mr. Sargent</from>
          <p eId="para_623">I appreciate the time given to me by Deputy Healy and by Fine Gael. The Taoiseach is very fortunate that the terms of the tribunal did not include the degree to which he and the Tánaiste were aware of Ray Burke being in receipt of £30,000. It is important to remember that in 1989, £30,000 would have bought a luxurious house, with a luxurious car thrown in. The significance of the value of that sum of money must raise suspicion about a Taoiseach who would overlook such a matter. In any other country it would warrant at least an offer of resignation – that would be a minimum in most countries.</p>
          <p eId="para_624">Those who became rich and powerful on the back of bad re-zoning decisions have forced people in north County Dublin to live miles from churches, schools, shops and public transport. This was mentioned by Deputy Jim Glennon, whom I welcome to the House, in the course of his maiden speech. It is too dangerous to cycle on the narrow roads on which their houses and housing estates have been built and footpaths are often non-existent. There are no recreational facilities for young people.</p>
          <p eId="para_625">There is no doubt that the DPP has a job to do, but so has the Government. This Government has published a national development plan which does not include a spatial strategy, perpetrating bad planning decisions. This is evidence of bad judgment even if there is no corruption involved. There has been no investment in public transport and a windfall tax on the profits from re-zoned land has not been introduced. Not one square metre of badly zoned land has been de-zoned. North County Dublin and many rural areas around the country are prime examples and many people have become rich and powerful. It may be coincidence that they are also very good supporters of Fianna Fáil.</p>

      the procedures in place in his Department to ensure that all rezoning decisions taken by local authorities are in line with local development plans and the spatial strategy; and the number of rezoning decisions in the past 30 years taken by local authorities which have been overturned by his Department.

          <from>Minister for the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Cullen)</from>
          <p eId="para_663">Section 10 of the Planning and Development Act, 2000, requires a development plan to set out an overall strategy for the proper planning and sustainable development of the area. The Act also provides that a development plan must include objectives, <i>inter alia,</i> for the zoning of land for the use solely or primarily of particular areas for particular purposes, whether residential, commercial, industrial, agricultural, recreational, as open space or otherwise, or a mixture of those uses, where, and to such extent, as the proper planning and sustainable development of the area, in the opinion of the planning authority, requires the uses to be indicated. It is primarily a matter, therefore, for each planning authority to ensure that these zoning provisions are consistent with the overall strategy contained in the plan.</p>
          <p eId="para_664">The Minister for the Environment and Local Government is a statutory consultee for all development plans. In accordance with normal practice, the Department, on my behalf, examines draft plans and regularly offers comments to local planning authorities. It will be well known that in recent years, and particularly in the context of the strategic planning guidelines for the greater Dublin area, my Department has raised substantive queries with a number of local authorities about their draft development plan objectives. These interventions have generally led to satisfactory outcomes.</p>
          <p eId="para_665">Ministerial power to direct a planning authority to amend a development plan is contained in section 31 of the Planning and Development Act, 2000. Similar provisions were included in the Local Government (Planning and Development) Act, 1963, but were never used.</p>
          <p eId="para_666">The new Planning and Development Act provides also for the making of regional planning guidelines by regional authorities to which local planning authorities must have regard in making and accepting a development plan. The strategic planning guidelines for the greater Dublin area represent such regional planning guidelines. I would intend that similar force should attach to the relevant provisions of the national spatial strategy when this is published shortly.</p>

          <p eId="para_669">Is there a need now for a certifying authority to safeguard the good name of councillors, in other words, a land use commission which would examine all rezoning decisions? This would not be an attempt to undermine the role of councillors but to safeguard their good name and ensure that all decisions made locally are in line with the development plan and the sustainability factor in that area?</p>
          <p eId="para_670">Will the Minister familiarise himself with the facts about the recent controversy regarding the rezoning of land in Delvin, County Westmeath, where local councillors went against the recommendations of the county manager and rezoned land, and decide that a land use commission is now long overdue?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#MartinCullen" eId="spk_348" as="#Minister_for_the_Environment_and_Local_Government">
          <from>Mr. Cullen</from>
          <p eId="para_671">It is important to bear in mind that planning is, and should be, regarded as a primary function of local authorities. The whole principle of subsidiarity comes into this, and that is certainly a European position as well. People may be trying to confuse other important issues, and indeed findings, with some suggestions now being made that we may remove it from the system. I am not sure that Deputy Allen is going that far, but I am not inclined to do that.</p>
          <p eId="para_672">In the planning process there is a wider range of issues that councillors consider. For instance, adopting housing strategies and local area plans; strategic development zones for housing, and economic development is part of the same function; approving proposed developments which would be in material contravention of the development plan; adopting a register of protected structures; and specifying other important non-zoning objectives of their development plan. These issues are central to overall good governance and proper planning.</p>
          <p eId="para_673">Under the new 2000 Act a more transparent, open and consultative process is in place which is only beginning to come into its own recently at local level in terms of the way the whole planning process is seen in a public context. I am not sure that the Deputy's idea about another layer to oversee the process is necessary. I believe in the honesty, probity and primacy of councillors. The public wants to see the transparency, honesty and probity of the system and the 2000 Act, in terms of its consultation role for various parties, contributes to that.</p>
          <p eId="para_674">The Deputy's final point is the subject of a separate question. I do not have the facts of the case before me but he is right in that when the national spatial strategy is published shortly, I will expect local and regional authorities, in terms of all their planning functions, to have serious regard to that strategy. As I indicated under the guidelines set out for the strategic development of Dublin, that was very much part of the brief in terms of coming in under the new 2000 Act.</p>

      <b>Mr. Penrose</b>
      asked the 
      <b>Minister for the Environment and Local Government</b>
      the way in which the spending incurred by his Department to date in 2002 compares with the amounts allocated in the Book of Estimates; if his Department will come in on target with regard to expenditure; if he anticipates cutbacks or adjustments in his Department; the areas in which these will be made; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

          <from>Mr. Cullen</from>
          <p eId="para_679">The 2002 spend in respect of my Department as it is now constituted is broadly consistent with the relevant profiles of expenditure which were drawn up in accordance with the provisions of the 2002 Revised Estimates for Public Services.</p>
          <p eId="para_680">An excess of €50 million for recoupment to local authorities in respect of accommodation for homeless persons, including asylum seekers, will be offset by savings in a range of other programmes. These programmes are likely to include the regeneration of local authority housing areas, non-national roads, waste management and urban renewal grants where, for various reasons, it would not be feasible to expend the relevant Estimates provision in full.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#WilliamPenrose" eId="spk_353">
          <from>Mr. Penrose</from>
          <p eId="para_681">Is it not the position that the Government had decided that cuts were to be made in advance of the general election and that they were concealed from the public until after  the election? Is it not the position also that local authorities have been advised, as part of the Minister's Estimates, not to purchase any more turnkey projects? Is it not the case that the whole thrust of advice in circulars from the Minister's Department to local authorities, especially in the housing and roads building areas, is that they cannot engage in practices which they have done up to now to address significant problems? Is that not a way of slowing down the process and not addressing serious issues in those areas?</p>
          <p eId="para_682">Are the parameters and criteria laid down in the growth and stability pact impacting on the Minister's Department's ability to secure necessary funding from the Department of Finance to carry out projects to which I know the Minister, from a previous existence, is committed?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#MartinCullen" eId="spk_354">
          <from>Mr. Cullen</from>
          <p eId="para_683">I do not agree with the Deputy's first point. The Deputy will be aware that when I was Minister of State in the Department of Finance I made comments, along with many of my other colleagues, which had absolute veracity based on information and expectations. The Deputy should remember that Ireland was not alone in terms of what we thought might happen going forward, and substantive international commentators made similar comments at the time about the world economy in general and the American economy in particular in terms of what might be anticipated. We know in hindsight that the situation has deteriorated in a global sense and as Ireland is subject to the global world economy, given that 90% of what we produce is exported, therein lies the answer.</p>
          <p eId="para_684">It is important to point out that the Revised Estimates for my Department for the delivery of the public services as set out for 2002, which included an increase of 14.6%, will be met in full. The budget for my Department is in the region of €2.5 billion. The Deputy will be aware that when we set out our plans for the year ahead under various headings, some projects and programmes go ahead rapidly and utilise more resources while others, due to a combination of circumstances, cannot be completed within the year. I have been able to meet my targets in full in terms of the Revised Estimates that were published.</p>
          <p eId="para_685">The Minister of State with responsibility for housing is beside me and will be answering questions in a while, but the general point is that in the current year we are spending about €1.1 billion on housing. There is not an unlimited budget for any heading and one must manage the process. That is what we are doing with the local authorities around the country to ensure we are not going beyond what is achievable and what was set out in this year's Estimates.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#WilliamPenrose" eId="spk_355">
          <from>Mr. Penrose</from>
          <p eId="para_686">I have read in the media about cuts being planned within the Department of about €81 million. Is this correct? Is it true that the Minister for Finance refused a request from  the Department for an extra €40 million for significant projects which it hoped to advance?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#MartinCullen" eId="spk_356">
          <from>Mr. Cullen</from>
          <p eId="para_687">It is certainly not. I am involved in the early stages of negotiating the Estimates for next year, which will be my responsibility, but can confirm that what was agreed for this year will be met in full. There is no question about that. The Deputy is being fair and understands that in some programmes the targets will not be met. I have been able to make those savings, but they are very small in the context of a €2.5 billion budget.</p>

          <p eId="para_690">I propose to take Questions Nos. 3 and 4 together.</p>
          <p eId="para_691">A statutory assessment of local authority housing needs was undertaken by each local authority at the end of March this year. My Department has only recently received all returns from local authorities and I expect we will be in a position to publish the co-ordinated results of the assessment in the next few weeks. The preliminary results available suggest an increase of between 20% and 25% in needs since 1999. The Government has already been responding to this increased social housing need by implementing in 2002 the highest level of output under the range of social housing measures for over 15 years. I anticipate output from all the social housing measures will enable the housing needs of approximately 13,000 households on waiting lists to be met this year.</p>
          <p eId="para_692">We have been making marked progress in increasing social housing output in recent years as a result of greatly increased investment, particularly in local authority and voluntary housing programmes. As recently as 1998 the housing needs of just 8,500 households were being met by these measures. As a result of greatly increased investment in housing in the national development plan, total social and affordable housing output this year will, at 13,000 households, exceed this earlier level by some 60%. The challenge  ahead will be to maintain and further diversify this high level of social housing provision.</p>

        <speech by="#BernardAllen" eId="spk_358">
          <from>Mr. Allen</from>
          <p eId="para_693">Will the Minister of State agree that there are now about 50,000 people on the social housing list? In my city, for example, a lone parent with three children can wait for anything up to seven years for an offer. Will the Minister of State agree that, at a time when there is huge demand for housing, there are three cutbacks by stealth being operated by his Department? First, the direct result of his circular letter about turnkey projects will be to slow down projects coming on stream. Second, will he agree that Part V of the Planning and Development Act, 2000, has resulted in very few planning permissions coming forward? Can he tell me how many local authority houses have been delivered under Part V of the Act? Third, will he agree that 44,000 houses will lose planning permission this year because of the withering clause and a further 35,000 will lose permission next year? Considering all this together, does it mean there will be a dramatic slowdown in the public housing construction programme this year, with consequent instability?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#NoelAhern" eId="spk_359" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_the_Environment_and_Local_Government">
          <from>Mr. N. Ahern</from>
          <p eId="para_694">The figure is not 50,000: the formal figure will be out in a couple of weeks and probably come in at around 48,000. We think it will be about 23%. Turnkey developments have increased hugely in recent years – a few years ago they were going nowhere. While they are not being totally stopped, they are certainly being slowed down. When they started a few years ago, it was because many local authorities did not have a land bank. In the last three or four years something like €370 million has been spent by local authorities in acquiring land and it makes sense that if they have bought the land, they should now build on it. We are not saying, "No". If some authorities do not have a land bank or have other problems, they can still make their case. The turnkey developments, from a couple of dozen a few years ago, will amount to about 1,000 out of the 5,500 being built.</p>
          <p eId="para_695">Some of the Deputy's questions are getting into the area of planning. The social housing project under Part V of the Act is a slow burner – we always knew that. The figure to date is about 50 houses.</p>

          <p eId="para_697">We always knew it would be a slow burner because developers had stockpiled planning permissions. By the end of the year it is estimated that it should have risen by 250 to 300.</p>

          <p eId="para_705">That is getting into the Minister's area, but, as I said, developers did stockpile permissions and it was stated in the Act that permissions would die after two years. Many developers are realising this and going back to update their planning applications. Part V will apply to those new applications.</p>

          <from>Mr. Penrose</from>
          <p eId="para_707">Is it not the biggest single indictment of the Government, and a social shame, that at a time of unprecedented wealth – or so we are told – during which the housing market has exploded, increasing by a minimum of 23%, so many people are not in a position to secure their own houses? This is because of increased and exorbitant rents. More and more people who could afford to build a house are being forced onto housing lists. Does the Minister of State intend to give resources to local authorities to secure land banks and help people who might be in a position to secure a mortgage but cannot get a site to build a house, thereby preventing them from ending up on the housing list? Can he confirm that there is to be a reduction next year in the number of local authority houses built from 7,000 to 4,000? This is very important.</p>
          <p eId="para_708">A directive was sent to local authorities preventing them from involving themselves in turnkey projects and indicating that they must get approval for design and tender – something that last happened 50 years ago. Is this not another delaying tactic, an attempt to push the boat out further in spreading the money? The Minister of State will not tell local authorities that the money is not there but will ask them to go through a rigmarole of bureaucracy while people wait and wait on housing lists across the country. It is a sad indictment of the Government and a source of shame. I am speaking as someone who was glad to get a local authority house myself. What measures will the Department take to ensure the social housing programme is implemented and a  dramatic increase in affordable house building takes place across the country, in order to tackle the housing crisis?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#NoelAhern" eId="spk_372" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_the_Environment_and_Local_Government">
          <from>Mr. N. Ahern</from>
          <p eId="para_709">As I mentioned to Deputy Allen, the Department has plans and is pushing them through as quickly as possible. The Deputy speaks of resources: the resources this year are enormous. The Minister previously mentioned that the whole housing package costs €1.1 billion. The local authority segment alone is worth €750 million, up 30% on last year's original provision and enormous by any standards. It is true that many people have applied for local authority houses in recent years who would previously have done their own thing. That is the reason the affordable housing scheme has been of such benefit. I opened a scheme six weeks ago out in Blanchardstown in which houses were being given out at very good prices, site-free. The trend in the Department to encourage affordable housing has helped people who would previously have entered the private market but have been forced into the local authority market. One cannot turn on a tap to get these projects going, but the number of houses being built under the affordable housing scheme in the Dublin area has increased hugely this year. This is a very important measure.</p>
          <p eId="para_710">The Deputy mentioned land banks. As I said, €370 million has been spent by local authorities over the last three or four years on land and now we want them to build on it. That was part of the philosophy. The turn keys were encouraged because local authorities did not have the land. Some €370 million of taxpayers' money has been spent, even though it may not have been borrowed money, and the land has been bought. In regard to next year, that argument is ongoing and it will be Christmas before we know exactly how things stand.</p>
          <p eId="para_711">It is fair to say that the number of local authority houses being made available this year is the highest for 15 years. The voluntary sector is growing. Different options are available, not just local authority housing. These include the voluntary sector, shared ownership, the affordable housing scheme and so on. Overall the needs of 13,000 people on the waiting list this year will be met.</p>

      <b>Mr. Allen</b>
      asked the 
      <b>Minister for the Environment and Local Government</b>
      the steps he is proposing to take to force the United Kingdom to close down the nuclear plant at Sellafield.
      [17312/02]
    </p>
        </question>
        <speech by="#MartinCullen" eId="spk_373">
          <from>Mr. Cullen</from>
          <p eId="para_713">The Government has taken, and will continue to take, a proactive role in campaigning against reprocessing operations at Sellafield. The programme for Government states  clearly that we regard the continued existence of Sellafield as an unacceptable threat to Ireland, that it should be closed and that we will use every diplomatic and legal route available to us to work towards the removal of this threat.</p>
          <p eId="para_714">The Government has taken an unprecedented initiative in pursuit of this policy objective through its separate legal actions under the OSPAR and UNCLOS Conventions in relation to the Sellafield MOX plant. These actions are proceeding on schedule and are challenging operations at the Sellafield MOX plant on economic, legal, environmental and safety grounds. The Government has not ruled out taking further legal action as appropriate.</p>
          <p eId="para_715">In addition, the Government has developed a strong constructive campaign against nuclear energy in general, and against activities at Sellafield in particular, that focuses clearly on the threat to Ireland from these activities based on genuine concerns regarding safety, security and sustainability. It is for this reason that, in international institutions and other multi-lateral fora, Ireland is actively advocating the highest possible standards of safety as well as health and environmental protection.</p>
          <p eId="para_716">Ireland has also responded critically to various UK public consultation processes concerning the regulation of the UK nuclear industry covering such matters as the management of radioactive waste in the UK, a review of UK energy policy and the UK strategy for discharges from nuclear installations. The Government has repeatedly pointed out that the risks and unresolved problems associated with the nuclear energy industry, when added to the high research and capital costs, including decommissioning costs, as well as continued additional safety and security costs, mean that nuclear energy is not sustainable. The significant recorded financial losses of British Nuclear Fuels and the financial situation at British Energy further underscore our position that nuclear energy is not economically viable.</p>
          <p eId="para_717">I assure the Deputy that the approach outlined will be pursued vigorously and that any further opportunities to press our case will be exercised in full.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#BernardAllen" eId="spk_374">
          <from>Mr. Allen</from>
          <p eId="para_718">What new initiatives have taken place since the postcard campaign prior to the general election? Will he also inform me if the invitation extended to the Radiological Protection Institute earlier this year has been honoured by British Nuclear Fuels?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#MartinCullen" eId="spk_375">
          <from>Mr. Cullen</from>
          <p eId="para_719">To bring the Deputy up to date, a very substantive legal case will open in The Hague on Monday week, 21 October, and we look forward to the outcome of that. In my view, part of the process in terms of our approach to the nuclear question is to build international alliances, which is important. As the Deputy will  be aware, I recently attended the world summit in Johannesburg when we got together with six other countries. This interesting group included Germany, Austria, Belgium, Sweden and Greece. We wanted to ensure that, going forward, nuclear energy would not be included under any heading regarding sustainable or renewable energy. Ireland played a central role in putting together this formidable alliance.</p>
          <p eId="para_720">In terms of winning cases, I have had bilateral meetings with the Norwegian Minister and the Icelandic Minister, who have equal concerns to Ireland, particularly in regard to Sellafield. We have had further discussions in this regard and have worked with them in supporting the various cases. We recently brought forward initiatives in regard to the shipment of nuclear fuels at one of the atomic energy commissions.</p>
          <p eId="para_721">There is much activity on this issue. The Deputy will recognise that the new Department of the Environment and Local Government has been substantially reshaped to fit into the whole environmental area. This issue is being handled directly by me at Cabinet level, which is important and gives it a further impetus. It is appreciated by my colleagues internationally that the Irish Government's approach to the issue has certainly not lessened – if anything, it has been further emphasised. Much will depend on the case that will open on Monday week as to where we go from there.</p>

          <from>Mr. Allen</from>
          <p eId="para_722">Will the Minister assure me that the invitation extended by British Nuclear Fuels has been honoured? Have our nuclear experts been able to go into Sellafield to examine the defensive and safety systems to reassure us as a nation that our future existence is not at risk? To my knowledge, it extended the invitation but did not honour it. I would be amazed if our experts have not been admitted up to now.</p>

          <from>Mr. Cullen</from>
          <p eId="para_723">The short answer to the Deputy's question is that I do not have a note in front of me, therefore I do not know whether they honoured it. I recall looking at something recently and I know that contact was made. However, I am not sure whether there was a high level investigation by the Radiological Protection Institute From my perspective of working with the institute, which is now within the ambit of my Department, we are engaged in a number of different strategies which may involve such an approach. I want to see at first hand exactly what is going on in these plants. I will get back to the Deputy on the specific point he made.</p>

          <p eId="para_741">The recent policy report, Making Ireland's Development Sustainable, published by my Department, details the progress made, the positive environmental impacts achieved as a result and areas where further progress is required.

Also, my Department has recently written to local authorities promoting more structured and effective approaches to the carrying out of environmental inspections, and local authorities have been invited to submit proposals for additional enforcement measures in respect of waste management, with funding from the environment fund. In addition, the forthcoming Environmental Protection Agency (Amendment) Bill will include strengthened provisions in relation to enforcement.</p>

Work has been initiated on the development of detailed proposals in this regard, including consideration of the legislative position and taking account of relevant responsibilities of existing agencies. I regard this work as a priority to be brought to completion as soon as possible.</p>

I had tabled a question in this respect, which was disqualified, but I would like to know that the Minister had no responsibility for this matter and that it was a matter for local authorities. What lines of communication are there to ensure that local authorities are fulfilling their obligations under the Waste Management Act to investigate the incidence of illegal dumping and illegal tip heads, as we have seen in County Wicklow?</p>

          <p eId="para_747">I will be brief. When does the Minister expect the enforcement agency to be established? Does he expect it to be on a legislative basis, because I do not see it on the Government's list of proposed legislation? What will its relationship be to the EPA and what will be the exact functions of such an enforcement agency?</p>

          <p eId="para_748">Is the Minister aware that unauthorised and illegal dumping is continuing in the  counties around Dublin of Kildare, Meath and Wicklow and that each of the three local authorities is severely understaffed to deal with this? Therefore, does the Minister intend to either give resources through this new agency directly to the local authorities or does he intend to give the new enforcement agency the power to deal with unauthorised dumping, because considerable under-resourcing continues to this day?</p>
          <p eId="para_749">Does the Minister have any plans to remediate the unauthorised dumps that exist throughout the country? Does he intend to give either the EPA, the relevant local authorities or the new agency the power and resources to remediate the illegal and unauthorised dumps that exist?</p>

          <from>Mr. Cullen</from>
          <p eId="para_750">As all the Deputies know, these decisions are in the remit of local authorities. They have responsibility, but let us not forget there is a range of other laws in place with regard to anybody who is illegally dumping. I am aware that there are significant problems with illegal dumping throughout the country. However, in respect of the enforcement agency, Deputy Penrose's points are very pertinent. They are exactly the points to which I am giving consideration because, if I am to set up an enforcement agency, I want it to work. I want it to have independence and see how it relates to the EPA, the other bodies and local authorities as well. That is a central point which I have inherited and I am heavily engaged with it at present.</p>
          <p eId="para_751">Deputy Cuffe is correct, but I wish that we could have a bit more leadership from some politicians who think there are simple solutions to dealing with waste management. There are not.</p>

I would rather have a much more controlled environment for dealing with all aspects of waste, from recycling to landfill to thermal treatment, rather than the current problem where many of these activities happen in an illegal fashion and cause far more damage to the environment than they would if we had proper facilities in place. I hope I will get the support of all Deputies in the House when I begin to implement the serious waste management plan.</p>

          <p eId="para_755">I assume that the question refers to the town renewal scheme. Designations under the town renewal scheme were announced in July 2000 and the scheme is due to operate until 31 December 2003. The incentives available under the scheme have already been enhanced with the extension, with effect from 5 December last, of section 23-type incentives to sites already designated for residential owner-occupier incentives.</p>
          <p eId="para_756">My Department has recently requested local authorities to intensify their efforts in promoting the benefits of the scheme at local level. With the enhanced incentives available and a pro-active approach by county councils to implementing and promoting the scheme, I am confident that significant progress can be achieved in the towns designated. My Department will, however, continue to monitor the progress of the scheme.</p>

          <p eId="para_758">I thank you, a Cheann Comhairle, for allowing the question. The Minister of State should carry out an in-depth evaluation of the scheme. It has a lot to contribute, but it is just not working. The scheme is just not effective, which I know for a fact. For example, the desired results are not being produced in the towns in Kerry. The in-depth evaluation should be carried out by the Department and not by the county councils. The Minister of State should also look at additional provisions in this year's budget to make the scheme more attractive because it is not having an impact on the ground.</p>

          <p eId="para_759">I agree that the take-up of the scheme has been poor to date, but I do not think an evaluation or extra incentives are required. The incentives available are the same as those available for the urban renewal scheme, which has been very successful. Take-up has been very slow and it is felt in counties where it has operated well that if local authorities took a pro-active approach and were seen to be pushing it, and perhaps had a designated official trying to deal with all queries of owners or developers, it might help to push things along. One can have problems with title and such matters. More assistance and promotion from the local authorities is needed, as is a more pro-active approach. If that were done for the remaining 15 months we would see more success.</p>

        <heading>Adjournment Debate. - Report of the Inspector of Mental Hospitals.</heading>
        <speech by="#DanNeville" eId="spk_400">
          <from>Mr. Neville</from>
          <p eId="para_762">I thank the Ceann Comhairle for allowing me raise this issue. I congratulate the Minister of State, Deputy Tim O'Malley, on his appointment. We served as colleagues on the Mid-Western Health Board for many years and I know that his heart is in the right place in respect of the issue of mental illness. I have some doubts, however, that his political masters will support him in all he will want to do.</p>
          <p eId="para_763">There is no doubt that the mental health services are the most neglected area of our health provision since the foundation of the State. The report of the inspector of mental hospitals for the year ending 31 December 2001 again highlights how neglected those suffering from psychiatric illness are. The inspector has, time and again, been struck by the number of psychiatric in-patients who are homeless and who are accommodated in acute or long-stay hospital wards, despite their being suitable for community and residential placements. There is hardly a service in Ireland where this situation does not exist. Such people have not moved to the community domestic scale residential or multiple accommodation because, in some cases, suitable property is not available. In other cases, especially in Dublin and other metropolitan areas, premises have become expensive. Surely the State should facilitate those who are at present in a psychiatric institution who do not need to be there and should be returned to the community. Even from a financial point of view it makes sense that such provision be made.</p>
          <p eId="para_764">Will the Minister of State outline when community based centres of psychiatric activity will be introduced? Without such functioning presence away from the patient base, there is a serious failure of the health care delivery system  in adhering to the Government's health strategy goals and objectives. In a majority of instances, such premises do not exist or are of inadequate structure and size for the identified purpose of their activity. In addition, there is, in many instances, a reluctance on the part of mental health professionals to centre their activities and working days in a community setting. The Government must immediately address this issue, which can be achieved without neglecting the professional's in-patient commitments.</p>
          <p eId="para_765">Similar difficulties arise in relation to the concept of hospital assessment and treatment. The inspector informs us that health professionals are confused in their conceptualisation of what a day hospital should be about, which patients should be treated and what treatment should be available. This is surely an indictment of the delivery of the services. Other difficulties arise in connection with the concept of day hospital assessment and treatment. The experience of the inspector country-wide is that health professionals are confused about which patients they should treat and what treatments should be available. In many instances, so-called day hospitals do not deal with a broad range of psychiatric disorders, especially the more serious ones, and do not provide a broad range of treatments. Ideally, a day hospital should provide every treatment that is available in an in-patient setting. Many premises are too small or do not have sufficiently large internal space to deal with more serious illnesses.</p>
          <p eId="para_766">Will the Minister of State outline the results of a study of community psychiatric services by the health boards' research unit, which is due to be published this year? The treatment of the elderly in our psychiatric institutions is a disgrace and cannot be defended. Currently, almost 40% of persons resident in psychiatric units in hospital are over 65 years of age. In some instances, especially among long-stay patients, this figure exceeds 50%. Not all such patients show signs of behavioural disturbance related to psychiatric disorder and among the more elderly especially, their needs and disabilities are related to their age rather than any psychiatric disorder. The inspector points out that the continuing residence in long-stay psychiatric facilities is neither appropriate nor best suited to their needs. Their remaining on the psychiatric register is neither helpful clinically nor appropriate from a civil rights point of view. The inspector is saying the civil rights of elderly long-stay patients are being denied. Will the Minister of State outline the programme to transfer their care to either the community residence, which is possible, or suitable in-patient continuing care facilities for older people in psychiatric institutions?</p>
          <p eId="para_767">A very disturbing aspect of the report outlines that in 2001 there were nine cases of suicide among psychiatric patients. Will the Minister of State indicate if it is planned, as recommended by  the inspector, to undertake an in-depth review of all deaths by suicide of patients under psychiatric care with a view to scrutinising existing clinical management and risk assessment of patients for the possibility or likelihood of self-injury, including the periodic review of procedures relating to absence when in the community?</p>
          <p eId="para_768">In May 2000 a 16 year old boy died by suicide while in the care of the Mid-Western Health Board. At the time I raised the issue with the Minister and he promised an early report. I submitted a parliamentary question for reply yesterday and the Minister has informed me that he understands the Mid-Western Health Board expects to be in a position to issue a final report on this matter within weeks. Will the Minister of State explain the reason it has taken two years and five months to produce a report on the suicide of a person in the care of a health board?</p>
          <p eId="para_769">In the last week of September a young student in the Mid-West Regional Hospital died by suicide. The family of this victim has requested that a report on her death, independent of the Mid-Western Health Board, be completed. I ask the Minister of State to facilitate this.</p>

        <speech by="#TimOMalleyPD" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Health_and_Children" eId="spk_401">
          <from>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Mr. T. O'Malley)</from>
          <p eId="para_770">I thank the Deputy for raising this matter on the Adjournment. I welcome the publication of the report of the Inspector of Mental Hospitals for 2001 and acknowledge the important role the inspector plays in providing an accurate and detailed account of services in the mental health sector throughout the country. I met the inspector recently to discuss his report and elicit his views about the areas of the mental health services that need improvement. The inspector informed me that steady progress is being made across the country in the move towards an integrated, community based mental health service, but that much remains to be done.</p>
          <p eId="para_771">In his 2001 report the inspector notes the continuing decline in the number of patients in psychiatric in-patient facilities, from 4,522 at the end of 2000 to 4,256 at the end of 2001. There were 26,037 admissions to these facilities in 2001. The number of involuntary admissions, at approximately 2,597, remained constant at 10%.</p>
          <p eId="para_772">The inspector refers to the ongoing replacement of old institutional mental hospitals with acute psychiatric units attached to general hospitals. During 2001 new acute psychiatric units were completed or nearing completion at St. Luke's Hospital, Kilkenny; Mayo General Hospital, Castlebar, and Portlaoise General Hospital. It is expected that each of these units will become available to the respective mental health services shortly. The construction of new acute psychiatric units is also well under way at James Connolly Memorial Hospital, Blanchardstown, and St. Vincent's Hospital, Elm Park. At  the time of inspection the few remaining patients at Our Lady's Psychiatric Hospital in Cork were due to transfer to the new St. Anne's unit in Shanakiel in Cork city, facilitating the final closure of Our Lady's Psychiatric Hospital. I am pleased to report that this process has now been completed.</p>
          <p eId="para_773">The inspector also noted that several significant developments had taken place during 2001. These included the enactment of the Mental Health Act, 2001, which was signed into law in July 2001. The Act provides for the establishment of the Mental Health Commission, which was established with effect from 5 April 2002. The commission is an independent statutory body whose primary functions are to promote, foster and encourage the establishment and maintenance of high standards and good practices in the delivery of mental health services and protect the interests of people detained for psychiatric care and treatment. While the detailed work programme of the commission is a matter for it to determine, I understand one of its priorities over the next year will be to put in place the structures required for the operation of mental health tribunals.</p>
          <p eId="para_774">The first report of the working group on child and adolescent psychiatry was published in March 2001 and provides the blueprint for the development of these services in the coming years. The group is now focusing on the particular needs of 16 to 18 year olds. The new national health strategy document, Quality and Fairness – A Health System for You, was also published in 2001 and includes a commitment to prepare a national policy framework for the further modernisation of the mental health services, updating the 1984 policy document, Planning for the Future.</p>
          <p eId="para_775">While the inspector expressed concern at the inadequate skill mix and lack of flexibility within many mental health services, he welcomed the introduction of new measures aimed at attracting and retaining nursing staff and the development of higher level courses for nurses wishing to follow a clinical career path. It is my intention to facilitate the service providers in bringing about the improvements and developments identified by the inspector as quickly as possible.</p>
          <p eId="para_776">Substantial capital funding under the national development plan has been allocated to the development of mental health facilities. Approximately €190 million is being provided over the lifetime of the plan, which will enable the further provision of acute psychiatric units attached to general hospitals and the provision of additional community based facilities. Additional revenue funding of €24.4 million has been provided this year for improvements in mental health services. The main development programmes for 2002 include community based services, hospital services, child and adolescent psychiatry, old age  psychiatry, suicide and suicide prevention programmes and the continuing support of the voluntary sector. I am committed to ensuring the recommendations contained in the inspector's report for 2001 are implemented as soon as possible.</p>

        <speech by="#FergusODowdFG" eId="spk_402">
          <from>Mr. O'Dowd</from>
          <p eId="para_777">This report basically proposes to cut back on bus services to the tune of €6.2 million from July 2002. In particular, the proposals for County Louth are causing grave concern to the people there. I refer specifically to the revision of the Dublin to Drogheda route which is targeted for savings – some €40,000 will be cut in January 2003. It is intended to cancel the rural and one day a week services in the Dundalk area at a saving of €100,000. The town of Drogheda service is to be withdrawn from January of next year – this is a cut of €50,000. A further cut of €90,000 will see the withdrawal of the town of Dundalk service.</p>
          <p eId="para_778">The Government is committed to improving public transport, including bus services. I refer to page 44 of the Fianna Fáil manifesto which specifically relates to buses. It is committed to further progress on upgrading the bus fleet, providing bus priorities in Dublin and other cities and increasing the level and frequency of the service. On the same page there is also a commitment to new services being introduced both in new housing developments and existing poorly served communities.</p>
          <p eId="para_779">I discussed the report with the regional manager in Dundalk and put it to him that there was grave concern in and around County Louth at the scale of the draconian proposals, particularly as the service had been extended to cope with the expansion of Drogheda and Dundalk in recent years. Bus Éireann has been very good at providing excellent, new services to meet people's demands.</p>
          <p eId="para_780">The more people that use public transport the better it will be. This is helpful in regard to sustainable development and will contribute to a reduction in the level of toxic emissions. Efficient public transport would allow town centres to work more effectively. They are currently overrun by people who insist on driving cars because they feel there is no alternative. If people can drive their car to the supermarket then that is what they do.</p>
          <p eId="para_781">The fact that this document was prepared in July this year contrasts greatly with the image being presented, particularly by Fianna Fáil in its programme for Government. It is absolutely and totally unacceptable to the people of Louth that these cuts in services will take place. Will the Minister give a commitment that the town services in Drogheda and Dundalk, the services to  Dublin and the rural services in County Louth will not be curtailed? Will he stand by his party's election commitments to sustain and improve these services. It is absolutely essential to the people of the county. Many people, including pensioners, are worried and upset about what is proposed.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#TimOMalleyPD" eId="spk_403">
          <from>Mr. T. O'Malley</from>
          <p eId="para_782">The Government is fully committed to the development of the public transport system. The scale of investment committed in the national development plan to enhance public transport is unprecedented in the history of the State. This follows decades of under investment in the public transport network which resulted in inadequate infrastructure and services required to sustain economic development in the 21st century.</p>
          <p eId="para_783">In line with the commitment of the Government to public transport, €233 million of Exchequer funding has been allocated to CIE as a revenue subvention in 2002. This represents an increase of 75% in Exchequer revenue funding since 1997.</p>
          <p eId="para_784">No report has been submitted to my colleague the Minister for Transport on proposed actions with regard to the financial position of Bus Éireann in 2002. Bus Éireann has also advised the Minister for Transport that no decisions have been taken to cut services on its network. However, in line with normal practice, Bus Éireann continues to adjust its timetable from time to time in response to demand patterns and to maximise the utilisation of resources.</p>
          <p eId="para_785">The Department of Transport recently received an application for a fare increase from CIE, which has been submitted in the context of its emerging financial position. This application is being considered in the context of reform issues, including within CIE, to further improve the efficiency, effectiveness and structure of the organisation in response to changing customer needs and demands. My colleague the Minister for Transport is considering a number of options.</p>

        <heading>Adjournment Debate. - Barring Orders.</heading>
        <speech by="#BarryAndrewsFF" eId="spk_404">
          <from>Mr. Andrews</from>
          <p eId="para_786">Interim barring orders are provided for those who can show they are at risk of harm from a spouse or family member. Yesterday's Supreme Court ruling has created a dangerous situation for those hitherto protected by interim barring orders.</p>
          <p eId="para_787">Women's Aid has already reported two types of incidence since that judgment. One is that spouses formerly restrained by interim barring orders are returning to the family home as they become aware of this development. The Garda Síochána has instructed its members that current interim barring orders are no longer valid and that people can, therefore, return home legitimately.</p>
          <p eId="para_788">The second incidence it is reporting is that, in some cases, people are confused about the distinction between an interim barring order and an actual one that has resulted from a full hearing so they are being browbeaten into accepting someone back into a violent situation. The coming weekend presents great dangers for those who have hitherto been protected by interim barring orders. This is the time when most domestic violence occurs. I would like to think the House has the capacity to come up with a solution to this problem in the short-term.</p>
          <p eId="para_789">In my own experience what happens is that when a domestic violence incident occurs a garda shows up and recommends an interim barring order. This is duly granted but the problem arises in that the return date for a full hearing might be three or four months down the road. There are insufficient judges and the Courts Service is not properly streamlined. The Supreme Court acknowledged this in stating that these interim barring orders were unconstitutional, and it was probably right about that.</p>
          <p eId="para_790">I hope the Minister will be in a position to state what steps the Courts Service can take in the short-term – days rather than weeks – to protect potential victims. I look forward to hearing what the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform can come up with in the short-term and what the Garda Síochána is going to do until the problem has been resolved. One weekend is too many but I hope that something can be done by next week at the latest.</p>
          <p eId="para_791">The legislation is adequate if time limits are introduced, as was recognised by the Supreme Court, as people were being kept out of their homes for a long period of time. As far as I understand, a respondent in the High Court can ask to have it discharged at any time during the period of the interim barring order so, in effect, time limits are what is required. I suggest that a statutory instrument could be introduced in the short-term. I call on the Minister to bring some measure before the House next week so that this matter can be dealt with and this loophole can be closed until such time as substantial changes to the Domestic Violence Act, 1996, can be brought before the House.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#MichaelMcDowellPD" as="#Minister_for_Justice,_Equality_and_Law_Reform" eId="spk_405">
          <from>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. McDowell)</from>
          <p eId="para_792">I am grateful to Deputy Andrews for raising this question which is of widespread concern, particularly, to those who are, or may be, victims of domestic violence.</p>
          <p eId="para_793">Yesterday, the Supreme Court, in the case of Keating <i>v</i> Crowley, Ireland and the Attorney General, declared that section 4(3) of the Domestic Violence Act, 1996, is invalid having regard to the provisions of the Constitution. This subsection permits the Circuit Court or the District Court to make an interim barring order <i>ex parte,</i> that is, without notice to the person to be barred,  where the court considers it necessary or expedient in the interests of justice. The Supreme Court held that the procedures prescribed by subsections (1), (3) and (4) of section 4 of the 1996 Act, in failing to prescribe a fixed period of relatively short duration during which an interim barring order made <i>ex parte</i> is to continue in force, deprive the respondents to such applications of the protection of the principle of <i>audi alteram partem</i>– hear the other side – in a manner and to an extent which is disproportionate, unreasonable and unnecessary. In other words, the provisions in question deprive the person who would be the subject of the interim barring order of the right to be heard in his or her own defence in a way which is unconstitutional.</p>
          <p eId="para_794">This decision clearly demands a response from the Government and we are studying the judgment to determine what the appropriate course of action is. The Attorney General has already asked for counsel's advice on the matter.</p>
          <p eId="para_795">I caution against an overly negative view of this judgment from the point of view of victims and potential victims of domestic violence. The declaration of the Supreme Court yesterday relates only to section 4(3) of the 1996 Act, the power to grant interim barring orders <i>ex parte.</i> The other protective reliefs available under the Act remain unaffected. While the court noted the draconian consequences of interim barring orders in the sense that breach of such an order is a criminal offence and also that the respondent is liable to be arrested by a garda who has a reasonable belief that such an offence has been committed, it did not declare that such orders were in themselves unconstitutional.</p>
          <p eId="para_796">Safety and barring orders remain unaffected by this judgment as do protection orders. Protection orders are particularly important in the present context in that they are interim measures pending the determination of an application for a barring or safety order. Protection orders direct that the respondent should not use or threaten to use violence against, molest or put in fear the applicant. Section 5(4) of the 1996 Act provides that such an order may be made <i>ex parte.</i> This is a remedy which could be considered by persons who fear violence in the period before the hearing of their application for the barring or safety order or persons who have interim barring orders granted <i>ex parte</i> and who fear they may now be ineffective for the reasons mentioned by the Deputy and the purpose for which they were made. Anyone who fears they are adversely affected by the Supreme Court decision is nonetheless free to apply for a protection order which would go a considerable distance to dealing with the anxieties the Deputy mentioned.</p>
          <p eId="para_797">In this context, I understand from the Courts Service that a maximum of 45 interim barring orders are in existence in the Dublin metropolitan district. I cannot give a figure for the rest of  the State, but it may be of a similar order. I also note from the report of the Courts Service for 2001 that, while the average length of time from the date of issue of the summons to the hearing of barring and safety order applications was 12 weeks, barring order applications where an interim barring order had been made were dealt with within two to three weeks. This shows that the District Court has been giving priority to cases in which an interim order has been made.</p>
          <p eId="para_798">What remains is to decide on the legislative change needed to rectify the constitutional defect found by the Supreme Court. As I said, the Attorney General will be advising on this and, until I receive his advice, I cannot make any definitive statements on the issue. However, I am reassured by yesterday's judgment in that, while the Supreme Court has struck down a provision in the Domestic Violence Act, it has not called into question the policy underlying the Act or the need to protect vulnerable people under threat of violence in their homes. On page 24 of the judgment it is stated:</p>
          <p eId="para_799">The issue in the case is not whether the Oireachtas was entitled to abridge, even in a relatively drastic fashion, the right of the [respondent in a barring order case] to be heard, in order to protect spouses and dependant children from domestic violence. That the legislature were entitled to effect such an abridgement of the rights of individual citizens in order to deal with the social evil of domestic violence is beyond dispute. The question for resolution in this case is as to whether the manner in which the abridgement of the right to be heard has been effected is proportionate. . .</p>
          <p eId="para_800">While the court found that the existing provision was not proportionate, I see nothing in this judgment which will prevent the House from enacting a new provision which is both fair and effective in respect to all parties and which will be consistent with the terms of the judgment.</p>

        <heading>Adjournment Debate. - Asylum Applications.</heading>
        <speech by="#BernardJDurkan" eId="spk_406">
          <from>Mr. Durkan</from>
          <p eId="para_801">I thank the Ceann Comhairle for giving me the opportunity to raise this issue in the House and compliment the Ministers who have appeared for the Adjournment debate. I recognise that some cannot always do it, but also recognise the reluctance of some to ever do it. I also highlight the quality of replies to parliamentary questions. Some Ministers are economical in the way they deal with replies. I regard that as an insult to the House and themselves. No one present need take offence at what I said. It does not apply to them. I intend to raise this issue at the appropriate time.</p>
          <p eId="para_802">I bring to the attention of the Minister, who is probably already aware of it, the case of an  unfortunate family who have sought asylum in this country for some time. It comprises six people – one parent and five daughters. They have lived in the north Kildare and south Meath area for the past year and a half. The children have attended school regularly and do very well. They are extremely studious and two of them are studying for public examinations.</p>
          <p eId="para_803">While I appreciate the difficulty which arises in such cases, perhaps the Minister would take into account the unfortunate circumstances in which the people concerned find themselves and try to alleviate the hardship for them as much as possible. It would be better, if it were possible, to accommodate them in this country. This has traditionally been a hospitable country which is known as Ireland of the céad míle fáilte. While I know this cannot be applied in all circumstances, there are compelling reasons in this case for taking into account the circumstances and adjudicating on the application in a fair and compassionate way. I know the Minister will do this, but wish to emphasise the need to do so.</p>
          <p eId="para_804">I know a parent has been detained and separated from the family. This has caused extreme trauma, anxiety, hardship and concern to the young members of the family especially and the other parent. It is not in Ireland's interests at any time to ignore the pleas of such people, especially if they are genuine. I appeal to the Minister to examine the case carefully and hope he can find grounds to accommodate the family. Submissions have been made by the principal of the local school that the children attend. I understand he sent a letter today to the Minister's office to apprise him of his concerns in the issue. I hope the Minister can indicate to the House the likelihood of the family being accommodated for the foreseeable future in safe surroundings with a view to allowing them to continue their education, provided all other procedures are complied with.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#MichaelMcDowellPD" eId="spk_407">
          <from>Mr. McDowell</from>
          <p eId="para_805">I thank the Deputy for excluding me from his remarks about the adequacy and inadequacy of ministerial replies. I am not aware of any case where the deportation of a family to their country of origin following the refusal of their asylum applications in this State has been the subject of an Adjournment debate in this House. I am somewhat uneasy about the extent to which the request for this debate requires me to discuss the individual circumstances of this family. However, it is important that the House is fully aware that the making of a deportation order is a serious matter and is not a decision taken lightly. I reassure the Deputy and the House that the procedures by which such decisions are taken are fair and reasonable and while it may seem harsh to return a person to a country of origin who might otherwise have a better standard of living in this country, deportation  is a normal and necessary component of any immigration system.</p>
          <p eId="para_806">I will summarise the background of the family concerned since their arrival in the State. The person to whom the Deputy refers and her five children arrived in the State on 10 May 1998. The mother of the family concerned completed an asylum application on 11 May 1998. Her application was treated as one which also covered her five children. She received an interview and her case was considered by appropriately trained staff. The application was refused and she appealed this refusal. She had the benefit of an oral hearing and engaged her own legal representation at that hearing which was conducted by an independent asylum appeal authority. Her appeal was considered by this authority, which was appointed as an independent authority to consider such appeals and which recommended that her appeal should be rejected.</p>
          <p eId="para_807">Her asylum application was refused on 23 August 2000. In the notice of this refusal the person concerned was given three options as required under the Immigration Act, 1999. These were: to make representations in writing as to why she should be allowed to remain in the State; to leave the State before a deportation order was made; and to consent to the making of a deportation order. The applicant made representations under section 3 of the Immigration Act, 1999, which were submitted to me by solicitors acting on her behalf. I considered all the circumstances in this case and I made deportations orders in respect of each of the family members on 2 August 2002.</p>
          <p eId="para_808">The deportation orders were made by me in accordance with the provisions of the Immigration Act, 1999. That Act requires that before I make a deportation order in respect of a person I must consider a range of 11 personal circumstances, including the age of the person, the duration of their residence in the State, the family and domestic situation, humanitarian considerations and any representations made by the person or on their behalf.</p>
          <p eId="para_809">Furthermore, section 5 of the Refugee Act, 1996, must be considered in every case and this provides for a prohibition of <i>refoulement</i> as follows: First, a person shall not be expelled from the State or returned in any manner whatsoever to the frontiers of territories where, in the opinion of the Minister, the life or freedom of that person would be threatened on account of his or her race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group or political opinion. Second, without prejudice to the generality of subsection (1), a person's freedom shall be regarded as being threatened, if, <i>inter alia,</i> in the opinion of the Minister, the person is likely to be subject to a serious assault, including a serious assault of a sexual nature.</p>
          <p eId="para_810">In making the deportations orders in this case, I considered the entire case file of the family, including the decision made in relation to the application for refugee status, the requirements of the Immigration Act, 1999, and the prohibition of <i>refoulement</i> and I concluded that the making of deportation orders was the appropriate decision.</p>
          <p eId="para_811">The Supreme Court, in the case of P.L.B, delivered its judgment on 30 July 2001. The circumstances of the persons concerned in that judgment were similar to those of this family. The Supreme Court described their situation in that:</p>
          <p eId="para_812">They were persons whose applications for asylum have been rejected at first instance and on appeal. They lacked any entitlement to remain in the country save that deriving from the procedures they were operating, i.e. a right to await a decision on a request not to be deported.</p>
          <p eId="para_813">The court went on to say that an applicant in this situation was:</p>
          <p eId="para_814">. . . at the time of making representations a person without title to remain in the State. This fact constrains the nature of the decision to be made. The legislative scheme is that such a person may be deported. If this were not so, such persons would be enabled in effect to bypass the normal system of application for entry into the country, made from outside.</p>
          <p eId="para_815">The power to arrest and detain a person who is subject to a deportation order is contained in section 5(1) of the Immigration Act, 1999. The sole purpose of such arrest and detention is to ensure the deportation of that person from the State.</p>
          <p eId="para_816">In the referral by the President under Article 26 of the Constitution of sections 5 and 10 of the Illegal Immigrants (Trafficking) Bill, 1999, to the Supreme Court, the judgment on 28 August 2000 stated that a person who is subject to a deportation order and is detained on foot thereof "is a person not entitled to be in the country". The court found that, in relation to detention on foot of a deportation order, "in all the circumstances the safeguards which do in fact exist. . .  are perfectly adequate to meet the requirements of the Constitution."</p>
          <p eId="para_817">The safeguards to which the court referred were as follows. Under modern jurisprudence in common law, an executive power of detention must not be unnecessarily exercised and the relevant executive authority must be vigilant to ensure that the detention is brought to an end if, having regard to new circumstances or discovery of new facts or some other reason, it is no longer necessary. The person detained may challenge by judicial review the validity of the deportation order. If it is considered that the power of detention is <i>ultra vires,</i> then an application for judicial review can be made seeking an order compelling  the reconsideration of the grounds for detention. There is a constitutional remedy of an inquiry under Article 40.4.2º, which will examine the basis for the circumstances of the arrest and detention.</p>
          <p eId="para_818">The person to whom the Deputy refers was entitled to challenge the making of the deportation orders in this case by means of an application for judicial review in the High Court but, at this stage, an extension of time would have to be sought from the court. Such a legal challenge has not been instigated. Furthermore, when I made the deportation orders, my Department directed the family to report to the Garda National Immigration Bureau or the gardaí at Trim Garda station. If they had done so, no detention would have been necessary. They did  not report as requested and, as a consequence, were immediately liable to arrest and detention by the Garda.</p>
          <p eId="para_819">The person concerned was arrested on Saturday, 5 October 2002, and is currently in lawful detention in the Dachas Centre, North Circular Road, Dublin 7, pending her deportation from the State. Her children are at present in the care of a close relative. This arrangement is in the knowledge and with the approval of the appropriate social services.</p>
          <p eId="para_820">The Deputy asked if the procedure and treatment in this case is normal and in accordance with that which would normally be expected in such circumstances. I assure the Deputy and the House that it is normal, lawful and appropriate.</p>
          <p eId="para_821">The Dáil adjourned at 5.30 p.m. until 2.30 p.m. on Tuesday, 15 October 2002.</p>

          <p eId="para_826">I propose to take Questions Nos. 9, 194 and 196 together.</p>
          <p eId="para_827">All planning authorities completed their housing strategies in accordance with Part V of the Planning and Development Act, 2000 by the July 2001 deadline and all strategies were adopted by means of a variation of the relevant development plan. To assist local authorities, my Department had earlier issued guidelines and a model housing strategy in December 2000. Draft housing strategies were forwarded to my Department and were examined by reference to the guidelines and model strategy.</p>
          <p eId="para_828">Housing strategies are a key element of the Government's policy of increasing the supply of housing and making housing more affordable. Under Part V of the Planning and Development Act, 2000 each planning authority is legally required to prepare a housing strategy which will cover the period of its development plan. Crucially, planning authorities are now legally obliged to ensure there is sufficient land zoned for residential development over the period of the development plan to meet the housing requirements identified in the strategy. To ensure the housing strategy is kept up to date, planning authorities must review and, if necessary, amend it within two years of its preparation. The strategy should also be reviewed where there is a change in housing requirements or in the housing market that could fundamentally affect the existing strategy.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_82">Housing strategies should, therefore, bring greater order and certainty into the planning and provision of housing development in local authority areas in a way which will benefit both the house building industry and households requiring housing. To ensure that Part V is meeting the objectives for which it was enacted, with particular reference to social and affordable housing, a review of its operation is under way in my Department. It is intended that the results of this review will be brought to Government as soon as possible.</summary>

In addition, European Commission Decision 2000/532/EC revised the EU list of hazardous waste to include, with effect from the same date, equipment which contains CFCs. These changes affect the disposal of fridges and freezers manufactured before 1994, which contain CFCs in insulating foam as well as in fridge coolant. While technology is available in Ireland for the removal of CFCs from the coolants, no equipment is yet available for the removal of the insulating foam. Accordingly since 1 January fridges and freezers cannot be dealt with by the traditional method of degassing, recovering the metal and sending the remaining waste to landfill.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_84">I understand that in the absence of treatment facilities in Ireland, a problem also being experienced in other EU member states, a number of local authorities have made arrangements for the storage of fridges and freezers or for their export to appropriate European recovery facilities; such arrangements may involve co-operation with private waste companies. In the interests of a longer term solution and within the co-operative framework for the North-South Ministerial Council, my Department has developed an all-island approach in co-operation with the Department of the Environment in Northern Ireland. Tenders are now being sought on behalf of all local authorities on the island for the provision of a service for the management of waste fridges and freezers. It is expected that this tender process will be completed by the end of November.</summary>

        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_85">The primary aim of the Johannesburg World Summit on Sustainable Development was to hold a ten year review of the 1992 Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro and to reinvigorate the global commitment to sustainable development. The summit agreed the Johannesburg Declaration on Sustainable Development and a Plan of Implementation reaffirming commitment to existing  targets in the UN Millennium Declaration and other international agreements, and including a range of new action based commitments and time bound targets in relation to access to sanitation, safer production and use of chemicals, access to energy and increasing the global share of renewable energy sources, reduction in the current rate of loss of biodiversity, development of programmes to achieve sustainable production and consumption, maintenance or restoration of depleted fish stocks, ratification of the Kyoto Protocol by those states which have not yet ratified, strengthening of health care systems for the delivery of basic health care to all and promotion of good governance and gender equity.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_86">The plan of implementation also calls for the creation of a world solidarity fund for the eradication of extreme poverty, the modalities of which are to be determined by the UN General Assembly. In support of the plan, numerous partnerships for sustainable development were launched between Governments-business in the developed world and developing countries-international agencies, including two EU partnerships on water and energy. These are designed to give practical effect to relevant commitments in the plan. Ireland joined with a number of other EU member states and obtained clarification that the EU partnership on energy did not include nuclear energy as an option within the initiative.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_87">While a specific target for renewable energy was not agreed, the EU supported by a number of other countries, issued a declaration underlining their commitment to co-operate in the further development and promotion of renewable energy technologies, and to the adoption of renewable energy targets. Ireland's national report for the summit, Making Ireland's Development Sustainable, which I launched in July 2002, reviews Ireland's progress towards sustainable development over the period 1992-2002, and identifies our policy priorities for the decade ahead. I am satisfied that the positive outcomes from the summit and the renewed emphasis on the standing agenda from Rio will have an important influence on the delivery of our policy priorities towards more sustainable patterns of development.</summary>

          <p eId="para_850">The strategic planning guidelines for the greater Dublin area, which were published on 25 March 1999, are intended to provide a long-term strategic planning framework for the development of the greater Dublin area. The guidelines were addressed to the local authorities in the greater Dublin area and to the Dublin and mid-east regional authorities. The Planning and Development Act, 2000 provides that these guidelines are now deemed to be regional planning guidelines as provided for in that Act. The review of the guidelines is, therefore, formally a matter to be undertaken by the two regional authorities in the area.</p>
          <p eId="para_851">The imminent publication of the national spatial strategy will provide a context and a structure for the review of the GDA strategic planning guidelines.

          <p eId="para_853">The total of 79 blue flags awarded to 75 beaches and four marinas in 2002 maintains the high number of blue flags awarded to these areas in 2001. The loss of blue flags at three beaches in 2002 was balanced by the award or restoration of blue flags at three other beaches.</p>
          <p eId="para_854">The blue flag scheme is operated by the Foundation for Environmental Education, FEE, a non-governmental organisation, and is administered in Ireland by An Taisce. The awarding or withdrawal of a blue flag is decided by FEE. My Department provides grant-aid to An Taisce as a contribution towards the administration expenses of the blue flag scheme in Ireland and we are in consultation with An Taisce in the context of identifying the options and measures required for increasing the number of blue flags awarded to areas in Ireland.</p>

        <summary eId="sum_89">My Department's updated programme for investment in water services in 2002 to 2004 relates to 380 waste water schemes with an estimated capital value of €2.6 billion, including all of the schemes needed for compliance with the requirements of the urban waste water treatment directive. Major schemes are well advanced in Dublin, Cork, Limerick, Galway, Wexford and Sligo, among others. These schemes will all have a significant positive effect on the quality of bath ing waters in the surrounding areas, their associated designated bathing areas and, consequently, on the number of blue flags likely to be awarded. The ongoing Cork scheme, for example, will eliminate more than 70 untreated sewage discharges to the River Lee and provide secondary treatment for the city and environs. This scheme is expected to restore good quality to the Lee Estuary which is currently assessed as eutrophic.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_90">The Dublin Bay project, the largest ever waste water treatment scheme in Ireland and the biggest currently under construction in the European Union, is due to be fully operational by the end of this year. It will provide tertiary waste water treatment for the entire city and much of the surrounding region and will potentially allow Dublin City to achieve the distinction of becoming the only capital in Europe with its own blue flag beach.</summary>

          <from>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government (Mr. N. Ahern)</from>
          <p eId="para_860">I propose to take Questions Nos. 18, 164, 272, 311 and 332 together.</p>
          <p eId="para_861">The Government has approved the general scheme of the Housing (Private Rented Sector) Bill and it is with the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel to the Government for priority drafting. I hope to be in a position to publish the Bill in early 2003. When enacted, the legislation will provide for the establishment of the private residential tenancies board on a statutory basis. The board was set up on an <i>ad hoc</i> basis in October last year. It will be ready shortly to commence offering a pilot dispute resolution service to deal with disputes that are referred to it on a voluntary basis during this phase of its operation.</p>
          <p eId="para_862">Government proposals for major reforms in the private rented sector, in response to the recommendations contained in the report of the commission on the private rented residential sector, were announced in January 2001. The majority of the proposed reforms require primary legislation for implementation. The fiscal reforms recommended by the commission and accepted by Government were implemented first by way of the last two Finance Acts. Those included in the Finance Act, 2001 were a reduction in the stamp duty rate for new residential investment properties, tax relief on rental income in respect of refurbishment capital expenditure, the re-introduction of interest relief on borrowings in the case of certain properties meeting specified conditions and roll-over relief on capital gains tax in respect of qualifying reinvestment in the sector. The Finance Act, 2002 reintroduced interest deductibility generally and realigned the stamp duty rate applying to investors with that applying to non-first-time buyer owner-occupiers.</p>
          <p eId="para_863">The remainder of the reforms will be implemented via the Housing (Private Rented Sector) Bill. In summary, the main purpose of the proposed Bill is to prohibit rents greater than the market rate and allow rent reviews no more frequently than once a year, unless there has been a substantial change in the nature of the accommodation; to introduce a four year security of tenure measure; to establish on a statutory basis the private residential tenancies board to resolve disputes and perform other research and information functions; to provide for the board to replace the present role of the courts in relation to landlord and tenant disputes; to specify new tenancy termination arrangements, including graduated notice periods; to provide for specified tenancy obligations applying to landlords and tenants; to provide for the registration of tenancy details by landlords with the board and repeal the existing registration regulations; to abolish, five years after the commencement date of the new legislation, the entitlement to apply for the first time for a lease under Part II of the Landlord and Tenant (Amendment) Act 1980; and to make consequential amendments to the landlord and tenant legislative code.</p>

          <p eId="para_867">I propose to take Questions Nos. 19, 323 and 375 together.</p>
          <p eId="para_868">The national development plan provides for a total investment of approximately €30 billion in the development of economic and social infrastructure over the period 2000-06. Of that total planned investment, approximately €17.5 billion is for programmes within the remit of my Department, including housing, water and waste water, non-national roads, waste management, urban and village development, habitat and heritage protection and conservation.</p>
          <p eId="para_869">Satisfactory progress is being made in meeting the targets set out in the national development plan. Expenditure to date amounts to €5.3 billion which is in line with the NDP targets. Good progress is being made on housing, water and non-national roads programmes. A total of €574.2 million was spent under the five housing measures in the first six months of 2002. Output for the first six months compares favourably with the same period last year and indications are that annual targets for 2002 will be achieved.</p>
          <p eId="para_870">The NDP provides for investment amounting to almost €4.4 billion on water and sewerage schemes. Expenditure on major schemes in the first half of 2002 amounted to €284.9 million or 53.6% of the forecast for the year. The investment programme for the years 2002-04 contains more than 600 individual water and sewerage schemes, including 129 new schemes. A further €70 million has been set aside in 2002 for the rural water programme. Expenditure in the first half of 2002 for non-national roads amounted to €187.32 million. Good progress continues to be made under this measure and this was confirmed by the evaluation of investment in the road network, an independent evaluation carried out by economic consultants Fitzpatrick Associates, published in August 2002 and available in the Oireachtas Library.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_91">I am satisfied that good progress has been made to date on the implementation of the NDP infrastructure programmes. I look forward to the outcome of the mid-term review of the NDP, which is expected in the latter part of 2003 and will provide an independent analysis of progress and make appropriate recommendations for programme adjustments, where necessary.</summary>

        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_92">The first case relates to the drinking water directive, 80/778/EEC, and concerns drinking water quality particularly in relation to private group water schemes. The Advocate General gave his opinion on the case in April 2002 and the judgment of the ECJ is awaited. The major drive to tackle quality deficiencies in this sector is being maintained and expanded, with a focus on all areas of relevance – sources, distribution, analytical programmes and services, full definition of quality problems, management aspects, treatment options and costings. This is being underpinned by a commitment of €644 million, current prices, under the National Development  Plan 2000-2006 for the rural water programme and a radically improved grants scheme.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_93">Other measures being pursued in partnership with the National Federation of Group Water Schemes, NFGWS, include the establishment of the national rural water monitoring committee, the provision by my Department of financial support to the NFGWS and the introduction on a pilot basis of a quality assurance scheme for the group sector by the NFGWS with the backing of my Department. A new comprehensive group water scheme monitoring programme, beginning later this month, will sample and analyse drinking water in the estimated 1500 group schemes falling within the remit of the European Communities (Drinking Water) Regulations, 2000 which come into operation on 1 January 2004.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_94">The second case concerns the nitrates directive, 91/676/EEC. Ireland's defence and rejoinder have been lodged and the opinion of the Advocate General and the judgment of the ECJ are awaited. The position with regard to implementation of this directive is set out in my reply to Question No. 1491 on 9 October 2002. The third case concerns the quality of shellfish waters, Council Directive 79/923/EEC. The European Commission has initiated proceedings in relation to Ireland's failure to fulfil its obligations under Council Directive 79/923/EEC on the quality required of shellfish waters by reason of its failure to adopt programmes for the protection of designated shellfish in accordance with Article 5 of the directive. The directive has been fully transposed into Irish law and action programmes recently made by the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources are now under consideration by the Commission.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_95">The fourth case concerns the dangerous substances directive, 76/464/EEC, in relation to which the Commission initiated legal action on 31 July 2002. Ireland is required to lodge its defence by 25 November 2002. This directive has been substantially implemented by the Local Government Water Pollution Acts 1977 and 1990 and related legislation. Also, for the purposes of this directive water quality standards have been established for phosphorous and 14 other substances including certain pesticides, solvents and metals. However, EPA monitoring indicates that dangerous substances, other than phosphorous, are not a problem in Irish waters generally. It is envisaged that the directive will be further implemented in the context of implementation of the water framework directive, 60/2000/EEC.</summary>

        <summary eId="sum_98">I am aware that the National Economic and Social Forum, NESF, recommended some time ago the establishment of a national housing authority. The Government's efforts in support of housing have prioritised the adaptation and strengthening of institutions and structures, increasing the funding of housing programmes  and the redesign of incentives and supports so as to secure the required levels of housing output across all tenures.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_99">In relation to strengthening of structures, we have developed a range of administrative arrangements and new initiatives, including the creation of Cabinet committees on housing infrastructure and public private partnerships, and on social inclusion, each chaired by An Taoiseach; the setting up of the housing forum in agreement with the social partners as provided for in the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness; the establishment of the private residential tenancies board on anad hoc basis pending the necessary legislation arising from the recommendations of the commission on the private rented sector; new organisational structures within my Department with enhanced focus on housing supply, voluntary housing, affordable housing and social inclusion; and an enhanced role for the housing unit, particularly in the area of research.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_100">Our approach has delivered high levels of overall housing output and continued the major expansion of both the local authority and voluntary housing programmes. Total housing output last year, at more than 52,000 units, was the highest output ever achieved in a single year. Based on the indications available I am confident that we will approach that figure once again this year. In addition, I expect local authority output for 2002 to be the highest level of completions for more than 15 years.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_101">The issue of a national housing authority was discussed at the recent meeting of the housing forum. Considerable reservations were expressed by the forum about the concept of an executive national housing authority. The consensus was that progress in this area would be better achieved by improving: capacity for housing research; dissemination of best housing management practice etc. in local authorities; support for the voluntary housing sector; synergies between existing housing agencies.</summary>

          <p eId="para_894">The serviced land initiative is one of a broad range of measures being implemented by the Government to increase housing supply. To date 267 individual schemes have been approved for funding by my Department. These schemes will provide water services to more than 170,000 housing sites. The latest returns from local authorities up to June 2002 indicate that 142 schemes, representing 94,000 sites, have been completed or are at construction. The returns project that by the end of the year the corresponding numbers of schemes and sites will have increased to 202 and 137,000, respectively.</p>
          <p eId="para_895">Targeted initiatives and the commitment of significant Exchequer funding in recent years have led to a significant increase in the supply of residential serviced land.

The 2002 survey of housing land availability is currently under way.

        <summary eId="sum_103">Part V of the Planning and Development Act, 2000, introduced a two year limit on a planning permission granted on foot of an application made after publication of the planning Bill in August 1999 and prior to incorporation of the housing strategy in the relevant development plan. The reason for its inclusion was to prevent developers "stockpiling" planning permissions  which would not be subject to the requirement to reserve land-houses for social and affordable housing.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_104">My Department sought information from planning authorities on the impact of the two year rule early in 2002. On the basis of the information supplied by the authorities, it was estimated that, excluding one-off housing permissions which are likely to be built out, in total about 2,100 current planning permissions, 79,690 units, nationally are affected by the two year rule, of which 749 permissions, 37,343, are in the greater Dublin area, GDA. A total of 1,185 permissions, 43,842 units, nationally will expire on 31 December 2002 and 939 permissions, 35,848 units, during 2003. In the GDA the figures are 480 permissions, 20,853 units, expiring on 31 December 2002 and 269 permissions, 16,490 units, expiring during 2003.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_105">There is no accurate way of assessing the number of units that could be subject to re-application because the rate at which permissions are built out varies depending on factors such as capacity, demand and location. However, given current trends in demand and capacity, a reasonable assumption would be that all developments of less than 100 units and 50% of the 100+ unit developments would be built out in the two year period. Applying these assumptions to relevant permissions over the period 2002-2003 would imply that around 188 permissions nationally for around 19,000 units, 102 permissions for around 11,700 units in the GDA, could be subject to re-application for planning permission. This number would be increased by any relevant planning application in the system which is granted permission and which is not built out in the two year period.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_106">The Agreed Programme for Government indicates that in order to minimise disruption to housing supply where planning re-applications are necessary because of the two year rule, set maximum application and appeals timings will apply. In addition, the programme promises to review the operation of Part V to ensure that it is meeting its objectives in relation to social and affordable housing. The review of Part V promised in the Agreed Programme for Government has commenced and is being conducted by my Department in consultation with the major stakeholders, including both construction industry and social-affordable housing interests, among whom is the Society of St. Vincent de Paul. I intend to complete the review and report back to Government shortly.</summary>

          <from>Minister for the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Cullen)</from>
          <p eId="para_917">I am aware of the report published in July this year by the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland, RPII, which represents the results of a national survey of indoor radon concentration levels in domestic dwellings carried out by the institute between 1992 and 1999.</p>
          <p eId="para_918">Radon is a naturally occurring radioactive gas found in variable amounts in rocks and soil. When it surfaces in the open air, it is quickly diluted. However, where it enters an enclosed space, such as a house, it can reach unacceptably high concentration levels. There is evidence to suggest that long-term exposure to high levels of radon can be a contributory factor in increasing the risk of lung cancer. The RPII's survey involved measuring radon concentrations in over 11,000 houses nationwide. The survey was geographically based, using the 10km grid squares of the Irish national grid as the unit area.</p>
          <p eId="para_919">The results of the survey were used by the RPII to predict the percentage of houses in each grid square with radon in excess of 200 becquerels per cubic metre of air. In 1990, the Government on the advice of the then Nuclear Energy Board, adopted an annual radon concentration of 200 becquerels per cubic metre as the national reference level above which remedial action to reduce indoor radon concentration level in domestic dwellings should be considered by the householder. This advice is consistent with EU and internationally accepted guidelines. Based on the results of the survey, the RPII estimated that just over 91,000 houses nationwide or some 7% of the national housing stock have indoor radon levels in excess of the national reference level. The RPII also used the results of the survey to designate as "high radon areas" areas where the predicted percentage of dwellings with radon levels above the national reference level is 10% or more.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_107">Over the years, the Government has committed significant resources to assessing the extent of the radon problem throughout the country and in highlighting public awareness of radon. The Government and the institute have actively encouraged householders in those areas designated as high radon areas to have their homes measured for radon levels if they have not done so already. In February 2002, my Department published a booklet, Radon in Existing Buildings – Corrective Options, advising designers, builders and home owners on remediation options for reducing radon in existing houses to, or below, the national reference level. This replaced an earlier booklet on this subject. In June 1997, upgraded building regulations were introduced requiring that all new houses commencing construction on or after 1 July 1998 should incorporate radon protection measures. The extent of the measures needed depends on whether the house is located in a high radon area.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_108">The Government has approved in principle the introduction of a radon remediation grant scheme to assist householders to carry out radon remediation work on their homes. The further development of an implementation process for such a scheme and related issues are under consideration between my Department and the Department of Finance.</summary>

          <from>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government (Mr. N. Ahern)</from>
          <p eId="para_924">I propose to take Questions Nos. 31 and 349 together.</p>
          <p eId="para_925">The Government's strategy has been to increase housing supply to meet demand and to improve affordability, particularly for first time purchasers. There is clear evidence that this strategy is proving effective. Total new housing output in 2001 was over 52,600 units, an increase of 5.6% on 2000 and the seventh consecutive year of record housing output. Prospects for housing output in 2002 are again good, with output up 5.2% in the first six months of the year compared to the same period last year.</p>
          <p eId="para_926">The effects of this increased output are being reflected in moderating house price trends. House price increases have been reduced from a peak of around 40% per annum in 1998 to approximately 5-7% per annum currently. There is also firm evidence that first time buyers are gaining an increasing share of the new housing market with first time buyer grant applications increasing by over 14% in the first nine months of 2002 compared with the same period in 2001.</p>
          <p eId="para_927">The combination of Government measures and other factors have impacted positively on housing affordability, including high levels of economic growth, lower tax levels, increased disposable incomes, increased employment, lower mortgage interest rates, low inflation and moderating house price trends assisted by an increased supply of properties on the market following years of record housing output. Significant progress has been made in delivering NDP social housing targets with local authority housing output of over 5,000 units in 2001, which was the highest level in 15 years. Local authorities built 1,468 new houses in the first six months of this year, an increase of 13% on the corresponding period in 2001. The voluntary housing sector is playing an increasingly significant role in the provision of social housing with output in 2001 of some 1,250 units, the highest level ever recorded.</p>
          <p eId="para_928">The Government is also committed to implementing major reforms in the private rented residential sector, arising from the recommendations of the report of the commission on the private rented residential sector. The private residential tenancies board was established on an <i>ad hoc</i> basis last October to deal with disputes between landlords and tenants. The drafting of the legislation required to set up the board on a statutory basis and implement other commission recommendations, such as improving security of tenure for tenants, is progressing. These reforms should facilitate the development of a better managed and more professional private rented sector.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_109">Finally, as required under the Planning and Development Act, 2000, planning authorities  have prepared housing strategies which identify the overall need for housing within the area covered by the strategy, including the need for social and affordable housing. The Government will continue to monitor housing developments and review policies as necessary to ensure that the demand for housing is met in a sustainable way.</summary>

          <p eId="para_933">Regional and local waste management plans provide for the progressive introduction in urban areas of source segregation and separate collection of household wastes in three distinct streams – dry recyclable materials, organic waste and residual wastes that cannot be recovered. Source separation of recyclable wastes from commercial and industrial sources is also provided for. The timescale for roll-out of segregated collection services in an area is contingent on the availability of materials recovery facilities, at which dry recyclables are sorted and aggregated for onward delivery to reprocessing outlets, and biological treatment facilities for organic wastes.

          <p eId="para_935">Council Regulation (EEC) No. 259/93 provides for the supervision and control of shipments of waste within, into and out of the European Community. While this Council regulation is directly applicable in member states, the Waste Management (Transfrontier Shipment of Waste) Regulations, 1998, provides for certain supporting administrative measures. In particular, they provide that, for the purposes of implementing Council Regulation 259/93, local authorities are the competent authorities in respect of the export of waste from the State, while the Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, is the competent authority in respect of the import of waste into, or its transit through, the State.</p>
          <p eId="para_936">Under Council Regulation 259/93, wastes are categorised as either "green list", "amber list" or "red list" wastes. Green list wastes may be exported for recovery without prior notification to relevant competent authorities. Amber list wastes require prior notification and may be exported in the absence of objections from relevant competent authorities within a 30 day period, that is, a tacit consent procedure applies. Red list wastes or wastes not specifically assigned to the green or amber lists, require prior written consent from the relevant competent authorities.</p>
          <p eId="para_937">In July 2002, waste from a pharmaceutical company that was subject to an integrated pollution control, IPC, licence granted by the EPA was implicated in the contamination of pig food by the hormonal substance MPA, in Belgium and the Netherlands. It appears that the waste concerned was shipped to Belgium by an Irish waste broker, acting on behalf of the producer, and was classified as green list material. Accordingly, it was not subject to the prior notification procedures laid down for amber and red list wastes. When notified of the contamination problem, the EPA took immediate steps to identify the producer of the waste concerned and halt all further shipments of process waste from that source. The facilities of the producer and broker concerned were inspected and all relevant records held by both parties and the agency were reviewed.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_111">Nearly 50 other pharmaceutical and chemical plants that are subject to IPC licences from the EPA were also inspected and it is understood that the EPA is satisfied from these investigations that  waste exports from these concerns are being carried on in accordance with relevant transfrontier shipment, TFS, procedures. About 450 other IPC licensed concerns and all local authorities and waste brokers were contacted in writing regarding the need to ensure full compliance with appropriate TFS procedures.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_112">I am reviewing the relevant national regulations in light of this case, and will also ask the European Commission to consider whether, in the context of an ongoing review of the operation of Council Regulation 259/93, further measures require to be taken on an EU basis in respect of the monitoring of movements of green list wastes.</summary>

          <p eId="para_944">I propose to take Questions Nos. 35, 49, 281, 319, 337 and 364 together.</p>
          <p eId="para_945">Ireland's obligation under the Kyoto Protocol is to limit emissions of a basket of greenhouse gases, of which carbon dioxide, CO2, is the principal component at about 65%, to an increase of 13% above our 1990 baseline by the commitment period 2008-2012, namely, 60.9 million tonnes, Mt, CO2 equivalent above 1990 emissions of 53.9 Mt CO2 equivalent. In each year from 1996 to 2000, greenhouse gas emissions have been 59.2, 61.8, 64.1, 65.9 and 67 Mt CO2 equivalent respectively. Preliminary data for 2001 are being prepared by the EPA and, subject to finalisation following complete analysis, indicate a further increase in emissions.</p>
          <p eId="para_946">The Government's national climate change strategy, published in November 2000, sets a ten year framework for achieving the necessary greenhouse gas emissions reductions to ensure that Ireland complies with the Kyoto Protocolumn Ireland together with all other member states of the EU ratified the Kyoto Protocol on 31 May 2002. In parallel with ratification, the first progress report on implementation of the national climate change strategy was published. This details measures, across sectors, implemented or in the course of implementation under the strategy. Measures already under way in the first year are capable of yielding reductions of up to 3.3 Mt CO2 equivalent of the 13.1 Mt CO2 equivalent reductions required below the business as usual projections in the national climate change strategy.</p>
          <p eId="para_947">Implementation of the national climate change strategy is being co-ordinated by a cross-departmental climate change team, chaired by my Department. The team has recently initiated the first biennial review of the strategy, to be undertaken in consultation with Comhar and finalised by spring of 2003. The national climate change strategy and progress report are available in the Oireachtas Library.</p>
          <p eId="para_948">I am satisfied that full implementation of the national climate change strategy over the remainder of the decade, together with any additional measures which may be identified in the review, will ensure that our Kyoto obligations are fully met by the commitment period.</p>

          <p eId="para_952">Ballybunion Castle is listed on the Record of Monuments and Places. The present structure is that the castle is in a ruinous state with only the tall eastern side remaining. Much of the cliff on the western side has been eroded and there is some erosion of ground near the north east corner on the north side, which will further undermine the structure. Consequently, to conserve the castle structure and militate against erosion would require substantial investment. There are many other such monuments throughout the country, similarly at risk, where my Department's intervention has been sought but all the resources that are available to me are already fully committed for the foreseeable future to the conservation and maintenance of the approximately 740 national monuments that are in State care. Among these are projects at Ardfert Cathedral, Gallarus Castle and Listowel Castle in County Kerry.</p>
          <p eId="para_953">The Deputy will be aware, however, that my professional staff have assisted in the preparation of a condition report on the castle and I understand that, following that report, urgent safety works were undertaken by Kerry County Council.</p>

          <p eId="para_961">The recent value for money report on planning appeals by the Comptroller and Auditor General examined the management of the appeals system, the factors impacting on its effectiveness and measures to improve the quality control of the system. The report did not make any specific recommendations in relation to the staffing or resourcing of An Bord Pleanála, which has benefited from substantial additions to its staffing and financing in recent years. Board membership has doubled from six in 1998 to the present membership of 12; the authorised staffing complement increased by 29 in 2000 and by a further four in 2001 to a current level of 138; 79 planners have been engaged on a fee per case basis to provide reports on the smaller types of appeals; seven consultancy firms have been engaged to provide reports on the larger cases and a panel of consultants has been set up to hold hearings in relation to motorway schemes, CPOs and other procedures devolved to the board under the Planning and Development Act, 2000.</p>
          <p eId="para_962">The Comptroller and Auditor General's report notes that since the mid-1990s, there has been a growing backlog of cases resulting from the major increase in the number of planning appeals in recent years. I am pleased to note that the situation in relation to the backlog of cases has been reversed dramatically during 2002, falling from a peak of 2,700 at the end of year 2000 to less than 1,600 cases as at end September 2002. The board has stated its confidence that the entire backlog will have been cleared by end November 2002 to a sustainable ongoing level of 1,500 cases on hand. It is anticipated that once the backlog has cleared there will be a marked improvement in the percentage of cases determined with the statutory objective period.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_114">My Department has also been concerned to ensure adequate staffing levels for local authority planning departments. It has approved numerous requests from planning authorities for sanction for additional planning posts, both professional planners and administrative staff. Staffing of local authority planning departments has almost doubled over the last five years from 660 in June 1998 to 1,276 in July 2002 and has involved significant recruitment of planners from abroad. I  am confident, therefore, that the resources available to the planning system have increased substantially and will continue to increase over the next number of years as a significantly expanded number of graduate planners becomes available from the educational institutions.</summary>

          <p eId="para_981">I propose to take Questions Nos. 43, 239, 250, 352 and 354 together.</p>
          <p eId="para_982">The national hazardous waste management plan, NHWMP, relates to the period 2001-2006. It makes recommendations in respect of four main areas: implementation of a national hazardous waste prevention programme; improved measures for the collection of hazardous wastes from households, small and medium enterprises, agriculture and other sources of "unreported" hazardous wastes; provision of requisite infrastructure to attain national self sufficiency in relation to the recovery and disposal of hazardous wastes; identification, risk assessment and, where necessary, remediation of sites where hazardous wastes were disposed of in the past.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_117">Under section 26 of the Waste Management Act, 1996, relevant public authorities are required  to have regard to the plan and, where they consider it appropriate to do so, to take measures to implement or otherwise give effect to recommendations contained in the plan. The plan recommended the establishment of an implementation committee to co-ordinate its overall implementation.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_118">In my Department's policy statement, Preventing and Recycling Waste – Delivering Change, which was published earlier this year, a range of organisational and policy initiatives in support of more effective waste management was outlined. These include the establishment of a core prevention team within the Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, to implement a major national waste prevention programme, that will encompass both hazardous and non-hazardous waste and focus on both the elimination of waste from manufacturing and securing improvements in the environmental performance of products. This initiative will be advanced as rapidly as possible.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_119">I intend also to establish a committee to oversee the implementation of the non-prevention aspects of the NHWMP and I will very shortly invite a range of business, agricultural and environmental organisations, as well as relevant Government Departments and State agencies, to nominate representatives to participate on this committee. Improved collection and reception services for hazardous waste from household and commercial sources are already being put in place by local authorities.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_120">With regard to infrastructure, the plan identifies a requirement for landfill and thermal treatment capacity for hazardous waste requiring disposal, so as to achieve self sufficiency and reduce reliance on export outlets. A private company has announced proposals to develop a hazardous waste incineration facility at Ringaskiddy, County Cork. As an exceptional measure, having regard to the polluter pays principle, grant assistance is available under the NDP to support the provision of landfill capacity for hazardous wastes, and there are indications of interest from the private sector in the development of such capacity. The NHWMP outlined a methodology for the identification and risk assessment of closed waste disposal sites. This methodology has since been developed further by the EPA and applied as a pilot project undertaken by Laois County Council. This project is expected to facilitate the development by the EPA of more detailed guidance for local authorities in this matter.</summary>

          <p eId="para_995">I refer to the reply to Priority Questions Nos. 3 and 4 on today's Order Paper where I indicated that the results of the most recent assessment of housing needs would be published in the next few weeks. I also indicated that the preliminary results available suggest an increase of between 20% to 25% in needs since 1999. The results of the statutory assessment undertaken at end March 1999 indicated a total of 39,176 households in need of local authority housing.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_121">Local authority housing output, including both new build and acquisitions, amounted to 5,022 units last year – an increase of 1,815 units or 57% on the 2000 output of 3,207 units. It is expected that local authorities will complete or acquire some 5,500 houses in 2002. Voluntary  bodies provided 951 units in 2000, 1,250 units in 2001 and are expected to provide 1,500 units this year. It is estimated that total social housing output this year taking account of new local authority housing, vacancies arising in existing houses and output under other social housing measures will meet the needs of approximately 13,000 households on waiting lists. While this has a positive impact on waiting lists, further new applications for social housing continue to be added to waiting lists.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_122">Information emerging from the recent assessment of housing needs indicates that approximately 60% of households assessed as in need of local authority housing were on the local authority waiting list for less than two years. It is, however, the case that some applicants for local authority housing are on waiting lists for longer periods on the basis that their housing need has a relative lower priority compared with the needs of households who have been allocated housing. The relative priority of households on the local authority waiting lists is determined in accordance with the authorities' scheme of letting priorities, the making of which is a function reserved to the elected members.</summary>

        <summary eId="sum_126">The conservation grant scheme for protected structures was introduced in 1999. The standard grant is 50% of the approved cost of works subject to a maximum of €13,000. A local authority may, at its discretion, vary this amount downwards, or in exceptional circumstances upwards, subject to a maximum allowable grant of 75% of the cost of the approved cost of works or €25,000 whichever is the lesser. Accordingly, the scheme is not intended to meet the full cost but is designed to assist owners or occupiers of pro tected structures to undertake necessary works to secure their conservation.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_127">The scheme is administered by local authorities who are required to prioritise applications on the basis of a scheme of priorities. This is a statement by the local authority of the criteria that will be used in prioritising grant applications. Each local authority is allocated a fixed amount of funding for grant purposes in each calendar year.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_128">There has been a pattern of under-expenditure on this scheme since its inception. In 2002 my Department made an allocation of €3 million to local authorities under the conservation grant scheme for privately owned protected structures. So far this year a total of €1,189,933 has been drawn down by local authorities in relation to this scheme and I expect the full amount to be drawn down by year end. In addition to the protected structures scheme, funding totalling €974,000 has been made available in 2002 under the Regional Operational Programmes 2000-2006. This is a scheme of EU co-financed grants for the conservation of the architectural heritage. It provides support for local authorities, civic trust and other not for profit bodies to upgrade buildings of significant architectural and heritage merit and which are in public ownership or open to the public generally.</summary>

          <p eId="para_1002">I have noted the comments contained in Focus Ireland's annual report. A comprehensive assessment of housing needs, which included a count of the number of homeless persons, was carried out by local authorities at the end of March and I intend to publish the results shortly. According to the results of the 1999 assessment of needs there were 5,234 homeless persons, the great majority of whom were in homeless accommodation rather than on the streets.</p>
          <p eId="para_1003">As part of the Government's homeless strategy, local authorities together with health boards and voluntary bodies, are required to draw up local action plans to tackle homelessness. Most of the action plans are now completed and it is expected that the remaining plans will be completed shortly. A wide range of additional accommodation, ranging from emergency night shelter accommodation to long-term sheltered accommodation to enable homeless persons move out of emergency accommodation into long-term accommodation that is more suited to their needs, has been provided for and more will be provided as part of the full implementation of the action plans.</p>
          <p eId="para_1004">Substantial additional funding has been made available as part of the homeless strategy. Capital funding for the direct provision by local authorities of accommodation for homeless persons is being doubled from €25.4 million to €50.8 million over the period 2001-2005.

        <summary eId="sum_145">The company law review group was established as a statutory advisory body to the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment by section 7 of the Company Law Enforcement Act, 2001. The review group is charged with advising the Minister on the reform and strategic development of the companies code in Ireland. A commission to develop a framework for a national policy for research and technological development has been convened to bring forward proposals for the development of an overarching framework for research and technological development in Ireland. The commission is expected to submit its proposals for the consideration of Government, to the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment by the end of 2002. There are no plans to give it a statutory basis.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_146">As recommended in the report of the review group on auditing, I established the Irish Auditing and Accounting Supervisory Authority, IAASA, on an interim basis.

          <p eId="para_1110">My Department officials are aware of the works proposed at this school and in particular the requirement to appoint the remaining members of the design team. My Department has an extensive post primary building programme under way at present, but, for financial reasons, it was not possible to commence architectural planning for a major building project at Scoil Phobail, Sliabh Luachra, Rathmore, County Kerry.</p>
          <p eId="para_1111">The question of appointing the remaining members of the design team will be considered later this year when the financial allocation has been made for the post primary schools building programme in the 2003 Estimates. My Department will be in contact with the school authority directly at that time.</p>
          <p eId="para_1112">The Deputy will appreciate that in light of the above, I considered it unnecessary for officials of my Department to meet with the parents council association. However, should the parents council association have other concerns regarding requirements at the school, they should be brought to the attention of the school authority for transmission to my Department's building unit.</p>

A management committee and a national policy advisory board were established for NEPS in 1999. The main function of the management committee was to prepare a NEPS development plan for the approval of the Minister. The main function of the National Policy Advisory Board was to advise the Minister on the policy, general principles and planning for an efficient and effective NEPS.

Figures supplied to the Department by individual licensing authorities indicate that taxi licence numbers nationally had more than doubled from 3,912 at November 2000 to 9,767 at end December 2001.

          <p eId="para_1226">The number of road deaths in 2000 and 2001 was 415 and 411 respectively. The total for 2001 represents a 13% decrease on the 1997 level of 472. There were 1,640 serious injuries on our roads in 2000 representing a decrease of almost 25% on 1997 levels. Figures relating to serious injuries for 2001 are not yet fully analysed and authenticated. They will be set out in Road Accident Facts, 2001, which will be published by the National Roads Authority. The number of road deaths to 8 October 2002 is 307.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_203">The Government is strongly pursuing the implementation of its Strategy for Road Safety 1998-2002, the first ever national road safety strategy to be adopted by the Irish Government. The strategy has prioritised a systematic and co-ordinated set of measures for preventing and reducing road accidents. It establishes quantified targets for achieving its objectives, the principle of which is to reduce road deaths and serious injuries each by at least 20% by 2002 relative to 1997. Priority is accorded by the Strategy to actions targeted at speeding, alcohol, seat belt wearing and vulnerable road users. A timetable for key actions in these and other areas is also set out.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_204">The Government strategy is monitored by the high level group on road safety, whose first progress report (July 1999), second progress report (August 2000), and third progress report (July 2001) detail progress with key actions. Copies of all three reports have been circulated to all Deputies and are also available in the Oireachtas Library. A fourth progress report will be published shortly.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_205">The third progress report shows that real and worthwhile gains are being made in road safety within the framework of the Government Strategy. In addition to the reduced level of road deaths and serious injuries to which I have already referred, the interim targets fixed by the strategy for achievement by 2000 have been well met.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_206">Progress is also ahead of target in extending low cost accident measures across the national road network, with 365 schemes completed on the national network by end 2001 with a further 32 approved for 2002.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_207">Garda enforcement activity has been intensified and improved in accordance with the road safety strategy. Over 345,000 on the spot fines issued in relation to speeding offences in 2001, compared to 175,000 in 1999 and 130,000 in 1998. A pilot scheme providing for the deployment of fixed speed cameras is in operation on four of the main national routes out of Dublin and on the M50. Speed limit enforcement is also being supported by an increase in mobile speed detection, the use of laser speed detection as well as in-car and motorcycle cameras. At the end of 2001, approximately 149,000 on the spot fines had been issued for non-wearing of seat belts since the introduction of this measure in July 1999. The number of detections for drink driving in 2001 increased by almost 53% over 1998.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_208">The road safety strategy also provided for the implementation of a penalty points system in support of road safety enforcement. The legislation necessary for this measure was passed by the Oireachtas in March 2002. The necessary software amendments to the national driver file to record penalty points and administer the system, have been made. Work is at an advanced stage in relation to the introduction of penalty points for speeding offences only, which I expect to be operational by the end of this month.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_209">An essential prerequisite of the development of the next strategy is that a detailed review of the results of the current strategy should be carried out. Accordingly an international expert in the field of road safety has been engaged to carry out an independent review of the current strategy based on the following terms of reference: review developments and progress made under the current National Road Safety Strategy 1998-2002; place Ireland's performance in an appropriate international context; and having regard to recent developments, including relevant international developments, suggest options for priorities for the next strategy to cover the period 2003-07, and beyond if considered necessary.</summary>

      the most common age group involved in road traffic accidents especially serious and fatal accidents; the estimated number of inexperienced drivers who will seek provisional driving licences over the next five years; the issues which have been considered to improve road safety education for this targeted group; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

          <p eId="para_1361">The annual reports of the National Roads Authority detailing road accident statistics include details of casualties classified by road user type and age. The latest report, Road Accident Facts 2000, is available in the Oireachtas Library. It can be seen  from this report that the highest number of casualties for the age groups recorded occurred in the 25 to 34 age group. The total number of casualties in that age group was 2,676, which represents 21% of the overall total for the year.</p>
          <p eId="para_1362">It is not possible to provide a firm estimate of future demand for provisional driving licences, but having regard to the demographic profile and trends in recent years it is anticipated that demand for first time provisional licences in the lower categories of licences will be of the order of 350,000 to 400,000 over the next five years. Since June 2001, all first time applicants for a provisional licence are required to have already passed the driver theory test.</p>
          <p eId="para_1363">Education and information is recognised in the Government road safety strategy 1998-2002 as being vital to forming good road safety habits in younger people who are the adult road users of the future. The National Safety Council was assigned the lead role by the Government strategy for road safety for the development of a resource pack on road safety for input into the social, personal, health and education programme in the new primary school curriculum. The resource pack called BE SAFE was launched in September 2000 and over 30,000 copies of the pack have been distributed to primary school teachers, principals and boards of management.</p>
          <p eId="para_1364">The NSC has also developed a secondary school transition year resource project on road safety. This resource was pilot tested in 20 secondary schools throughout the country and was launched on September 10 2001. This resource will complement existing activities in secondary schools. The council also regularly targets young drivers in its public media campaigns.</p>
          <p eId="para_1365">The question of introducing a road safety and driver education syllabus into the schools is currently being examined by the National Council for Curriculum Assessment, NCCA, which has commissioned a study of the issue at the request of the Minister for Education and Science.</p>

          <p eId="para_1367">The Government road safety strategy 1998-2002 provided for the implementation of a penalty points system in support of road safety enforcement. The legislation necessary for this measure was passed by the Oireachtas in March 2002.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_216">Penalty points will be applied in respect of a wide range of minor offences, the commission of which have a potentially negative impact on road safety. These include excessive speeding, red light running, poor lane discipline, non-compliance  with stop and yield signs and a number of offences relating to vehicle safety.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_217">Excessive speed is recognised as the most significant contribution to road accident causation and has already been the subject of significant investment in enforcement measures by the Garda Siocháná. The importance of achieving safer speeds is recognised as a key priority of the current road safety strategy.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_218">I am therefore giving high priority to the introduction of penalty points on a phased basis, commencing with its application to speeding offences, which I expect to be operational by the end of this month.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_219">The penalty points system will be operated through the national driver file. Before the system becomes fully operational the NDF must be supported by the IT systems of the courts and the Garda. The development of these IT systems is a matter for the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform.</summary>

        <summary eId="sum_221">The national development plan sets out a strategic framework for the development of national roads and provides for investment of €6.75 billion  in national road improvements over the period 2000-06.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_222">It is a matter for the NRA, within the NDP framework and available funding, to promote the detailed programming of the work required and to manage, in co-operation with local authorities, the planning, design and implementation of individual road development projects. I have not requested the NRA to slow down its activities in this regard.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_223">I am aware that the Construction Industry Federation has expressed concerns about progress in relation to the national roads programme. It is clear, however, that good progress has been made with the development of the national roads network as mandated in the NDP, including on the five key inter-urban routes. Some 15 major schemes, involving 106 km of roadway were completed in 2001, including such major projects as Dunleer-Dundalk – M1; Southern Cross Route – M50; Croom bypass – N20; Kilmacthomas bypass – N25 and Blackpool bypass – N20.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_224">Over €1 billion, the highest allocation ever, and nearly twice the level of funding in 1999, is being provided to the NRA in 2002 for the improvement and maintenance of national roads. This year work is under way, or has been completed, on over 20 major projects with a combined length of over 200 kms, including the M1-N1 – Cloghran-Balbriggan and Drogheda bypass Dublin port tunnel, N4 – Celbridge Interchange, N7 – Kildare bypass, Watergrasshill bypass, Limerick southern ring road – N17 Knock-Claremorris phase II – N18 – Newmarket-on-Fergus bypass – N22 – Ballincollig bypass – N25 – Youghal bypass – and on the M50 – south eastern motorway.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_225">Good progress has also been made in the roll out of the NRAs PPP programme and four projects – Kilcock-Kinnegad, Waterford city bypass, Dundalk western bypass and Fermoy bypass – are at tender stage. The NRA is also examining the scope for extension of its PPP programme.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_226">It is acknowledged that the cost of the national roads programme has increased for a range of reasons, including land costs and construction cost inflation, and that the benefits of substantial capital allocations to NDP projects by Government have consequently been eroded to an extent. However, I am pleased to note that the rate of construction price inflation is now abating, from a peak of 12% per annum over the period 1998 to 2000, to 9% in 2001 and a projected 5% in 2002. I expect that this trend will continue in 2003.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_227">Completion of the NDP programme will be dependent on funding levels and the prevailing budgetary and economic situation over the coming years. The Government is committed, nevertheless, to strong promotion of the NDP national roads programme and to maintaining a high level of investment in the national road network. Already, the funding for national roads in the period 2000-2002 is some 10% in excess of the planned NDP profile.</summary>

A person wishing to avail of the capital allowances and reliefs available must make a formal application in writing to the relevant local authority. If the local authority is satisfied that the park and ride facility, and associated development, where relevant, conforms to the guidelines issued by the Department of the Environment and Local Government and also conforms with the relevant sections of the Finance Act, it may issue a certificate which will enable the developer to avail of the tax incentives.</p>

          <p eId="para_1383">There are no requirements in Irish or European Union law for safety frames in passenger cars. Directive 98/14/EC on motor vehicle type approval lays down the requirements and standards that all new passenger cars must meet before they can be registered for use for the first time. The requirements do not include the fitting of safety frames to cars and individual member states are not free to introduce requirements that would be additional to those set out in the directive.</p>

          <p eId="para_1423">There has been no increase in the fee payable to National Car Testing Service Limited – NCTS – for an inspection of a vehicle for the purposes of a certificate of suitability for a small public service vehicle licence since this function was assigned to NCTS on 1 July 2001. In fact, arising from the changeover to the euro, the net cost of the fee has decreased from £58.33 –€74.07 – on 1 July 2001 to €74 since 1 January 2002. Following  budgetary changes, the rate of VAT applicable to NCT fees increased from 20% to 21% from 1 March 2002. This resulted in the fee payable to NCT increasing from €88.80 to €89.50. The current fees payable to NCTS, including the fee for a suitability inspection, are specified in the Road Traffic (National Car Test) (Amendment) Regulations, 2002.</p>
          <p eId="para_1424">A certificate of suitability is required before a small public service licence can be issued for a vehicle. The inspection for such a certificate involves assessing the suitability of the vehicle by reference to the requirements of the Road Traffic (Construction, Equipment and Use of Vehicles) Regulations, 1963 to 2002, in addition to a standard NCT roadworthiness test. As there is no difference in the inspection carried out on a new or used vehicle, the fee of €89.50 applies irrespective of the age of the vehicle.</p>
          <p eId="para_1425">While the renewal of the small public service licence in respect of a particular vehicle does not require a further certificate of suitability, a standard NCT roadworthiness test is necessary at each renewal date.

          <p eId="para_1446">Under EU law the fitting of speed limitation devices on coaches over ten tonnes in weight and on goods vehicles over 12 tonnes in weight is mandatory. These directives are fully implemented in Ireland.</p>
          <p eId="para_1447">Proposals for a directive on the fitting of speed limiters to light commercial vehicles are expected to be considered by the Council of Transport Ministers before year-end. Additionally, the European Commission is carrying out research into the use of speed limiters in all vehicles. In line with the commitment in the Government strategy on road safety, Ireland will continue to support strongly the development and introduction of new vehicle safety measures at EU level.</p>
          <p eId="para_1448">Non-statutory initiatives aimed at monitoring or limiting driving by young insured persons and at incentivising good driving behaviour, have recently been launched by a number of insurance companies. The effects of these initiatives will be kept under review.</p>

          <p eId="para_1583">The standard speed limit for built-up urban areas is currently 30 miles per hour. However, there is a general obligation that a vehicle shall not be driven at a speed exceeding that which will enable its driver to bring it to a halt within the distance which the driver can see to be clear.</p>
          <p eId="para_1584">The present framework for speed limits derives from a comprehensive review carried out between 1990 and 1992 and was further addressed in the context of the Government strategy for road safety 1998-2002. The strategy concluded that changes should not be proposed in the immediate term and that the priority was to secure a much higher level of compliance with the existing speed limits.</p>
          <p eId="para_1585">The merits of a revision of speed limits, including reduced speed limits in urban areas, will be considered in the light of experience under the road safety strategy, 1998-2002, and in the context of preparations of the next road safety strategy.</p>

Vehicles, including vans, that are designed for carrying goods, and for which the appropriate rate of motor tax applicable to goods vehicles is paid, are also liable to periodic roadworthiness tests; testing of these vehicles is carried out by authorised testers appointed by local authorities.</p>

This method of procuring the new service was decided by the Government in 1996 following consideration of a range of options, including the operation of the service through local garages, as in the UK. Since the present contract excludes, for its duration, the deployment of other procurement arrangements for roadworthiness testing of cars, there is no proposal to develop such arrangements at present.</p>

          <p eId="para_1601">Directive 91/671/EEC has been fully transposed into Irish law. As a consequence passenger vehicles with up to eight seats are required to have seatbelts fitted for each seat and these must be used by the seat occupants.

          <p eId="para_1630">Statistics regarding the total number of road accidents are published by the National Roads Authority in their annual Road Accident Facts reports. The reports, which are compiled from information supplied by the Garda Síochána, are available in the Library. The latest year for which figures are available is 2000. These reports however do not include details of accidents in which drugs were a contributory factor.</p>
          <p eId="para_1631">The Government Strategy on Road Safety, 1998-2002, recognises that the influence of drugs on driving behaviour is an issue of increasing concern. Identification of the presence of drugs is however more complex than for alcohol. Consequently, considerably more work is needed to develop a more detailed regulatory regime in relation to drugs and driving. A number of research programmes are being carried out internationally in this area and the Strategy commits the Government to monitoring and assessing these developments.</p>
          <p eId="para_1632">In order to advance research in relation to drugs and driving in Ireland, my Department has pledged an additional €253,948 to the Medical Bureau of Road Safety – MBRS – over 2000 and 2001 for a two-year programme of drug analysis of blood and urine specimens.</p>
          <p eId="para_1633">The analysis of 2000 specimens for the presence of drugs by the Medical Bureau of Road Safety was completed in 2001. The preliminary findings of the survey showed that 37% of samples screened were positive for drugs. The extensive survey conducted during 2000 and 2001 will identify true trends in the types of drugs being taken, their combination with alcohol and the extent of poly-drug use. The confirmation analysis of specimens will continue into 2002 and the data collection and report is scheduled for publication towards the end of 2002.</p>
          <p eId="para_1634">These early findings underline the Government's view expressed in the Road Safety Strategy that drugs and driving is an issue of growing concern. While it is too early to draw definitive conclusions, the research programme when completed will, along with other international analysis and research in this area, inform the need for possible changes in testing methods for the presence of drugs, changes in enforcement practice and procedures and possibly changes to existing legislation.</p>

          <p eId="para_1779">I assume that the  question refers to the current urban renewal scheme.</p>
          <p eId="para_1780">Significant progress is being made under the urban renewal scheme. Based on statistical returns submitted by county councils to date the total value of projects completed is €97 million, work in progress is valued at €520 million, with projects in planning valued at €1,476 million, giving an overall investment level of in excess of €2 billion. It would be reasonable to estimate a total investment figure of some €3 billion over the life of the scheme.</p>
          <p eId="para_1781">The extension of the scheme from 31 December 2002 to 31 December 2004 and greater availability of section 23 reliefs introduced in the Finance Act, 2002, has given additional impetus. I am satisfied with the progress being made and have no proposal to amend the scheme.</p>

          <p eId="para_2954">The identification of works to be carried out on newly constructed or improved roads to mitigate the effects of road traffic noise is carried out as part of the environmental impact assessment process for relevant projects. Forecasts of road noise levels are included in all environmental impact statements for major road schemes. Objections can be made to proposed road developments on the grounds  of the potential impact of increased noise, including at an oral hearing held by An Bord Pleanála.</p>
          <p eId="para_2955">In approving road projects, it is open to the board to require modifications in relation, <i>inter alia,</i> to noise mitigation and such modifications have in the past been imposed as required. In view of the comprehensive nature of this approach, the activation of regulations, in consultation with the Environmental Protection Agency, under section 77 of the Roads Act, 1993, in relation to noise mitigation on newly constructed or improved roads has not to date been considered necessary and I do not propose to make such regulations.</p>
          <p eId="para_2956">EU legislation transposed into Irish law sets standards for permissible sound levels and exhaust systems on new motor vehicles. The Road Traffic (Construction, Equipment and Use of Vehicles) Regulations, 1963, require that vehicles should be fitted with a silencer or other device suitable for reducing, to a reasonable level, noise caused by the escape of exhaust gases from the engine and prohibits use of a vehicle which causes any excessive noise in a public place. An assessment is also made concerning the effectiveness of the silencer in reducing exhaust related noise, as far as is reasonable, as part of the roadworthiness tests for heavy and light goods vehicles and private cars.</p>
          <p eId="para_2957">Future noise policy will be guided by Directive 2002/49/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council relating to the assessment and management of environmental noise which was adopted on 25 June 2002 and must be transposed into national law by mid-2004. This directive requires, <i>inter alia, </i>the mapping of noise using harmonised noise indicators from sources including transport, major roads, railways, airports and industry and the drawing up and publication of strategic action plans to manage noise issues and effects. I understand Dublin Corporation has already commenced work on noise mapping. The directive does not set or require the setting of environmental noise standards and I do not have any plans at present to specify these.</p>

          <p eId="para_2961">I understand that faulty alarms gave rise to 11% of the noise complaints made to Dublin Corporation in 2000, the third lowest of all categories of complaints listed. Nevertheless, I recognise that alarms are a source of neighbourhood noise. A number of arrangements are in place to reduce the incidence of unnecessary noise from alarms and to tackle persistent incidence of such noise.</p>
          <p eId="para_2962">The National Standards Authority of Ireland – NSAI – has published a voluntary standards specification – S.I. No. 199 of 1987 – and operates a certification scheme to that standard, which, <i>inter alia, </i>specifies a minimum 15 minutes and maximum 30 minutes duration for the sounding of external alarms in buildings with the alarms being required to cease automatically after the maximum duration. The connection of monitored business intruder alarm systems to Garda stations is contingent, <i>inter alia, </i>upon the use of alarm systems which are certified by NSAI and installed by certified installers.</p>
          <p eId="para_2963">A European standard for external intruder alarms, which will replace all current national standards, will incorporate considerably stricter controls regarding minimum and maximum duration for the sounding of alarms. The new limits are 90 seconds minimum and 15 minutes maximum. This new standard will be the only one applied by the NSAI from September 2003.</p>
          <p eId="para_2964">I understand that the promulgation of the Irish standard, the development of the European standard, the requirements of the Garda for monitored alarms, improved equipment, and the co-operation of installers certified by the National Standards Authority of Ireland have, together, been instrumental in ensuring that the incidence of false alarms and the failure of audible alarms to cut off have been very significantly reduced.</p>

      asked the

      his proposals for dealing with sludge from waste water treatment plants; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

          <p eId="para_2967">Sewage sludge is an inevitable and potentially useful by-product of advanced waste water treatment processes. Overall volumes of such sludge will inevitably grow as a result of the major investment in waste water treatment facilities now under way as part of the national development plan. It is therefore desirable, and in accordance with EU requirements, that sewage sludge should be re-used wherever appropriate.</p>
          <p eId="para_2968">Sludge management plans are being developed by all relevant local authorities in the context of waste management planning generally. These plans are intended to address the management of waste water sludge in a progressive and environmentally sustainable way. I anticipate that this planning process will be completed in 2002.</p>
          <p eId="para_2969">My Department has taken steps over the past decade to promote improved management of sewage sludge and has, for example, provided detailed guidelines and financial assistance to support the preparation of sludge management plans by local authorities. At this stage, all marine dumping of sewage sludge is statutorily prohibited and has been terminated. Treated sewage sludge from the main Dublin waste water treatment plant is reused as an agricultural fertiliser.</p>
          <p eId="para_2970">Following a series of studies commissioned by my Department in relation to the re-use of sewage sludge, arrangements are being put in place by other local authorities for the full treatment of sewage sludge, including pasteurisation, and its conversion into a soil conditioner and fertiliser, or biosolid.</p>
          <p eId="para_2971">To assist the farming sector and local authorities in implementing this approach, a code of good practice for the use of biosolids in agriculture and a guidance document for the preparation of sludge management plans by local authorities, with an associated model plan, have both been published under my Department's auspices.</p>

          <from>Minister for the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Cullen)</from>
          <p eId="para_2976">I propose to take Questions Nos. 161 and 165 together.</p>
          <p eId="para_2977">Under planning legislation, each planning authority is obliged to prepare a development plan setting out an overall strategy for the proper planning and sustainable development of the area. Such plans would include the policy of the authority in relation to the provision of single houses in rural areas. Decisions on individual applications are also a matter for each individual authority in accordance with its development plan or An Bord Pleanála in the case of an appeal.</p>
          <p eId="para_2978">I have not had any discussions with An Taisce in relation to single houses in rural areas. However, my Department did receive a submission from An Taisce arising from the consultation process undertaken during the preparation of the national spatial strategy on the emerging indications as to how more balanced regional development might be achieved in Ireland. The An Taisce submission included comments on development in the countryside including the issue of one-off housing. All of the responses received during the consultation process have been carefully considered within the process of finalising the national spatial strategy.</p>
          <p eId="para_2979">As regards single houses in rural areas, it is essential that the farming community and those working on the land should be able to live in the country. However, a continuation of the current trends in one-off housing, particularly with regard to urban generated development, that is, development by those from and living and working in urban areas, will have significant implications in terms of a range of issues such as transport, the possibilities for strengthening many of our towns and villages, landscape and tourism and protection of ground and surface waters. All of these issues will be further considered in the context of the national spatial strategy, which is now being finalised. The report, Sustainable Development – A Strategy for Ireland, published in 1997, indicated that in general there should be a presumption against urban generated, one-off rural housing adjacent to towns.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_273">The White Paper on Rural Development commits the Government to ensuring the economic and social well-being of rural communities and to providing for vibrant sustainable communities with the range of age, income and occupational  groups to enable people living in these areas to enjoy a standard of living which will make them attractive communities in which to live and work. The Government is committed to ensuring that the maximum number of family farms will be retained. This policy is supported by local authority development plans. Such plans should seek to generate economic well-being, enhanced quality of life and vibrant communities; recognise that the sustainable development of a county must also have regard to the fact that many rural settlements act as service centres for an established rural hinterland with an existing community that must be catered for and promote residential development in specific rural areas, where population decline is evident, by re-inforcing weaker settlement structures.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_274">The national spatial strategy will provide a framework to guide future planning and development activity throughout Ireland, including investment in infrastructure, enterprise and the location of residential and other types of development. Part of the challenge of the strategy will be the need to address the issue of maintaining the vibrancy of rural areas, but doing this on a sustainable basis. The future role of our villages and smaller towns is likely to be of particular importance in this context.</summary>

          <p eId="para_2984">Primary responsibility for protecting water against pollution arising from the land-spreading of agricultural waste rests with the person carrying on the land-spreading activity. It is an offence under the Local Government (Water Pollution) Acts for a person to cause or permit polluting matter to enter waters, directly or indirectly. It is an offence under the Waste Management Acts for a person to hold, recover or dispose of waste in a manner which causes or is likely to cause environmental pollution. A code of good agricultural practice, issued in 1996 jointly by my Department and the Department of Agriculture and Food, provides clear guidance to farmers in relation to the storage and spreading of slurry and related activities.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_275">Primary responsibility among public authorities for the protection and improvement of water quality is assigned to local authorities under the Local Government (Water Pollution) Acts and related legislation. Powers are available to local authorities under the Acts to serve advice, prevention or warning notices. Some local authorities have made by-laws to protect water quality against pollution caused by agricultural activities.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_276">The EPA has relevant powers and duties in the context of its licensing and other functions under the Environmental Protection Agency Act, 1992. The EPA's IPC licensing system has been progressively extended in recent years to apply to intensive pig-rearing and poultry-rearing installations.</summary>

        <summary eId="sum_278">In the context of ongoing implementation of EU and national waste legislation, there is a need for additional, enforceable statutory controls in relation to the recovery of animal manure and related agricultural activities. The recovery of such organic wastes is generally exempted from the licensing requirements of the Waste Management Act, 1996, and is not yet the subject of general statutory provisions which directly address these activities. Draft regulations in preparation in my Department at present will address issues such as the land-spreading of slurry, the storage of organic waste, the use of fertilisers and related agricultural activities.</summary>

      his views on the fact that 53% of the County Cork non-national road network is sub-standard; the length of time it will take to bring these roads up to standard; the reason the allocation of grant per kilometre in County Cork is less than half that received by County Meath and only a quarter of that received by County Kildare; and his proposals in this regard to enable Cork County Council to bring its non-national road network up to standard within a reasonable time.

          <p eId="para_2986">Since 1997 non-national road grant payments to Cork County Council have increased by 78% from €20,743,711 in 1997 to €36,871,778 in 2002. The council's 2002 allocation is the highest for any county council in the country; it exceeds the next highest grant by almost €12 million and represents a 10% increase on the 2001 outturn.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_279">In determining non-national road grant allocations for 2002, the objective has been to resource all local authorities, including Cork County Council, appropriately in relation to their ongoing and special needs. This process is guided by a range of criteria, including road pavement  conditions, traffic volumes, length of road network and suitability in relation to criteria for EU co-financing.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_280">In addition, allocations made under the grant category, non-national roads to support housing and other development, particularly to counties in the greater Dublin area, where there is a significant demand for housing, further complicate comparisons on the basis of the length of the non-national road network in each county.</summary>

          <from>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government (Mr. N. Ahern)</from>
          <p eId="para_2990">Under the Housing (Traveller Accommodation) Act, 1998, each county and city council, borough council and the town councils of Bray and Dundalk are required to prepare and adopt a five-year Traveller accommodation programme and to take reasonable steps to implement it.

          <from>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government (Mr. N. Ahern)</from>
          <p eId="para_3079">I propose to answer Questions Nos. 176 and 178 together.</p>
          <p eId="para_3080">Certain fixed interest rate loans issued by local authorities prior to 1988 carry rates in excess of current levels. These fixed interest rates reflect the cost of long-term funds prevailing at the time the loans were advanced and are fixed for the life of the loan. The cost of reducing the fixed rates on these loans would be considerable and would have to be borne by the Exchequer, the Housing Finance Agency or the local authorities.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_292">Since 1980, borrowers with local authority fixed rate mortgages are free to redeem such loans without any interest rate penalty and refinance  them in the private sector. This may be regarded as a significant concession given that borrowers with fixed rate mortgages from commercial lending agencies are typically obliged to pay significant redemption penalties of up to six months interest, or more, in the event of early redemption.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_293">In February 2000 my Department undertook a survey of local authorities to determine the extent of remaining high fixed interest rate loans. The results of that survey showed that there was almost 44,000 individual fixed rate housing loans outstanding at that time, of which 38% were at 12.5% interest rates and the balance at rates under 12.5%. The average amount outstanding on an individual loan at that time was less than €6,600.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_294">In May 2001, it was established that the information supplied in response to the survey did not, in some cases, include tenant purchase loans. In view of this my Department requested all local authorities on 21 May 2001 to review and update if necessary the information supplied.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_295">Of the 42 local authorities issuing housing loans, 35 have responded to this second request. The number of additional cases included in the responses received to date is just over 19,000 which brings the overall total of fixed rate housing loans to some 63,000 and the average amount outstanding on individual loans to around €6,350.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_296">It is estimated that the cost of a reduction in the high fixed interest rates to the average local authority fixed rate of 6.6% in 2000, 5.9% in 2001 and 5.3% in 2002 would be in the region of €10 million, €11 million and €13 million respectively in the first year, declining thereafter as loans are paid off.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_297">The position regarding these high fixed interest rates was reviewed in November 2001 in consultation with the Department of Finance. This review determined that a State subsidy to reduce interest rates would not be appropriate.</summary>

The returns in respect of 2000 and 2001 have not yet been submitted but Repak, the voluntary compliance scheme established by industry to meet Ireland's packaging waste recovery targets, has indicated that it has recovered at least 25% of packaging waste in 2001, over 230,000 tonnes, thereby facilitating the achievement of Ireland's packaging waste recovery target for 2001 as set by Directive 94/62/EC.</p>

Progressive targets are set in the directive so that biodegradable municipal waste quantities consigned to landfill must be reduced to 35% of the total amount, by weight, of this waste produced in 1995 by 2016.</p>
          <p eId="para_3094">These targets were anticipated in the 1998 policy statement, Changing our Ways, which set out specific overall targets to the year 2013. These are to achieve a minimum national 65% reduction, over 15 years, in biodegradable wastes consigned to landfill; and develop composting and other feasible biological treatment facilities capable of treating up to 300,000 tonnes of biodegradable waste per annum.</p>
          <p eId="para_3095">In addition, the 2002 policy statement, Preventing and Recycling Waste: Delivering Change, reaffirmed a commitment to draw up a national strategy on biodegradable waste. This is now under consideration.</p>

        <summary eId="sum_299">The local and regional waste management plans, which are now being implemented following the enactment of the Waste Management (Amendment) Act, 2001, incorporate proposals for household segregation and separate collection of organic waste and dry recyclables in urban areas; a range of centralised composting and other biological treatment facilities; support for home composting of food and garden waste, especially in rural areas; an extended network of bring facilities in rural areas, typically with a tar get density of one facility per 500 population; and an increased network of civic amenity sites and waste transfer stations.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_300">Some local authorities have commenced their own home composting initiatives, providing composting bins, wormeries and other necessary home composting equipment to households in their areas, at subsidised rates to the householder.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_301">My Department's capital grants scheme will provide assistance towards the provision of materials recovery and biological treatment facilities, including centralised composting facilities, in accordance with regional and local waste management plans. Support from the Environment Fund, funded by the plastic bag and landfill levies, may also be available for suitable projects. Direct subvention of householders by my Department is not however envisaged.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_302">Progress towards meeting the targets set out in Changing our Ways will be reported by the EPA which is responsible for the provision of statistics on waste management generally. The national waste database report for 1998, published by the EPA in March 2000, is the most recent report available. The report, which is updated on a three-yearly basis, provides detailed statistics on waste streams in Ireland including details on the recovery of waste. A copy of the report is available in the Oireachtas Library. The next national waste database report for 2001 is currently being prepared by the EPA.</summary>

          <p eId="para_3097">In an effort to establish the number of tenants remaining in the sector and their status, local authorities, at the request of my Department, carried out a survey of landlords in March 1999. As the results from this survey were unsatisfactory, local authorities were requested in October 2000 to carry out a further survey directed this time to the tenants. This was supplemented by notices in the national media which alerted tenants to the fact that the survey was being undertaken and asked them to contact their local authority if the authority did not include them in the survey.</p>

        <summary eId="sum_303">A total of 8,489 properties, identified from local authorities' registers of formerly rent controlled dwellings, were surveyed and 5,360 replies  were received. Based on the survey results, it is estimated that some 1,700 properties currently remain within the sector, the majority of which are occupied by original tenants and/or their spouses whose right to remain in the dwelling will not be affected. It is estimated that the tenure rights of less than 400 successor tenants nationally were affected by the changes which came into effect in July 2002.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_304">Once protection for successor tenants ceases under the 1982 Act, I am advised that they may be entitled to claim a long equity lease of up to 35 years under Part II of the Landlord and Tenant (Amendment) Act, 1980. If the landlord is unwilling to grant such a lease, the tenant may apply to the Circuit Court to determine a tenant's entitlement and also to set the rent and other tenancy terms in the absence of agreement between the parties.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_305">A new means tested rent allowance scheme has been introduced by the Department of Social and Family Affairs, following consultation with my Department, to cater specifically for tenants affected by these changes. In addition, an information leaflet outlining the changes affecting the formerly rent controlled sector has been distributed by local authorities to all tenants in the sector and a freephone helpline is also being operated by my Department to assist tenants and landlords.</summary>

        <summary eId="sum_306">A 1993 survey, undertaken by consultants on behalf of my Department, estimated that the total quantity of household and commercial – municipal – waste arising in Ireland was 1.972 million tonnes, equivalent to approximately 0.55 tonnesper capita.The most comprehensive data on waste arisings are contained in the national waste database reports for 1995 and 1998, published by the EPA. The EPA estimated that some 2.056 million tonnes of municipal waste was generated in Ireland in 1998, compared to a best estimate of 1,848 million tonnes in 1995. On this basis, it is estimated that per capita municipal waste arisings  increased from 0.52 tonnes in 1995 to 0.56 tonnes in 1998.</summary>

        <summary eId="sum_308">In general, the EPA cautions that care must be taken in making comparisons between 1995 and 1998 waste data, as it can be difficult to determine the extent to which variations reflect real developments, or are a function of improved reporting and methodology.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_309">The EPA's principal method of obtaining data on municipal waste, including household waste, for the 1998 report was through a questionnaire circulated to all local authorities, supported by information from waste contractors and recycling organisations, and from waste composition surveys conducted by or on behalf of local authorities.

          <p eId="para_3108">It is estimated that in the region of 45,000 existing local authority rented dwellings lack a central heating system. Since 1994, my Department has required that central heating be provided during construction in new local authority dwellings and included in the overall cost of the schemes.</p>
          <p eId="para_3109">The management, maintenance and improvement of their rented dwellings, including the installation of central heating, is in principle the responsibility of local authorities to be financed from their own resources. However, where capital funding is provided under remedial or regeneration schemes operated by my Department for the upgrading of local authority dwellings, the provision of central heating may form part of the works undertaken. Local authorities may also seek on a case by case basis approval to use internal capital receipts, which are in excess of the requirements of their programmes for the provision of local authority houses and the remedial works scheme, for improvement works such as the provision of central heating to their dwellings.</p>
          <p eId="para_3110">Private householders are responsible for any works they may wish to undertake to their dwellings. There are a number of options currently available to assist lower income householders, and elderly persons in particular, to secure necessary improvement works to their houses. These include the local authority house improvement loan scheme, the disabled persons and essential repairs grant schemes, improvement works in lieu of local authority housing and the task force on special housing aid for the elderly.</p>

          <p eId="para_3122">In the light of events of 11 September 2001, the Government established a task force on emergency planning under the chairmanship of my colleague, the Minister for Defence, which meets on a regular basis to ensure that preparations are in place for a co-ordinated response to possible nuclear, chemical or biological threats. In addition, the Office of Emergency Planning has been established in the Department of Defence to take a lead role in emergency planning to meet the new threat from international terrorism and from any escalation in international terrorism, including co-ordination of the responses by the various agencies involved. This office is also exercising an oversight role in relation to peacetime planning in order to ensure the best possible use of resources and compatibility between different planning requirements now in place. The existing lead roles of Departments in respect of emergency planning for their own areas of responsibility remain in place.</p>
          <p eId="para_3123">Major emergency planning in Ireland, which involves the broadest range of agencies, is based on a Government framework for a co-ordinated response of the front line agencies, that is, local authorities, including fire, the Garda, health services and also other agencies such as utilities and the voluntary sector who may be called on to assist. Major emergency plans are in place in all local authority areas and may be activated by the local authority, Garda or health service. It is a matter for the individual authorities to update their plans regularly in the light of relevant developments, changes in contact details for agencies and personnel, etc. and these plans are exercised, including inter agency exercises, periodically. I am satisfied that this emergency planning framework is effective.</p>

        <summary eId="sum_312">The need to safeguard water supplies has been the subject of a series of guidelines, over the years, from my Department to local authorities, who are responsible for the management and operation of water supply infrastructure, and for the first line response to any incident that would affect the security and quality of supply to the public. These departmental guidelines for ensuring the safety and security of water supply systems are periodically reviewed in response to new  circumstances and continue to be developed in light of emerging threats. The action plans of the local authorities, adopted in accordance with the guidelines, form part of the major emergency plans and will be activated as part of the response to an emergency.</summary>

Local authorities were advised that information about current plans should be available to all service providers and to the public. My Department met the City and County Managers Association in December 2001 and managers are satisfied that arrangements are in place to ensure that major emergency plans are updated and co-ordinated with other emergency services at local level. Under the general oversight of the Government task force, my Department also issued guidance in November 2001 for the emergency services on response measures in the event of the release of chemical agents.</summary>

These recognise the need for a dramatic reduction in reliance on landfill, in favour of an integrated waste management policy which delivers ambitious waste recycling-recovery targets and brings waste management infrastructure up to modern standards, including sustainable development, in the Planning and Development Act, 2000, as a yardstick against which development proposals are to be evaluated; establishing Comhar to advance sustainable development on the basis of dialogue and partnership; adopting a national climate change strategy in 2000, setting out clearly the actions to be implemented to ensure that Ireland meets its target under the Kyoto Protocol – many of the measures are already being implemented; banning leaded petrol, extending the ban on smoky coal to further areas, and increasing substantially the levels of investment in public transport; publishing revised guidelines on Local Agenda 21, Towards Sustainable Local Communities, in 2001 to help give new impetus towards sustainable development at community level; adopting a national biodiversity plan and a national heritage plan in 2002; and implementing a major campaign to promote greater public awareness of environmental issues.</summary>

          <p eId="para_3164">I am concerned to ensure that the register of electors used at any poll should be as accurate as possible. The compilation and publication of the register is a matter for each registration authority in accordance with electoral law and involves the carrying out of house-to-house or other local inquiries and in many cases delivering registration forms to households for completion.</p>
          <p eId="para_3165">The draft register is published on 1 November and is made available for examination at post offices, public libraries, Garda stations, courthouses and local authority offices up to 25 November. The public are invited, through national and local advertising campaigns, to check the draft during this period to make sure that they are correctly registered and to bring errors or omissions in the draft to the attention of the registration authority. The final register is published on 1 February and comes into force for a year on 15 February.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_329">There have been a number of changes in recent years which have helped to improve the accuracy of the register. The Electoral (Amendment) Act, 2001, included new provisions to allow persons who have moved residence to another constituency or to another electoral area in a constituency during the currency of a register or who will reach 18 years old on or before polling day to apply for entry in the supplement to the register. It also provided that persons who are unable to vote in their constituency because of their employment  by a returning officer in another constituency on polling day are eligible to apply for entry in the supplement to the postal voters list.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_330">I am satisfied that these and previous amendments to the electoral code will contribute towards a more accurate register but I will, nonetheless, continue to keep the administrative and legal arrangements for the compilation of the register of electors under review.</summary>

          <p eId="para_3167">Planning authorities, where they consider it necessary, may attach a condition to a planning permission requiring the provision of a packaged treatment plant for the disposal of sewage from domestic dwellings. Such treatment systems might typically be required to be certified to meet standards set by the National Standards Authority of Ireland-Irish Agrément Board.

          <p eId="para_3170">All planning authorities prepared their housing strategies in accordance with Part V of the Planning and Development Act, 2000, by the statutory deadline of end July 2001. All development plans have been varied to include the housing strategies and, accordingly, the social and affordable housing requirement now applies to all relevant residential planning permission applications. I should point out that the legislative requirement is for a maximum 20% social and affordable housing rather than a minimum 20%.</p>
          <p eId="para_3171">Local authorities are now implementing their housing strategies. I understand that some 53 units have been or are about to be occupied with many more units the subject of pre-planning discussions and final negotiations between authorities and developers-builders. Some of the larger authorities have estimated that around 300 units may come on stream by end year.</p>
          <p eId="para_3172">In order to ensure that housing strategies and Part V in general is meeting the objectives for which it was enacted, with particular reference to social and affordable housing, a review of its operation is currently under way in my Department. It is intended to bring the results of the review to Government as soon as possible.</p>

          <p eId="para_3178">I propose to take Questions Nos. 217 and 270 together.</p>
          <p eId="para_3179">The 15 cent levy on plastic bags, as provided for in the Waste Management (Environmental Levy) (Plastic Bag) Regulations 2001, applies to all plastic bags supplied to customers at the point of sale to them of goods or products to be placed in the bags in any shop, supermarket, service station or other sales outlet. There is an exemption for bags used for non-packaged fresh food products – fish, meat, poultry, fruit and vegetables etc. The dimensions of these bags must not exceed 225mm in width – exclusive of any gussets – by 345mm in depth – inclusive of any gussets – by 450mm in length – inclusive of any handles. Plastic bags designed for re-use and which are sold to customers for a sum of not less than 70 cent are also exempt as are bags provided to departing passengers in ports or airports, and on board ships or aircraft. The levy does not apply to plastic primary packaging, in the form of bags or otherwise, containing goods or products, regardless of size or contents.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_331">Over and above the levy on plastic bags, necessary measures are required to ensure that systems are set up for the return and-or collection of used packaging, and for the reuse or recovery – including recycling – of the packaging waste collected, to assist in meeting packaging waste recovery and recycling targets. In accordance with the  principle of producer responsibility, initiatives already operate in Ireland in the areas of packaging waste and farm plastics waste, Repak in the case of packaging waste and Irish Farm Films Producers Group in the case of farm plastics, for example, silage wrap. In these cases, producers are required to take steps to recover waste or alternatively to contribute to, and participate in, compliance schemes set up to recover the waste in question.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_332">An Agreed Programme for Government states that consideration will be given to the extension of the levy on plastic bags to other areas such as non-reusable packaging. While my Department is actively considering the issues involved, final decisions have not yet been taken on the items which should be targeted as a priority in this regard.</summary>

          <p eId="para_3182">In 1997, my Department issued updated and comprehensive technical guidance documents on how to comply with the regulations for the benefit of the general public, the building industry and the building control authorities.

          <p eId="para_3287">Under the Planning and Development Act 2000 each planning authority is required to develop a housing strategy to take account of all the housing needs of its area, including those for social and affordable housing. The authority then determines the percentage, up to a maximum of 20%, of land zoned for residential use, or for a mix of residential and other uses, which is to be reserved to meet the identified need for social and affordable housing. Authorities may decide to apply different percentages to different areas, subject to not exceeding 20%, or the general percentage specified in the housing strategy, if this is lower.</p>
          <p eId="para_3288">Guidelines for planning authorities on Part V of the Act, and the preparation of housing strategies along with a model housing strategy were issued by my Department in December 2000. While the guidelines set out the factors to be considered by planning authorities in the preparation of their housing strategies, including a requirement to set out local social and affordable housing policies and to ensure mixed and balanced developments, they did not specify a particular percentage for the social housing element, as under the Act this is a matter for each local authority. The model housing strategy, using Louth as the model county, describes a methodology for calculating the extent of social and affordable housing need. In utilising Part V, planning authorities have been advised to maximise the extent to which needs can be met by the provision of affordable housing.</p>

          <p eId="para_3290">The national rural water monitoring committee has recommended a pilot programme by local authorities to test a range of new, small-scale wastewater collection and treatment systems, based on design-build-operate, DBO, procurement, as a means of meeting the requirements of small rural communities. My Department has accepted the recommendation and expressions of interest will be sought shortly by the relevant local authorities for the provision of such facilities at some 12 locations around the country.</p>

          <from>Minister for the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Cullen)</from>
          <p eId="para_3315">Security arrangements at British nuclear power plants, including Sellafield, are a matter for the British authorities. However, the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland has been in regular contact with the UK's Nuclear Installations Inspectorate with a view to obtaining as much information as possible in regard to security measures at such facilities.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_336">Following the 11 September 2001 attacks, the Irish Embassy in London contacted the relevant Government Departments to ascertain what security measures are in place at nuclear installations. The embassy was informed by the UK Department of Trade and Industry that it is not UK Government policy to disclose details of  security measures taken at civil nuclear sites. However, the DTI indicated that the UK's civil nuclear sites apply stringent security measures which are regulated by the DTI Office for Civil Nuclear Security. The OCNS also works closely with the UK Health and Safety Executive which provides advice on the safety implications of events, including external hazards such as plane crashes at nuclear installations. Furthermore, the DTI indicated that security and safety precautions at nuclear installations are kept under regular review and that the regulators were reviewing all relevant precautions in the light of 11 September.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_337">There have been further meetings between relevant Irish and UK authorities, and between the RPII and BNFL, with a view to assisting further more detailed evaluation by the Irish authorities of the safety of Sellafield installations from attack by terrorists. A recent OCNS report for the DTI on the state of security in the civil nuclear industry and the effectiveness of security regulation concludes,inter alia, that stringent security precautions are being taken to protect civil nuclear sites and material in the United Kingdom, commensurate with current threats to national security and that satisfactory arrangements have also been made with the Ministry of Defence to protect civil nuclear sites from attacks from the air.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_338">However, the RPII has advised my Department that, because of UK security restrictions, neither the briefings provided, nor the OCNS report, provide sufficient technical detail to enable the RPII fully to evaluate these conclusions. A more recent meeting took place in July 2002 and was attended by the RPII, my Department, the Office of Emergency Planning and the Irish Embassy. Unfortunately, while the UK provided more information on the methodology of its nuclear security measures, the information was of a general nature and lacked specificity. Ireland's concern to have more details regarding the safety and security arrangements at Sellafield and the consequences of a terrorist attack on the facility was again emphasised to the UK.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_339">The Government has in place a national emergency plan for nuclear accidents. This plan is designed to respond to a major disaster at a nuclear installation in the UK, or elsewhere, which would result in a major release of radioactivity into the environment and pose a radiological hazard in Ireland whether the disaster is caused by an accident or a terrorist attack. All the information gained by the RPII in regard to safety and security measures at British civil nuclear power plants provides constant input to our emergency planning and management response programme.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_340">An information booklet, entitled National Planning for Nuclear Emergencies, was published by my Department in March 2002, and sets out the principal features of the national emergency plan for nuclear accidents. An information leaflet summarising the main elements of the booklet  has been distributed to every household in the country.</summary>

          <p eId="para_3317">My Department's guidelines for planning authorities on residential density, published in September 1999, set out the types of locations appropriate for higher residential densities, the range of densities appropriate to various locations and the need to achieve a high quality of residential environment. The guidelines specifically provide that one of the criteria to be taken into account by planning authorities in considering applications for higher density housing development is the "provision of an appropriate scaled range of social and community facilities, including shopping, education, health and childcare".  Any planning applications for higher density development would be considered by planning authorities in the context of their development plans.</p>
          <p eId="para_3318">Section 10 of the Planning and Development Act, 2000 provides that each development plan must contain objectives for, <i>inter alia</i> the integration of the planning and sustainable development of the area with the social, community and cultural requirements of the area and its population; the preservation, improvement and extension of amenities and recreational amenities and the provision, or facilitation of the provision, of services for the community, including, in particular, schools, crèches and other educational and child care facilities. I am therefore satisfied that provisions are in place to ensure that a high quality residential environment is achieved in relation to all new higher density housing.</p>

          <p eId="para_3320">The targets for completions under the National Development Plan 2000-2006 for the shared ownership and affordable housing schemes are 1,000 each per annum. In 2001, a total of 1,611 transactions were completed under the shared ownership scheme and a total of 272  houses were completed under the affordable housing scheme. Progress has been slower than expected under the affordable housing scheme, in part due to the time lag between land acquisition and construction and sale. However, since the introduction of a site subsidy in June 2000 the number of transactions has increased. At the end of June 2002, a total of 364 dwellings were completed, 1,848 under construction and 3,414 were in planning. I expect that at least 600 dwellings will be completed under the scheme this year.</p>

          <p eId="para_3329">My Department issues overall allocations for house purchase and improvement loans, disabled person's and essential repairs grants. There are no separate allocations for the essential repairs grants scheme which represents only a small proportion of the overall allocation. It is a matter for each local authority to decide the level of funding to be provided for the essential repairs grants scheme in its area from within its overall allocations. While it is open to a local authority to seek a higher allocation in the event of increased demand under the scheme, an increased capital allocation would not, of itself, allow increased expenditure by a local authority without a corresponding upward revision of the authoritys own estimates of expenditure.</p>
          <p eId="para_3330">Apart from these allocations, my Department's involvement with funding for the essential repairs grant schemes relates primarily to the recoupment of up to two thirds of local authority expenditure on the payment of individual grants. The grants scheme is funded at local authority level from the authorities own resources and within the amounts included for that purpose in the local authorities' own estimates of expenditure. I understand that South Dublin, Galway and Laois county councils have notified my Department of difficulties funding the element of the essential repairs grants scheme not recouped by the Department.</p>
          <p eId="para_3331">In recent years, the amount of recoupment payable by my Department to local authorities has increased significantly under this scheme. Prior to 2 December 1998, local authorities were recouped 50% of each essential repairs grant paid up to a maximum of €1,143 in each case. Since that date two thirds of the amount of grant paid is recouped, up to a maximum recoupment of €8,467 in each case.</p>

Detailed proposals in relation to these matters are at present being considered by my Department. The precise form of the new bodies involved will emerge from that consideration.

          <p eId="para_3526">I propose to take Questions Nos. 248 and 316 together.</p>
          <p eId="para_3527">The national development plan provides for expenditure of €4.4 billion over the period 2000-06 on water services infrastructure, the bulk of which will be incurred on the treatment of wastewater. This is approximately three times the total comparable spend during the 1994-99 period. Exchequer expenditure this year is expected to exceed €480 million.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_352">My Department's current water services investment programme, covering the period 2002 to 2004, is the second phase of a rolling three year strategy that will be advanced progressively up to the end of the NDP in 2006. Funding for wastewater infrastructure under the programme is focused on meeting the requirements of the Urban Waste Water Treatment Directive. A number of significant wastewater schemes have already been substantially completed under the programme in locations such as Drogheda, Dundalk, Leixlip, Oberstown and Loughrea. The provision of the necessary facilities is well advanced in locations such as Dublin, Cork, Limerick, Waterford, Wexford and Galway. The programme now incorporates all the remaining wastewater schemes for specific agglomerations requiring secondary treatment or better under the directive.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_353">The wastewater schemes included in the water services investment programme 2002-04, which is available in the Oireachtas Library, were drawn mainly from the assessments of needs produced by local authorities in response to my Department's request to all authorities to prepare and submit prioritised proposals for dealing with their capital water services requirements. The assessments have helped to quantify the amount of investment needed to augment existing schemes and to provide new facilities.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_354">In general, the operation of water treatment plants does not give rise to a risk of pollution. Local authorities are required to have action plans in place for the security and protection of water resources and drinking water supplies as part of their major emergency plans.

      the course of action which can be taken against a local authority which has failed to take responsibility for the supervision and enforcement of relevant provisions of the Waste Management Act, 1996, in relation to the holding, recovering and disposal of waste within its functional area; if the council or local authority is legally responsible if it fails to meet its criteria in this regard; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

          <p eId="para_3529">Under section 59 of the Waste Management Act, 1996, each local authority is responsible for the supervision, and the enforcement, of the relevant provisions of the  Act in relation to, the holding, recovery and disposal of waste within its functional area. Section 63 of the Environmental Protection Agency Act, 1992, provides that the agency may take specified actions where it is of the opinion that a local authority has failed to perform a statutory function of that authority in relation to environmental protection, or has performed that function in an unsatisfactory manner.</p>
          <p eId="para_3530">Under the Ombudsman Act, 1980, the Ombudsman is empowered to investigate complaints about administrative actions, delays or inaction adversely affecting persons or bodies in their dealings with public bodies, including local authorities. The Minister for the Environment and Local Government has no direct function in relation to the exercise or otherwise by a local authority of the various powers and functions conferred on it under the 1996 Act.</p>

          <p eId="para_3532">Under the Air Pollution Act, 1987, the occupier of any premises, other than a private dwelling, is required to use the best practicable means to limit and, if possible, to prevent an emission from such premises. Emission is defined to include a smoke emission. In addition, the occupier of any premises is prohibited from causing or permitting emissions in such a quantity or manner as to be a nuisance. The Act empowers a local authority to serve a notice on the occupier of any premises from where there is an emission specifying the measures necessary to prevent or limit air pollution.</p>
          <p eId="para_3533">The Waste Management Act, 1996, places a general duty on the holder of waste not to hold, transport, recover or dispose of waste in a manner that causes or is likely to cause environmental pollution. Local authorities have specific powers under the Act to require measures to be taken to prevent or limit environmental pollution caused by the holding or disposal of waste , and mitigate or remedy the effects on the environment of any such activity.</p>

          <p eId="para_3535">Capital allocations to enable local authorities to fund the provision of dwellings under the affordable housing scheme in 2002 were notified to local authorities by my Department on 12 July 2002. Within these allocations authorities can finance expenditure by way of loans from the Housing Finance Agency, or from their own resources. The following table sets out the allocation notified to each local authority.</p>
          <p eId="para_3536">Separate allocations are not made to authorities in respect of the subsidy which may be payable by the Department towards the cost of acquisition and development of the sites of these dwellings. Expenditure incurred for this purpose by authorities is recouped by my Department on receipt of a valid claim from the authority. Details of activity under the affordable housing scheme are published in my Department's housing statistics bulletins which are available in the Oireachtas Library. Activity under the scheme has increased significantly. At the end of 2001 there were 1,177 dwellings in progress, while at the end of June 2002, there were 1,848 dwellings in progress.</p>

          <p eId="para_3617">Responsibility for the activation of major emergency plans rests with the three main response agencies, the local authorities, including the fire service, the Garda Siochána and health boards. Dublin City Council decided to activate its major emergency plan in response to the flooding in the Dublin area in February 2002. In the council's interim assessment report of the flooding in February 2002 they indicated satisfaction with the operation of the plan and with the dedicated efforts of their workers and the other emergency services and volunteers involved in the response to the flooding.</p>

        <summary eId="sum_359">The European Environment Agency report, European Community and member states greenhouse gas emission trends 1990-1999, which is available at http://reports.eea.eu.int/topicreport200110/english, indicates that Ireland has the highest per capita emissions of total greenhouse gases for the EU in 1999, calculated on a global warming potential basis, not including emissions and sequestration from the land use change and forestry sector. The difference between Ireland's position when comparing CO2 only and total greenhouse gas emissions arises mainly from the disproportionate contribution to total emissions of methane – CH4 – and nitrous oxide – N2O – from the agriculture sector to total emissions from Ireland compared to other EU countries. Both of these gases have a significantly higher GWP than CO2, which is the base gas for comparing the contribution to global warming of all greenhouse gases. The GWP of CO2 is one, that for CH4 is 21, and that for N2O is 310. As regards meeting our international obligations under the Kyoto Protocol, I  refer the Deputy to the relevant question on today's Order Paper.</summary>

A copy of the report is available in the Oireachtas Library. In order to progress the strategic review, I have had extensive discussions with the Fire Services Council and have more recently invited stakeholders in a spirit of partnership, to engage in a process for moving forward key recommendations of the report at national and local level, in so far as they concern services within the remit of my Department. Work to this end is now proceeding.</p>

          <p eId="para_3680">I propose to take Questions Nos. 268 and 302 together.</p>
          <p eId="para_3681">The unprecedented demand for housing, fuelled mainly by rapid economic growth and demographic changes, has been the major driver of house price increases in recent years. Therefore, a wide range of Government measures have been implemented to reduce excessive house price increases by boosting housing output and removing infrastructural and planning constraints on residential development. These have included: extensive measures to increase housing supply including the introduction of a greatly expanded local authority housing programme and the unprecedented expansion of the voluntary housing programme; increasing the supply of serviced residential land through targeted initiatives and the commitment of significant Exchequer funding – on foot of these initiatives, there is currently five to six years supply of serviced residential land nationally and in the greater Dublin area; securing the more efficient use of serviced housing land through higher residential densities; introduction of a range of measures to expand the capacity of the planning system, including the appointment of additional planning staff to local authorities and An Bord Pleanála; significantly improving the eligibility criteria under both the shared ownership and the affordable housing schemes; and the rebalancing of stamp duty rates to favour first time purchasers including increasing the exemption limit from €76,184 in 1997 to €190,500 currently.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_360">These measures have had a very positive effect in significantly increasing housing output, moderating house price increases and assisting affordability. Average year on year house price increases have been reduced from a peak of around 40% per annum in 1998 to about 5-7% per annum in June last. Last year was the seventh successive year of record housing output. A total of 52,602 units were completed in 2001, up 5.6% on 2000 housing output. Total housing output for the first six months of 2002 was 25,418 units, up 5.2% on the same period in 2001 and it is anticipated that total output in 2002 will be close to the 2001 record levels. Information in relation to the average price of new houses is provided in my Department's quarterly Housing Statistics Bull etin, copies of which are available in the Oireachtas Library.</summary>

          <p eId="para_3687">The problem of litter pollution requires a wide range of responses, including education and awareness measures aimed at school children and young adults. Initiatives taken in this area include the National Spring Clean campaign administered by An Taisce with financial assistance from my Department, and the Green Schools campaign supported by my Department and largely funded by private business and local authority contributions; local authority work aimed at promoting litter awareness in schools and among young people generally; and the national cinema and outdoor poster advertising campaigns sponsored by my Department, which took place during the year.</p>
          <p eId="para_3688">On the specific issue of enforcement, the general law in relation to the prosecution of children, for which the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform has responsibility, also applies to the treatment of offenders under the Litter Pollution Act, 1997. Within this framework, it is a matter for local authorities to decide on the most appropriate enforcement action in individual instances of littering. I have no proposals to seek amendment of the law in this area on the lines referred to by the Deputy.</p>

          <p eId="para_3693">The scheme of representational payment for councillors, which has been introduced following extensive consultations with the local government associations, is one element of an overall package of measures designed to enhance the role of local government and the elected member. These include constitutional recognition and guaranteed local elections; a modern legislative framework underpinning the central role of the elected council; updated financial management and personnel systems; a better focus on efficiency, corporate planning and customer service; training for councillors and record funding levels for local authorities.</p>
          <p eId="para_3694">As part of this programme the RP is intended to provide practical support for elected members in their work, without losing sight of the important principle of voluntary public service, long associated with the role of the councillor. The level of the RP has been set at 25% of a Senators salary for county and city councillors and under the regulations will remain so linked for the future. The payment framework provides for proportionate payments to members of town councils and is somewhat similar to that for the annual allowance.</p>
          <p eId="para_3695">The question of payment of the RP is a matter for individual authorities, in accordance with the statutory regulations and rules governing the scheme. Such payments are additional to the existing annual allowance which has been maintained and improved.</p>

      asked the

      the amount of grant aid paid to each local authority in each of the past five years under the improvement works in lieu of local authority housing; the number of household units improved; the average cost for each household unit for each of those years; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

          <from>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government (Mr. N. Ahern)</from>
          <p eId="para_4180">The information requested in relation to expenditure by all local authorities concerned with the improvement works in lieu scheme is set  out in the following table. Information relating to activity under the improvement works scheme for each local authority is published in my Department's quarterly and annual bulletins of housing statistics, copies of which are available in the Oireachtas Library. Detailed information on the average cost in each year of improving a dwelling under the scheme is not available in my Department, as local authorities have delegated authority to undertake works which do not exceed a prescribed value without the prior approval of my Department. The current limit is €75,000. It is not possible to derive an average annual unit cost from the number of dwellings improved in a particular year and the expenditure in that year because of changes in the level of work in progress in any year.</p>

          <p eId="para_4749">The 1998 policy statement, on waste management, Changing our Ways, recognised that the construction industry has primary responsibility for the environmentally sound management of construction waste. Changing our Ways challenged the construction industry to treat construction waste as a resource, and to take practical steps to achieve the recycling of at least 50% of such waste by end 2003, with a progressive increase to at least 85%  by 2013. The industry was invited to devise and implement a coherent programme of voluntary measures, involving effective least-cost solutions, to meet these national targets.</p>
          <p eId="para_4750">In response to the targets set in Changing our Ways, a dedicated task force was established by the Forum for the Construction Industry to co-ordinate the development of a voluntary industry-wide programme to meet the targets. The task force concluded its deliberations and submitted its report, incorporating a comprehensive list of recommendations, last year.</p>
          <p eId="para_4751">The core recommendation of the task force report was for the establishment of a National Construction and Demolition Waste Council, representative of all relevant sectors, to drive implementation of the recommendations so as to facilitate the achievement of the set targets. The council was launched in June 2002 and is now developing its work programme. The measures identified in the report are directed at a significant reduction in the use of landfill and this will permit both an improvement in environmental quality and more beneficial uses of land.</p>

      <b>Mr. Allen</b>
      asked the 
      <b>Minister for the Environment and Local Government</b>
      the reason Ireland failed to achieve the target of 25% recycling by July 2001 set under the EU Packaging Waste Directive 94/62/EEC; and if the target of between 50% and 65% recycling by 2005 is likely to be achieved.
      [17673/02]
    </p>
        </question>
        <speech by="#MartinCullen" as="#Minister_for_the_Environment_and_Local_Government" eId="spk_616">
          <from>Minister for the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Cullen)</from>
          <p eId="para_4754">Under the provisions of Council Directive 94/62/EC on packaging and packaging waste, Ireland is required to recover a  minimum 25% of packaging waste by 2001. Ireland is further required to recover 50-65% of packaging waste by 2005, and also to recycle 25-45% of such waste. The EPA has responsibility for the compilation of national waste statistics.</p>
          <p eId="para_4755">In accordance with Commission Decision 97/138/EC, pursuant to Council Directive 94/62/EC, the EPA is required to submit annual packaging waste returns to the European Commission within 18 months of the end of the relevant year. The return in respect of 2001 is not likely to be completed until early 2003. However, Repak – the voluntary compliance scheme established by industry to meet Irelands packaging waste recovery targets – has indicated that it has recovered at least 25% of packaging waste in 2001.</p>
          <p eId="para_4756">The 2005 recovery and recycling targets set for Ireland in the directive are challenging. However, I am confident that these targets can be met in light of a number of initiatives. Following the recent review of the Waste Management (Packaging) Regulations, 1997, by a task force comprising representatives of my Department and relevant stakeholders, I am finalising new waste management packaging regulations which will prohibit the landfilling of recyclable packaging waste.The National Development Plan 2000-2006 anticipates some €825 million capital investment in the development of waste management infrastructure, much of this through public private partnerships. Of this, some €127 million in Exchequer-EU funding will be provided to support the capital cost of waste recovery infrastructure under the local and regional waste management plans. Initial allocations under this waste infrastructure capital grants scheme will be announced shortly.</p>
          <p eId="para_4757">In addition, revenue generated by the environmental levy on plastic shopping bags and the recently introduced landfill levy will accrue to a dedicated environment fund for use in support of support of a range of environmental initiatives including waste recycling. Repak has developed a comprehensive five-year strategy and work programme in consultation with its stakeholders to facilitate the achievement of the end 2005 targets. It is intended under this strategy simultaneously to ensure increased recycling across all packaging materials.</p>
          <p eId="para_4758">In effect, the necessary arrangements to underpin a significant increase in national recycling performance – including in respect of packaging waste – are currently being put in place. Having regard to the foregoing, I am confident that the 2005 recovery and recycling targets set for Ireland in Council Directive 94/62/EC will be achieved.</p>

          <p eId="para_4766">I propose to take Questions Nos. 288 and 382 together.</p>
          <p eId="para_4767">The EPA's Air Quality Monitoring Annual Report 2000, a copy of which is in the Oireachtas Library, details air quality recorded at all monitoring stations in Ireland in the 2000-01 monitoring period. The report shows that Ireland's air quality remains good and all current national and EU standards are being complied with.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_380">The Air Quality Standards Regulations, 2002, made in June 2002, specify the reference methods to be used for the sampling, analysis and measurement of six pollutants, sulphur dioxide, SO2, oxides of nitrogen, NO2 and NO2, particulate matter, PM10, lead, benzene and carbon monoxide, for which ambient air quality standards will  apply from 2005-10. These reference methods are in conformity with the Air Quality Framework Directive (92/30/EC) and Daughter Directives (1999/30/EC and 2000/69/EC) and are considered state-of-the-art for monitoring networks.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_381">The extent to which adequate air pollution monitoring exists throughout the country and whether the technology involved is sufficiently modern and adequate to meet requirements are matters for the relevant local authorities, and the EPA at a national level under article 4 of the Environmental Protection Agency Act, 1992 (Air Quality Assessment and Management) Regulations, 1999. In anticipation of the making of national regulations transposing the Air Quality Framework and Daughter Directives, the agency published the National Air Quality Monitoring Programme: A Discussion Document in August 2000. This provides the basis for the future development of Ireland's air quality monitoring network in accordance with the directives. The discussion document deals with providing a monitoring network meeting all the technical standards in the directives and ensuring that the technologies employed in the monitors and their locations, are in conformity with requirements. Information on the installation of modern technology monitors is provided and I understand the EPA is in discussion with relevant local authorities about necessary additional monitors.</summary>

          <p eId="para_4777">A detailed examination of the issues which arise in relation to the sale of local authority flats, carried out some years ago in consultation with local authorities, concluded that no workable arrangements could be made which would be satisfactory to tenant purchasers, local authorities or the other tenants in a flat complex who did not wish to purchase. The main difficulties involved were, apart from any legal issues, the level of management charges necessary, public liability insurance issues and the future saleability of purchased flats.</p>
          <p eId="para_4778">However, in the light of the increased activity in the sale of private sector apartments in recent years and following consultation with my Department, I understand that Dublin City Council has engaged consultants to advise it on a scheme for the sale of local authority flats to tenants.

          <p eId="para_6758">The EPA's national hazardous waste management plan, published in July 2001 identifies a need for a thermal treatment facility, with energy recovery, for hazardous waste to ensure national self-sufficiency in managing hazardous waste which cannot be prevented.</p>

          <p eId="para_6760">It is open to the private sector to bring forward proposals for thermal treatment facilities on a commercial basis, and current proposals, if progressed, may have implications for the provision of thermal treatment capacity under the regional plans.</p>

          <p eId="para_6762">Postal voting was extended in 1996 to electors who are unable to go in person to vote at a polling station by reason  of a physical illness or physical disability. In addition, an elector, who is ordinarily resident in a hospital or in a home or similar institution for persons with a physical illness or physical disability and is unable to go to a polling station, may apply for entry in the special voters list. Postal voting was extended in 1997 to persons whose occupation, service or employment renders it likely that they would be unable to go in person to a polling station on polling day. This category includes third level students in the State.</p>

          <p eId="para_6769">Statutory responsibility for the provision of drinking water supplies and for upholding the prescribed quality standards rests with sanitary authorities. Stringent drinking water standards are prescribed in the European Communities (Quality of Water Intended for Human Consumption) Regulations, 1988. The duty placed on sanitary authorities to take the necessary measures to ensure that drinking water meets these standards is performed under the general supervision of the EPA. The most recent EPA report on Drinking Water Quality in Ireland 1998-2000 is available in the Oireachtas Library. The report is based on the results of 141,955 individual tests on 22,801 samples of drinking water taken from 2,559 supplies.</p>
          <p eId="para_6770">The report concludes that the overall quality of drinking water from public supplies nationally continues to be satisfactory. The EPA places a strong emphasis on the need to tackle deficiencies in a small number of public supplies which have been identified as frequently breaching water quality standards and exhorts local authorities to adopt corrective action programmes in relation to the relevant water treatment plants. In 2001, the EPA undertook 11 random audits on sanitary authorities, including Cork County Council, focusing in particular on the management of reported non-compliance with the drinking water standards. An analysis of the overall findings of these audits is included in the EPA Report. The EPA has undertaken to mention in future reports the extent to which deficiencies identified by their audits have been addressed. This is a welcome measure, which should serve to promote improved performance by sanitary authorities.</p>
          <p eId="para_6771">It is a matter of serious concern that any supply of drinking water is deficient in quality and, accordingly, the National Development Plan 2000-2006 provides for large-scale investment in water services, including a particular focus on the provision of additional water treatment and distribution capacity, the maintenance of water quality standards, water conservation and leakage reduction, and network rehabilitation.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_398">The EPA report acknowledges the water quality deficiencies affecting group water schemes, in particular on privately sourced schemes that supply some 5% of households nationally and highlights the Government's continuing commitment to achieve improved performance in the group sector. The major drive to tackle quality deficiencies in this sector is being maintained and expanded, with a focus on all areas of relevance – sources, distribution, analytical programmes and services, full definition of quality problems, management aspects, treatment options and costings. This is being underpinned by a commitment of €644 million, current prices, under the National Development Plan 2000-2006 for the rural water programme and a radically improved grants scheme.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_399">Other measures being pursued in partnership with the National Federation of Group Water Schemes – NFGWS – include the establishment of national rural water monitoring committee, the provision by my Department of financial support to the NFGWS, and the introduction on a pilot basis of a quality assurance scheme for the group sector by the NFGWS with the backing of my Department. A new comprehensive group water scheme monitoring programme, beginning later this month, will sample and analyse drinking water in the estimated 1500 group schemes falling within the remit of the European Communities (Drinking Water) Regulations, 2000, which come into operation on 1 January 2004.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_400">On foot of the EPA report my Department issued a circular letter in April of this year to all sanitary authorities endorsing all recommendations made by the EPA and urging their earliest implementation. The recommendations include, inter alia, the adoption of a management systems approach for the management and operation of large drinking water treatment plants and certification similar to the hazard analysis critical control points – HACCP – system to be pursued for small plants.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_401">With respect to drinking water supplies in Cork, including Cork city, the EPA report notes that overall the quality of public water supplies is satisfactory. The report also highlights problems in certain public and group schemes. Details of major schemes approved for the provision or improvement of public water supplies in Cork are set out in my Department's Water Services Investment Programme 2002-2004, published in April 2002, a copy of which is in the Oireachtas Library. In addition, a block grant allocation of €2.525 million has been made to Cork County Council for the current year under the devolved rural water programme in respect of small public and group water schemes.</summary>

        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_402">Primary responsibility among public authorities for the protection and improvement of water quality is assigned to local authorities under the  Local Government (Water Pollution) Acts and related legislation. The EPA exercises general supervision in relation to the performance of these functions by local authorities</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_403">Eutrophication or over-enrichment of waters, caused mainly by excess inputs of phosphorus and to a lesser extent nitrates, is the main threat to Irish water quality. Since 1997, my Department has been pursuing a comprehensive, national strategy to tackle all sources of eutrophication. A catchment-based approach to water quality enables all sources of pollution to be dealt with on a comprehensive and integrated basis. As part of the strategy, major catchment-based projects were established in respect of Loughs Derg, Ree and Leane – Killarney – and the Rivers Suir, Boyne and Liffey to establish water quality monitoring and management systems. The combined cost of sewage infrastructure investment in these catchments is €203 million, £160 million, with €8.63 million, £6.8 million, expenditure on monitoring and management systems. This expenditure is supported by European Union Cohesion Funding. The strategy is also underpinned by the Local Government (Water Pollution) Act, 1977 (Water Quality Standards for Phosphorus) Regulations, 1998, which set clear targets for reducing phosphorus levels in rivers and lakes by end 2007.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_404">Catchment management is beginning to show early, positive results in some locations. The final report of the Lough Derg and Lough Ree catchment monitoring and management system, a copy of which is in the Oireachtas Library, has shown that water quality has improved significantly and the improvement appears to be continuing with the implementation of a major programme of remedial measures, including phosphorus removal at 17 waste treatment works serving the principal urban areas in the catchment.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_405">My Department is now promoting the establishment by local authorities of river basin management projects to address water management in all inland and coastal waters, including groundwaters, and all sources of water pollution. These projects will facilitate implementation of the EU water framework directive which requires the maintenance of high status water quality, where it exists, and the achievement of at least good water status, as defined in the Directive, generally within a 15-year timeframe. River basin management projects for the east, the south-east, the River Shannon and the west have been approved in principle. Financial support at a rate of 100% will be provided by DELG for expenditure incurred by local authorities in relation to these projects.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_406">Water quality management is being supported by my Department's major investment programme in sewage infrastructure facilities throughout the country. The national development plan provides for capital investment of €3,700 million the major portion of which will be devoted to waste water infrastructure. The investment programme places particular emphasis on the provision of phosphorus reduction facilities  where a need is indicated in this regard. Large-scale projects are now being completed or advanced in major cities and towns, including Dublin, Cork, Drogheda, Dundalk, Galway, Limerick and Waterford. Discharges to waters from industrial sources are subject to licensing controls operated by local authorities and the EPA.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_407">Losses to waters of phosphorus and nitrogen from agriculture arise from inadequate waste management at farmyard level and from leaching and run-off from land, particularly following the landspreading of slurries or the use of chemical fertilisers. Facilitated by regulations which I made in 1998 to extend and strengthen their powers, by-laws were made by certain local authorities under the Local Government (Water Pollution) Acts to protect waters against pollution by agriculture. My colleague, the Minister for Agriculture and Food, has substantial initiatives under way to tackle nutrient inputs from agriculture, including the rural environment protection scheme and the new farm waste management scheme.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_408">The nitrates directive has been substantially implemented in Ireland by way of extensive monitoring of nitrate levels in water, assessment of trophic status of waters, the development and dissemination in 1996 of a code of good agricultural practice to protect waters from pollution by nitrates and by a range of other measures which operate to protect water quality against pollution from agricultural sources. However, there is a need for additional controls countrywide in relation to agriculture to complement the efforts that are being made in other sectors such as UWWT investment and controls on industrial discharges.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_409">Proposals are now being developed in my Department for an action programme, including regulations, to strengthen the application in all areas of established standards of good farming practice. The regulations will give further effect to a number of EU Directives on waste and water quality, including the nitrates directive, and generally strengthen and support measures for the protection of the environment. The detailed provisions of the action programme and regulations will be developed over the coming months in consultation with the farming bodies and other interests.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_410">A voluntary agreement is in place with the Irish Cosmetics and Detergents Association for the effective phasing-out by end 2002 of the marketing by ICDA members of phosphate-based domestic laundry detergents products in Ireland. My Department is liaising with the non-ICDA suppliers in relation to the remaining 10% of the market with a view to obtaining similar commitments for the own-brand sector. Significant progress is being made in this regard.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_411">Detailed information in relation to the enforcement activities of local authorities under the Local Government (Water Pollution) Acts is contained in Environment Bulletin No. 53 issued by my Department, a copy of which is available in the Oireachtas Library. A total of 11,511 enforcement activities are  recorded in 2000 and include 6,140 investigations, the issue of 4,898 formal notices and 44 prosecutions. These data do not include enforcement action taken by other authorities or persons for example regional fisheries boards.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_412">Water quality in Ireland is generally satisfactory, especially in comparison with most other European countries and this is confirmed by the EPA report on Water Quality in Ireland 1998-2000 which was published in January 2002, a copy of which is available in the Oireachtas Library. The report records, for the first time since national surveys commenced in 1971, a reversal in the downward trend in water quality with a reported increase in the length of unpolluted river channel, from 67% in 1995-97 period to 70% in 1998-2000 period. In addition lake surface area classified as unpolluted has increased some 28% over the periods 1995-97 and 1998-2000.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_413">I refer also to the reply to Questions Nos. 400 of 7 March 2002 and 340 of 26 March 2002 which summarise relevant enforcement activity by local authorities, including prosecutions in the years 1995 to 1999 under the Local Government (Water Pollution) Acts.</summary>

          <p eId="para_6797">There are a number of schemes available which assist the improvement of housing to accommodate elderly relatives. The disabled person's grant scheme allows local authorities to pay a grant for the provision of additional accommodation or necessary works of adaptation to a house to meet the needs of a disabled or incapacitated member of the household. In addition, the scheme of improvement works in lieu of local authority housing, inter alia, enables local authorities to improve or extend a private house owned by a relative of an elderly applicant for local authority housing, if it could, on completion of the works, meet the applicant's housing need.</p>
          <p eId="para_6798">Copies of leaflets outlining the operation of these schemes are available in the Oireachtas Library. Further details of the operation of these schemes together with application forms are available from local authorities.</p>

          <p eId="para_6800">Comprehensive statutory assessments of local authority housing needs are carried out on a triennial basis. The results of the most recent assessment of housing needs which was undertaken by local authorities at the end of March will be published by my Department in the next few weeks. The results of the assessment of housing needs which was undertaken by local authorities in March 1999 indicated a total 39,176 households in need of local authority housing. The previous statutory assessments of housing needs undertaken in March 1993 and March 1996 indicated a  total of 28,624 and 27,427 households respectively in need of local authority housing. A detailed breakdown by local authority of the results of these assessments are published in my Department's housing statistics bulletins for the September quarters in 1993, 1996 and 1999 and are available in the Oireachtas Library.</p>
          <p eId="para_6801">It is a matter for local authorities to estimate anticipated changes in housing requirements, including social housing requirements, in their housing strategies under part V of the Planning and Development Act, 2000. I understand that Cork City Council and Cork County Council, including the town councils, published a joint housing strategy under part V of the Planning and Development Act, 2000, in November 2001 which contains their estimated housing requirements for the period 2001-06.</p>
          <p eId="para_6802">The number of authorised starts for the years 1992 to 1999 and under the multi-annual programme for the period 2000-03 is set out in the following table:</p>

          <p eId="para_6828">Under the Kyoto Protocol, certain levels of carbon sequestration by forestry may be counted towards meeting Ireland's greenhouse gas emissions limitation target. In this context, the Government's national climate change strategy, published in November 2000, deals extensively with forestry as a carbon sink and enhancing its role in greenhouse gas sequestration. The Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources is represented on the cross-departmental climate change team, chaired by my Department, which is co-ordinating implementation of the national climate change strategy and has regular contact with forestry authorities in this regard.</p>

          <p eId="para_6884">I refer to the reply to Questions Nos. 186, 190 and 215 of today's date.</p>
          <p eId="para_6885">The primary response to such circumstances rests with the front line emergency services – Garda Síochána, and local authorities, including the fire brigade, and health boards. If required, the front line emergency services can call on the support of the Defence Forces, Civil Defence, other voluntary organisations and relevant Departments.</p>
          <p eId="para_6886">Each of the front-line emergency services has prepared their own plans and strategies for dealing with major emergencies. These plans set out the responsibilities of each service in an emergency and requirements in relation to co-ordination and testing. Any one of the three main emergency services can activate the plan which will likely involve a collaborative effort on the part of all the agencies.</p>
          <p eId="para_6887">At national level, responsibility for emergency planning rests with individual Departments for services within their own areas of responsibility. My Department's role is to support the local authority service through a range of functions including capital funding, the development and upgrading of an emergency planning framework and guidelines and the provision of training and other initiatives to ensure the authorities respond promptly and effectively to emergencies.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_426">In addition, my Department chairs an interdepartmental group involving the Departments of Justice, Equality and Law Reform; Health and  Children and Defence. This committee is an advisory body which monitors the preparation, co-ordination and testing of plans by the emergency services as necessary, the co-ordination arrangements at national level to facilitate the response of the local authorities, health boards and Garda Síochána to major emergencies.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_427">More recently, the office of emergency planning in the Department of Defence, established following the events of 11 September, is now exercising an oversight role in relation to peacetime planning to ensure the best possible use of resources and compatibility between the different planning requirements.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_428">The Government also has in place a national emergency plan for nuclear accidents which is regularly updated. My Department has the lead role in implementing the plan through the Emergency Response Co-ordination Committee. This committee which also includes representatives of other departments and the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland, will respond to a major disaster at a nuclear installation in the UK or elsewhere which would result in a major release of radioactivity. An information booklet entitled,National Planning for Nuclear Emergencies, was published by my Department in March this year. The booklet sets out the principal features of the national emergency plan for nuclear accidents. An information leaflet summarising the main elements of the booklet has been distributed to every household in the country.</summary>

          <p eId="para_6889">The national development plan provides €4.4 billion for investment in water services infrastructure up to the end of 2006, approximately three times the amount expended during the 1994-99 period. Expenditure by my Department on water services reached a record €507 million last year.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_429">Substantial increases in water treatment and storage capacity are being achieved as a result of this increased investment. Schemes completed since 1997 have produced additional drinking water treatment capacity equivalent to the needs of a population of 586,000. The increase in water production capacity in 2000 and 2001 alone was sufficient to meet the requirements of a population of 378,000 people and was equal to 45% of the corresponding figure for the entire period of the previous national development plan 1994-99. The increase in storage capacity produced during  2000 and 2001 was sufficient to meet the requirements of a population of 437,000, representing 50% of the corresponding output in the 1994-99 period.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_430">The national water study published by my Department in March 2000, a copy of which is available in the Oireachtas Library, included details of the treated water storage capacity of all public water supply schemes serving populations in excess of 5000. The study recommended a minimum capacity of 24 hours storage.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_431">Details of currently approved proposals for major new and upgraded water supply schemes are set out in my Department's Water Services Investment Programme 2002-2004, which is also available in the Oireachtas Library. A significant number of new water supply schemes are included among the 129 schemes worth €726 million introduced to the programme for the first time. The schemes contained in the programme are drawn mainly from the results of local authority assessments, which have helped to inform the overall strategy for meeting additional capacity requirements.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_432">Details of an allocation for 2002 of €80 million for rural water services were announced earlier this year. The main focus of this programme is on the provision of water treatment facilities in privately sourced group water schemes serving some 5% of households nationally.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_433">Overall I am satisfied that the resources being put in place will ensure that we continue to meet all demands for water services.</summary>

          <from>Minister for the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Cullen)</from>
          <p eId="para_6926">I propose to take Questions Nos. 343, 350 and 357 together.</p>
          <p eId="para_6927">I reject the proposition that the planning system is in a state of collapse.</p>
          <p eId="para_6928">In recent years planning applications have increased significantly in line with the growth in the economy. Planning authorities have responded to this increase by improving their productivity substantially. The expansion in the demand for planning permissions has, in the short-term, stretched the resources of planning authorities. This has led to difficulties, particularly in relation to planning enforcement.</p>
          <p eId="para_6929">Strong and visible enforcement is critical to ensuring that the planning control system works properly and for the benefit of the whole community. A key objective of the Planning and Development Act, 2000, was to bring forward strengthened provisions in relation to planning enforcement. These new provisions come into force on 11 March.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_441">Changes in the 2000 Act will encourage increased enforcement and more compliance by developers and includes a new streamlined enforcement procedure. Fines under the Act have also been greatly increased and planning authorities will retain the income from such fines. Planning authorities will also be able to recoup their expenses when they prosecute a case. In addition, an application for permission to retain unauthorised development will no longer act as a  defence against an enforcement action or be a reason for staying a criminal prosecution. Increased penal fees for applications for such retention permission will act as a significant deterrent to developers from undertaking unauthorised development. The Planning and Development Act, 2000, also enables a planning authority to refuse to grant permission to a developer who has not complied with previous permissions. This is subject to the consent of the High Court.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_442">I want to ensure adequate staffing levels for local authority planning departments. Numerous requests from planning authorities for sanction for additional planning posts, both professional planners and administrative staff, have been approved. Staffing of local authority planning departments has almost doubled over the past four years from 660 in June 1998 to 1276 in July. This has involved significant recruitment of planners from abroad. I am confident that the resources available to the planning system are increasing and will continue to increase over the next number of years as a significantly expanded number of graduate planners become available from the educational institutions.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_443">The Ombudsman's report acknowledged that these changes were being made. He also stated his intention to monitor the area closely. In light of this, and because I believe enforcement of planning issues is properly placed at local level, I do not propose to establish a national planning inspectorate in relation to planning enforcement.</summary>

          <p eId="para_6943">The recycling of post-consumer plastic beverage containers and other types of plastic packaging is generally more problematic than the recycling of other packaging materials. This is due to the light weight to volume ratio, sorting and pre-treatment requirements, high end market specifications and associated costs involved. Therefore, the recycling rate of plastic packaging is lower than that of other packaging materials.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_444">It is against this background that the local and regional waste management plans are now being  implemented. They incorporate proposals for a significantly increased network of bring facilities to facilitate increased collection of recyclables, including plastic beverage containers. Receptacles for the deposit of such containers are already in place in a number of counties. It is envisaged that similar arrangements will be extended to all regions in the near future.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_445">The local and regional waste management plans also provide for the progressive introduction of segregated household collection of dry recyclables in urban areas. A segregated collection service is already available to over 200,000 households throughout the Dublin region. This service is also available in Galway, Kerry, Kildare, Limerick, Louth, Meath, Tipperary and Waterford.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_446">Dry recyclables can be sorted and baled for onward delivery to reprocessing outlets at material recovery facilities. The collection of plastic beverage containers under such arrangements is contingent on the availability of such facilities. In accordance with the commitments in An Agreed Programme for Government, substantial capital grant assistance will be made available to support the early development of waste recovery infrastructure, including material recovery facilities. The provision of such services and facilities should facilitate significantly increased collection and recovery of plastic beverage containers in the years ahead.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_447">As indicated in the recent policy statement, Preventing and Recycling Waste: Delivering Change, further initiatives to facilitate additional recovery-recycling of specific materials, such as PET bottles for plastic soft drinks containers, will be targeted with support from Repak and local authorities.</summary>

      asked the 
      <b>Minister for the Environment and Local Government</b>
      if he has satisfied himself with the operation of section 55 of the Waste Management Act, 1996, in relation to the illegal dumping of waste; if adequate resources are available to the local authorities to effectively implement the provisions of the Act; and his further proposals in this regard.

          <from>Minister for the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Cullen)</from>
          <p eId="para_6945">Section 55 of the Waste Management Act, 1996, empowers local authorities to require, by notice, specified measures to be taken in relation to the holding, recovery or disposal of waste in order to prevent  or limit environmental pollution. Failure to comply with a notice under this section constitutes an offence and may be prosecuted accordingly.</p>
          <p eId="para_6946">I have no function in relation to the implementation of this provision of the 1996 Act by local authorities. They use these powers to require the cessation of unauthorised waste activity and, if necessary, the taking of measures to mitigate or remedy the effects of such activity. I am not aware of any difficulties arising from the implementation of this section.</p>
          <p eId="para_6947">I am satisfied that adequate resources are being made available to local authorities to implement the Act. A sum of €593 million in general purpose funding has been allocated to local authorities from the local government fund in 2002. Allocations for 2002 are on average more than 74% greater than the initial allocations for 1997. They represent an increase of about 10% on the baseline allocations provided for 2001. General purpose grants from the LGF are additional to specific grants for purposes such as roads and water services. The income of local authorities is supplemented by local sources such as commercial rates, waste charges and landfill gate fees. It is largely a matter for these authorities to decide how these general purpose grants are spent.</p>
          <p eId="para_6948">I intend to utilise new resources from the environment fund to support dedicated and measurable enforcement initiatives by local authorities. This will be aimed at controlling fly-tipping and unauthorised waste activities. I have asked local authorities to submit proposals to me in this regard.</p>

        <summary eId="sum_453">Amendments to part M came into effect on 1 January 2001 and all new dwellings must be accessible by people with disabilities. The new provisions also place more stringent requirements regarding access for disabled people on new or extended non-residential buildings. This includes places of employment and leisure, hotels and cinemas. Such access must be adequate and not just reasonable.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_454">Compliance with the building regulations is primarily a matter for the owners, designers and builders of the buildings involved. My Department published an updated technical guidance document M, 2000 edition, which details how to comply with the requirements of the amended part M.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_455">Local building control authorities are responsible for monitoring and enforcement of compliance with the regulations. Under the regulations, the authorities are empowered to inspect public buildings, issue enforcement notices for non-compliance with the regulations and initiate court proceedings. Given the primary responsibility of developers for ensuring compliance, it has always been envisaged that direct enforcement by building control authorities should be selective. The current enforcement target is that authorities would physically inspect 12% to 15% of developments in their functional areas.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_456">The careful selection by clients of competent building professionals and contractors should help to ensure that buildings are designed and constructed in accordance with the regulations.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_457">My Department does not have statistics on the number of instances where it has been determined, by the local building control authority or the courts, that Part M has not been complied with in the case of privately or publicly owned buildings.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_458">Since 1997 my Department has urged local authorities to more actively enforce all parts of the building regulations, including part M. Circulars BC7/99 of 17 June 1999 and BC7/2002 of 12 February specifically called for stricter enforcement of Part M. The appointment of building control officers was also sanctioned where necessary and building control fees were increased to fund stricter local enforcement. At present more than 90% of authorities are carrying out inspections; more than 80% of authorities have achieved the target level of inspection, 12%-15% of developments and the remaining authorities have been requested to achieve the agreed target.</summary>

Local authorities can require permit holders to ensure that waste collected is transferred only to an authorised waste facility, to maintain detailed records in relation to the quantity and nature of wastes collected, and the manner in which it is dealt with. A local authority can refuse to grant a collection permit, or revoke one that has been granted, if an applicant or permittee is found guilty of any one of a number of specified waste offences, including unauthorised dumping.</p>

Under the programme priority attention is given to tackling the spatial concentration of poverty and social exclusion within the designated areas through front-loading State resources, available under the national development plan. The programme also calls on Departments and State agencies to bring about better co-ordination and closer integration in the delivery of services. There are two strands of the RAPID programme. Strand I targets 25 urban areas and strand II targets 20 provincial towns.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_464">Under strand I, area implementation teams with the assistance of a local co-ordinator, prepared a plan for each area. Plans were approved by the relevant city/county development boards earlier this year, prior to being sent to the national co-ordinator for the programme at ADM Limited. Proposals from the plans were then forwarded by ADM to the relevant Departments for consideration and follow up action. Departments are examining these plans at present.</summary>
