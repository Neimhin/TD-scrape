          <p eId="para_1">I have received notice from Senator Paschal Mooney that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_2">The need for the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources to outline the position of the Government on hydraulic fracturing, known as fracking, and whether the terms of the original licence granted to companies seeking to introduce fracking to Ireland oblige the Government to grant drilling licences to these companies if they conclude that drilling for gas, specifically in the Lough Allen basin and County Clare, is commercially viable.</p>
          <p eId="para_3">I have also received notice from Senator Marie Moloney of the following matter:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_4">The need for the Minister for Finance to extend primary medical certificates to people with Down's syndrome.</p>
          <p eId="para_5">I have also received notice from Senators Marie Louise O’Donnell and Gerard Craughwell of the following matter:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_6">The need for the Minister for Education and Skills to outline her plans on the junior certificate external assessment impasse and the prospective teachers’ strikes in lieu of resolution of this impasse. </p>
          <p eId="para_7">I have also received notice from Senator Colm Burke of the following matter:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_8">The need for the Minister for Health to establish a programme which would allow general practitioners to provide assistance for patients with haemochromatosis.</p>
          <p eId="para_9">I regard the matters raised by the Senators as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment. I suggest that Senators O’Donnell and Craughwell share time as their Adjournment matters are on the same topic.</p>

        <speech by="#DarraghOBrien" eId="spk_3">
          <from>Senator Darragh O'Brien<recordedTime time="2014-11-19T10:40:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_11">The Government will make announcements to try to resolve some of the issues surrounding the debacle of Irish Water and water charging. We await with interest to see what those announcements will be. Most of them have been in the media so I reckon we have a fair idea of what will be involved. I understand there will be a full debate in the Dáil and Government a motion on the issue of Irish Water will be put to the Dáil tomorrow evening. Therefore, I assume that a motion will be brought to the Seanad and there will be a debate in the Seanad on the revised proposals from Government. I ask the Leader to clarify the position.</p>
          <p eId="para_12"> It is important that we have a debate on water services. Last year we had a debate with the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform on the public expenditure side in terms of the investment on water infrastructure. He promised certain things then that have not come to fruition, in particular a review of the greater Dublin drainage scheme, which is €1.9 billion that the State plans to waste. We did put forward alternatives. Over the next few weeks or early in January we should have a debate on water services investment and infrastructure with the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government. I am not sure why the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform came here for the last debate. </p>
          <p eId="para_13"> Last week the Minister for Health came here for a debate on health in which many Senators, from across the House, participated. I got two and half minutes to contribute but was restricted in what issues I could raise. One area I raised, and which I have consistently raised in here, is the review on the multiple sclerosis drug called Fampyra which has been pending since 25 July. During the debate I asked the Minister directly whether he would simply call the review section in the HSE to inquire where the review is at. I remind colleagues that the drug only costs €270 per month and 1,500 MS sufferers benefit from it but they have been unable to access it since July. The drug improves mobility and many of the people who suffer from MS, in particular women, cannot go back to work.</p>
          <p eId="para_14"> The Minister said last week that it would be inappropriate for him to intervene. I did not ask him to pull a stroke or intervene. I simply asked him to do his job which entails asking the officials in the Department why are they sitting on the review of a multiple sclerosis drug since 25 July. It is now November but 1,500 people cannot access life changing drugs that they need. That is a disgrace and I am tired of raising the matter. At least I can stand on my own two feet and raise the issue on behalf of people who cannot stand because they cannot get a drug that costs €270 a month. I wish to table an amendment to the Order of Business that the Minister for Health comes in here, for just half an hour, to provide us with an update, bar the same answer I have received since July that it is up for review. I want him to provide us with an update and give us a timeframe for when the drug will be made available to 1,500 people with multiple sclerosis in this country.</p>

        <speech by="#IvanaBacik" eId="spk_4">
          <from>Senator Ivana Bacik<recordedTime time="2014-11-19T10:40:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_15">I also welcome the fact that we will see an announcement this afternoon by the Government on revisions to the charging proposals for Irish Water. We do not know the full package but we have seen a good deal of information about them in recent days in the newspapers. The revisions are a sign of responsiveness by the Government to the concerns expressed by people through peaceful demonstrations. I welcome the suggestion that there may be moves taken, not just to reassure people on price affordability and certainty of pricing, but also on the need to reassure people that Irish Water will stay in public ownership. The latter is a hugely important issue about which there is a great deal of concern. Yesterday, the Leader said we would have a debate in this House on the package of measures this afternoon which is welcome. I know he is seeking to arrange the debate.</p>
          <p eId="para_16"> I ask the Leader to arrange a debate, in due course, on crime statistics and crime rates in Ireland. I will also raise this matter with the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality. It is a matter of great concern to see that the Garda Inspectorate's report raised issues about inconsistencies in recording of offences reported to the Garda. This situation is not unique to Ireland and we have seen it happen in a number of other jurisdictions. This week in Britain this subject has also been in the news as serious concerns have been expressed that one in five crimes reported to police are not recorded as such. There is a general concern about the matter but the Garda Inspectorate's report raised a number of specific issues. In yesterday's newspapers there was an announcement by the CSO that it may have to defer its publication of crime statistics because of these concerns, which is a worrying development. Over the years we have had a lot of problems, generally, with the way in which we record crime statistics with changes made making comparisons between years very difficult. This is a difficult matter for statisticians but it is also a difficult one for policymakers when trying to judge different rates of decrease or increase in particular crimes. I would like us to have a comprehensive debate on the matter once the Oireachtas justice committee has reviewed the issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_17"> Yesterday, in light of the decision in the case taken by Dr. Sheehy Skeffington against the National University of Galway, I asked the Leader for a debate on gender and promotions in third level education. In the New Year I would also like us to have a debate on third level education more generally. A number of us heard a very good briefing from the HEA last week about this matter and on different plans for the development of third level, in particular the changes within the IT sector to develop technological universities. I know the Leader has an interest in this topic and I would like him to arrange a debate on same in the New Year. </p>

        <speech by="#TerryLeyden" eId="spk_5">
          <from>Senator Terry Leyden<recordedTime time="2014-11-19T10:40:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_18">I second the amendment to the Order of Business tabled by Senator Darragh O'Brien.</p>
          <p eId="para_19"> Today is national water day and the Government is trying its best to rescue the situation. It has been a political disaster for the Government and the country. The household charges should have been amalgamated. A far more logical approach would have been to insist the property tax had an element of water service. I do not think the Government will get out of the trap that easily. We will see what happens during the course of the day and we will have a debate here.</p>
          <p eId="para_20"> I wish to give notice to the Leader that I intend to reactivate No. 30 on the Order Paper, the Registration of Wills Bill 2011 - Second Stage (Resumed). I am not sure whether he will provide Government time for the legislation. I brought in this Private Members' legislation which was approved by Fine Gael, the Labour Party, Fianna Fáil, and the Independents in the Seanad between 2007 and 2011. When I re-introduced the legislation, because it lapsed in the previous Seanad, there was not as much support. The legislation has not been put to a vote and I intend to re-activate it. I intend to lobby my colleagues, particularly new Senators like Senator Craughwell and others, on its contents which are logical and reasonable.</p>
          <p eId="para_21"> The premise has been accepted throughout the Council of Europe and some countries have a system to register wills. People here are being deprived of a human right to their inheritance. Due to the neglect of legal firms that have hidden or lost the wills book there is mayhem and people cannot locate wills. I cannot understand that a Government that came to office on the basis of transparency and trying to reform the law would not support my legislation. I appeal to Senator Bacik and the Leader to reconsider the matter. I shall make a presentation to my colleagues over the next few weeks and I hope to move the legislation in early 2015.</p>

          <p eId="para_22">I wish to raise the just-released Law Reform Commission's consultation document on cyberbullying, which is an issue that I and others in this House have raised numerous times. The commission has released a comprehensive set of options as to how cyberbullying might be dealt with and it has asked interested parties to make submissions to it by 19 January through the <i>www.lawreform.ie</i> website. This is a critical issue that is being highlighted increasingly and all Members are aware of the effects of cyberbullying. It is important that people make submissions with regard to personal safety and one's privacy online, as well as on cyberbullying itself. It is a subject about which this House should be raising awareness. I also have called previously for a debate with regard to cyberbullying and perhaps at that point or before the consultation process, the Leader may facilitate a debate on this issue.</p>

          <p eId="para_23">I look forward to hearing the latest chapter in the water debacle later today. I understand that yesterday in the House, there was some querying as to my involvement in protests in this regard. Consequently, given that I was absent yesterday, it is only appropriate that I point out to Members that I was present at some of the protests in recent weeks. However, I condemn absolutely all the violence in Jobstown, Sligo or anywhere else. It takes from the sincerity and validity of the campaign and I certainly would have no hand, act or part in it. I believe in and support peaceful protest and certainly will attend future peaceful protests on issues I consider to be a matter of concern to the public and on matters my constituents consider to be of issue to them. I certainly was in attendance at a protest in Sligo the other night and I very much regret the thugs who became involved in unnecessary behaviour in what up to that point had been a good-humoured protest and demonstration by diverse members of society, from all walks of life and none and certainly not involved in any aspect of politics. It was highly regrettable.</p>
          <p eId="para_24"> I hope, as the Leader and others have pointed out, that Members have a debate either later this evening or tomorrow on whatever it is that will be announced tomorrow. I am sad to state I do not believe it will be enough. I believe Members have set about establishing the monster that is Irish Water. It is like setting up McAlpine to build a single house. There is a huge umbrella organisation, with a huge amount of cost associated with it, for which the people are not prepared to pay. It was ill-thought out, was wrong and there is no appropriate way forward other than to abolish this entity, to invest in the infrastructure nationally and to leave it at that. The people are entitled to that, as well as to uniform quality nationwide. They are entitled to a good infrastructure and when there already is an infrastructure that has been providing water to the people of Ireland for many generations, why was it necessary to set up this gilt-edged superstructure with pensions, bonuses and so on? Workers were misled, by bringing them into a situation in which they thought they were in secure jobs but they were not. It was ill-thought out and trade unions on the one hand now are protesting while on the other, they are indicating they do not wish to have bonuses cut. It is an unmitigated disaster----- </p>

          <p eId="para_30">It has been reported that at present, more than 200,000 cars in Ireland do not have a valid national car test, NCT, disc. While nobody would suggest for a minute that anyone should be driving a car that is not fit for purpose on the roads, one problem that has arisen on foot of the recession is many people leave until the last minute any expenditure they must undergo. This is fully understandable, particularly coming up to Christmas but unfortunately not many people are aware that a change in the law is coming into effect from 8 December whereby a person who is stopped without a valid NCT disc will be subject to an automatic on-the-spot fine, as well as an automatic imposition of three penalty points. This is pretty severe, considering there will be significant numbers of checkpoints in the approach to Christmas and, consequently, many people will be caught at these checkpoints for not having a valid NCT disc. While the change in the law also provides that one can carry out one's NCT up to 90 days before it is due, that is, when the previous disc expires, many of the 47 testing centres nationwide have waiting lists for an NCT of more than three months. In other words, were people to wake up in the morning, they still would not have the amount of time needed to get an NCT done before this law is introduced. Consequently, I ask the Leader to ask the Minister with responsibility to step up the information campaign in the first instance because as I stated, many people do not realise this is coming down the road. In addition, I do not believe a start date of 8 December is legitimate or realistic given that the NCT centres nationwide are not in a position to carry out the tests people are legally obliged to undergo.</p>

          <p eId="para_31">I notice the British have just announced they have found a new dye with which to overcome the problem of diesel laundering. This matter has been brought up a number of times in this House and Senator Brennan has spoken of the huge clashes that are ongoing in the north Louth-south Armagh area. However, if the British have come across a new dye they believe cannot be removed and which they intend to introduce next year, the authorities here should ensure we are ready for it and are capable of handling it as well. One wishes to avoid a situation in which the new dye is in use within the United Kingdom but not south of the Border. Consequently, I ask the Leader to draw this matter to the attention of the responsible Minister on that basis.</p>
          <p eId="para_32"> Another item that caught my attention was the suggestion by Deputy Dowds that the new flyover at Newlands Cross on the Naas Road should be called the Veronica Guerin flyover. That is a wonderful idea. The Cathaoirleach may not be aware that Veronica Guerin spent the last few weeks of her life in my company and I brought her into this House just a few days before she died. This would be an ideal opportunity by which to recognise her. She was somebody who fought against crime and gave her life for it. This road is located close to where she was murdered and to have her commemorated in that manner would be a strong message against the criminals. It would state this is something which we in the State recognise, that is, we recognise somebody who gave her life for this purpose and I would like to think consideration could be given to doing this.</p>
          <p eId="para_33"> May I offer a word of congratulations to those who organised the mass for the deceased this morning? It was well handled here in the House. I learned that in the House of Commons, there is mass every morning. I am not sure whether this is correct but that is what I was told. Members should not be in the least bit shy of recognising - this is the first time for four years - that they have had a mass for the deceased Members of this House. It was well organised and I congratulate everyone involved, particularly our colleague, Senator Naughton, for her wonderful voice and the music Members heard there today.</p>

          <p eId="para_36">I concur with Senator Quinn in complimenting everyone who was involved in the tasteful ceremony this morning to remember all colleagues who have died in recent years.</p>
          <p eId="para_37"> I wish to flag a good news story, just announced this morning, which is that more than 1,000 young entrepreneurs from every county in Ireland participated in the first ever competition to find Ireland's best young entrepreneur. The 24 finalists in that competition, coming from 17 counties, were announced this morning and will participate in the national final in Dublin in the coming weeks. This is fantastic and it gives real confidence in the country for the future that so many people between the ages of 18 and 30 are involved actively in business and have the confidence to participate in such a prestigious competition that is being run by the local enterprise offices nationwide. I wish them well and congratulate them and in particular, am pleased that two of the finalists are from County Galway. Dara Lynch of Twizt Hydration in the best new idea category and Pat Divilly of Pat Divilly Fitness in the best established business category will compete in the final to be named as Ireland's best young entrepreneur. As two thirds of all new jobs come from start-ups in the first five years of operation, it is good that the Government is supporting strongly young entrepreneurs and start-up businesses and Members must ensure that businesses are fully aware of all the supports available to them.</p>
          <p eId="para_38">I hope the Minister, Deputy Richard Bruton, will come back to the House in the not too distant future for further discussions on the progress of the Action Plan for Jobs 2014 and his aspirations for the 2015 plan. That would give us an opportunity to have an input into that and ensure that the growth in our economy and the level of new job creation is sustained in the coming years.</p>

          <p eId="para_41">It is amazing that despite all the questions being asked, which the Leader of this House, the Taoiseach and the Tánaiste refused to answer and said we will have to wait until the announcement was made, all the details of what will be announced came into the public domain through the media. That seems to characterise this Government's approach to dealing with such matters and is one of the reasons it is in crisis on this issue. It is because of the way it has handled the establishment of Irish Water and water charges. Despite repeated calls from both Opposition and Government representatives in this House and in the Dáil the questions were not answered yet those in the media were able to get access to all of the detail, even before the Dáil or the Seanad debated the issue. That is regrettable but it is symptomatic of the way this Government has done its business.</p>
          <p eId="para_42"> It is important to differentiate between the vast majority of peaceful protestors who came out onto the streets in huge numbers in Dublin and in cities and towns across the State some weeks and a small number of people who have engaged in heavy-handed tactics, which are wrong. The right to water protests, which have been organised by a number of trade unions and political parties, have been robust in challenging the Government politically but have been responsible in ensuring they were family-friendly and safe and that they provided an opportunity and a space for people to make their point about water charges. We will have a protest on 10 December and despite the ruse and the political stunt we will see today in the announcement by the Government, people have made up their minds on Irish Water and water charges.</p>
          <p eId="para_43"> Last week I and a number of other Senators called for a debate on technological universities. It is important we have that debate quickly because as the Leader will be aware, the process in the south east is in very real trouble if not dead in the water. I listened to representatives from Waterford Institute of Technology yesterday saying they will engage with Michael Kelly, who has been appointed by the Government to engage with both institutes and stakeholders in the region, but not on the basis of a merger. If that is their position and they will not move, where does that leave the entire process?</p>
          <p eId="para_44"> I am flabbergasted that the six Oireachtas Members in Waterford have still not met on this issue despite a request from me to do so. It is one of the most important issues facing the south east and the people of Waterford. I ask the Leader, through his office, to organise such a meeting so that we can discuss what is a crisis and how it can be dealt with in an effective way.</p>

          <p eId="para_45">I understand the issue I wanted to raise was raised earlier by Senator Hayden. It is regarding NCT tests but I want to add to what was said. I support the Senator's call for a debate on this matter, and the Minister needs to clarify it.</p>
          <p eId="para_46"> Before I came into the House I was looking at the NCT website which states that one can apply to have one's test done 90 days in advance but if one applied in Macroom today, one would not get a test until March. One cannot apply and have the test done in 90 days because the people waiting in the queue cannot get it done in time to avoid breaking the law. It is inexplicable that because the system does not allow for the test to be taken somebody who is trying to adhere to the law can now, at the discretion of a garda, receive three penalty points and a fine on the side of the road. Clarity is required on this matter and the Minister should come into the House and do that as soon as possible because after 8 December, law-abiding citizens potentially will be breaking the law through no fault of their own if they were stopped by gardaí.</p>
          <p eId="para_47"> Regarding Waterford Institute of Technology, I support Senator Cullinane's sentiments although not their full content. Something must be done on this issue. People are saying they are not prepared to be involved in a merger but a merger was being discussed at the time I was a member of the regional authority seven or eight years ago. The concept of a merger between Carlow Institute of Technology and Waterford Institute of Technology was always on the table but for some reason people appear to be withdrawing from that now. One can bring the horse to water but one cannot make it drink, but we need clarity on the matter so that we can move on in the interests of the south east and in terms of where we go from here on the issue. I would welcome it if the Minister came into the House for a discussion on the matter as soon as possible.</p>

          <p eId="para_48">I support Senator Quinn's suggestion that the new flyover at Newlands Cross would be named in honour of Veronica Guerin because that part of the motorway will always be associated with her and the heinous crime that was committed at that location. It remains live in the memory of anybody who drives up and down that road regularly, as I do. The suggestion is a very good one and I hope it will be carried forward.</p>
          <p eId="para_49"> It is wonderful to look forward to next week and the prospect of driving from the Red Cow roundabout to Limerick city or Cork without encountering a set of traffic lights. It shows the progress we have made. People often ask what the previous Fianna Fáil-led Government did with the boom but I tell them to look at the road from Dublin to Limerick or Dublin to Cork because that is part of the answer to the question. We talk about waste of money but that was an important piece of infrastructure to put in place and it will stand to us for a long time to come.</p>
          <p eId="para_50"> As part of the programme for better local government the Minister envisaged the setting up of public participation networks, PPNs, which is a support group for local authorities involving local community members. However, in the drafting of that schedule somebody decided that a person who had been an elected representative at any level of Government, either local or national, should not be chosen to represent a PPN in any role for one year after completing their term of office. I do not understand the warped thinking in the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government that would come up with such a clause, which effectively debars somebody of experience in local government representing a PPN. We have stood down hundreds of councillors who retired voluntarily or whatever, particularly town councillors, many of whom had 20 or 30 years experience, and it is crazy to go to the trouble of inserting a clause to the effect that they cannot serve in a voluntary capacity to work with the local authority for one year. In effect that means a full five-year term because these people currently are being selected by public process, therefore, if one does not get on in year one, one will have to wait for five years to get the next bus, so to speak. We are debarring the services of people who together have more experience of local government than the rest of us. I ask the Minister to revisit that clause. It has already caused trouble in one or two local authorities where such people have been deselected because of what I regard as their eminent qualifications. I ask the Leader to bring that matter to the attention of the Minister.</p>

          <p eId="para_51">In the area of mortgages I have already spoken briefly about the 80% loan to value limit on mortgage lending the Central Bank is proposing. What has been less remarked upon is the proposal on the ratio the Central Bank wants to cap at 3.5 times the combined earning of the borrowers. Last week the chief executive officer of Ulster Bank, Jim Brown, told the Oireachtas finance committee that if the new proposed rules were enforced this year, 68% of first-time buyers would not have been granted mortgages. That is hugely concerning because without access to mortgage credit, young families will place increasing demands on the rental and social housing markets. A balance must be struck as a matter of priority between tight regulation and access to credit for first-time borrowers. The solution may lie in private international companies which could bridge the gap between needing to make finance safer and the increasingly pressing need to house the population.</p>
          <p eId="para_52">In effect, private insurance could offer mortgage protection policies to first-time buyers that would cover 10% of the loan to value amount, allowing banks to lend up to 90% of the mortgage. The bank would then be protected against the first 20% of any loss on the mortgage. This achieves the Central Bank's aim of making the bank safer or limiting the risk to the bank while, at the same time, not putting house purchase beyond the reach of first-time buyers. Similar mortgage insurance methods have been used in the US for almost a century to enable borrowers to obtain finance for housing. Of course, we need to ensure we do not create any sort of bubble, as commentators have suggested, but we also need to ensure ownership remains an attainable ambition for young creditworthy families. There was a call last week for a debate on mortgages and I am sure the Leader is arranging one but this is something I will propose to the Minister for Finance if he comes to the House to discuss the matter in the near future. </p>

          <p eId="para_53">It is funny that I wish to discuss exactly the same issue. I still hold my belief that we do not need to soften the mortgage market but I take on board the suggestion that we would be able to insure 10%. However, I ask the Leader to set aside time to debate the private rental market because unless we control the rental market, as the mortgage market becomes tighter, rents will only go up. We have heard calls for the Department of Social Protection to increase rent allowance, which I fully support, but I do not support the rental allowance being increased merely to give more profit to landlords. We are trying to strike a very difficult balance and we should take great care with that.</p>
          <p eId="para_54"> The issue of Fampyra was raised by Senator Darragh O'Brien, on which I submitted a matter for the Adjournment today. If we are to have a debate on it, we should invite the drug company to attend, along with sufferers of MS. Given that this drug is capable of providing huge relief to MS sufferers, but only works in a maximum of 50% of cases, I would like joint responsibility between the drug company and the HSE in the early stage while this drug is being prescribed. I ask that we hold this matter for an Adjournment debate at a later stage to give us time to get the drug company and MS sufferers in here. This is a three-way partnership.</p>

          <p eId="para_56">I agree with most people who say the setting up of Irish Water was an absolute disaster but it seems to have been set up by somebody who was leaving the country in a hurry and it was basically thrown together. It is not fair that the Minister, Deputy Alan Kelly, should be blamed for the disaster that was left on his desk. Senator MacSharry said it was like setting up McAlpine to build one house but that is not the case. I do not know if he realises the scale of the problem we have in this country. We need to raise €8 billion to fix the piping network because 40% of our water is lost through leakage.</p>
          <p eId="para_57"> It is the Government which his party led that is really at fault here in that when we were awash with money, which it would admit, it spent nothing on fixing the water network. What was Senator MacSharry protesting about in Sligo?</p>

          <p eId="para_67">Mar a deirtear, tá a lán uisce faoi thalamh mar gheall ar an ábhar seo. Ba mhaith liom cúpla focal a rá i dtaobh Uisce Éireann. I welcome the fact that, according to reports, the Government has listened to the concerns of the people in this regard and we look forward to the announcement this afternoon. However, we will still be left with a structure that is inappropriate. We now see that many of the bad practices in Bord Gáis, which I and others spoke about here, were transferred to Uisce Éireann and that there will be a rear-guard action to try to preserve the bonuses, which is entirely wrong.</p>
          <p eId="para_68"> I hope that having taken on board what the people have said, the Government will in this instance look to other areas. For example, we all got letters about the property tax from the Revenue Commissioners recently stating that it is due on 1 January and must be paid by 21 March 2015. When we had rates, there were two moieties. People who want to pay in one lump sum rather than monthly, because they will pay interest or whatever on it, should be able to pay it in two moieties, one in March and one in September. All policies introduced should take into account the concerns of people and their ability to pay in these hard-pressed times.</p>
          <p eId="para_69"> In that regard, I ask the Leader to arrange a debate on hard-pressed working class people. I am talking about people on lower to middle incomes who are really finding it very difficult. More than 300,000 people have had to leave private health insurance, which really needs to be addressed. They are now being assaulted by the banks, which hard-pressed taxpayers' money was used to bail out, in order to extract excessive and exorbitant interest rates. The interest rates available to the banks have never been so low and yet margins are 3% to 3.5%, which is unacceptable. Something needs to be done in this regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_70"> I was appalled to hear the Tánaiste dismiss this and say it was a matter for the Central Bank when replying to Deputy Michael McGrath in the Dáil last week when he asked her what the Government was going to do. We were told the issue in regard to water charges was a matter for Uisce Éireann but when push came to shove, the Government intervened. I appeal to the Minister for Finance to come to the House and for us to put pressure on him to take action in this area. It is unacceptable. We must make accessing home ownership much more affordable and available to the majority of young people who have the same aspirations we had when we were younger when we could access home ownership. This is a big issue which needs to be discussed.</p>

          <p eId="para_71">Some time last year I mentioned that gardaí have been advocating the use of electronic tagging for repeat criminals - criminals who may have committed 50 or 60 crimes. We hear on a daily basis of serious crimes being committed by criminals out on bail. I call for a debate on this issue. I know the Government has mulled over this issue and perhaps the previous one did so too. Electronic tagging is used in many countries and I call for a debate with the Minister for Justice and Equality as soon as possible to see at what stage we are and the advantages or disadvantages of it.</p>
          <p eId="para_72"> Another issue I raised more than 12 months ago was the question of diesel laundering. I welcome the fact the authorities have now discovered a dye which, I understand, is practically impossible to remove from diesel and petrol.</p>
          <p eId="para_73">I believe it will be introduced next April or May. If it is discovered, why can it not be implemented and used much sooner?</p>

          <p eId="para_74">Last week in the Seanad I raised on the Adjournment the need for the Government to promote a very promising autism teaching technique called the rapid prompting method. This is a method for gradually teaching a child with autism to point to letters on a letter board to spell out answers. It leads to a child expressing his or her own thoughts by spelling sentences on a letter board and he or she can eventually be taught to spell on a keyboard or iPad that would speak what he or she has written. Thousands of children in the United States have been treated by the method since its introduction 15 years ago. It is a real breakthrough method that assists parents and teachers of children with autism as well. The system gives a child a new way to communicate with others and it is particularly successful for people who have no speech or who have limited speech.</p>
          <p eId="para_75"> According to the figures from the Department of Education and Skills, approximately one child in every 88 is on the autistic spectrum. With such a high incidence of autism in Ireland, the Department ought to be interested in any promising new education techniques for children affected by autism. I was very disappointed with the response I got when I asked for the Government's response to whether the Department would fund or promote the rapid prompting method. Instead of the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Jan O'Sullivan, coming to the House to respond to my query, the Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, Deputy Heather Humphreys, delivered a prepared script from the Department of Education and Skills. It was not clear from the Department's prepared script-----</p>

          <p eId="para_77">Yes, I am leading to a question. It was not clear from what the Department said whether it had even heard of the rapid prompting method. I informed the Department of the families whose lives had been transformed and the children who had gone from needing special treatment situations into more mainstream schooling as a result of the very promising method. There are very courageous families who are pushing ahead and they deserve support from the Government. Will the Leader raise the matter with the Government to see if we can get a proper answer on whether the Department has heard of the rapid prompting method and if it will instruct the relevant parties to look into whether it has the potential that has been claimed? Will the Department respond in some way and assist families who are doing their best to assist their children with autism to make progress at home and in school? I would appreciate if a more thorough consideration could be given to the rapid prompting method and I would be very grateful if the Leader would take up the matter with the Minister for Education and Skills on my behalf.</p>

          <p eId="para_78">I seek a debate in the House with the Minister in charge of the equality brief. The Leader might be aware of the landmark judgment earlier this week by the Equality Tribunal which ruled in favour of a woman being promoted in a university in a case dating from 2009. Since the judgment I have been contacted by upwards of 15 women who also failed to be promoted. Apparently, the judgment says they now have a right to be promoted. This is an issue for all universities. It appears that 70% of promotional posts go to men and only 30% to women. It is an issue worth teasing out with the Minister. Apparently, we are the lowest in Europe when it comes to the promotion of women at university level. There is a glass ceiling and this has been a landmark victory for a very brave woman who is a descendant of one of the suffragettes. It has happened in my own backyard, and since the judgment, between 15 and 20 women have asked me to raise the matter. I would be grateful if the Leader would organise a debate on gender equality and promotion for women. We are always talking about getting women into senior management roles and we must do something about it. I look forward to the Leader's response.</p>

          <p eId="para_79">I wish to add to what some of my colleagues said about water pricing. I acknowledge the steps that have been taken by the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government in acknowledging the massive and grave mistakes that were made by the previous Minister, which were highlighted by this side of the House during the debate in February this year, on the establishment of Irish Water and the pricing model to be used. Irrespective of what happens today and the tweaking around the edges in terms of establishing a fixed price over a period, the quango that is Irish Water still exists. The best approach would be for the Government to make a decision to disband the company in its current format and to move the responsibility back to the public ownership in the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government and the local authorities where councillors would at least have responsibility for making decisions and for overseeing work and investment plans through the county council process.</p>
          <p eId="para_80"> What happened in England, for example, when a decision was taken to semi-privatise water provision through the creation of regional authorities, resulted in regional water monopolies which increased the price by more than 200% in a 20-year period. The average cost of water per household in England currently is approximately £456 sterling. That is the actual cost of the water, and it would be the equivalent cost of providing water in this country if it was averaged out on a household basis. The difficulty in England is that a semi-private, off-balance sheet monopoly was created on a regional basis but when investment was required, it was privatised or sold. Private investors bought the regional authorities. The British Government then tried to claw back the mistake it had made. It acknowledged that a mistake had been made but it was too late at that stage. I fear that in five, ten or 15 years' time, we will come to the inevitable conclusion, irrespective of who is in government, that a grave mistake was made but it will be too late at that stage. We can try to enshrine certain provisions in legislation but it will be too late unless we disband the existing structure. We see that it is a mistake. Millions of euro have been wasted on spin doctors and consultants to replicate what is already in place through the local authority structure and through the Department. I fear that soon it will be too late to do anything. While the changes being introduced today might solve the problem for some for the next two to three years, the longer-term picture will not be solved.</p>

          <p eId="para_81">Senator Darragh O'Brien and several other speakers spoke about water charges and the investment in infrastructure for a water supply. I am arranging to have a debate on the matter on Tuesday next. I hope everyone will have an opportunity to attend. We must bear in mind that the Minister was present for a debate on the matter in recent weeks, but I assure Members that the new proposals will be debated in the House on Tuesday next.</p>
          <p eId="para_82"> Senator Darragh O'Brien also proposed an amendment to the Order of Business. He has raised the matter of the drug, fampridine, on a number of occasions. He also indicated that he had raised the matter with the Minister himself only last week. The Minister, Deputy Varadkar, is abroad today and cannot come to the House for statements and I cannot therefore amend the Order of Business to suit the Senator's request. However, I will give some background to the matter. I remember reading about fampridine a number of months ago. The manufacturer of fampridine supplied the drug free of charge to some patients who were prescribed it by their clinician. The manufacturer recently decided to stop supplying the drug free of charge and, as a consequence, the patients affected are now faced with financing the drug themselves if they wish to continue with the drug treatment.</p>
          <p eId="para_83">Fampridine was never available to multiple sclerosis patients under the community drug schemes. The HSE has received an application for the inclusion of fampridine in the general medical services scheme and community drugs schemes. The application was considered in line with the procedures agreed with the Irish Pharmaceutical Healthcare Association. In accordance with these procedures, the National Centre for Pharmaeconomics, NCPE commenced a health technology assessment, HTA, of the project is May 2013 which was completed in August 2013. The HTA provides detailed information on the potential budget impact of the medicine. It also assesses whether the medicine is cost-effective at the price quoted by the manufacturer. In the report the NCPE concluded that fampridine is a high-cost drug which requires intensive neurological assessment both initially and throughout longer-term follow-up. An assessment of the cost-effectiveness of fampridine was not presented in the submission made by the manufacturer nor was any of the other evidence of cost-effectiveness of fampridine found. While it is as yet unknown what impact improvement in walking speed has on quality of life, studies are ongoing to assess the wider impact of fampridine on both walking and quality of life.</p>
          <p eId="para_84"> As the manufacturer was unable to demonstrate the cost-effectiveness of fampridine in the Irish health care setting, the NCPE was unable to recommend the reimbursement of the drug under the community drug schemes. The NCPE report was an important input to assist decision-making and helps inform the next stage of the process, which involves further discussions with the manufacturer of the drug in accordance with the aforementioned procedures agreed with the pharmaceutical industry. The report is available on the NCPE's website.</p>
          <p eId="para_85"> The HSE's assessment process is intended to arrive at a decision on funding of the new medicines that is clinically appropriate, fair, consistent and sustainable. It is open to the supplier at any time to submit a new application to the HSE incorporating evidence which demonstrates the cost-effectiveness of fampridine. The HSE will then reconsider the application in line with the agreed procedures and timescales.</p>
          <p eId="para_86"> The issue is being considered at length. I agree it is taking a long time for a decision to be made. Even though Senator Darragh O'Brien raised the matter with the Minister last week, I will try to ensure the Senator is forwarded a written reply to update him on the position. I am unable to amend the Order of Business for the reasons I have outlined.</p>
          <p eId="para_87"> Senator Bacik raised the matter of having a debate on gender equality among staff in the workplace, especially in the universities. She raised that issue yesterday but I did not comment on it then. Senator Healy Eames also raised that matter this morning. I will bring the matter to the attention of the relevant Minister.</p>
          <p eId="para_88"> Senator Bacik also called for a debate on crime statistics and the Garda Inspectorate report. She also called for a debate on third level education in general. Senator Craughwell also called for such a debate. Senator Cullinane called for a similar debate with specific reference to the Waterford Institute of Technology. I will contact the Minister to try to facilitate such a debate for the Members.</p>
          <p eId="para_89"> Senator Leyden raised the matter of reactivating his Registration of Wills Bill. He raised this matter in the previous Seanad and the Government turned it down but he is quite clear that this matter can be resumed and I will see what I can do.</p>

I will arrange for the relevant Minister to come into the House to discuss that matter.</p>

          <p eId="para_96">Senators Hayden and Landy raised the matter of the imposition of automatic fines for motorists who do not have a valid national car test, NCT, disc displayed, which will come into effect on 8 December, and the need to step up an information campaign on this measure. I heard Conor Faughnan of AA Ireland outline this measure in recent weeks. It is a matter of public concern. I will bring the matter to the attention of the Minister, taking into consideration Senator Landy's point that people are finding it difficult to get an appointment for an NCT test in some locations.</p>
          <p eId="para_97"> Senators Quinn and Brennan raised the matter of the introduction of the new dye to eliminate diesel laundering. I have asked about this and the Minister of State, Deputy Simon Harris, will come to the House to discuss that matter in the new few weeks. Senator Quinn is correct in that there have been ongoing talks between scientists in Ireland, North and South, and in the UK, and as a result of that, this development has occurred. Hopefully it will eradicate this problem which is causing major difficulties to motorists and local authorities who have to deal with the sludge in particular that is dumped by criminals involved in this activity.</p>
          <p eId="para_98"> Senator Quinn and Senator O'Sullivan raised the matter of Deputy Dowds's suggestion that the new flyover at Newlands Cross be called the Veronica Guerin flyover. It is an excellent suggestion especially at a time when veiled threats have been made to journalists and newspapers. It is apt that this would be done now.</p>

          <p eId="para_105"> Senator Kelly referred to the scale of infrastructural problems in the water network and pointed out that Fianna Fáil signed up to a deal, dating back to 2012, which would have seen the introduction of a €400 flat charge.</p>

          <p eId="para_107">I note his points on the Revenue Commissioners and his view that the payment method should be tailored to meet people's needs. I certainly agree with him in that regard. He also called for a debate on the ability to become a home owner.</p>

          <p eId="para_109"> Senator Rónán Mullen alluded to his Adjournment motion last week on a new teaching method for autistic children. If the Department was not aware of the method, I am sure it became aware of it after the Senator having raised it.

          <p eId="para_110"> Senator Brian Ó Domhnaill called for the disbanding of Irish Water. We all agree there is a great need to repair the antiquated infrastructure that currently exists.

          <from>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine (Deputy Ann Phelan)<recordedTime time="2014-11-19T14:00:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_118">I welcome the opportunity to address the House on my role as the Minister of State with responsibility for the implementation of the report of the Commission for the Economic Development of Rural Areas, more generally known as the CEDRA report. Coming from a rural community, I have a strong and personal interest in energising rural communities. I was very honoured and privileged to have been given the job four months ago of overseeing the implementation of this report. I also want to reiterate that rural communities have the Government's full commitment to doing all it can to support job creation and to developing vibrant, dynamic rural economies and communities.</p>
          <p eId="para_119"> The report, commissioned in September 2012 by the then Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Phil Hogan, and the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy Simon Coveney, was designed to provide the Government with the information necessary to support policy and policy implementation frameworks that will work for the economic development of rural communities.</p>
          <p eId="para_120"> Throughout 2013, the commission and its chair, Mr. Pat Spillane, worked tirelessly, travelling the length and breadth of Ireland to ensure anyone who wanted to contribute to this report was facilitated to do so. As part of its work, the commission sought and considered the views of the public and stakeholders, hosting general public meetings, town hall meetings and meetings with key stakeholders, leaders of the business community and key experts. In total, over 100 meetings were held and approximately 1,000 contributions were made to the commission. To my knowledge, it was one of the most substantial and active public consultation processes conducted in recent times. This extensive level of consultation gives me confidence that the strong messages in the report reflect the knowledge and experience of people who live and work in rural Ireland and have their support.</p>
          <p eId="para_121"> The report itself took a multisectorial approach and contains 34 recommendations designed to support the medium-term economic development of rural areas for the period to 2025. These cover actions to be taken on enterprise development, tourism, broadband, rural town stimuli, artisan foods and beverages, social enterprise, creative industry, availability of finance, capacity building and skills, regional roads, rural transport, water services, the marine sector and renewable energy.</p>
          <p eId="para_122"> I accept the report's finding that generally rural areas and small towns did not benefit to the same extent as larger towns from the Celtic tiger boom. The report showed rural areas were particularly affected by the deep economic crisis. They experienced an increase in unemployment of 192% between 2006 and 2011, compared to 114% in urban areas. Small towns also experienced a drop in population, a major fall-off in economic activity and high youth migration and emigration. The impact is still visible nationwide with closed shops, the steady flow of emigrants and the resulting impact on community and cultural life. Any Member from a rural area will know when driving to Dublin of the serious decline of many towns. Equally, there is very mixed evidence on the extent to which rural areas are experiencing any of the current uplift. Some towns are beginning to benefit from the bounce back but my personal experience is that this is not the reality felt by a great majority of rural areas.</p>
          <p eId="para_123"> Vibrant rural areas are essential to the national economy. They have real potential which is not being fully realised and they need specific support if they are to achieve this potential. CEDRA was clear that rural areas are not looking for a hand-out but they most definitely need a hand-up if they are to continue to contribute to and benefit from, to the maximum extent possible, national economic development and well-being. This report is not a whinge about the lack of facilities in rural areas. It is about realising and capturing the potential of rural towns and areas.</p>
          <p eId="para_124"> The CEDRA report is a multisectorial plan. Key to its successful implementation is the achievement of a more co-ordinated and integrated approach to the wide variety of issues raised and the delivery of the services necessary to energise rural communities. It is also vital all Departments and support agencies are fully aware of the needs of rural communities and, as far as possible, that agency plans are tailored to provide the necessary support and assistance.</p>
          <p eId="para_125">On this latter message, since I came into office, I have been working to ensure that all new policies and strategies are being rural-proofed in a very meaningful way. I have already asked that this be done for the new policy statement on entrepreneurship and for the forthcoming planning and development Bill. I have also written to all Departments and agencies asking them to ensure the needs of rural areas are specifically and strategically considered when new policies or strategies are being considered. This is a timely request as all State bodies are currently developing their new three-year strategy statements for the period 2015 to 2017. </p>
          <p eId="para_126"> In addition, I have met and made my views known on this issue at meetings with ministerial colleagues and with officials from IDA Ireland, Enterprise lreland, Teagasc, Bord Bia, local authorities, the local enterprise offices, LEOs, and now the local community development committee, LCDC, structure as well. This element of my work will continue as further meetings and engagements are lined up.</p>
          <p eId="para_127"> On the second message, I believe that integrating different strands together, as suggested by the Commission for the Economic Development of Rural Areas, CEDRA, will give us an improved process. Therefore, I have now established and am chairing a high level interdepartmental group, IDG, which is tasked with implementing the CEDRA report. The CEDRA IDG includes all the main departmental actors and to date we have had two meetings, with the third scheduled for early December.</p>
          <p eId="para_128"> This group has already carried out an initial evaluation of each recommendation and has provided me with a detailed brief on what is being done. I have assigned lead responsibility for all actions and, following our last meeting in October, we are now finalising a multi-sectoral CEDRA work programme with specific actions and timelines up to the end of 2015. There is a strong reporting and developmental framework for the work of this interdepartmental group as I have to report back to Government, through the Cabinet committee on economic recovery and jobs, on the progress achieved by the end of this year.</p>
          <p eId="para_129"> A good example of the valuable co-operation and assistance which I am already receiving is demonstrated by the input on broadband which I have received through the good offices of my colleague, the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, Deputy Alex White. Delivering high speed, high quality broadband is one of the important CEDRA recommendations and access to a fast and reliable service is a basic requirement for rural development. It has the equivalent importance as the rural electricity scheme in the 1950s and 1960s and the change that made in rural Ireland. The roll-out of broadband will have the same effect as the roll-out of electricity in rural areas. </p>
          <p eId="para_130"> I am very pleased to see that practical and time-bound actions are now being taken to deliver on one of this Government's priorities for the period 2014 to 2016, namely, to provide a State-led broadband investment package for rural areas under the national broadband plan. Work is already under way on this project to identify and map the areas to be covered. Next week, the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, Deputy White, will publish, for public consultation, an interactive map showing the areas of the country that by the end of 2016 will have access to high speed broadband through commercial investments, as well as those parts which will require State intervention to ensure availability of such a service. This will be complemented by a series of public events to alert rural communities to the plans. By next summer the comprehensive strategy with timelines will be published and issued for public consultation and it is expected that the procurement process will be well under way by the end of next year.</p>
          <p eId="para_131"> This investment is essential if rural communities are to survive and thrive. In this day and age, broadband is no longer a "nice-to-have" service but is instead a critical piece of infrastructure for the economic development of rural areas. A quality and robust service is absolutely essential if these areas are not to lag even further behind. For that reason, one of my priorities was to get a comprehensive brief on developments in this area. I was very glad to see the developments being planned by this Government and I will continue to actively monitor this area as part of the CEDRA implementation process.</p>
          <p eId="para_132"> Another CEDRA issue on which progress has been made is illustrated by the rural transport programme. I have experienced at first hand how this programme has succeeded in developing services used by rural communities to gain better access to medical and educational services and to help combat rural isolation and loneliness. The number of services and routes has increased from 40,000 in 2003 to 224,000 in 2013 while the number of passengers has risen from 151,000 to 1.7 million over the same period. These provide a valuable lifeline for rural areas and the alignment of these services to provide better access to employment, education and health services is critical for rural areas. The types of integrated and co-ordinated action which CEDRA recommends is an example of this rural transport system. The rural transport programme is undergoing a restructuring process which is designed to deliver administrative efficiencies and a new role for local authorities in addressing transport needs.</p>
          <p eId="para_133"> I also welcome the fact that the National Transport Authority has introduced a licensing scheme for rural hackney services which is designed to allow new localised services to be introduced where there is an identified lack of availability of such services. I am confident that these initiatives will provide a solid foundation on which we can continue to build improved transport services in rural areas. </p>
          <p eId="para_134"> Another area of relevance is social enterprise. This is a broad work area covering many enterprises. These areas are primarily distinguished by the fact that any income generated is generally reinvested in the social enterprise itself, which is the social objective. One such area is social farming where people from disadvantaged groups are invited to participate in the activities of a working farm. It provides a novel social support service to improve health and also support farm diversification. The Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy Coveney, and the Minister of State at the Department of Health, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, and I have been working with the social farming across borders project to publicise these initiatives which provide opportunities for inclusion and reconnection between farmers, their community and disadvantaged groups. It also plays a major role in increasing self-esteem and improving health and well-being. It links up the Department of Heath and the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine and our intention is that it will also feed into the corporate social sustainability element of Origin Green. We are jointly launching the social farming guidelines booklet on 26 November. This is the type of cross-government, integrated thinking which is recommended by the CEDRA report and I am very anxious that I promote this.</p>
          <p eId="para_135"> Besides co-ordinating the implementation of the multi-sectoral CEDRA programme, I am in the process of identifying a few priority areas which I hope to pursue to energise rural areas and to show by best practice examples what can be achieved when communities and State enterprise agencies work together in a co-ordinated approach. I have asked a sub-group of the CEDRA IDG to develop, from within their combined resources, a number of proposals with clear, implementable actions which will assist the economic development of rural towns and their hinterlands. To help stimulate these proposals, I have been able to secure an allocation of €1 million in the 2015 budget for the establishment of a rural innovation and development fund to support innovative and small scale pilot initiatives under the CEDRA report. My intention is to pilot a small number of initiatives so as to assess their viability and effectiveness in creating employment in rural areas in the short to medium term.</p>
          <p eId="para_136">Work on these proposals is progressing well and my expectations are that well-advanced proposals will be brought to the next CEDRA meeting in December.</p>
          <p eId="para_137"> This funding is only part of a wider comprehensive framework to support economic development in rural areas. These include major elements of the draft rural development programme, the seafood development investment programme and the wider enterprise, capability and community development initiatives operated by other bodies such as the local enterprise offices, Leader, local development companies, educational training boards and tourism agencies.</p>
          <p eId="para_138"> My role, under CEDRA, is to capitalise on these resources and to achieve a more co-ordinated and integrated approach to energising and developing rural areas. I feel that in the short time I have been in office I have made some progress. I have shown a clear commitment and statement of intent to progress the CEDRA report and I intend to continue to actively do all I can to energise rural areas.</p>
          <p eId="para_139"> Now is the time to look forward and prepare to support rural communities to avail of the many and varied opportunities that I am confident are coming down the line. Ireland is beginning to turn a corner and it is incumbent on us to work together with the people of Ireland to provide the support they feel is necessary in order to maintain and develop vibrant communities that have always formed the heart of Irish society particularly in rural Ireland. This is a Government priority. Now that the economy is beginning to recover we must make sure that economic recovery is felt in parts of rural Ireland, and that is my role in the whole CEDRA process.</p>

          <from>Senator Brian Ó Domhnaill<recordedTime time="2014-11-19T14:20:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_140">Cuirim fáilte roimh an Aire Stáit, an Teachta Phelan, anseo tráthnóna inniu. I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Ann Phelan, and congratulate her on her appointment and wish her well. I believe her role is very important for implementing the recommendations of the CEDRA report. I see it as an overarching responsibility across all Departments, as I am sure she does.</p>
          <p eId="para_141"> I attended the presentation in the Houses of the Oireachtas at which the chairman of the CEDRA group, Pat Spillane, was present. I agree that it is a good idea to have a report commissioned on what is required in rural Ireland. However, I read the report when it was published and it seemed to copperfasten all of the cuts which were made in rural Ireland to broadband provision, farming grants, RDP funding, Leader funding and all of those issues. The report identified all of the issues, but the cuts that were being made ran in correlation with them. That is not to make a political point on the issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_142"> To develop rural Ireland we, as a Government and as a Parliament, have to ask whether rural Ireland is important in terms of economy, way of life and as a place where we want to live, raise families and work. The answer is "Yes", but it is not simple to join all of that up. Taking my own county, County Donegal, as an example, 30% of people aged between 19 and 35 have left Donegal over the last three years and have emigrated because they were not able to get employment locally. Some of them went to Dublin and Galway, but the vast majority emigrated overseas and that is very sad. The same can be said of many parts of rural Ireland. While there is some economic revitalisation occurring in the country, the vast majority of that is here in Dublin. No one would begrudge Dublin that. It is great from an overall economic point of view. However, the fact remains that rural Ireland is on its knees at the moment. </p>
          <p eId="para_143"> I believe it was a grave mistake on the Government's part not to have a Minister with full responsibility for rural affairs at the Cabinet table. I believe that the Minister of State, Deputy Phelan, should have been promoted to the Cabinet straight up because there is a need for every decision being made by every Department to be rural-proofed, whether that is the roll-out of broadband, sewerage schemes, funding for roads or whatever. </p>
          <p eId="para_144"> The commission for economic development could be beneficial for rural Ireland, or for an economist it could be very negative. The economist will carry out a blanket cost-benefit analysis of a road investment and say "No, there are not enough people living there." That is the way the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport and the National Roads Authority operate. They carry out a cost-benefit analysis and the result hinges on where people live. Unfortunately, very often economic decisions are detrimental to rural Ireland. To give some examples of issues people have been raising, and I am sure the Minister of State is well aware of them: there have been over 140 Garda stations closed during the lifetime of this Government; the agricultural disadvantaged areas scheme has been cut; the school transport charges, while not seemingly significant, have had an impact; as has the ending in 2012 of the CLÁR programme to help rural areas top up road grants. </p>
          <p eId="para_145"> The availability of broadband in rural Ireland is pitiful from a European point of view. In Europe, broadband is available at every street corner and crossroads in most countries. We do not have that here. In parts of rural Ireland there is absolutely no broadband available. I blame the operators for that, but I would also blame the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources. On a number of occasions in this House I have raised a matter where there was funding available under the last rural development programme for the provision of broadband to 12,500 rural properties which were not serviced. There was €13.5 million coming from Europe and €3.5 million from the Government but the money was not drawn down. It went back to Europe. That was a disgrace and I ask the Minister of State to investigate why that happened. Was a Minister or an official responsible? Whoever was responsible for the decision, whether a civil servant, a public servant or a Minister, should hang their head in shame. Money that is available like that should not go back, it should be rolled out. </p>
          <p eId="para_146"> With e-learning and e-business, the opportunities to work from home have never been greater, but that cannot happen in rural Ireland. I cannot get broadband in my own house even though it is only 1.5 km from a village, and 90% of people in the parish where I live cannot obtain broadband. I do not think that is right. Eircom and all of the providers say it would be different if they had access to that money and I spoke to all of the providers who could have provided the service. If they had access to the money that was available, they would have provided the service and I have letters to prove it from the suppliers. </p>
          <p eId="para_147"> There are serious questions, and we have to learn. If anything is to come from this report, it needs to happen right at the top. Whichever Government is in power, there needs to be Government accountability that we are going to proof every decision. That proofing must take place from an economic point of view because the taxpayer needs to have economic accountability and to know that when money is spent it is spent well and not recklessly. We must also ensure that if there is money to be spent, a person living in a rural area should have the same access to State services as a person living in the city. Very often it is more economically viable for the private sector to provide services in a city or an urban setting anyway, so maybe the State should be focusing on the provision of services in rural areas to provide the same level of service right across the board.</p>
          <p eId="para_148">I think the Minister will find it difficult to meet the challenge head-on. We could go across each Department and look at the distances people have to travel to get services, but we do not have time today. We could speak about the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport, the Department of Health or any other Department. I will give an example. Last year, the Department of Health examined individuals who were applying for motorised transport grants. This relates to the disability allowance, for which the Department of Social Protection is responsible. I know that in three or four cases in County Donegal involving individuals in wheelchairs who needed to be assessed at different times, the Department wanted them to come to Dublin for their assessments. The departmental officials would not go to County Donegal because they did not have enough people to assess on the same day. It is absolutely crazy to ask an individual who is basically paralysed to come to Dublin for a medical assessment which should be carried out by the State in County Donegal. Things like this do not even cost money to repair. The State should have a joined-up policy across each Department of providing the same level of service to every citizen, regardless of where he or she lives. It is as simple as that. The Minister of State will have to contend with this challenge. I wish her well. She has my full support in her endeavours. I know she faces a challenging task.</p>

        <speech by="#MichaelComiskey" eId="spk_58">
          <from>Senator Michael Comiskey<recordedTime time="2014-11-19T14:30:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_149">I welcome the Minister of State to the House. I congratulate her on her new position in rural development. The Commission for the Economic Development of Rural Areas, CEDRA, is a voluntary body that was established in November 2012 by the Ministers for the Environment, Community and Local Government and Agriculture, Food and the Marine. The objective of the commission is to develop a strategy to guide the medium-term economic development of rural areas for the period up to 2025.</p>
          <p eId="para_150"> Rural areas are defined for these purposes as "all areas located beyond the administrative boundaries of the five largest cities". All parts of the country have suffered greatly during the past few years of recession, but none more so than the rural areas that have been badly affected by unemployment and emigration. Unemployment in rural areas increased by 192% during the recession, whereas it increased by 114% in urban areas. Small and medium-sized towns were the worst affected locations. The high poverty index in rural towns dictated that one third of working-age households were rendered jobless. In small towns business after business was forced to close and main streets were left desolate and empty. While our country has emerged from recession, thankfully, rural areas are not feeling the current economic bounce as strongly as other areas. The recommendations resulting from the CEDRA report seek to remedy this. I hope this happens.</p>
          <p eId="para_151"> The vision statement in the CEDRA report states that "Rural Ireland will become a dynamic, adaptable and outward looking multi-sectoral economy supporting vibrant, resilient and diverse communities experiencing a high quality of life with an energised relationship between rural and urban Ireland which will contribute to its sustainability for the benefit of society as a whole". This objective can be achieved through the support of the Government and the implementation of the recommendations set out in the report. The report contains 34 recommendations to help stimulate rural economies, including: the preparation of a rural economic development policy statement; the assignation of ministerial responsibility for implementation; the encouragement of better joined-up activities by Departments, State agencies and enterprise bodies; the facilitation of bottom-up development of rural economic development zones and a rural towns stimulus programme; the improvement of rural capacity by improving skills and capacity, widening broadband capacity and enhancing services such as rural transport, roads, finance and water; the specific examination of areas like tourism, creative industries, social enterprise, artisan foods, marine and renewable energy to see how they can be leveraged to energise rural areas; and the maximisation of the potential of available funding mechanisms to support economic development in rural areas.</p>
          <p eId="para_152"> I commend the Government on the work it has already done to further this aim. The CEDRA report was launched in April of this year. The Taoiseach appointed a Minister of State with specific responsibility for the implementation of CEDRA in July. An interdepartmental group was appointed to achieve a more co-ordinated and integrated approach to the delivery of economic services in rural areas. The first meeting of this group took place in July, when an initial evaluation of each recommendation of the report was carried out and lead responsibility was assigned. A clear brief was requested and received from each Department regarding what was being done. The group then dealt with details and timelines relating to more specific actions and to what will be achieved by the end of 2015. The Minister of State and the members of the interdepartmental group met representatives of Enterprise Ireland, IDA Ireland, Teagasc, local employment offices and local community development committees to secure their involvement in the CEDRA work programme and to develop ideas. A sub-group of the CEDRA interdepartmental group has developed a number of priority proposals with clear implementation actions to assist the economic development of rural towns and their hinterlands. The intention is to pilot a small number of initiatives to assess their viability and effectiveness in creating employment in rural towns in the short and medium terms.</p>
          <p eId="para_153"> I welcome the allocation of €1 million in the 2015 budget for the establishment of a rural innovation and development fund to support initiatives and small-scale pilot incentives under the CEDRA report. The provision of this stimulus funding will greatly assist this task. I welcome the Government's commitment to encourage and facilitate the continued development of rural areas. This funding is part of a wider comprehensive framework to support economic development in rural areas, including major elements of the draft rural development programme, the seafood development investment programme and the wider enterprise, capability and community development initiatives. The CEDRA report has an important role to play in further developing rural areas and helping them to prosper. Recent rural initiatives such as the Wild Atlantic Way and the proposed 1916 commemorations have again highlighted the potential of our rural areas. It is important that we do everything in our power to support our rural areas and help them to prosper. I thank the Minister of State again for coming to House. I acknowledge the work that the Minister of State and her Department have done to further the objectives of the report. I look forward to hearing further details of the progress being made by the Minister of State and the interdepartmental group in the coming weeks.</p>

          <from>Senator Feargal Quinn<recordedTime time="2014-11-19T14:30:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_154">I welcome the Minister of State. I am delighted to have her in the House. It was great to hear about the enthusiasm with which she has grabbed hold of this challenge. She said earlier that "rural areas are not looking for a hand-out but they most definitely need a hand-up". We need to hear those sorts of words. Before I was elected to this House, I was a member of a partnership in a small town, the aim of which was to bring business and life back into that town. I remember going to a meeting of the partnership and being disappointed that everybody else seemed to be thinking we should ask Dublin to send a State agency down to do things for us. I said "No" and pointed out that we needed somebody to clean the windows of our supermarket. I remember that a young man set up a business with a bicycle, a bucket and a ladder. There was no charge for the water. He succeeded and sold that business on. The person who had been cleaning the windows was coming from outside the town. When I said we could do with fresh vegetables, somebody else set up a little lettuce plant in his back garden. If we telephoned him from our supermarket at 4 p.m. to say we were running short of lettuce, he would bring some lettuce down to us. I mention this because there seems to be a danger that people think the best thing to do is call on the State to do something for them, whereas the important element of what we are doing is to give people a hand so that they can do these things for themselves.</p>
          <p eId="para_155"> I certainly welcome the report. I am glad it calls for a support pathway to help rural businesses and small-scale food producers. While I do not want to repeat what is outlined in the report, I will mention a couple of other ideas contained in it. The report calls for a target stimulus programme to help rural towns get back on their feet. I have been involved in such initiatives in a number of towns, one of which is Drogheda. When I did a television series in Drogheda, it was interesting that someone from outside the town could ask whether those involved in many things had ever thought of approaching them in a certain way.</p>
          <p eId="para_156">The different traders were not talking to one another. Drogheda is a large town and not a rural one. </p>
          <p eId="para_157"> What we really need to do in rural town centres is to look at a different way of doing things. We should aim to set the conditions so that our rural towns are home to small, vibrant and original retailers. To do this, there should be some incentives for small retailers to set up shops in Dublin, for instance. Walking around the streets of Vienna, it was amazing to see tiny restaurants seating ten people, specialty record shops and shop windows displaying handmade furniture. The Austrians set a low rent and a fixed rate in order for these small and unique businesses to survive. If they paid normal rates, they would not be viable.</p>
          <p eId="para_158"> In France, rural towns are known as places where one can find an amazing selection of butchers, bakers and fishmongers. Some towns and villages in Ireland are thriving because they have indigenous retailers rather than the chains from the big cities. If our rural towns were able to be home to such a diversity of shops, I think they would attract more people. Customers are now very attracted to this type of aspirational shopping and we need specialty retailers to fill the gaps in the market. Indeed, it could be argued that centuries ago, our rural towns had a mixture of workshops, craftsmen and merchants and we should get back to this concept. In some towns, one sees shops which are owned by families and which are not part of a chain. The report's recommendation that incentives should be given to retailers to occupy vacant properties could really play a part. </p>
          <p eId="para_159"> To stimulate footfall in our rural towns, we really need to tackle parking charges. We have a massive problem of customers being put off shopping in towns due to over-vigorous traffic wardens and clampers. I went to Edenderry in County Offaly with a television show and it was just so sad to see the big supermarkets on the outside of town with the centre of the town devastated. Senator Landy coaxed me to Carrick-on-Suir some time ago and one could see that the people there were getting together to do something. We should allow people one hour free parking to get them into the towns to shop using disc parking. In Belgium, most towns and cities have a blue zone in the city centres which gives people a maximum of two hours free parking. People carry a simple parking disc in their cars on which they can display what time they parked their cars. It allows the traffic warden to see clearly how long one has been parked. A culture change like this would increase everybody's confidence and would encourage people back to towns and villages. This is a very sensible and straightforward solution, which could simplify and stimulate business and bring some life back to our rural towns.</p>
          <p eId="para_160"> I will give another example, which I call rural tourism, or agritourism. It is called <i>agriturismo</i> in Italy. The report points to opportunities for rural tourism in many parts of the country as it is under-exploited. It also states that this area is particularly suited to local authorities, which have more development responsibility now. I would like to give one concrete example, the model of <i>agriturismo,</i> which has worked so well in Italy. It is the basic idea of a small farm offering accommodation and a unique experience to tourists. When I was around 19 years of age, I was involved with Comhar Taisteal, a co-operative travel group which did a deal with CIE to get people down to west Cork. The train would take people to the nearest station and the farmer would meet them with his horse and cart and take them to the farm where they would stay. For city dwellers, it was a joy to see how country people worked and lived. This could be done with a small cheese-making farm with a few beds and tourists willing to pay a premium for the experience. </p>
          <p eId="para_161"> What they found in Italy was that this sort of rural tourism was extremely lucrative. These types of tourists are willing to pay three or four times more for this sort of different or authentic experience. Just imagine the potential for rural Ireland. These <i>agriturismo </i>farms get support at the national and EU levels. We should examine this model in Ireland and perhaps the <i>agriturismo</i> idea from Italy might fit in well with this if it was done in a rural area. </p>
          <p eId="para_162"> There are so many farms here which could offer the authentic Irish farm experience, where tourist could enjoy something different and even help out on the farm. If that was done successfully in one part of the country, it could provide a national model. Consider the Dutch and the German tourists, who would love to see this type of Ireland. What about all the American tourists who do not want to stay in a regular chain hotel? We have nothing similar to the Italian <i>agriturismo</i> here and the Minister of State could look closely at that model. Would there be funds available to help people along the line? </p>
          <p eId="para_163"> The other idea I have is that it is worth looking at countries like New Zealand. New Zealand has been very successful in developing and marketing its food products worldwide. We must look at the continuing growth of the agrifood sector in the context of the growing demand from regions such as Asia. We must listen to the customer and adapt our agricultural produce to that demand. The New Zealand dairy company Fonterra makes products specifically for the Chinese market and to cater for the particular customer tastes there. The Minister has just come back from China and I am sure we are moving in that direction but why are companies in Ireland not adopting this approach, innovating and developing similar products to the same degree as New Zealand? I do not think we are tailoring our products. To really compete abroad, we need to do more of this. </p>
          <p eId="para_164"> As dairy consumption goes through the roof, Fonterra is establishing dairy farms in China. I understand that Irish producers have to import milk to keep up with the demand for products like infant formula in China. Our dairy products are the best in the world but we seem to be lagging behind in exploiting some of these markets. They are just some of the ideas. </p>
          <p eId="para_165"> Over the past couple of years, I had the opportunity to travel around the country with television programmes and it has been a joy to see the success stories, but it has been sad to see those who have not succeeded, so let us manage to give them a hand up. I loved what the Minister of State said that they do not want a hand out but need a hand up and I think she is the very person who will give them that hand up.</p>

          <from>Senator Denis Landy<recordedTime time="2014-11-19T14:40:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_166">I welcome the Minister of State and am delighted she was appointed to this very important position. We go back a long way as we served on the regional authority together many years ago. Even at that time, she was very strong in regard to the development of rural Ireland.</p>
          <p eId="para_167"> I welcome the publication of the CEDRA report earlier this year. Along with the Minister of State, I attended a number of meetings with the chief proponent of the report, Pat Spillane, to discuss it. What we have now are 34 recommendations which the Minister of State is tasked with implementing. That is an impossible job and I do not think she will implement the 34 recommendations in the timeframe given to her so it is important she fine tunes what it is intended to do over the next 18 months - the lifetime of this Government.</p>
          <p eId="para_168"> There was a fantastic report in 1999, which was brought to a White Paper by the late Noel Davern, but which ended up on a shelf. The only thing that was implemented from that White Paper was that it opened up education and training for people in the understanding of rural development. I am pleased to say that I qualified for funding and did my diploma in rural development in UCC as a result of that White Paper but very little else came from it. I do not want to see the same thing happen with the CEDRA report. </p>
          <p eId="para_169"> Will the Minister of State set up a task force on rural development? I greatly respect every civil servant in this country and in this House. Currently, an inter-departmental group is dealing with this but with the greatest respect to the people on it, when this Government is gone and when the Members of this House are gone, we will still have the inter-departmental group. What we need is a task force which will bring in outside bodies to implement what is in the CEDRA report, such as the business people about whom Senator Quinn spoke and the people who represent rural Ireland and who are elected at local level like the Minister of State and myself in a previous life.</p>
          <p eId="para_170">We know what needs to be done, which is implementation of the report. Having meetings to identify the issues will not get us beyond where we are at present. The Minister of State is charged, as I heard her state recently at an event in Carrick-on-Suir, with everything outside the farm gate in rural Ireland. This is a massive task, but I believe she is well up to it. I wish to raise a number of issues which the task force could very well address in a positive and tangible way. I do not believe further consultation or discussion is necessary. We need Ministers and Departments to buy into the initiatives which the Minister of State wants to bring forward and provide budgets for her. A working budget of €1 million has been allocated which is fine and will see some pilot projects established, but in real terms, given what needs to be done, €1 million is a very small amount of money.</p>
          <p eId="para_171"> We should examine places where this has been done well. Senator Quinn mentioned towns in rural Ireland, and I will specifically mention Westport. A representative from Westport was at the seminar in Carrick-on-Suir which the Minister State also attended. Speaking to that person and others who are knowledgeable, the net result of how Westport has developed is not alone that most of the people who live in Westport and the surrounding areas are employed, but 800 people go to work in Westport every day. This is a staggering figure. Almost this many people leave my town of Carrick-on-Suir to go to work every day. What does Westport have which other parts of the country do not? It has an urban planner, specifically employed to ensure every development in the town is for the greater good of the town as an entity and not just for the individual establishing it. We need to consider this concept for the rest of the country. We also need to examine shop closures. We had an urban renewal scheme in the 1990s, which was referred to as section 83. It did some good work, but many of the ideas and concepts coming out of it did not address the bigger picture of keeping town centres vibrant and alive.</p>
          <p eId="para_172"> A number of years ago, 2006 if I recall correctly, Senator Quinn visited Carrick-on-Suir. He stated a roof should be put on the main street of the town. I remember people at the function were aghast, and he was called many things, such as a mad hatter, for saying it, but it caused massive debate in the town for weeks afterwards on what we could do for ourselves to give us an extra edge. Concepts and ideas such as this make small towns stand out.</p>
          <p eId="para_173"> I tabled a Private Members' motion 12 months ago on the revitalisation of rural towns. Among the issues we spoke about was pop-up shops. To this day no legislation is in place to govern them. A local authority turns a blind eye for three or four months until somebody in the town objects. We could legislate for this and it would not require too much. We could also examine concentrated urban renewal, and by urban I mean rural towns. We have seen cosy deals done on planning on the fringes of towns where, depending on who owned the land and how well he or she was connected politically, the land was rezoned. We have seen supermarkets being built outside towns. We have taken initiatives on parking. In my town one has 15 minutes free parking on the main street which allows one to go to the bank, newsagents, butchers or another shop to do a small bit of shopping and get back to the car before one is penalised. In Thurles one has free parking on Saturday afternoons. Precedents have been set throughout the country which could be implemented more widely. Speaking about these issues here will not change the fate of rural Ireland. Many of these measures would not cost money but they need to be implemented.</p>
          <p eId="para_174"> I welcome the fact Eircom will roll out high-quality broadband in 66 regions throughout the country. I also welcome the fact the ESB has received approval from the EU to roll out broadband to 500,000 houses. However, 700,000 houses, many of which are in rural Ireland, will not come under these schemes. We need to examine how to address this because it needs to be addressed.</p>
          <p eId="para_175"> We must also consider tourism in rural Ireland as there are many opportunities. I met the Minister, Deputy Donohoe, recently about a concept I brought forward which I termed "the GAA way". The concept is to build a product around the history and culture of the GAA, starting in Thurles, where the organisation was founded in Hayes Hotel, and then perhaps moving to peripheries such as Kilkenny. The concept would involve the 32 counties and ensure places which are not known to tourists could become part of a tourist product. The Minister, Deputy Donohoe, was very interested in the concept, but as he explained it, at present our tourism has two legs of a stool, which are Dublin and the Wild Atlantic Way. I put it to him the third leg should be the GAA way, which would give an opportunity to parts of rural Ireland where the GAA plays an intrinsic role, such as Kilkenny, Tipperary and Roscommon, to build a product from county level to national level. Throughout the world 500 million people claim Irish descent and almost 400 GAA clubs exist outside the country. These include clubs celebrating five, ten, 15 or 20 years of existence. This alone is a product. Will the Minister of State examine this concept? We must build on ideas such as this to develop rural Ireland. I wish the Minister of State well in her task, which will not be easy. From today I ask her to establish a task force. Interdepartmental groups will come and go, but a task force including all elements required to develop rural Ireland will be a success story.</p>

        <speech by="#TrevorOClochartaigh" eId="spk_61">
          <from>Senator Trevor Ó Clochartaigh<recordedTime time="2014-11-19T14:50:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_176">Cuirim céad fáilte roimh an Aire Stáit. Táim thar a bheith sásta go bhfuil sí anseo agus tá sé thar a bheith tábhachtach go mbeidh an díospóireacht seo againn. Fáiltím go mór roimh a ceapúchán. I very much welcome the position which has been created and that we have a Minister of State with responsibility for rural affairs as it is very important. However, I must say the budget of €1 million is pitiful in the broader context, if, for example, one considers how much has been spent on consultants in Irish Water, which is €86 million. If rural Ireland is such a priority for the Government, the fact it can earmark only €1 million for it is quite pitiful.</p>
          <p eId="para_177"> All of the recommendations in CEDRA are commendable, and nothing among them surprised anybody involved in rural Ireland or development. The biggest issues are job creation and service provision. I do not see enough in the report on these and much more needs to be done. One cannot go into too much detail on every recommendation in a debate such as this, but because the interdepartmental group meets regularly and the Minister of State has updates on its specific recommendations, perhaps she could make a document available to us on what has been done and what has not on each specific recommendation in order that we can keep track of it.</p>
          <p eId="para_178"> The strategy on youth in rural areas could be beefed up. There is a lack of facilities. It is great if one is into the GAA or other sports, but if one is not there is a dearth of activities and facilities for young people in rural areas, which is raised regularly in the House as an issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_179"> I am interested to hear rural-proofing is being done in a meaningful way. Perhaps the Minister of Stage can tell us a little more about how this is being done. What framework is being used? How is it being measured and put into practice? Rather than asking somebody working on a strategy to include a paragraph or two about rural Ireland and calling it rural-proofed, is there a framework for rural-proofing?</p>
          <p eId="para_180"> I am not as optimistic as my colleagues with regard to rural broadband. On 9 May 2011 a statement was issued by the then Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, Deputy Pat Rabbitte, announcing a new rural broadband scheme to identify the remaining individual premises in rural Ireland unable to obtain broadband and ensure universal broadband access was provided in Ireland by the end of 2012. We are still waiting, which speaks for itself.</p>
          <p eId="para_181">I am concerned that another report will state there will be a time lag and that rural areas will still be trying to catch up, at which time we will already be contemplating the next phase of broadband. The CEDRA report makes specific reference to fibre delivery to rural towns. Perhaps the Minister of State could give us a note on that. What is the plan? Is there a list of the towns under consideration?</p>
          <p eId="para_182"> A significant issue arises regarding rural transport and centralisation in this regard. Rural hackney licences have been mentioned. How many such licences have been issued at this stage? I do not know anybody who has one, nor do I know whether there is much take-up or how useful the arrangement will be.</p>
          <p eId="para_183"> Another part of the backdrop is the cuts to the community and voluntary sector. There have been cuts of up to 40% or 50% in most parts of the sector. This has had a detrimental impact. It has had a bigger impact in rural areas than in urban areas. There have been closures of social welfare offices under the Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Joan Burton. This has had a big impact in rural areas also. It was a very retrograde step.</p>
          <p eId="para_184"> With regard to the specific recommendations, there is talk of rural economic development zones. Have these been identified? If not, how will they be identified? Recommendation No. 6 concerns the rural towns stimulus programme, which was mentioned. Has this been developed? If not, when? How does the Minister of State intend to proceed in this regard?</p>
          <p eId="para_185"> Recommendation No. 7 is on the national spatial strategy. Do we have a national spatial strategy? If so, how will it affect rural areas?</p>
          <p eId="para_186"> Recommendation No. 8 concerns the new Enterprise Ireland and IDA Ireland unit. A steering committee is to be set up to address rural targets. Has it been set up? If not, when will it happen? It is mentioned here regularly.</p>
          <p eId="para_187"> Recommendations Nos. 11 and 7, in particular, point to the elephant in the room in terms of rural development. I was part of a Leader programme delegation to Brussels yesterday. There are very serious concerns among the Leader and local development companies, which are the backbone of most of the development that needs to be carried out in rural areas. Many of the targets and plans in the CEDRA report would need to be linked to those companies. The delegation I was part of met Commission representatives yesterday and they told us they have written to the Government here because they have over 400 questions on the proposed implementation of the Leader programme here that they want answered because they are not happy with the way it is approaching it.</p>
          <p eId="para_188"> The delegation included members from the trade unions, the companies and political representatives from across the spectrum, all of whom are very concerned with the way in which the Leader programme companies are being subsumed into the local authorities. They believe power is being taken away from them and that there is a lack of consultation on this process. This must be addressed. SIPTU is being stonewalled by the Department, which will not meet regarding the transfer of undertakings and the workers in the companies. We face circumstances in which 36 development companies will be shrunk to 28 local area groups. This almost dictates there will be only 28 companies. The counties most affected will be rural counties such as Galway, Mayo, Donegal, Tipperary and Kerry. Could the Minister of State comment on that? Does she agree with the policy? I actually do not agree with the recommendation in the CEDRA report that we should centralise local development under the local authorities. It is a hugely retrograde step and it flies in the face of the concept of community development from the ground up. It will not save any money.</p>
          <p eId="para_189"> Yesterday, we met representatives from the European network for regional development, who gauge the Leader companies across Europe. They told the Balkan states the Irish model that we have had until now is the prime model to follow and that every other country should follow it. However, we are regressing due to the changes that have been brought in. This is the elephant in the room.</p>
          <p eId="para_190"> Is the Government aware of the 400 questions the Commission has sent to the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government on the Leader programme? If so, to what areas do they pertain and how serious are they? Will the Minister of State ask the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Alan Kelly, to consider seriously the other botch-up by his predecessor, Mr. Phil Hogan, namely, the downgrading and dismantling of the Leader sector and local development companies? I have many more questions. I hope to write to the Minister of State and put them to her in due course. Perhaps we will have more debates on rural affairs.</p>

          <from>Senator Pat O'Neill<recordedTime time="2014-11-19T15:00:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_191">I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Ann Phelan, to the House. The two of us were elected for the first time in 2004 in the same electoral area, Thomastown in County Kilkenny. We were again elected in 2009. When she was elected to the Dáil in 2011, I was elected to the Seanad six weeks later. However, I have not been offered a Ministry since she was appointed Minister of State.</p>
          <p eId="para_192"> This is an important debate because 60% of our population of 4.6 million is rural. The report is important because there is more to Ireland than Dublin. Professor Suzi Jarvis of CEDRA spoke at a conference in October 2013 and stated:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_193"> If we are to pull Ireland out of recession faster, and also reduce the brain drain leaving the country to seek out work, then we now need to home in on the regions. We need to provide 'on the ground' supports for people in rural communities. This is so they can create ideas and spot opportunities to develop enterprises. The positive spin-offs could be new job creation at the local level, taking people off the dole, and generating local wealth that feeds back into rural economies.</p>
          <p eId="para_194"> As I said, our population is mostly rural. As the Minister of State and others pointed out in this House, rural Ireland suffered more than any other region during our economic decline in recent years. As has been said, there was a 192% increase in unemployment in rural areas by comparison with a 114% increase in urban centres.</p>
          <p eId="para_195"> Many have pointed out what keeps rural Ireland going. People have said that €1 million in a fund may not be much, but it is very important that the Minister of State, who has connections with up to seven Departments and Ministers, lobby for moneys in other areas.</p>
          <p eId="para_196"> SMEs employ 134,000 people directly, and 250,000 when indirect employment is accounted for. It is just not a matter of big companies such as Google and Facebook, which are necessary, because we should consider also the number of people employed overall by SMEs that employ under ten people each. The Government has tried to support these SMEs. It is important that resources return to rural Ireland. One cannot locate a company such as Google or Intel in the middle of a rural area because infrastructure is required but an SME can set up there.</p>
          <p eId="para_197"> Financial supports have been announced by the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Richard Bruton, including access to credit through the micro-finance fund, into which €90 million has been placed for small businesses. The fund will result in the giving of loans of €25,000 to people setting up a new business. The credit guarantee scheme will guarantee credit. There is a fund of €450 million and 75% is guaranteed to banks. Therefore, if people get credit, 75% is guaranteed by the Government. Therefore, it may be easier for people to gain access to credit.</p>
          <p eId="para_198"> The crucial issue, which many have touched on today, is broadband. Unless we can get proper broadband into rural areas, we will not attract SMEs, industry or jobs. The report states all broadband speeds should be up to 30 Mb by the end of 2015. I hope that is not a dream. I welcome the Government investment programme for broadband. Senator Landy pointed out that 700,000 homes may not be able to avail of the investment. It is important that the Minister of State lobby the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources to continue with the rolling out broadband to rural areas. The only major piece of infrastructure built in the country in the past few years has been at Newlands Cross. It is important that infrastructure be built in rural areas also and that roads be improved.</p>
          <p eId="para_199"> Water is always in the news. Unless we have access to clean water, we will not able to attract businesses. Intel is the biggest user of water in County Kildare. In County Kilkenny, when the county council and IDA Ireland invested €12 million in a new water scheme for the south of the county, it resulted in the Belview plant for Glanbia, which will employ 2,500 people directly and indirectly. That is supporting rural Ireland. It is important, therefore, that infrastructure be made available.</p>
          <p eId="para_200"> I did not get to mention tourism. We have to support regional airports and get people out of Dublin. We have to support the airports at Knock, Shannon, Kerry and Cork to ensure people come out-----</p>

          <p eId="para_206">I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Phelan, who is a colleague of mine. I concur with my colleague, Senator Landy, that the Minister of State had a lot to do and very little time in which to do it. I agree with colleagues who suggest that €1 million funding for her project is not sufficient and she should look for more.</p>
          <p eId="para_207"> Towns in Roscommon were very badly hit as a result of the recession. I refer to towns such as Castlerea, Boyle, Strokestown and in particular, my own town of Ballaghadereen. We had a beautiful hotel which closed down, including its leisure facilities. A meat factory was closed down and many pubs and shops closed. Too many houses were built during the so-called good times with the result that we have too many ghost housing estates. In one housing estate 20 vacant houses were demolished last week as a result of funding provided at the time by Deputy Jan O'Sullivan who was the Minister of State. </p>
          <p eId="para_208"> There needs to be a new way of thinking with regard to rates which is a very significant issue. In my opinion rates should be calculated on the basis of turnover and profit and not on the square footage of a building. Some months ago I met with a delegation of publicans from Galway and Roscommon. They told me that this is being piloted at a snail's pace. Some of the rural pubs are paying a lot less and some of the urban pubs are paying a lot more. As the Minister of State will appreciate, the punters are out on the street in Shop Street in Galway, for example, in front of the pubs. These pubs could be the same size of square footage as a pub in Senator Ó Clochartaigh's area which would only have two punters in the bar at night and that pub pays the same level of rates as the pubs in Shop Street. This issue needs to be dealt with as a matter of urgency because rates are the difference between a business staying open or closing and this is happening every day of the week.</p>
          <p eId="para_209"> The local authorities give no leeway with regard to payment of rates. They are not interested in the alternative. I refer to the instance of the hotel in my town. Fifty jobs could be created if it were to re-open but there is no joined-up thinking between Departments. There should be a mechanism to allow the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation to talk to the local authorities and suggest that the hotel could be given a rates holiday for a year or a year and a half, until its business is established. At the end of the day that hotel will take 50 people off the dole.</p>
          <p eId="para_210"> There is much talk about the closure of small post offices. A total of 193 post offices were closed down in Fianna Fáil's time. Eleven have closed down under this Government but these were not forced closures; they were closed down because nobody was willing to take up the mantle and run the post office. I ask the Minister of State to bring my recommendation on post offices to the Minister, Deputy Burton. The Department of Social Protection is encouraging as many people as possible to provide details of their bank accounts for the household benefits package but there is no option for people to use the post offices. We need to give more business to the post offices in order to keep rural Ireland alive. </p>
          <p eId="para_211"> The positive aspects with regard to my town are that we have solid employers and the BMW assembly which has been given funding of €100 million by the EU Commissioner, Phil Hogan. We have the Western Development Commission and we are probably one of the nearest towns to Knock airport which is a selling point. We are developing a tourism package which is branded as Lakes and Legends. I have sought a meeting with the Minister of State next week so that I can bring to her attention that the Western Development Commission is prepared to come on side with us in an effort to revitalise towns. I suggest that we could use Ballaghadereen as a pilot project. </p>
          <p eId="para_212"> Development levies are far too high in counties like Roscommon. The new building regulations introduced by the then Minister, Phil Hogan, mean that building a one-off house could cost 25% more than in the past. These regulations are not progressive and I ask that the Minister of State should speak to the Minister, Deputy Alan Kelly, in this regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_213"> In the areas of social inclusion and mental health I suggest that dedicated funding should be provided to the Men's Sheds projects and the rural men's projects. I brought the Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Joan Burton, to view one of these rural men's projects in Taughmaconnell recently and she was very impressed with the work they do.</p>
          <p eId="para_214"> We need to review our wind energy policy and move away from wind farms which are not productive. We will end up with ghost wind farms in the same way as we ended up with ghost housing estates.</p>

          <from>Senator Paul Bradford<recordedTime time="2014-11-19T15:10:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_215">I welcome the Minister of State to the House. I support the comments of my colleagues about this report. How could anyone oppose a genuine effort to promote and expand rural Ireland? However, we must concede that we have heard it all before. This might be a newly-commissioned report but all these suggestions have been made down the years but sadly, most have not been acted upon.</p>
          <p eId="para_216"> I will dwell on the broad aspects of how we might regenerate, renew and rebuild rural Ireland. I will reflect upon the word "rebuild". There is a national housing crisis which is almost beyond description in the capital city of Dublin and in most of our large urban areas. However, across the length and breadth of our rural communities there are half-built houses, abandoned houses, derelict sites and unused planning permissions. It is very disappointing that we have yet to put in place a comprehensive national housing structure to marry some of those problems into a singular solution. Rural resettlement programmes have worked quite well but it is not fair to expect that 50,000 or 60,000 Dublin people on the housing list will all want to move to Cork or Kilkenny or to Waterford or Leitrim. However, hundreds of families would be interested in such a move. This is a matter for the Minister of State with responsibility for housing but also for the Minister of State, Deputy Ann Phelan, who has responsibility for rural development.</p>
          <p eId="para_217"> If we can rebuild our rural communities with people then trade, commerce and job opportunities can follow. The housing aspect must be reflected upon. Did anyone think ten or 15 years ago that we would now be in a position of driving around smaller rural Irish towns and villages where housing estates which are completed or partially built are on the verge of being knocked down? This is a tragedy which stemmed from Celtic tiger excess. Rather than allowing it to remain a tragedy we should try to see it as part of the solution by way of a more integrated national housing policy. This is not the brief of the Minister of State but she must be concerned about the population drift and expansion on the east coast which is a serious problem. I recall one of our former colleagues, Joe O'Toole, speaking on a few occasions about electoral laws and electoral provision and that the constitutional requirement of Oireachtas representation of one Deputy for 120,000 people should be amended to reflect that in some western counties the reduction in population and the reduction in the number of Dáil seats is providing a very unbalanced type of representation for those regions.</p>
          <p eId="para_218"> Agriculture has always been and will continue to be the most significant employer in rural Ireland. Colleagues referred to the revised and now almost entirely complete Common Agricultural Policy reform programme. I am on the record of the House as expressing disappointment that we did not use that opportunity to make a clear defined statement about the future of farming families and in particular, about the future of small farms and the families who live on them. We all welcome the annual investments from Europe of billions of euro into Irish agriculture. We must be deeply concerned at the continuing reduction in the number of farming families.</p>
          <p eId="para_219">That stems directly from Government decisions and European decisions, and we are the authors of those decisions. It is not something we can blame others for. As part of the Common Agricultural Policy we need to decide what future we want for rural areas, including how many farming families should remain. We then need to introduce policies and supports to meet our aspirations in that regard. The report contains many very valid ideas. Securing agriculture is fine, but we also need to secure the number of farming families. That is crucial to the development of rural areas.</p>
          <p eId="para_220"> The housing issue including planning and other areas are worthy of substantive separate discussions. I wish the Minister of State well. Her role is interesting and the Government made a good decision in appointing a Minister of State to this area. She will have plenty to occupy her and I wish her well. I believe this report is a help but it is only one part of a much bigger picture.</p>

          <from>Senator Paschal Mooney<recordedTime time="2014-11-19T15:20:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_221">I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Ann Phelan, to the House. This may be her first time in the House and it is certainly my first time to have the opportunity to exchange views with her on her portfolio.</p>
          <p eId="para_222"> The good news is that I echo the welcoming comments made by all sides, including by the previous speaker, about her appointment. It was a very imaginative decision by the Government not only to make the appointment of a Minister of State with responsibility for rural affairs, but also to put Deputy Ann Phelan in the job. That is part of the good news. The other part of the good news is that I welcome the opportunity that Mr. Pat Spillane's taskforce has given us to debate rural issues in the House.</p>
          <p eId="para_223"> However, there is bad news. I am severely constrained in criticising the Government because of my friendship with the Minister of State - both of us served on the British-Irish Parliamentary Assembly. I have tremendous admiration for her and I know she will do a very good job. Senator Ó Domhnaill listed the decisions taken by various Ministries since the Government came into power in 2011 that have severely and adversely impacted on rural areas. I am somewhat constrained in launching an all-out attack because of my admiration for the Minister of State and the mere fact that she is now <i>in situ</i> with responsibility for the area. I wish her every success in that regard. I have no doubt that she will bring her vast experience and expertise to bear. As she comes from Kilkenny from outside a large city, she will understand better than most the challenges faced in this area.</p>
          <p eId="para_224"> Ireland is not unique in terms of the challenges faced by the decline of rural environments. I often cite the French example. Many French villages that were once vibrant now only have a post office and a bakery. There is no heart and soul to such villages and people are living outside. During the Celtic tiger years enormous pressure was brought to bear on Fianna Fáil-led Governments to change the planning laws to accommodate large multinational supermarkets in out-of-town locations to the detriment of the town centres.</p>
          <p eId="para_225"> The Minister of State may have an opportunity to respond to this. I believe rural communities are fighting back. In many cases these challenges are being met by imaginative decisions being taken by local business groups in association with local authorities. For example, Carrick-on-Shannon in County Leitrim has become very prosperous over the past 20 years - the Celtic tiger years were very positive for the town. It was probably the smallest county town in the country. When I was going to school it had a population of approximately 2,000 to 2,500 and it is now approximately 5,000, which gives it a certain critical mass. When I was on Leitrim County Council we used to say that if we had 5,000 people in one centre in the county it represented critical mass because it could then be economically viable. I believe Carrick-on-Shannon has now reached that and it is now a byword for pleasure seeking of a variety of different denominations - in other words hen parties, stag parties and goodness knows what else-----</p>

          <p eId="para_227">----- but the town is doing well.</p>
          <p eId="para_228"> However, there is a real problem in the centre of the town. There has been out-of-town development with Tesco - of which I am not a great fan. I appreciate it is providing jobs. Ultimately one must be aware that one is meeting people every day who work in Tesco. Even though I might not be sympathetic to the corporate image Tesco presents, I appreciate it is providing jobs.</p>
          <p eId="para_229"> I am particularly pleased that Irish-based supermarkets such as SuperValu, Centra and others are succeeding in small towns and are surviving. Small businesses are also surviving primarily through the work of the development companies across the country, the money coming from Leader, etc. That has helped to a large degree.</p>
          <p eId="para_230"> I would be interested to hear the Minister of State outline her priorities for her brief over the remaining time of her tenure and hopefully into the future in terms of how we might address the decline of the centres of towns and villages. That is the challenge for the Minister of State and for everybody else. I would be particularly interested to hear her views on that. Overall I am delighted she got the job. I have no doubt that she will give it 110% and I wish her every success in the world.</p>

          <p eId="para_231">It would be an understatement to say that all the diverse opinions and issues that were raised in this House this afternoon are a reflection of the challenge that I have in addressing the issues in rural areas. As Senator O'Neill said, I am largely responsible for everything outside Dublin, Cork, Limerick and Galway.</p>
          <p eId="para_232"> I understand how the difficulties we have suffered in recent years and the economic downturn has very adversely affected rural areas. I could choose to see the glass half-full or half-empty. As I am very passionate about rural areas and I feel that rural communities want to take part in the recovery, I choose to see the glass half-full. Rural areas need considerable TLC. I am not being naïve about this. I know that there were cuts and that is the reality of the situation in which we live. We need a mature debate about the expectation of services in rural areas. There must be a degree of reality about it. We can have nostalgia around rural areas, but we have to see the real thing as well.</p>
          <p eId="para_233"> I have a big challenge and I welcome all the Senators' very good contributions. It does not matter on what side of the political divide one stands provided there are positive developments for rural areas. Rural communities have huge potential. As I visit those communities I cannot impose a plan on them. As we have seen in recent months, if I came in heavy handed and presented a plan, the first thing people would tell me is that they did not want it and they would protest against it. So I have to work with the communities to get them to develop their own plan so that it is not my plan or that of the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine and certainly not a Dublin-based plan, but their own plan. Then they will hopefully deliver that plan.</p>
          <p eId="para_234">Hopefully, they can deliver their own economic success through that plan and through the integrated approach the Government will take to put those services down into rural Ireland - all that support from the Government - and establish what can be delivered on the other side. As all Members are aware, the Government in itself cannot create jobs but it can create the environment for those jobs, which brings me on to a point mentioned by Senator Landy. It would have been a plus, had I been handed this brief three years ago, and making it a full Ministry the next time certainly would be advantageous. Had this been the case, I could have had a lot more time to engage with rural Ireland but I can only deal with the situation in which I am at present and I will be keeping my foot on the pedal for rural Ireland. I am now the advocate for rural Ireland, for which the clock started ticking when I became the responsible Minister of State four months ago. That is ground zero for me and as to what happens in rural Ireland, I can only begin to count from that point onwards. I cannot keep looking back but must consider the positives in this regard. Moreover, I cannot set up any new structures but must work within the existing ones, which pertain to the integration supports from the Government and the alignment process to which the Senator referred earlier. I have an excellent relationship with the Leader companies and I intend to see that continue into the future.</p>
          <p eId="para_235"> The development of the rural economic development, RED, zones is my priority because I believe that if there is sustainable job creation in rural Ireland, everything else will take care of itself. If one has sustainable jobs in rural Ireland, one will have the users for the post office network, the Garda stations and the local shops. I live my life by the motto "use it or lose it" but all the Government's efforts must be concentrated on particular areas in rural Ireland to ascertain what can be delivered on the other side. The Government is signing off on criteria regarding these RED zones as we speak and they will be decided independently. There will be independent criteria for them and that is how they will be decided. In some ways, this will be similar to the former CLÁR areas in that when a particular zone is decided on, the Government will be able to bring down all the supports available to it to establish how to harness the potential of these particular areas and to examine the job creation element. The Government is considering a number of these areas from the perspective of the potential that exists in the hinterland of some of these development zones. This is because when the Government seeks to do something, it will be important to have selected an area that has the potential to deliver jobs. The Government has not decided on the number of REDs yet but this will be done over the coming weeks. As for a targeted approach, we will undertake some case studies and establish what works and what will not work in some cases. I note there also are learning possibilities arising from what will not work and if mistakes are made, we will not repeat them in other areas. I envisage that the development of the RED zones will be adopted and I will work closely with the local authority structures, that is, with the local community development committees, LCDCs, because a bottom-up approach to the community is being adopted. The Government will get the LCDCs to identify their own rural economic development, RED, zones and see how they can take those plans. They then will have the capability of rolling them out throughout rural Ireland.</p>
          <p eId="para_236"> I must acknowledge that one of the biggest issues in rural Ireland is broadband. Everywhere I go and in each community I visit, the first question and issue to be raised is that of broadband. Consequently, I understand the difficulties people who are trying to set up businesses experience in rural areas and it all depends on the broadband capability. The Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, Deputy White, has an extremely good and highly ambitious plan for the roll-out of broadband in rural Ireland. I can only work with that Department, which has a grand plan in this regard and I believe it will succeed. The Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources tells me that people will be very surprised by how ambitious that plan is. They are tasked with delivering broadband access that does not merely last for the next five to ten years. This is a highly technical subject but rural broadband must be delivered and there must be a network that lasts for 30 years at a minimum, for 50 years in the medium term and in many cases perhaps, even for 100 years. The aforementioned Department is working very hard on this monumental task, which also is a Government priority.</p>
          <p eId="para_237"> To revert to the urban areas, I do not wish to create a "them and us" situation. I do not seek to create a situation in which one shouts across at people in Dublin to claim they have everything, while people in rural Ireland have nothing. I wish to take what are the positives in Dublin and to try to deliver them in rural Ireland. There has been a recurring argument about how the IDA only looks to the very large urban areas and that this is where that agency will deliver the jobs. When broadband is delivered to rural Ireland, the IDA will have much greater flexibility in respect of the companies it can bring there and in some cases, some companies will come because of that rural setting. For example, I refer to the Walsh Whiskey Distillery in Bagenalstown, County Carlow. When that operation is up and running, more than 70 people will be working there full time with a further 25 people working part time. That distillery actively sought a rural setting and consequently, I believe it is up to us and we simply must keep trying much harder.</p>
          <p eId="para_238"> I also believe the situation in rural Ireland is particularly relevant when speaking about tourism and I will give consideration to a lot of tourism initiatives to deliver jobs to rural Ireland. I heard a presentation yesterday from people associated with the greenway in County Mayo on the number of jobs they could deliver there because of the greenway's establishment. Down across the Barrow and Nore valleys, we are seeking to develop a blueway that will deliver jobs for those communities along the River Barrow and tourism is a huge element to what I am doing.</p>
          <p eId="para_239"> In response to the issue raised in respect of the post offices, a committee has been set up on which I will sit, albeit not all the time but at intervals, at which will be represented the Irish Postmasters Union, IPU, and An Post and which will have an independent chair. The Minister, Deputy White, will also sit intermittently on that committee. Its purpose is to consider how a post office network can be delivered and what kind of post office network will exist in five or ten years' time. That committee will undertake some good work and will consider issues such as banking, why people engage in banking transactions and whether they can choose to use the post office. It will involve research and looking across all Departments to ascertain what kind of supports can be given to the post office network, under the constraints that exist, to establish how the Government can deliver and retain the post office network. Personally, I am very passionate about the network because I like to retain that face-to-face service, which has been in place in rural Ireland and which people really like and want. However, there is a responsibility on everyone to use the post office. If supports are given to An Post, people must continue to use the post office because that is the only way in which such offices will be kept open. The co-operative societies also are being studied as they offer a highly innovative way of creating jobs and keeping people in jobs. Senator O'Neill made reference to Glanbia, which as Members are aware began as part of the co-operative movement. Consequently, there also are good and exciting ways in which to examine those societies.</p>
          <p eId="para_240"> There are many varied challenges in respect of rural Ireland and trying to keep it alive.</p>
          <p eId="para_241">Let us look at what happened to tourism during the Celtic tiger years. Ireland was not a place one went for value for money. During that period we did not really care about the tourism industry. That was the case for society as a whole, not necessarily the tourism agencies themselves. When the Government came to office in 2011 we realised that tourism was a vital part of the economy and we put the focus back again on tourism. It did not let us down and has delivered. I would like to think that is what will happen in the case of rural Ireland. We will put our foot back on the pedal again and get the Government to focus support in rural areas and as a result deliver on job creation. Post offices, local schools and other services will flow from job creation. We might have to look at services in a slightly different way but we must be mature about what we can expect.</p>

          <p eId="para_243">I am very pleased to be here this afternoon. This is the first opportunity I have had to address this august Chamber and I look forward to doing so. I also look forward to the engagement this afternoon and the development of our ongoing relationship.</p>
          <p eId="para_244"> I thank Members for the invitation to address the House on the important issues of SME access to finance and financing for growth. The Government has clearly identified SMEs as the lifeblood of the economy and recognises that they play a crucial role in economic and employment growth. The onset of the international financial crisis and the systemic problems within our national banking system, collectively combined with cultural payments issues, all conspired to create an extremely challenging environment for SMEs when it came to accessing finance and prompt payments, which have continued to be an issue for Irish business. Both pre and post-crisis, Irish SMEs are among the most reliant on banking finance in Europe. Consequently, Irish SMEs have been disproportionately exposed to the weaknesses in the banking sector relative to other European countries.</p>
          <p eId="para_245"> Increasingly one hears that, as the economy continues to recover and grow stronger, there will be a focus on financing for growth and a move away from securing finance to simply stay in business. The Government will continue to work across the economy, and through its Departments and agencies, to deliver appropriate programmes that work for the growing SME sector.</p>
          <p eId="para_246"> In my new job I have tried to consider the issues that affect access to finance and financing for growth in a practical way and I will now focus on some of the State supports that are available. First, communications and communication in general are essential. The Government recognises that the array of State funding options can be quite confusing and an SME may, in some cases, not know who to contact. In order to bring some clarity, a "supporting SMEs" online tool has been developed and is live on the local enterprise office website and on various other websites. The tool acts as a signpost, which is very easy to use, comprises eight short filter questions. SMEs are then signposted to some possible State resources and supports that they may be able to avail of. I ask Senators to test the tool because it really is useful, practical and straightforward. </p>
          <p eId="para_247"> Communication of the support environment for SMEs has also been enhanced by the establishment of the network of local enterprise offices, LEOs, that provide a first-stop-shop service for anyone seeking information and support on starting or growing a business in Ireland. The LEOs provide a basis for delivering an improved suite of services to start-ups and small businesses across the country.</p>
          <p eId="para_248"><b>
						</b>In terms of accessing loans, LEOs are also available to assist microenterprises in applying for a Microfinance Ireland loan. It should be borne in mind that companies can get a lower interest rate by applying through their LEO than by applying directly to MFI. We have supported 333 micro enterprises with over €5 million worth of loans up to the end of September. That number is growing all the time. We have also put in place a credit guarantee scheme but its performance has been lower than anticipated. Nevertheless, we have supported 106 companies with over €14.5 million in guaranteed loans as at 14 November. We are working on the legislative process to amend the guarantee scheme to make it more effective in the SME lending market.</p>
          <p eId="para_249"> The Government is committed to ensuring there is a diversified funding market available to SMEs. We also understand that banks have and will continue to play a vital role in supporting SMEs. To this end, where a business has been refused credit by a bank, I would encourage it to lodge an internal appeal and, if necessary, contact the Government's Credit Review Office. Many solutions have been found for SMEs through these mechanisms.</p>
          <p eId="para_250"> Upskilling is very important. If an SME needs to upskill in the area of financial capability, my Department has funded the Finance4Growth programme which is offered by Skillnets through ManagementWorks. It means people can get access to an SME finance expert who will explain the different sources of finance available, guide them to those most relevant to their business, and advise on how banks, investors and agencies make decisions. It is a very practical option that is available to SME owners and managers. It is a free service with the option of a one day finance workshop and a further two hours of mentoring for a small fee.</p>
          <p eId="para_251"> As Members will be aware, the Government has recently established the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland. It is still in infancy but I have high hopes that it can be a market disrupter. I hope it will provide SMEs with access to new innovative financial products and a lower cost longer-term funding. I hope that the SBCI will encourage competition in the Irish banking system which is something that is really needed. Very shortly I will meet senior officials from the SBCI to make it very clear to them how I see its position on the landscape in terms of supporting SMEs in a practical way.</p>
          <p eId="para_252"> Unlike many European countries, Ireland did not have a state development institution to sustain funding to businesses throughout the financial crisis as banks reduced their lending exposure to small and medium-sized businesses. The persistent premium in the cost of finance available to Irish SMEs, compared with other European SMEs, puts our indigenous businesses at a competitive disadvantage. It results in the need for a local conduit vehicle to enable the channelling of low cost European finance into the Irish economy.</p>
          <p eId="para_253"> The SBCI will not just be part of Ireland's recovery but will be a permanent feature of the Irish funding landscape for many decades to come. The building of a recognisable brand and ongoing franchise will set this apart from previous discrete SME finance initiatives.</p>
          <p eId="para_254"> The Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland, SBCI, will keep providers of finance focused on providing a good service to SMEs, first, by challenging them through the introduction of bespoke well publicised SME credit products and, second, by introducing competitive pressures into the marketplace because of the SBCI's explicit support for new market entrants.</p>
          <p eId="para_255"> The SBCI will provide loans that currently are not typically offered in Ireland like loans of longer duration and loans that have built in payment holidays that encourage and enable growth of our SMEs. The SBCI will use lending partners rather than direct lending for three reasons. First, using the operations of established lending partners, the SBCI can get its funding out to SMEs more quickly than by building a direct lending platform from scratch. Second, the SBCI has a mandate to increase the number of finance providers to SMEs and create competition; if it lends directly, it would hamper its ability to generate broader competition. Third, by keeping costs low, it will enable the lower funding costs to be passed on to SMEs. A core objective of the SBCI is to generate competition and choice for SMEs seeking finance in the Irish market. The SBCI will have a lower cost of funding and this cost benefit must<b>
						</b>be passed on to SMEs. That is a critical point. </p>
          <p eId="para_256"> The SBCI will aim to maximise Ireland's potential drawdown from multilateral and international supports such as European Investment Bank and European Investment Fund schemes. It will also work with other Government initiatives in this space and the Government has already decided, for example, that the revised credit guarantee scheme should be aligned with the SBCI. The SBCI is working with its first lending partners, AIB, Bank of Ireland and Bibby Financial Services, to provide initial funding to the SME sector by the end of 2014. A full roll-out will occur during January 2015 with traditional bank lenders and, importantly, with new credit providers from beyond the traditional banking sector. All of this will allow for the distribution of SBCI funding to the SME sector in Ireland on a prudent and sustainable basis.</p>
          <p eId="para_257"> In terms of what the State is doing for equity investment, my Department through Enterprise Ireland and the Irish Strategic Investment Fund, ISIF, which is due to take over from the National Pensions Reserve Fund, will continue to invest in a range of SMEs in Ireland. Legislation has been passed to transition the NPRF into the Irish Strategic Investment Fund,<b>
						</b>which will operate as a sovereign development fund with the capacity to make €6.8 billion of resources available for investment on a commercial basis to support economic activity and employment in Ireland. The Government's message in regard to the ISIF is that its door is open to proposals from the SME business community to develop a portfolio of SME finance investments. The SBCI and the ISIF will operate as enabling institutions, working with public and private actors to both augment the impact of existing initiatives and, where appropriate, to develop new measures.</p>
          <p eId="para_258"> Regarding our primary focus for 2015, given the progress that has been achieved to date, I believe that the emphasis should be less on developing new supply side measures and rather more on supporting and influencing the effective implementation of the major policy initiatives the Government has already introduced to support the SME sector and in regard to prompt payments. In 2012, the ESRI undertook a major research programme on the issue of SME financing and the final report from this considerable body of work, entitled Financing SMEs in Recovery, was published in October 2014. The Senators may have read about that because it was widely covered in the media. Significantly, the suite of policy recommendations contained in this report focused strongly on the need to enhance and embed the existing range of policy measures already in place.</p>
          <p eId="para_259"> We need to concentrate on how to maximise the potential benefits for SMEs of the evolving financial architecture that now exists in Ireland. In particular, there must be a concerted focus on ensuring that the extensive suite of initiatives now in place facilitate the availability of appropriate, diverse and sustainable funding options across the life cycle of an SME, not just at the start. Key policy areas for 2015 will include the roll out of the SBCI; the export finance strategy; co-operation with the European Investment Bank and other national promotional banks; equity financing; communication; Government sponsored initiatives; data infrastructure; capacity building; alternative financing instruments; and EU financing.</p>
          <p eId="para_260"> I am fortunate to have been given the opportunity of late to serve as a Minister of State at Cabinet at what I see as a hugely exciting time for Ireland and for the Irish business community. I am most pleased that this Ministry will see me working with businesses which essentially are at the centre of Ireland's recovery. We must not forget that SMEs directly employ 70% of our entire workforce. We are very good in this country at promoting Ireland as a destination for foreign direct investment, but SMEs are the lifeblood of our economy and our society and are our key employment generator.</p>
          <p eId="para_261"> I have made a commitment across the landscape that as Minister of State with responsibility for business and employment I will be as vigorous supporting small and medium enterprises in this country as we are as a nation at supporting foreign direct investment because that is critical. SMEs are present across our country in every town, village and city and if we are to have the type of balanced economic recovery we need, we must ensure that we have proper finance for growth packages for sustainable businesses across this country into the future. We have a job to do in terms of communicating the range of opportunities that are available to companies across the country.</p>
          <p eId="para_262"> I look forward to continuing to work with the Senators to ensure we can promote the opportunities that are available to businesses in the communities we represent across the country.</p>

          <p eId="para_265">He is very welcome and I congratulate him on his appointment.</p>
          <p eId="para_266"> Small and medium-size companies are the lifeblood of the Irish economy, representing 70% of all employment, but the recovery of SMEs is being strangled by a lack of access to credit. They also report that bank fees and charges are rising, and the trend is likely to continue.</p>
          <p eId="para_267"> The decision by Danske Bank to join ACC in winding down its presence in the Irish market was another blow to hopes of real competition in the financial services sector. A former employee in the Central Bank, Fiona Muldoon, said that no institution applied for a banking licence during the time she served in the Central Bank. Just as the Government seeks to attract foreign direct investment in the manufacturing and services sector, the Government must make a concerted effort to get international banks to establish retail and commercial operations here.</p>
          <p eId="para_268"> While SME lending approval rates are increasing, the level of lending is still very low. The current level of expertise among the Irish banks for dealing with non-property related lending is very low and needs to be increased substantially. That has been going on for the past three years. It has become clear that people in the banks do not understand how to deal with the needs of small and medium-size businesses.</p>
          <p eId="para_269"> The legacy of debt held by SMEs must also be considered. This was highlighted by media reports that Danske Bank is planning to sell off over €500 million worth of SME loans across 4,000 different customer accounts. Legislative protection must be introduced for SME customers in such circumstances.</p>
          <p eId="para_270"> Efforts to encourage non-banking funding have been inadequate to date. High profile announcements around seed capital loan guarantees and microfinance have not been matched by the delivery of funding. The credit guarantee scheme is supporting lending at a rate of €1 million a month. It will take 40 years at the current pace to achieve its target of €450 million.</p>
          <p eId="para_271"> The long-term well-being of the economy requires both effective competition and regulation. The forthcoming report from the Committee of Public Accounts affords an opportunity to put in place a fit for purpose regulatory regime to underpin a competitive market. There is a need to protect SMEs whose loans are sold by departing banks to vulture funds.</p>
          <p eId="para_272"> It is five years since the onset of the banking crisis and the Irish banking sector is still not fit for purpose. It is imperative that the Government brings forward a White Paper on a strategy for competition and regulation and not simply react to each development. There is clearly a lack of competition but I do not have time to go into that. </p>
          <p eId="para_273"> The Minister referred to the establishment of the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland. Anyone who understands the situation knows that this is a half-hearted effort to tackle the problem of access to credit for small and medium-size enterprises.</p>
          <p eId="para_274">The Minister of State spoke glowingly about it but it is well known this is only a half-hearted effort. It falls well short of what is needed by the SME sector.</p>
          <p eId="para_275"> The establishment of the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland, SBCI, was long over due. It was promised as part of the programme for Government more than three and a half years ago and it will be several more months before it starts lending. However, even though it is called the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland, it will not have a banking licence, instead it will provide funding to existing banks who will lend on to SMEs. It is farcical that the credit decision will still remain in the hands of the existing banks. </p>
          <p eId="para_276"> I would like to speak about Sparkassen Bank in Germany. It is one of a number of banks in Germany. It was set up 200 years ago and it has 400 outlets around Germany. It was deliberately set up to provide services for people who are less well off in the German economy. People were fleeing rural areas and moving to the towns and the Germans wanted to support people who wanted to remain engaged in agriculture. The bank provided for small farmers, small business people and people who were not well off. We are missing a big opportunity here in that we are not doing something similar with our post offices and credit unions. The networks of credit unions and post offices could be turned into a facility such as the German Sparkassen Bank to serve local communities, rather than our relying on the two pillar banks that have not changed a whit. I wish the Minister of State every luck in his role.</p>

          <p eId="para_277">I welcome the Minister of State to the House. He has told us this is the first occasion he has been to the House.</p>
          <p eId="para_278"> The reality with respect to SMEs is that finance becomes irrelevant if people have no spending power. The latest figure indicates that 70,000 more people are back in work; the figure of 1.9 million has been crossed in terms of people who are now back in work. That has a major impact upon small and medium enterprises. Those people who are back in work are able to spend money and are not fearful of doing so.</p>
          <p eId="para_279"> In terms of Government finances, the deficit in 2011 was €22 billion and the deficit for the next year calendar will be €5 billion. The State is able to step up to the plate on this occasion. It has done so with the SBCI which will be able to provide €800 million of additional credit, which the Minister of State discussed and I do not want to go over that ground again, and the Irish Strategic Investment Fund, ISIF, which was the National Pensions Reserve Fund, NPRF, making €6.8 billion available. That will be the important factor.</p>
          <p eId="para_280"> A fair criticism was made by a Member on other side of the House that the NPRF was investing worldwide and businesses here were withering on the vine without funds being made available. The Minister of State said that the ISIF is in a transition period. It is crucial that we move on from the transition period and that the fund is up and running as quickly as possible. I am also informed that the amount involved must be €5 million or over. I have a concern about that and I know extra work is involved with smaller amounts. The National Pensions Reserve Fund will have to carry out due diligence on every project that comes before it. I congratulate my colleague, Senator Barrett, who insists on the carrying out of due diligence in that regard and I also support that. The same due diligence is required to be carried out on a small €1 million, €2 million, €3 million or €5 million project as a €50 million project but projects involving these smaller amounts are probably those that will get people back to work in terms of SMEs generating employment. That puts money into people's pockets which will give them spending power.</p>
          <p eId="para_281"> Another important initiative, which was part of budget 2014 which should not be forgotten, is the two-year tax exemption for a person who was long-term unemployed starting his or her own business. The increase in the threshold to €3 million in respect of the review of a loan refusal by the Credit Review Office is also important. The credit guarantee scheme in terms of 500 to 600 new jobs and 200 to 400 jobs being maintained together with the microfinance loan fund are also important. The Horizon 2020 programme, which we discussed earlier, is also important. The coming together of all those elements was important. I had a self-criticism of us and the State agencies and bodies. One of the best newsletters I have seen is this <i>SME Credit and Funding Newsletter</i> from the Department of Finance, but unfortunately if one goes to meet people in business they do not know what is available. I heard the Minister, Deputy Bruton, say on one occasion that only 16 people applied for funding under one of the schemes that was made available. There is a failure somewhere in the system when only 16 people applied for funding due to a lack of information. </p>
          <p eId="para_282"> The roll-out of the local enterprise offices will be important. I can only speak about the local enterprise office that I know best.</p>

          <p eId="para_286">I can only give the Senator the information that I know. The staff in the local enterprise office in Wexford know much more than I know. The staff in those offices are up to speed on what is available and they pass that information on to businesses throughout the country.</p>
          <p eId="para_287"> I will conclude by referring to the banks, God bless them. Significant funds are available and the banks are improving, but my criticism of them relates to the structure of their underwriters. I asked a colleague in the Dáil to table a parliamentary question about the banks' underwriters. Nobody seems to know who they are. Their identity seems to be kept a closely guarded secret. I am told that they are independent of the banks. That is a lovely position for the banks to be able to keep them at arm's length and a bank can say in response to a question that it was a matter for the underwriters. It is not good enough. It is a clever position for the banks if they want to refuse one credit. Bank lending is about risk. Senator White spoke about risk and the banks not being good enough and not being capable. From what I am experiencing, while the risk being taken has increased a little, it has not increased enough. The entrepreneurs, the business people in SMEs throughout the country, are taking a far greater risk than the banks. I would like something to be done about that. </p>
          <p eId="para_288"> The Minister of State is welcome to the House and I wish him well in his role.</p>

          <from>Senator Katherine Zappone<recordedTime time="2014-11-19T16:20:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_290">I welcome the Minister of State and I thank him for the enthusiasm and vision he has brought to his work. I want to focus my remarks on one aspect of the access to finance for SMEs, which the Minister of State referred to in his speech as the "market disrupter", namely, the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland. I would make three points in regard to it. First, I congratulate the Minister, Deputy Noonan, and the Government on its establishment. It is an extremely important initiative. I supported it during the legislative process. I was grateful for an engagement with the Department of Finance officials with regard to some suggestions I had in terms of its memorandum and articles. It is extremely important that the banking corporation will be able to provide €800 million of additional credit. That is hugely positive. It is a job well done.</p>
          <p eId="para_291"> I am especially delighted that the Minister, Deputy Noonan, accepted my proposals that the overall mission of the SBCI would include a commitment to social innovation and environmental protection as well as contributing to economic development of the State. The memorandum and articles that were agreed relatively recently state that the SBCI is to consider economic and social development of the State and hence, where appropriate, to provide credit to financially viable social businesses and environmental projects. I hope and expect that mechanisms will be put in place to ensure that these kinds of enterprises do have access to funding.</p>
          <p eId="para_292"> I appreciate the open-mindedness of the Government on the issue. The growth potential of social businesses and green enterprise has not been fully exploited due to the difficulty of this highly innovative sector accessing funding from the retail banking sector. SMEs in general have that difficulty but particularly these types of SMEs. </p>
          <p eId="para_293">There may be additional European resources that we could draw on for the SBCI within the sector of social innovation European venture funds.</p>
          <p eId="para_294"> There is a concern about ensuring the effective delivery of the SBCI’s mission to finance SMEs in a way that truly provides flexible conditions and lower cost finance. There are reasons to be concerned that the SBCI funding may not reach the companies it is set up for. When low-cost funding for SMEs was available from the EU in the late 1990s, the funds were often not granted to SMEs. The money was sometimes used for larger businesses to replace existing funding because they were perceived as being less risky. It is important for the Central Bank to conduct stringent oversight of the SBCI and not allow the mistakes of the past recur. Every effort should be made to ensure that the low-cost funding reaches SMEs, including social and green businesses. I support the Irish Small and Medium Enterprises Association, ISME's, advocacy in this matter. </p>
          <p eId="para_295"> There also needs to be appropriate oversight of SBCI’s on-lenders to make sure that the benefit of the lower cost finance is carried to the companies and not consumed by the on-lenders as often happened in the past. We know that the European Central Bank's refinancing rate is at an historic low of 0.05% following a series of cuts. While tracker customers have benefited from this, SMEs and variable rate mortgage holders have not. I believe that banks that benefit from the ECB rate cuts should pass the benefit on to the customers, and this is an opportunity, particularly for SMEs.</p>
          <p eId="para_296"> It is expected that the loans through SBCI will be approximately 1% less expensive than current market rates. We need to be absolutely sure that the benefits of the lower cost credit will be passed on to SMEs and not to the on-lenders. The Minister of State might update us on how that will be monitored and controlled. The SMEs in my community are not accessing the funding they need. They have not experienced any consistent recovery yet. I spoke with the management of the sustainable business programme in South Dublin County, run in conjunction with the council and the Chamber of Commerce. They have contact with more than 4,500 companies in the area and according to those companies, access to finance, not only loans but also access to overdrafts and short-term finance, is a critical issue. That affects not only the survival and success rates of small businesses, but those of the communities within which they reside.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#JohnGilroy" eId="spk_86">
          <from>Senator John Gilroy<recordedTime time="2014-11-19T16:30:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_297">I welcome the Minister of State to the Chamber. He said it is his first time here. Many stellar political careers have started here and there is no doubt that his will follow that trajectory. Many people have commented on how rapidly the Minister of State has read into his brief and on his deep understanding of it, which is to be commended.</p>
          <p eId="para_298"> SMEs are crucial to the recovery of our economy. The only way we will ensure our people’s prosperity is by creating employment. The companies best placed to create employment are not foreign direct investors but SMEs. It is said that if every SME took on one new employee, it would end the unemployment crisis overnight. Anything we can do to support that sector is vital.</p>
          <p eId="para_299"> SMEs, particularly start-ups, have difficulty navigating their way through the system and finding the finance. The establishment of the local enterprise offices, LEOs, will, when they are embedded and expanded, address that problem. The SME sector has been disproportionately reliant on bank finance which has been a problem. I do not have a great deal of confidence in the banking sector and do not believe that it is fully compliant with our objectives for it. It is very hard to know how to address this. The last thing we want is political interference in the running of the banks but anything we can do to encourage competition in this area must be welcomed.</p>
          <p eId="para_300"> The Minister of State spoke about the establishment of the SBCI which will provide a very flexible funding package on a sustainable level. Often during the boom time we noticed that while the banking sector produced plenty of financial packages, very few of them were sustainable, leaving us with a great debt overhang in the SME sector, which inevitably will be a drag on the sector’s development. In addition, legislation was passed several months ago to establish the Ireland Strategic Investment Fund, which was a very important element of the Government’s pre-election and programme for Government platforms. It has been overseen by the National Treasury Management Agency, NTMA, which, by contrast with the banks, is an agency in which we can have full confidence. It has proved its value and understanding of the financial sector and markets over the past few years. A total of €19.9 billion is available in the National Pensions Reserve Fund of which €13 billion or thereabouts is invested in the banks. That leaves €6.8 billion available for investment in the economy, much of which should go to the SME sector. Although these agencies are welcome, it will take some time for the finance to sink into the economy. </p>
          <p eId="para_301"> Senator White mentioned that the SBCI does not have a banking licence but when the Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, spoke here several months ago, he was very clear that he will keep this under review and if there is a need for a banking licence he will take the appropriate steps.</p>
          <p eId="para_302"> How can we ensure that the financing, which is being made available through these agencies, does not just displace existing money? It is a complex and thorny area but if it were to displace money it will not achieve our objectives. There is a theory that new money displaces old money. Does the Minister of State have any comments on that point?</p>

          <p eId="para_303">I welcome the Minister of State and wish him every success in this endeavour which is most important because we have had to reorientate the Irish economy away from the banks because they no longer served us. We have had to curtail the growth of public sector employment and we still have a problem identified by the troika today that too many of the sheltered sector services, in particular legal services, are far too expensive. It is a difficult place for a start-up.</p>
          <p eId="para_304"> I welcome the Department’s announcement of the 24 finalists in Ireland’s best young entrepreneur competition which had over 1,000 entries. That is the re-orientation which is needed. We did a lot of things wrong and made many mistakes and that is what we are trying to correct. We tabled an amendment when the Minister for Finance was here to try to keep the funds in the SBCI for entrepreneurial activities and out of property. He changed the articles of association so that this will be used for counter-cyclical purposes while property must be the definition of pro-cyclical purposes, particularly the way we ran it here.</p>
          <p eId="para_305"> Why is it not possible now to buy a house for 2.5 times average income as was possible many decades ago? Our parents were able to do that. What is wrong with the construction industry that it is unable to meet a target like that? Has its productivity gone wrong? These are some of the criticisms of it by Ronan Lyons, a property economist in Trinity College Dublin. The extremely high price of property is a major obstacle to doing business in this country. I regularly dissent when people wrongly hail higher house prices as an indication of prosperity. They add to the cost base of the economy.</p>
          <p eId="para_306">That is something we must avoid. Regarding the LEOs, and I do not know if that is a reflection on any candidate for the next leadership of the current leading Government party, what does a LEO do that the county enterprise boards did not do? Are we progressing or are we just putting new labels on old bottles?</p>
          <p eId="para_307"> I am glad the Minister of State is addressing the issue of finance for growth. Irish banks did nothing except invest in property, and the numbers show it. Would they know a small and medium enterprise if it presented itself right in front of them? They have not been doing it. Can the Minister of State change the corporate culture of Irish banking?</p>
          <p eId="para_308"> I note that the Minister of State said that our lending partners are AIB and Bank of Ireland. We could not have Anglo Irish Bank as a lending partner. I hope that the corporate culture of those bodies has changed. We want some thing different. I am concerned that many of the previous developers are in league with NAMA. Perhaps we need the assistance of AIB and Bank of Ireland for a while, but they did not do the job. That is what we are trying to correct now. The Minister of State has our support for his endeavour in this regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_309"> We need legal reform and energy costs reform. The economist, Cormac Lucey, wrote about that in the newspapers last Sunday. The regulator has not paid sufficient attention to the needs of small and medium enterprises. They are buying energy at 20% to 30% in excess of what businesses in other countries are paying. Regulators in Ireland tend to be captured.</p>
          <p eId="para_310"> I welcome the initiative of the Musgrave Group owners of SuperValu who have launched the Food Academy whereby new entrepreneurs start to supply their local store and grow until their products are on the market. We sometimes talk about small and medium enterprise and do not do anything about it.</p>
          <p eId="para_311"> There is a proposal to have 10% of bus routes open to competition but this is being held up all the time. People have made a substantial difference in the Minister of State's constituency and other businesses can enter the bus service and increase the market share of public transport. Something similar happened in taxis.</p>
          <p eId="para_312"> A small and medium enterprise that wished to tender for the postcode competition was ruled out of the competition because its turnover was not over €40 million a year. That seems a very strange way to promote small and medium enterprises. I doubt the wisdom of the postal code system in general.</p>
          <p eId="para_313"> This strategy should be entrepreneurial and not agency driven. The low corporate tax rate should be as productive as possible and not one in which fiscal termites chisel out, that is, too many tax lawyers and accountants. Let us have real entrepreneurship. I am sure the Minister of State supports that and we support him.</p>

          <p eId="para_315">I welcome the Minister of State to the House. I acknowledge his encouragement and enthusiasm for this important role in our economy. I welcome the measures he has rolled out, such as the local enterprise offices , which are very important, as well as the recently established Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland and the Irish Strategic Investment Fund.</p>
          <p eId="para_316"> As the Minister of State has said, more than 70% of our workforce are engaged in SMEs. I have been particularly concerned that many SME owners and farmers are refusing to ask questions of their banks when they have been refused credit. We have discovered from the most recent report of John Trethowan, the credit reviewer, that the Credit Review Office has overturned 56% of the banks' decisions to refuse credit. This has meant that €30 million in credit has been released and more than 2,000 jobs have been protected or created. It is noteworthy therefore that only 3% of those refused credit from their banks challenged the decisions. The remaining 97% of applicants walk away disappointed and empty handed. It is vital that this is changed. It is a matter of educating people about it.</p>
          <p eId="para_317"> While many businesses have taken advantage of the function of the CRO, there are still too many who do not have access to credit and who are unaware of the assistance the CRO can provide. SMEs need to challenge banks' decisions, as on many occasions the banks reverse their decisions. If they do not, the CRO is there to help.</p>
          <p eId="para_318"> The Government is dedicated to ensuring that credit is made available to SMEs and farmers, as the Minister of State has outlined. Last year the Minister for Finance, Deputy Michael Noonan, increased the limit for loan applications that can be reviewed by the CRO from €500,000 to €3 million. This increase allowed for requests from a broader range of SMEs and also assisted borrowers banking with non-trading banks. More than €800 million of additional credit has been made available to Irish SMEs through the new Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland, to which the Minister of State referred. I appeal to all farmers and SME owners in need of credit to approach their banks to gain access to these funds. If they are refused, they should ask the reason.</p>
          <p eId="para_319"> The Minister for Finance also announced in the Budget Statement 2015 that Permanent TSB will shortly participate in the CRO process and Ulster Bank is considering making a similar commitment. We need them involved because we need more competition in banking. It is very important that farmers and business owners are aware of the supports available, and it is vital that they challenge their bank as to why they have been refused access to credit.</p>
          <p eId="para_320"> I welcome the Minister of State's enthusiasm for this role, which is so vital to the future of the economy. Please God, he will be back again soon.</p>

          <p eId="para_322">I too welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Nash to the House. I am delighted to see him in this Chamber.</p>
          <p eId="para_323"> One of my major concerns about cash for small businesses comes from the Construction Contracts Act 2013, which was signed by the President 480 days ago. It was not the Minister of State's baby until last week, but it is now his baby. In the past 480 days nothing has happened. I would love to see the Minister of State grab this issue and show that he can actually do it. I think that would be a major benefit.</p>
          <p eId="para_324"> I wish to raise the issue of crowdfunding. I am connected with linked finance in that I made a small investment and I believe in crowdfunding. One of the reasons it has not taken off in Ireland as well as it should have is because we do not have any regulation whatsoever. If there is no regulation, people are concerned they might walk themselves into a problem.</p>
          <p eId="para_325"> New Zealand is regarded as first in the world of easy access to credit for small businesses. We are not even second, third or fourth but 23rd. We can actually do something about this. We can move on that quickly and readily.</p>
          <p eId="para_326"> I have spoken about pension release in the past. I welcome the move in recent years to allow people access to 30% of their additional voluntary contributions to pensions. It seems to me there are things we can do. I would love to draw the Minister of State's attention to news from the United Kingdom. The plan is that people will be able to use their pension pots like bank accounts from the age of 55 years to withdraw thousands of pounds to save, invest or spend as they wish on whatever they want to do. I think that is very worthy and it is something we can do something about. I think it is a very sensible move. Under current rules in the United Kingdom, people from the age of 55 years can take 25% of pension savings as a tax-free lump sum. In the future, however, savers will be able to dip into their pension pot when they want and, each time, 25% of what they take out will be tax-free. That has to develop more business for small and medium-sized businesses.</p>
          <p eId="para_327"> I have pointed out that Ireland has the highest rate of inheritance tax in Europe and that it is almost six times that of Italy and double that of Germany. Yesterday, in the UK, they announced they will be changing their inheritance tax laws. At present if people die without exhausting their pension funds, the funds their children or grandchildren over 23 years inherit is taxed at a massive 55%. From April 2015, the tax will be abolished altogether, bringing it into line with money left to spouses. I know that Senator Healy Eames is worried about competition from Britain, particularly for small and medium-sized businesses. She took the example of what happened in Galway last week, when the British made great efforts to get Irish SMEs to move to Britain to develop their business there. That is a reminder that we live in a competitive world and whether it is a competitive world in regard to death taxes, inheritance taxes or pension funds, we have to recognise that we are not living on our own. There is competition and it is making sure that our SMEs do not get the money they deserve or otherwise would have had.</p>

          <p eId="para_329">I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Nash, and wish him well with his new brief. Senator Quinn has led into what I wanted to say. As I said on the Order of Business yesterday, I am very concerned. I do not know whether the Minister of State is aware that the UK trade department is coming to many roadshows in Ireland to entice Irish small and medium-sized enterprises to set up over there. It offers them six months of free rent and rates, which is incredibly attractive. Who would blame any small or medium-sized business for taking up this offer? I spoke to some businesswomen who were in the House last night. They have already set up an office in London. They are testing the market. The issue is that these businesses might eventually leave. The Minister, Deputy Bruton, and the Minister of State need to wake up to this reality so they do not sleepwalk us into a huge crisis.</p>
          <p eId="para_330"> Senator Quinn especially will appreciate the startling fact that Ireland is ranked 93rd in the world for lack of competitiveness due to the effective taxation on incentives to work in Ireland. The source for that is the World Economic Forum report. The UK, which is just across the water - in fact, it is just 60 miles up the road - is 33rd in the world. It was explained to me that this is happening in Northern Ireland. I ask the Minister of State to address this issue when he sums up at the end of the debate. Our high marginal income taxes are a significant barrier to labour entry. We have incredible taxes on employment. We have very high PRSI. If an employer offers €10 to a worker, that comes at a cost of €15 to him or her. If an employer offers €16 to a worker, that comes at a cost of €22 to him or her. These taxes are untenable. Why are we taxing our employers out of business? That is what we are doing.</p>
          <p eId="para_331"> The sad fact is that we will not need to offer access to finance to small and medium-sized enterprises in Ireland if we cannot keep them here. It is bad enough that we are leaking graduates, but it is pure stupid to be leaking small and medium-sized enterprises. I have a word to say here. When Ireland was very attractive for foreign direct investment - it remains attractive - Mr. Cameron hit the roof and pushed on it so much that we had to provide for corrective measures - the double Irish system, etc. - in our recent budget. I think we should have something to say about our nearest neighbour being able to poach our businesses. We live in a democracy. I cannot blame an export-led small or medium-sized enterprise for testing the market. This is the only point I am making today and I ask for it to be addressed. Anything else would take from what I have to say. I am really keen to hear the Minister of State's response.</p>
          <p eId="para_332"> I would have concerns about the local enterprise offices. Entrepreneurs have been saying to me, without the detail, that they are not attractive at all. This is for another day because I need to get the detail there. I will make a final point on the issue of tax competitiveness. Does the Minister of State know that if one sells a business in this country, one has to pay capital gains tax of 40%, whereas one pays 0% if one sells a property? What are we saying? We are actually saying we value property more than business. It is very dangerous. We need entrepreneurs and businesses to hire our people and take them off social welfare. This is necessary if the economy is to grow. If we manage that, everybody will have more money in their pockets.</p>

          <p eId="para_333">I will respond in reverse order, if that is agreeable. I thank Senator Healy Eames for her remarks. It would be very useful if she could send me on the information to which she referred. I will be happy to respond to her in that regard in due course. I was interested to hear her refer to a particular index or score sheet. Ireland is at the top, or very close to the top, of many global, EU and OECD indices and indicators with regard to our competitiveness and our taxation regime for foreign direct investment. It has been said by the business community over the last period of time that work needs to be done with our taxation measures to make Ireland a more attractive place for the owners and managers of small and medium-sized enterprises. Now that the country is clearly recovering from the economic situation it has been in, all these issues can be addressed over time by the Minister for Finance and the Government. I am particularly interested in the notion of competitiveness regarding where start-up companies might locate. Ireland is competing on the world stage as it tries to attract high-potential start-ups from the US, Canada and elsewhere to locate in this country.</p>
          <p eId="para_334"> I would like to move on to one of the points made by Senator Barrett about property. Issues with the supply of adequate office facilities in some parts of the country have been raised with me informally by small start-up companies from the other side of the Atlantic that might wish to locate here. I think we need to address the supply issue. Clearly, our financial institutions will have a role in that regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_335"> I thank Senator Quinn for raising with me the Construction Contracts Act 2013, for which I recently took responsibility. I have a personal interest in trying to make sure the legislation originally drafted by Senator Quinn, which was adopted with some changes by the Government, works well. I think the future health of our construction industry will depend on that. I accept that it took some time to develop and adopt the Act, which now has a home. I will be managing it. I will be happy to report back to this House when we are in a position to elaborate further on the mechanics in this area. I appreciate the Senator's interest in this issue and his dedication to bringing it to the floor of this House and making it a priority for the Government. Now that I am responsible for it, I look forward to rolling it out.</p>

          <p eId="para_337">Senator Gilroy referred to the local enterprise offices as being part of the ecosystem for supporting small and medium-sized enterprises. I think they will be a critical piece of the infrastructure. Now that they are aligned with the local authorities, the really important thing is for them to infuse those authorities with an enterprise culture. As Senator White will be aware, my constituency of Louth is lucky enough to have had a really strong enterprise culture for a long time now. We decided approximately ten years ago to do it ourselves. The local authorities and the local enterprise offices are coming together as part of a really strong initiative to try to create-----</p>

          <p eId="para_339">Absolutely. I accept that. I was one of the people behind the driving of that agenda over an 11 year or 12 year period. A host of supports are available. All of us as public representatives have to do a really critical job. Regardless of whether we are in government or in opposition, we need to alert our constituents and those we represent to the products and supports that are out there. It is difficult to point young entrepreneurs who are in a hurry, and who might not be used to dealing with State agencies, in the right direction. Many of these people do not want to deal with State agencies. It is critical that we put them in contact with people who understand their businesses. The staff of the local enterprise offices understand these businesses. We are monitoring very seriously what these offices are doing. We are keeping an eye on a set of key performance indicators all the time. I assure the House that local enterprise office staff across the country are responding in a positive way to Government policy and to this new arrangement.</p>
          <p eId="para_340"> Senators Gilroy and Zappone and others made some clear points about the monitoring of the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland. They said we need to make sure that the money available to the corporation gets to the businesses that need it very quickly and that new products are made available through the corporation. I do not necessarily believe we need a whole host of new banks in this country. That is probably the last thing we need, in some respects. We need the banks we have to function properly and to meet the needs of citizens and the small and medium-sized enterprise community. We need to make sure the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland delivers on its mandate to deliver more and newer longer-term financial products that are more easily accessible and respond to the real needs that exist.</p>
          <p eId="para_341">I will be meeting senior officials from the SBCI very shortly to pass on the views of Senators in terms of what needs to happen and how the corporation needs to respond to the needs of SMEs. The last thing we want is for a situation to emerge whereby there is a lack of public confidence in the SBCI because of its close relationship with the pillar banks. We need to make sure that people have confidence in the SBCI because it is potentially a game changer. It has a really serious wedge of money to make available to SMEs which must be delivered properly and in a timely fashion. </p>
          <p eId="para_342"> Senators made reference to the entrepreneurial culture in this country. The Minister, Deputy Bruton, the Minister of State, Deputy English and I have concluded the work of our Department in developing a new national entrepreneurship policy statement. I found it extraordinary, on entering the Department about four months ago, that we did not have a national policy on entrepreneurship but we have one now. I am particularly interested in supporting entrepreneurs and am glad that Senator Barrett made reference to the competition to find Ireland's best young entrepreneur, the response to which has been truly magnificent. </p>
          <p eId="para_343"> I attended the Student Slingshot event last night which was organised by Enterprise Ireland. There were approximately 150 participants, most from our universities and institutes of technology where there are now entrepreneurship societies, which is something that did not exist when I entered university 21 years ago. There is a real sense of confidence among young people. They believe they can do the business and see themselves as potential entrepreneurs. As with the saying that there is a good book in everybody, I believe there is a good business idea in everybody and people just need to be encouraged to bring it forward. The State agencies are there to support that. I heard some fantastic ideas last night. If we can get young people to work with the research and development units in their colleges and universities and with Enterprise Ireland to monetise and commercialise their ideas, then we will have a very positive future.</p>

          <p eId="para_348">Earlier this year I spoke about what it was like growing up as an adopted child and not knowing anything about my natural mother until I was 29 years of age. Since then, I have been overwhelmed with e-mails and letters from other adoptees sharing their experiences. Some of their personal circumstances are very different to mine. However, their pain, sadness and anxiety are all too familiar: the pain of not knowing who you really are or where you came from; the sadness that descends on you each birthday and Mother's Day when you wonder where your mother is and if she's okay; and the anxiety that grips you every time a doctor asks if there is a serious genetic medical condition in your family and you have to tell him that you do not know.</p>
          <p eId="para_349"> Having finally met my natural mother a few years ago, I now have answers to these questions. I am also fortunate to have had the chance to get to know her, my half siblings and the rest of my second family. However, I am one of a tiny minority of adoptees who have been able to find their mothers through the national adoption contact preference register. Without a right to their birth certificates, thousands of Irish adoptees will never get even the most basic information about themselves that everyone else takes for granted.</p>
          <p eId="para_350"> Adopted people in England have had a legal right to their birth certificates, listing their original names and those of their parents, since 1976. Forty years later, Irish adoptees still do not have this right. Successive Irish Governments have claimed that the reason for denying us this information is to protect the privacy of our mothers. The impression given is that women chose to give up their babies years ago, have not looked back since and do not want to be reminded of the past. This could not be further from the truth. The reality is that for decades, unmarried mothers were pressurised into putting their children up for adoption, with adoption rates among them reaching 97% at one stage. Women had no choice. As the movie "Philomena" powerfully shows, many of these women were devastated at losing their children and have spent years trying to trace them, only to be lied to by religious orders and adoption agencies and refused information by the State.</p>
          <p eId="para_351"> As a teenager in Limerick, Philomena Lee was banished to Sean Ross Abbey for the so-called sin of having a baby out of wedlock. Against her wishes, she was forced to sign papers to place her son Anthony for adoption and told by the nuns that she would burn in the fires of hell if she ever uttered a word to anyone about her shameful secret. After Anthony was taken from her, Philomena left the convent and moved to England. However, she never stopped thinking about her son and returned to Sean Ross Abbey a year later to beg the nuns to tell her where he had gone. They refused and so started a 50-year search for her lost son. The next time Philomena came close to Anthony was when she stood over his gravestone at Sean Ross Abbey decades later. When she later met her son's partner, she was told that Anthony too had gone back to the nuns seeking information about his mother. To Philomena's heartbreak she learned that he had been told his mother abandoned him and never looked back. Her son had died believing she had rejected him even though that could not have been further from the truth.</p>
          <p eId="para_352"> In calling on Members to support this Bill last weekend, Philomena said that while it is too late for herself and Anthony, we must legislate now to help other mothers who were forced to separate from their children in circumstances similar to hers. In recent weeks, I have been contacted by many other women like Philomena.</p>
          <p eId="para_353">They were devastated to lose their children in the first place and are heartbroken that they still cannot make contact with them now. They just want to know that their son or daughter is okay. They want to know how life has turned out for them, and they want to be able to tell their child that they never stopped thinking about them. Older women in particular are worried that if legislation is not brought in soon it will be too late.</p>
          <p eId="para_354"> I know that Members have been contacted by many people in recent weeks sharing their own stories. Many of them are equally sad. We got an e-mail from a gentleman the other day who said he finally found his mother in September only to hear that she passed away in August and that she had a dreadful life. The pain of being separated from her child had caused her great hardship and upset. He spent years trying to trace her through the Health Service Executive only to realise that he missed her by a month. That heartbreak is unimaginable to most of us. It is cruel, wrong and it is time we changed it.</p>
          <p eId="para_355"> Ireland's history of secretive and often forced adoptions is not just a shameful aspect of our past. It continues to cause great pain to adopted people and their parents to this day. It is time for the Government to do the right thing by giving all adoptees a right to their birth certificates and assisting adopted people, and mothers and fathers, who wish to reunite. This Bill is designed to do just that. If enacted, all adoptees will have a right to their birth certificates, listing their original names and their parents' names; natural parents may request information about their adopted sons or daughters; and both adoptees and parents can opt to have their contact details released to each other if they are both happy to do so.</p>
          <p eId="para_356"> Many adoptees and natural parents would love to be reunited with each other and will be delighted that a process is finally in place after all these years to enable them do so. I accept that others may prefer not to do so. The system provided for in the Bill will enable each person to proceed in a way that suits their own individual needs and sensitivities. Where both parties wish to exchange contact details, they will be facilitated in doing so but where someone would prefer not to have their details released to the other person, they can simply tell the Adoption Authority to withhold them. However, a parent who does not wish to meet may opt to provide medical information to their son or daughter which could be of huge benefit to the adoptee.</p>
          <p eId="para_357"> In deciding whether to accept or decline a request for contact details, an adoptee or a parent will have at least four months to make up their mind. They will also have the option to meet with a counsellor or social worker to talk the whole thing through before coming to a decision. The Bill has been carefully designed to respect the desires and rights of both parties.</p>
          <p eId="para_358"> Some commentators have asked what is to stop adoptees tracking down their birth parents against their wishes once they have their birth certificate. As an adopted person and an adult, I would never have wished to force myself into a relationship with somebody else who did not want to have that relationship. We are all sensitive people. Before I met my mother I thought more about her needs than my own. I was aware of the fact that I could have been conceived in difficult circumstances and that meeting me might bring back difficult memories for her, and I was sensitive to that. I know from talking to other adoptees that is their perspective also. </p>
          <p eId="para_359"> As an adopted person sometimes I resent the idea put out in public debate that we are irrational and want to hurt people. All we want to know is who we are and where we came from. That is perfectly natural and it is all any of us want in this world. It is so wrong that out of fear, scare-mongering and cruelty we have denied people that information for so long. It comes from a misguided attitude towards people which, unfortunately, has led to stigma in other areas of our society where the State believes it has a responsibility to protect people from themselves and be patronising in its attitude to different groups. It is cruel and it is wrong.</p>
          <p eId="para_360"> Putting that aside, there is also a greater risk of unwanted contact under the current arrangements. Not having an automatic right to one's birth certificate does not necessarily mean it is impossible for adoptees to find their parents. As the Minister knows well, it makes it more difficult. The records are open. If somebody wants to do a painful, exhausting search of all the children born on their particular birth date, cross off all the boys and go through the girls, narrow it down until eventually they come down to three or four babies they can do that. People sometimes trace it down to a locality and they end up in terrible situations walking around asking people if they know a particular lady who lived in the area decades ago. Those are the lengths to which people have to go, which is not a good process for anybody and because there is no intermediary to reach out to the mother on their behalf, their only way to make contact is to write a letter directly, pick up the telephone or send a message on Facebook. Nobody wants to be put in that position.</p>
          <p eId="para_361"> This Bill would put in place that intermediary service and enable adoptees to reach out to their natural parents through the Adoption Authority rather than having to do so directly. It also includes provisions relating to supports from a counsellor or a social worker to ensure that both people are supported and that they have someone who can help them through the process, but it puts in place a system that is much more supportive and sensitive for all concerned. It is far better and there is much less of a risk of people having unwanted contact than under the current arrangements. I want to knock that on the head because that notion is often put out by people who do not understand the issue. </p>
          <p eId="para_362"> The Bill strikes a careful balance. I welcome to the Visitors Gallery Dr. Fergus Ryan, who drafted the legislation for us. Dr. Ryan is a law lecturer at Maynooth University with a particular expertise in family law, constitutional law and human rights. He did a huge amount of work on the Bill over many months, researching all the relevant constitutional cases and ensuring it is drafted in a way that vindicates the adoptee's right to his or her identity while also respecting the mother's right to privacy, achieving a balancing of rights as required by the Supreme Court in the I. O'T <i>v.</i> B case.</p>
          <p eId="para_363"> It has taken a good deal of work to develop legislation that achieves the appropriate balance but I am confident that this Bill does that. However, it is only on Second Stage in the Seanad today. After we agree it today, as I understand we will, and I thank the Minister for that and Members on all sides of the House who helped to bring that about, it will go through another two Stages in this House before going through three Stages in the Dáil. I will be happy to consider, as will Senators van Turnhout and Healy Eames also, suggestions for amendments and changes from any Member of this House. We want to get this right and have the best possible legislation, and we are more than willing to amend it on Committee Stage if necessary.</p>
          <p eId="para_364"> There is no doubt that this is a sensitive and legally complicated area but it is not beyond our capabilities as an Oireachtas to get it right. As the Supreme Court has pointed out on many occasions, it is our job to do so. Ignoring this issue, as successive Governments have done, does a huge disservice to the thousands of adoptees who have been denied their identities as a result. It has also left women like Philomena to suffer great pain and loss unnecessarily. It is long past time we stopped abdicating our responsibility as legislators and worked together to address this issue in a fair and sensitive way.</p>
          <p eId="para_365"> I thank Senators van Turnhout and Healy Eames for seconding the Bill. I am also grateful for the support it has received from Senators and Deputies of all parties and none. In the past week various people have been ringing my office and stopping me in the corridor, which I really appreciate. By putting aside party differences and working together, we can make a real difference to people's lives and enacting this Bill would be a major step forward for the 50,000 Irish adoptees and their families. I would like to keep working with all Members after today to help get it passed into law as soon as possible, and I hope they will support me in that.</p>

          <from>Senator Jillian van Turnhout<recordedTime time="2014-11-19T17:10:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_366">The Minister is very welcome and I thank him for his co-operation in helping us bring this Bill to the House. I would also like to extend a welcome to our visitors in the Visitors Gallery from Adoption Rights Alliance Ireland and Dr. Fergus Ryan.</p>
          <p eId="para_367"> I thank Senator Averil Power for her tremendous work initiating the Bill and Senator Healy Eames for joining with us in bringing it forward today. A special thanks also to Dr. Fergus Ryan who drafted the Bill. I thank also the many colleagues who shared their personal stories with me over the past two weeks and the reason they support this Bill, which indicates that it reaches into every household in Ireland.</p>
          <p eId="para_368"> I feel very strongly about the Bill and it is an honour for me to second it in the House today. My intervention will focus on a critical component, which is all too readily brushed aside or diminished, that is, the right to identity. In 1976, Alex Haley, author of <i>Roots: The Saga of an American Family</i>, articulated what so many adoptive people in Ireland have described to me over the years when he stated: "In all of us there is a hunger, marrow-deep, to know our heritage - to know who we are and where we have come from. Without this enriching knowledge, there is a hollow yearning ... and the most disquieting loneliness". The right of people to know who they are is fundamental, necessary and basic.</p>
          <p eId="para_369">Its absence can be a source of considerable pain and anguish. Its absence, where the necessary information exists but is being withheld, can leave people with a feeling of deep injury and injustice. By focusing on the right to identity I do not wish in any way to undermine or diminish the identity that an adopted person has developed in his or her life with his or her adoptive parents and families. There are many adopted people who have no desire whatsoever to access their birth information. However, there are many for whom the information is a burning need.</p>
          <p eId="para_370"> I have spoken in this House on several occasions about forced and illegal adoptions. All too often we have cloaked adoption in secrecy and as a society we have been complicit in suppressing women, their children and their respective rights. This is typified by a startling figure produced by Clare McGettrick of the Adoption Rights Alliance which shows that in 1967, a staggering 97% of all children born outside marriage were adopted. We cannot allow our shameful past, our fear that further shames may be exposed, to justify the perpetuation of a shameful practice against at least 50,000 people in Ireland and yet we do. That is why this Bill is so necessary, so important and is long overdue.</p>
          <p eId="para_371"> We need to fundamentally reconsider how we approach adoption in Ireland. Our current system of closed adoptions which automatically extinguishes the child's and the adult's right to their identity will ideally be changed to an open system where their biological and adoptive families have access to varying degrees of each other's personal information and have an option of contact from the outset. In the meantime, this Bill will ensure, however retrospectively, the adoptive person's right to identity. </p>
          <p eId="para_372"> We are on the eve of the 25th anniversary of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child. How fitting it will be if we can give life to the convention's expressed recognition of a child's right to know and to preserve his or her identity. This has been the law in Scotland since 1930 and in England and Wales since the mid-1970s, with no dire consequences or legal wrangling over rights to privacy.</p>
          <p eId="para_373"> According to the Supreme Court in I.O'T <i>v</i>. B, an adoptee's right to his or her identity is not absolute and is subject in particular to the right to privacy of the natural parent, about which we have heard much in the past 24 hours. However, it also pointed out that the right to privacy does not automatically trump the right to identity. The Supreme Court decided that the two rights must be balanced against each other. It is clear from the Supreme Court decisions in Tuohy <i>v</i>. Courtney, that the precise balance to be struck is a matter for the Oireachtas to determine. This Bill achieves that balance in a way that is sensitive to the needs of all parties. </p>
          <p eId="para_374"> We must let in the light and we must start now in a new era of openness and understanding. We should not stand in judgment and I believe that this Bill strikes the balance mooted by the Supreme Court and longed for by so many adoptive people, their families and friends. Let us do this now.</p>

          <p eId="para_375">I welcome the Minister to the House. I thank the Senators who have introduced this Bill, in particular, Senators Power, van Turnhout and Healy Eames. As someone who has been involved in drafting Private Members' Bills I know it is not an easy task and it takes a lot of work, dedication and commitment. I thank everyone involved.</p>
          <p eId="para_376"> This Bill is comprehensive and carefully drafted and it progresses the debate on the subject and will help to bring about change. As Senator Power outlined, this change is long overdue compared to the changes in UK legislation which occurred over 40 years ago. It is time to move on and to stop hiding behind closed doors on this matter.</p>
          <p eId="para_377"> I refer to the number of people who are affected directly or indirectly by the fact that they are unable to gain access to information. I recently had a case relating to foster care where two people, both of whom I had known for 35 and 40 years, respectively, had been put into foster care. They were aged 71 and 79 years, respectively, when they met for the first time since they were children. One of the individuals was very involved in Fianna Fáil and the other was very involved in Fine Gael.</p>

          <p eId="para_379">If they had been in the same party they might have met earlier. When they are together one can see that they are sisters. They were put into foster care and had not been adopted yet it took them until they were in their 70s to find each another. This brings home the reason change is needed in this area.</p>
          <p eId="para_380"> I refer to the recent Supreme Court judgment in the case of I.O'T <i>v</i>. B which states: </p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_381"> That in view of the caution to be exercised with regard to the duty of ascertaining and declaring what were the personal rights of the citizen, other than those specified in the Constitution, it was incumbent on a court declaring such a right to do so in clear and explicit terms. It was only a right that had been so declared that could be regarded as a right guaranteed by the Constitution. It was not permissible for any court to imply from the existence of a right guaranteed by the Constitution, whether from the specified terms thereof or as a result of a declaration by the superior courts, the existence of any other right in the absence of a declaration by the superior courts of the existence of that other right.</p>
          <p eId="para_382">We have allowed the courts to deal with this issue for far too long. It is time to move on and to bring in the necessary legislation to set up a proper structure and procedure for dealing with providing the information to people who have been adopted but also providing the information to the natural parents. There are two sides in this matter and it is important that both are catered for.</p>
          <p eId="para_383"> The Government is considering bringing forward legislation but this Bill could be a means of progressing the debate. If change is not introduced in the lifetime of this Government, progress will be delayed for two or three years. The Bill proposes procedures for the adoptee's right to apply for a birth certificate to the General Registration Office, that the Adoption Authority of Ireland will be notified and it must make reasonable efforts to contact the natural mother and father, where known, and to advise them of the request. The natural parents will be advised that their child's records will be released and a reasonable period of time is allowed. It is important that a reasonable period of time is allowed and this legislation provides that balance in allowing time for both sides to deal with the issues and that everything is above board. This legislation will provide a way forward. I agree it needs to be fine-tuned and that we will probably need to bring forward amendments. We can no longer allow the situation to remain as it is. This Bill is one of many steps that will be required to arrive at properly structured legislation. The General Registration Office will be crucial in setting up the structures and it will need to be adequately resourced in order to deal with the issues arising.</p>
          <p eId="para_384"> I welcome the Bill and it has my full support and I hope it will be a means of bringing this matter to a conclusion during the lifetime of this Government.</p>

          <p eId="para_385">There is very little one can say after the tremendous speeches Members have heard from everybody here. I endorse everything said by Senator Colm Burke and it is great that he is welcoming this Bill on behalf of the Government side. This non-partisan approach to policy has so much to commend it. I wish to praise Senators Power, van Turnhout and Healy Eames for acting on behalf of the 50,000 adoptees and their families on the right to identity. I welcome the visitors in the Gallery from the Adoption Rights Alliance and, in particular, Dr. Fergus Ryan, who I knew as a most kindly man when he was in Trinity College for looking after his elderly neighbours in the Rubrics. This is a man who comes with strong credentials to this topic, which he has proven through drafting this legislation. While many speakers wish to make a contribution, other than wholehearted support from these benches I do not wish to delay the House. I am delighted the Minister is present and note that the last time Members discussed children's rights with him, it was the much smaller right of children not to be smoked at by adults in the same car. While this issue is much more serious, the Minister proved his credentials then in defending children in that small way and I am sure that on this much larger issue, Members will hear much of the same positive approach he took then. I thank the Acting Chairman, welcome the Minister and reiterate my praise of all the Senators who have spoken. This is a good day for this House and for the adopted people who have asked Members to do this. I thank everyone who sent e-mails to Members, to each of which I try to reply individually. I note the happiness already generated by Members' support in those people who sent the e-mails to them. They are really pleased and it is a good day for this House that we have sided with them.

          <from>Senator Marie Moloney<recordedTime time="2014-11-19T17:30:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_386">I welcome the Minister to the House. I thank Senators Power, van Turnhout and Healy Eames for drafting this legislation, as well as the distinguished guests in the Visitors Gallery who also were involved in this regard. I support this Bill and I am absolutely delighted that Senator Power has been involved because Members are listening to someone who knows what she is talking about. She has been through this, understands it and has lived it. From previous debates, Senator Power will be aware that I also have experience in this regard in that my father was adopted, albeit that he knew his birth name as the people who adopted him allowed him to keep his name. He was an older child when he was adopted and was not adopted as a baby. In those days, when people had children outside of marriage, sometimes one or two, some were kept in the family home and others were placed in an orphanage, as was the case with my father. His sister was kept within the family circle and he was put into an orphanage and adopted by someone else. Consequently, I know about the void of not knowing one's past, albeit it was my grandparents who I did not know. Senator Power has a closer experience than that but when doing our family tree at school or simple things like that, we had no idea and could only go up one side of the tree. My father, who would be in his 80s today had he lived, died as a young man and he never spoke to us about it. He did not seem to want to so do and by the time we reached the age at which we could discuss it with him, unfortunately he was gone. Therefore, while we knew the identity of one of the grandparents, we do not know who our grandfather was. We could be living in a community in which we have an aunt, an uncle or a first cousin but we do not know the relationship. We do not know whether in the future, children will meet one other or get into a relationship and, consequently, I am delighted that this legislation is being brought forward.</p>
          <p eId="para_387"> This Bill is long overdue and, if implemented, would have the potential to improve greatly the situation both of adoptees and the birth parents of adoptees. The United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child states expressly that every child has the right to preserve and know his or her identity. Surely, part of everyone's identity is knowing basic information about one's birth parents and who is one's natural family. For far too long, the State has stood in the way of adoptees finding out basic information about themselves. Adoptees must fight hard to find out who their biological parents are and their natural family's medical histories. There are several thousand adoptees living in Ireland today, none of whom has an automatic right to their birth certificates, their original names, their parents' names or their family's medical history. In pursuing such a restrictive policy towards those who have been adopted, I believe the State has created obstacles for adoptees finding out about their past and being able to establish their identities. The position facing the birth parents of adoptees is not much better. At present, there is no formal process for biological parents to access information about their adopted children. Major challenges face the natural parents of adoptees when it comes to finding out any information about their adopted sons and daughters. There are issues in respect of finding the adoption certificate and the new names of their natural children.</p>
          <p eId="para_388"> The Senators have drafted this legislation carefully to give a balance to the birth parents and the adopted child's rights, albeit they will be adults when they seek information. However, I acknowledge the Senators have drafted this measure carefully and have tried to protect everyone's interests. One of the most important measures in this Bill will ensure that all adoption records currently in the hands of adoption agencies, religious orders or mother and baby homes will be delivered to the Adoption Authority of Ireland.</p>
          <p eId="para_389"> Whenever Members speak in debates, no matter what the subject, they always appear to refer to their nearest neighbours across the water in England, Scotland or wherever and to what they have done. Today, I note that Scotland introduced a similar measure in 1930 and that in 1976, people in England were given the right to access their birth certificates. Consequently, I believe this measure is long overdue here and it is time to introduce it. I hope the Minister will progress this Bill as quickly as possible through both Houses and will bring it to a conclusion, as well perhaps as bringing closure to many adopted people. There are rights for everyone, including the birth parents and, in particular, I presume, the mothers. This is because in many cases the birth certificates will have only the name of the birth mother, as many of them do not have the name of the birth father. These parents have the right not to give out their whereabouts if they see fit not to so do. However, as can be seen from watching a television programme involving such long-lost families, I am pretty sure that in most cases it would pull at one's heartstrings to see people being united. Even if there were reasons the mother or father had to give up the child, it is all forgotten in such meetings and it is a wonderful experience that is great to watch. I thank the Acting Chairman and I am sure Members will have further opportunities to speak on this Bill. I say well done to the Senators concerned.</p>

          <p eId="para_392">That was not easy but it is what strengthens this Bill and has made it a Bill that Members hope and expect the Government will take. As Senator Colm Burke noted, we have carefully constructed this Bill with the support of Dr. Fergus Ryan, who is present. We hope we have all the i's dotted and all the t's crossed. There are three parties in every adoption story, namely, the adopted child, the natural mother and the adoptive family. I stand, as part of the three who created the Bill, as an adoptive mother. We have two adopted children who now are in their early and late teens.</p>
          <p eId="para_393"> In the last week I was asked why I as an adoptive parent would want to open up this can of worms. This is not about me or my needs, that would be totally selfish of me. This is about the needs of the adopted person. I, personally, have what an adopted person needs, namely, access to my identity and my birth certificate. It is as basic as that. It is only fair that adopted persons are given equal access to their story. In a way, it is about access to their back-story. In our case, we adopted one child when four months old and another, internationally, at ten months old. We have different information about each child. We met our son's birth mother and as a result we know so much more, including medical history. This Bill will provide for access to that type of information. For example, I know it would be not a good idea for my son to become a smoker because based on his family medical history smoking would not be helpful to him. In my daughter's case, because she was adopted internationally, I do not have that type of information. </p>
          <p eId="para_394"> We all know the importance of medical history. For example, if there is a history of cancer on the mother's side of the family, particularly breast cancer, it is important for a daughter to know that. This Bill will provide access to basic information which will assist the adopted person in feeling whole. It is a basic human need to feel whole. Access to one's identity helps heal a primal wound. It is the start of a journey towards answers to the many questions which adopted persons have. One of the most basic questions to which an adopted person needs an answer is why he or she was given up. There is a theory that all adopted persons are damaged. Providing answers around birth identity starts the journey towards healing the primal wound of abandonment. As an adoptive parent, why would I not want my adopted children to feel whole? Why would I not want them to know their story? </p>
          <p eId="para_395"> We have been careful in balancing this. I put the breaks on Senators Power and van Turnhout and I ensured that we had a six month period between the request for a birth certificate and provision of that birth certificate because a request could arrive at the time the adopted child is undergoing his or her leaving certificate examinations or prior to a university examination. Also, the request to the natural mother could arrive at a time when another of her children is getting married or a relative has died.</p>
          <p eId="para_396"> Time is critical. We have worked together to slow down the process but not for too long. I believe six months strikes a good balance. We are carefully balancing the right to identity, which is the primary right in this regard, as it must be, with the right to privacy. However, as stated by Senator van Turnhout the right to privacy does not automatically trump the right to identity. We are carefully balancing the right to identity with the right to privacy of the natural mother. Just because a person has the right to his or her birth certificate does not mean he or she immediately gets it but it will be available when he or she needs it. Equally, just because it might not be a good time in the natural mother's life to meet the adopted person does not mean she will not want to do so some time in the future. We are setting up a new life cycle whereby the needs of all can be met. We all need time. The Bill also provides that during the six-month period the adopted person and natural mother would engage in an advisory session with a counsellor or social worker so that feelings are addressed and the right to privacy is discussed, which is an important safeguard. </p>
          <p eId="para_397"> The question of why our State should move on this issue has been raised. As the Minister, Deputy Reilly, will have heard during this debate the UK, Scotland and Wales have had similar legislation in place since the mid-1970s and the sky has not fallen in. Adopting a child can make a family whole. I know this. Adoption is a positive outcome for the many people who find themselves in crisis pregnancies. It is important any stigma attached to this area is removed. Let it be a story of joy and hope for all parties.</p>

          <p eId="para_399">I welcome the Minister to the House. I also welcome this debate. While we prepare to celebrate the Centenary of 1916 we should also reflect on the fact that our new State also brought with it some very dark elements. The forced adoption of people within and outside this State before and after the enactment of the 1952 Act is something that should bring a deep sense of shame to all of us as a society.</p>
          <p eId="para_400"> We recently had cause in this House to discuss the Tuam babies and wider issues. The issue of forced adoption is very much tied up in that era and the attitude of society to those who did not apparently live up to what were very cruel standards. In principle, I support Senators in making the tracing of birth parents or adopted children easier and ensuring rights are afforded to both parties in proportion. I welcome that the Government is proposing that this Bill be supported in the Seanad and referred to the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Health and Children for further consideration. Work is already under way on the development of the general scheme and heads of Bill of an adoption (information and tracing) Bill, which will provide for statutory access to adoption records and birth information. The heads of Bill will provide that access to records will be provided to people previously involved in adoptions in so far as is possible and in line with legal advice.</p>
          <p eId="para_401"> While Dr. Ryan has done an excellent job in the drafting of the aforementioned Bill and seeks to go no further than the decision of the Supreme Court in I. O'T <i>v.</i> B, it must be accepted that there is a significant element of doubt as to the exact meaning of that Supreme Court decision. It is speculated on one side that given the Supreme Court decided that the rights of neither the birth parent nor child were absolute, the release of a birth certificate would not prejudice the constitutional right of the birth parent to privacy. The other interpretation of the Supreme Court decision, the one with which the Adoption Board has since relied, is that the release of a birth certificate would prejudice the constitutional right of privacy of the birth parent. In the circumstances, it is appropriate that this legislation would not be objected to in this House by the Government but rather referred to the committee so that all of these details can be teased out. In my view, given the complexities and personal stories involved, regardless of the way the Bill is ultimately drafted, the matter may again appear before the Supreme Court for decision. </p>
          <p eId="para_402"> I would like to make a constructive comment on the Bill on which Senators and the Minister might reflect. There could be little objection to medical records being released. There is a far greater understanding today of the hereditary nature of illness. It would seem unconscionable that someone who is adopted would not, for example, during a pregnancy, have information or even the right to it, on their parents' medical history or no knowledge of what regressive gene they might be carrying or passing on. An adopted person would have no idea that he or she might be afflicted by a hereditary illness until such time as he or she becomes ill. Given the judgment in I. O'T <i>v.</i> B it would be very difficult to try to assert that an adopted person does not have the right to know his or her medical history. Surely this could be done without compromising any supposed right to privacy. </p>
          <p eId="para_403"> It would seem to me that there is a huge variety of situations with which this legislation will have to cope. No two adopted persons or natural parents or their wants or needs will be same. Whatever legislation is enacted needs to be flexible and needs to respect all parties, something we have failed to do in this country to date. If it takes time to get it right, it will be time well spent. I commend the Senators who put forward this Bill and look forward to constructive debate on it as it progresses through the Houses of the Oireachtas.</p>

          <p eId="para_404">Like others, I commend the three Senators who introduced this Bill. As Senator Barrett mentioned, it is a good example of cross-bench collaboration, placing the Seanad in a different light than the unfortunately dysfunctional Dáil. It is also good that we have Senator Power, who has shown great courage in giving testimony on her circumstances, Senator van Turnhout, who has operated in the field of children, and Senator Healy Eames. I will revert to them in a minute.</p>
          <p eId="para_405"> I will set out two guiding principles to policy on this matter, namely, the integrity of identity and the best interests of the child. The latter are often expounded, but are more honoured in breach than in adherence. As Senator Power stated, they must be balanced with the interests of adoptive parents. When people adopt children, take them into their homes and give them wonderful lives that they would not have been able to access otherwise, it is a wonderful example of Christianity in practice. Like all parents, they make necessary sacrifices in the interests of their children's well-being. It is important that this balance has been emphasised in the Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_406"> Reference has been made to secretive, forced adoptions. They undoubtedly occurred. For various and sometimes simplistic reasons, people often place all of the blame for this on the religious institutions. They are certainly responsible for an element of what happened, but I would not like to take from the good people who worked in those institutions, for example, the Good Shepherd Convent in New Ross. As I have articulated in recent years, some people emerged from institutions with bad experiences, but I also know of many who emerged with nothing but the height of praise and support for the people who looked after them. Some of the nuns were outstanding in the care they gave children. Obviously, not everyone reached the standard to which they should have been aspiring and there were many unchristian practices.</p>
          <p eId="para_407"> However, let us not take from the fact that those children were often put up for adoption due to parental pressure. As misguided as it was, that pressure may have stemmed from people's misconceptions about what was in the best interests of their own children, namely, the mothers of the babies. Poverty certainly played a part, as did the valley of the squinting windows where, like the Pharisees, people were harsh in judging others as having fallen below what they felt was the standard. Often, they did not reach that standard in their own lives.</p>
          <p eId="para_408"> I am inclined to mention a meeting that we held last week. I have been working on a Bill on sperm donations for a while. Dr. Joanna Rose visited Leinster House. Throughout her life, she campaigned to try to establish her true identity and, as we are trying to seek in this debate, the records of adoptive children. She took a successful court case in England. Unlike the Senators who have shown courage and initiative in introducing this Bill, the British politicians who were contacted did not raise the matter in the House of Commons. It was left to the courts to determine in her favour. She discovered that her father, who had been a student, was a sperm donor and that she had between 200 and 300 siblings. She subsequently sought to identify her father. I understand that he is a senior executive with Monsanto. When she contacted him, he responded with a solicitor's letter.</p>
          <p eId="para_409"> It has been stated that our past is shameful, uncaring and unchristian. It did not meet the guiding principles that I set out at the start. However, it is a good line along which we can reflect on our shameful present. Secretive and forced adoptions are being replaced by secretive and forced abortions. Ms Philomena Lee's story is sad. After searching tirelessly, it is unfortunate that she only discovered her son's identity after he had died and been buried. The Philomena Lees of today will not have the opportunity to make contact with their children because of the prevalence of abortion in the Western world. While I support the Bill fully, we should examine my concern with it on Committee Stage, namely, that we should not introduce the unintended consequence of mothers adopting the modern and shameful practice of abortion out of a fear that their identities might be exposed. We should try to avoid that. The Bill is a step in the right direction and I hope that the Minister will see it all the way through to its enactment. People should and will have an entitlement to their identities. This is everyone's human right.</p>

          <p eId="para_410">I welcome the Bill and congratulate Senator Power on the way in which she spoke, both today and previously, about her personal experience. That is to be commended. It is a difficult thing to do, so well done to her.</p>
          <p eId="para_411"> I will not repeat what people have stated, but Senator van Turnhout referred to the burning desire to know one's identity. This is considerable for someone who is adopted. Not many children are adopted these days. As such, we are referring to the past. Women gave up their babies for adoption for several reasons. Often, they did so out of shame and because of the term "fallen woman".</p>
          <p eId="para_412"> I wish to discuss the people who go through the process of finding their mothers only to find the latter do not want to meet them. This is difficult for any adoptee. In the past week, I was contacted by a lady who told me that, after 30 years, she had found her mother. She had one meeting with mother, who told her that no one knew about her. She has brothers and sisters, but her mother told her that she would not tell them about their sibling. That is shockingly sad. When discussing matters such as this Bill, it is important to remember those adoptees who will never find their mothers. The people with whom I have spoken tend to look for their mothers before their fathers.</p>
          <p eId="para_413"> I welcome the Bill and look forward to it being before the Oireachtas health committee. I am pleased that the Senators named on the Bill have introduced it. Since this is a sensitive issue, I do not want other matters brought into the discussion as happened today. We are discussing the past but seeking to move into the future. I hope we do so in a meaningful and, most of all, respectful way.</p>

          <p eId="para_414">I commend the three Senators who introduced the Bill as well as those who have contributed to the debate so far. I also welcome the Minister.</p>
          <p eId="para_415">Sinn Féin welcomes this Bill and we are happy to support it. We agree with the sentiments of the Adoption Rights Alliance that it represents an important first step towards equality for adopted people in Ireland. For far too long, the Irish State and successive Governments and religious institutions have colluded to deny these people their rights as both children and adults. </p>
          <p eId="para_416"> In the past three years, we have heard in this House and in the Dáil horrendous stories of decades of neglect and abuse and the denial of the most basic of rights to single women and their children while in the so-called care of the various religious orders and the State. The mother and baby homes, the Magdalen laundries, orphanages and industrial schools brought together a system of forced labour, extreme violence, and physical, sexual and emotional abuse in a system that had more in common with gulags and concentration camps than with the care and well-being of women and children. As a nation and a State, we have only just begun to come to terms with the legacy of this awful time. Therefore, there is an onus on all of us, but especially on legislators, to ensure that people whose human rights have thus far been denied them as a result of this system are now guaranteed. </p>
          <p eId="para_417"> It is in this context that I welcome today's legislation which ensures that adopted people will from here on have the same rights as everyone else to access their birth certificates and other personal records once they reach 18 years of age. The Bill also assists adopted people and their birth parents to exchange contact details if they so wish. It also ensures the exchange of information from birth parents to their children regarding their family medical history. </p>
          <p eId="para_418"> The Bill establishes a central record under the auspices of the adoption authority where all records pertaining to adoption in Ireland from agencies, religious congregations, mother and baby homes, and so forth, will now be held. This is a very important practical step, but it is also hugely symbolic. We know, for example, that the gulag system was based on secrecy, shame and on state and institutional abuse of the most basic human rights of women and their children. A central feature of the entire system was a denial of people's humanity. Official records matter and they are more than just a piece of paper. At a very fundamental level, they acknowledge a person's existence. They give people a past and a sense of connectedness to a family history. In a very human sense, people have a lineage and are not all alone in the world. Therefore, I support this Bill. </p>
          <p eId="para_419"> There are a number of flaws in the Bill which have been articulated and I would accept that. That is what Committee Stage is about. If we feel the thrust of the Bill, the logic of the Bill, is important and that it is one that should be pursued, we should support it. Any difficulties we have with the Bill, including from the Government's side, can be addressed on Committee Stage. Therefore, I appeal to the Government to accept the Bill and to move it along. If the Government has concerns, as Sinn Féin does, let us use Committee Stage to address those concerns. However, let us support this Bill today and send out a message to those people who have been abused and let down by the State that we are on their side and that we will ensure that the mistakes of the past are corrected as best we can. </p>

          <from>Senator Mary Moran<recordedTime time="2014-11-19T18:00:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_420">I welcome the Minister to the House for the debate. I commend Senators Power, van Turnhout and Healy Eames on bringing this Bill forward. I am delighted the Minister will be supporting the motion and that we all will be supporting it. It is very important. I look forward to it going before the Oireachtas Committee on Health and Children. It is a very important Bill. Movement on the issue of access to information for adopted people and their natural parents is something that is a long time coming - from successive Governments - and I impress on the Minister the frustration that has deepened year on year for individuals who are affected by this.</p>
          <p eId="para_421"> I am delighted to support the Bill and the fact that the Minister will also be supporting it and referring it to the Committee on Health and Children. I welcome the intention to finalise the scheme and the heads of Bill as soon as possible. I hope this can be achieved for the sake of the many thousands of people who at present and into the future want access to their information, essentially their identity. </p>
          <p eId="para_422"> I received dozens of e-mails, as I know all my colleagues have, over the last few weeks, from people whose lives have been touched by adoption. Reading through the thoughts of these people was eye-opening for me. I am grateful to the people who contacted me and shared their very personal experiences and their frustrations regarding the difficulty in accessing their information, particularly their original birth certificates. Access to a birth certificate is something we take for granted. I receive numerous e-mails highlighting the great difficulty adopted people have in accessing their birth certificates, often spending many years researching and travelling to find out more information about themselves. There was one particular remark in an e-mail from an adoptee that struck me. The individual stated, "I am thirty years of age and I do not know what weight I was when I was born". It is a very simple sentence but it is particularly poignant. From my own experience, my own children would ask me on what day they were born, what weight they were, what they did. It is something very personal and so small - it is only a small detail - but is something very important. This person further highlighted the embarrassment that is felt when asked for a medical history by a doctor, as they do not know it. The relationship of the natural parent and the child is a matter which should be decided between them, with the assistance of a third party if necessary. Access to vital documents and information such as birth certificates and medical records needs to be urgently addressed. </p>
          <p eId="para_423"> Another adoptee who contacted me stated that as an adopted person who has searched for his mother, he firmly believes that greater transparency is needed to aid people in the search for their natural families. He told me he found his mother through dogged determination and hours of looking through birth records and that this does not need to be the case. He told me people will find their families without this Bill but the way things are now, they are a recipe for heartache. He said people are made to feel like they are wrong to want to find their birth family and asked whether, at the end of the day, it is not a person's right as a human being to know where one comes from? </p>
          <p eId="para_424"> I would challenge anyone to not feel disappointed with the services we are currently providing for individuals across the spectrum in relation to adoption. No one should be made to feel like they are wrong for wanting to know about themselves and where they came from. We need to provide the support and services necessary to those women, children and siblings who are searching for each other and more information about themselves. In recent years, we have attempted to deal with the past in relation to the Magdalen laundries and, more recently, symphysiotomy. Those women who were sent to mother and baby homes and those children who were adopted from a mother and baby home should have the opportunity to avail of a service which would assist, within set parameters, with gathering information, tracing or communication. Equally, all people affected by adoption and seeking information should have similar access to such a service. </p>
          <p eId="para_425"> I wish to also mention Philomena Lee who is a person who has highlighted this issue more than anyone in recent years. When the book and the film came out, it was a wonderful opportunity to open up the issue, particularly to younger generations who are maybe not as aware of adoption and things that have happened with adoption. I wish to publicly commend her for her courage and bravery in coming forward with her tragic story, which could so very easily have been avoided. </p>
          <p eId="para_426"> On a personal note, I know the joy that can be involved in finding one's birth parents. It happened a few years ago to a very good friend of mine who I never knew was adopted and who himself did not know until both his parents died. It was a very sad story where the mother had her son at a very young age. Her parents put her straight into a mother and baby home. Several years later she married the father of the child. They went on to have three other children, one of whom - his sister - unfortunately died when she was approximately 14 years of age. Through the change in recent years, and years and years of searching for each other, they did find each other. This brought joy, absolute joy, to this person. They were lucky unlike the person Senator Henry mentioned. There is joy in being able to find out one has siblings and of being able to find one's mother and father.</p>
          <p eId="para_427">It is unbelievable. Everybody should have the opportunity to find out who they are.</p>

          <p eId="para_428">I welcome the Minister, Deputy Reilly. I echo all that has been reflected in today's contributions. There is a great deal of understanding of Senator Power's position. It cannot have been an easy journey for her in terms of drafting the Bill. I am sure she constantly relied on and received great co-operation from Senators van Turnhout and Healy Eames in drafting the Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_429"> Notwithstanding what Senator Henry said, I will drift into another area. Listening to the contributions and reading through parts of the Bill, I was struck by the fact that it is a celebration of life. It is a celebration of Senator Power's life in the sense that her mother chose to give birth. In contemporary Ireland there are so many pressures on mothers to take a different route. I know it is a horrible thought, but let us suppose her mother had chosen to take that other route. This is not a judgment. As Pope Francis said, who am I to judge the circumstances in which an expectant mother finds herself and the choices she might wish to make. Sadly, it is happening every day of the week, not in this country but next door. I could not help but think that it is a wonderful, joyous thing that this Bill is about life and the celebration of life. In a sense, it is attempting to square a circle, to fill in a missing gap for adopted children who wish to know their identity and background.</p>
          <p eId="para_430"> It must be a very painful experience when one becomes aware as a child that one is adopted. As Senator Walsh said, the warmth and Christian attitude of the parents who chose to adopt and the love they gave is evident. It is obvious that Senator Power is a very well-rounded person and sees this as an opportunity for her to reach out and help other adopted children who perhaps are not as blessed as she is in terms of her identity. I raised questions in previous discussions on the subject of timing and parents’ rights, but all of that is swept away in the context of what the Bill attempts to do and the reality of what faces an adopted person. That is on one side of the equation.</p>
          <p eId="para_431"> I fully support all that has been proposed in the Bill. I see it in the same way as Senator van Turnhout, as a basic human right. One should know one’s background and what is on one’s birth certificate. One could ask why it has taken so long for any Government to introduce such legislation in light of our neighbour’s experience. I recall being in this House when a former colleague, Senator Catherine McGuinness, raised the issue on a number of occasions. It was a very emotional thing for her to do, namely, to put on the record that she was an adopted child and look for some change and improvement at the time. That did not happen.</p>
          <p eId="para_432"> There is a great onus on the Minister, Deputy Reilly, to see the Bill through this time and to be the Minister responsible for that. He does not lack a sense of purpose. When he gets the bit between his teeth on an issue, he is like a dog with a bone, as he proved with his position on smoking, labelling and the legislation on sunbeds. He is to be commended on those issues which form part of his legacy. Good luck to him in that regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_433"> I am also interested in the other side of the equation, namely, the response of the natural mother. I note those who drafted the Bill were very sensitive in this area. If the natural mother decides not to become involved, there is nothing one can do about it. No law in the land will do anything about it. Is it not a cruel vista to imagine that an adopted child who wishes to know about his or her medical history cannot find out because the natural mother decides she does not want to revisit what might have been a very painful period in her life? I do not say that is a flaw in the legislation but encouragement must be provided in order that even if a natural mother does not want to make contact with an adopted child, at least she would be in a position to provide relevant information that could then be passed on through the adoption agency. There must be an independent stand-alone agency to deal with such matters and to process them in a sensitive manner. What I outlined are not flaws, as such, but they are difficulties that present, and even with the passage of the legislation they would still be faced by adoptive children, but at least the main thrust of the Bill, if implemented, would go a long way towards addressing a long-standing sore.</p>
          <p eId="para_434"> Many speakers have referred to Philomena Lee. There is no question but the film influenced me. It is a powerful testament of a history of which we should be at least questioning if not ashamed. It is difficult to imagine how such a thing could have happened in a so-called Christian country among people who profess Christianity and who presented themselves as better Christians than the rest of us. I do not understand how people did such horrible things to women who found themselves in the same situation as Philomena, whose children were effectively sold, and the situation was compounded by not allowing them to know what had happened to the children. I accept we are talking about the past rather than the future, but it was a cruel thing and for that reason if no other, the Bill is not only worthy of support but, morally and in every other way, must be supported.</p>

          <p eId="para_435">I was not going to speak but it would be remiss of me not to say something. I was previously asked to speak but I hesitated. My presence here today is an indication of my full support for the Bill. I congratulate Senators Power, van Turnhout and Healy Eames.</p>
          <p eId="para_436"> The point has been made by previous speakers that the Bill is important for genetic reasons alone. I recognise the difficulties for some mothers and their right to privacy and to remain anonymous if they so wish. I agree with Senator van Turnhout’s point that the Bill reaches out to every household in the country. The right to know who one is is a basic human right. Some adopted children do not wish to trace their parents for whatever reason, and that is also their right. Change is long overdue.</p>
          <p eId="para_437"> I was considered to be adopted. I was one of four children and my mother died when she was 30. I was adopted by my granny and we were farmed out to other uncles and aunts. It was a different form of adoption but I recognise how difficult it was in those days.</p>
          <p eId="para_438">I know my parents but there are people who do not know their parents. I know who was good to me over the years and who helped in those important years. </p>
          <p eId="para_439"> Every child has the right to know their identity. It is a basic human right and I wish this Bill every success. I shall listen attentively to what reasons the Minster or the Government may have as to why it should not get unanimous support in both Houses. Acceptance of this legislation would be a major achievement for this Seanad and I congratulate my colleagues for bringing it forward. Those sentiments are from my heart. Go raibh maith agat. </p>

          <p eId="para_440">I welcome the Minister to the House and welcome the visitors seated in the Visitors Gallery. I acknowledge and commend the work of Dr. Fergus Ryan who is in the Visitors Gallery because he had a large part to play in the drafting of the Bill. I commend Senators Power, van Turnhout and Healy Eames for their work in preparing the Bill and presenting it to us this evening. They have given us an opportunity to speak on a very important issue. There is real consensus in the House on the need for such legislation. I am delighted that the Government will support the Bill on Second Stage and the fact that it supports the principles behind the legislation.</p>
          <p eId="para_441"> It is very good to see another Seanad Private Members' Bill supported and accepted in this way by Government. We have had a precedent for this with quite a number of other Bills, which colleagues on both sides are well aware of. Both Opposition and Government Members Bills have been adopted by Government, either adopted fully by Government or parts incorporated into later Government Bills. Either way, the important thing is that we have contributed to the making of legislation in the most direct way which is hugely important.</p>
          <p eId="para_442"> The right to an identity is an important issue. Many colleagues have spoken eloquently about their personal or family experiences. I do not have that direct experience but as a practitioner, as a practising barrister in the past, I did a lot of work representing survivors of abuse before the Residential Institutions Redress Board. For many of the people whom I represented, and who had spent time in institutions as children, the right to an identity was critical. In many cases the search for information about their birth parents and origins was a hugely important part of their resolution of the issues around abuse and the institutionalisation that they had endured. On a practical level as a legal representative, the difficulty in seeking to obtain information was immense in many cases with all sorts of obstructionism from different bodies - statutory, non-statutory, State and non-State agencies. I also wish to acknowledge the important work done by groups like Barnardos in assisting people and giving support in tracing identity.</p>
          <p eId="para_443"> This Bill seeks to address not only the core issue of the right to identity and access to personal documentation, such as birth certificates and medical records, but it also addresses the issues around the practical arrangements of access to information. The legislation provides, for example, for the centralisation of adoption records in one place. I know from experience that such an initiative is a hugely important part of the process of seeking information.</p>
          <p eId="para_444"> There are complex issues on the balancing of rights. For example, the right to privacy when we talk about retrospective adoptions or adoptions in the past. It is much easier to legislate for adoptions that will occur in the future where there will be knowledge of the legislation conditions whereby information will be obtainable. We are dealing with situations, and I have spoken with colleagues and with Senator Power and all of us are aware, where people have never spoken about birth parents or having given a child up for adoption. There are sensitivities that must be respected. </p>
          <p eId="para_445"> This Bill achieves a careful balancing of the rights at stake. It does not trespass on the privacy of those individuals who wish to have privacy respected and it is not just the parents. As Senator Power has also acknowledged, there may be children whose birth parents have searched for them and who do not wish to have records released. That is a sensitivity that needs to be respected.</p>
          <p eId="para_446"> The Bill ensures that both adoptees and natural parents may accept or decline for their contact details to be released but there cannot be a veto on the release of the birth certificate which is important. It is also important that the Bill provides for reasonable time limits that are not too short because there may be very difficult issues involved in accessing information, particularly where people do not wish to be contacted. The Bill also makes provision for supports to be provided where information is sought. </p>
          <p eId="para_447"> The Bill is well constructed and well drafted. I know the Government is working on the heads of a Bill and that many of the issues in this Bill will also be addressed by the Government. There are issues around the management of adoption records, which this Bill addresses, the circumstances for provision of information, issues around both retrospective and prospective adoption, and issues around support services for those who are involved in accessing information and tracing identities. There is a good deal of work which is being done at Government level but today's Bill will assist in that work. I hope that we will see, before too long, the culmination of that work in legislation that is passed into law and goes beyond Second Stage. I hope that this Bill will progress further and I am delighted that we can all support it tonight in the House. </p>

We should acknowledge their bravery. We should make this Bill work instead of finding issues and technical issues that will hold it up.

          <p eId="para_452">Sorry, got pregnant some time after her husband died. The woman was taken from the farm that she had been left, she was placed in a mental hospital, her two sons were sent to Letterfrack and her daughter was sent to America. The child that was born as a result was sent to be fostered. It so happened that a relation of mine who happened to be in Merlin Park Hospital met the child 75 years later and on hearing his name said "My God, I have a cousin with the same name". That means a brother and half-brother lived within 20 miles of one another for 75 years but never knew of each other's existence. Let us not play games with this Bill and get it passed because 50,000 in this country are waiting for this to happen. I ask the Minister to do whatever it takes and use his good offices to ensure the Bill is brought the full way through the Oireachtas and passed.</p>
          <p eId="para_453"> Again, I compliment Senator Power on the very brave thing she has done today and congratulate her. I am proud to be in this House on the day that somebody brought forward such a Bill. Congratulations, Senator.</p>

          <p eId="para_455">Ba mhaith liom tacú leis an méid a bhí le rá ag an Seanadóir Ó Creachmhaoil. Caithfimid leanúint ar aghaidh leis an mBille seo agus caithfimid é a chur tríd na céimeanna sa Teach seo go dtí go dtéann sé go dtí an Dáil. Táimse ag súil nach dtéann an Bille seo go dtí an coiste. Beidh deis ansin rudaí a mhoilliú agus an dul chun cinn sa Bhille seo a stopadh. Tá an baol sin ann.</p>
          <p eId="para_456"> Ba mhaith liom m'ómós a chur in iúl don Seanadóir de Paor. Mar a dúirt an Seanadóir Ó Creachmhaoil, is rud an-chrógach a rinne sí anseo inniu agus a scéal féin á chur ós comhair an phobail agus í ag úsáid a taithí féin agus a scéal féin chun rudaí a dhéanamh níos fearr do dhaoine eile agus an cás céanna acu. Bhí a lán rudaí a tharla in Éirinn fadó nach raibh ceart. Rinneadh na rudaí sin ag an am ar fáthanna a bhí ceart ag an am. Tá a lán grá ann. Tá a lán brón ann freisin maidir leis an ábhar seo. Tá roinnt daoine trína chéile ach, mar a dúirt an Seanadóir de Paor cheana féin, ní chóir do dhaoine bheith ag mothú trína chéile nó bheith buartha faoin reachtaíocht seo, má chuirfear i bhfeidhm í.</p>
          <p eId="para_457">Ba cheart go mbeadh áthas ar dhaoine go bhfuil an Oireachtas seo ag obair i gceart. Nach mbeadh an áit seo i bhfad níos fearr dá mbeadh an Teach eile ag obair mar seo agus dá mbeadh an Seanad ag obair mar seo i bhfad níos mó, sa chaoi go mb'fhéidir go mbeimis ag caint faoi Chéim an Choiste maidir leis an mBille seo an tseachtain seo chugainn nó an tseachtain ina dhiaidh sin?</p>
          <p eId="para_458"> Táimse ag tacaíocht leis an mBille. Táim ag iarraidh m'omós freisin a chur in iúl don Dochtúir Ó Riain. Tá aithne agam air ó Choláiste na Tríonóide agus is dlíodóir agus abhcóide den scoth é i Maigh Nuad anois. Nach bhfuil sé go hiontach go bhfuil daoine ar nós an Dochtúir Ó Riain in ann a lán ama a chur isteach i saothar mar seo ar son an phobail agus ar son na tíre?</p>
          <p eId="para_459"> Táim ag rá go géar leis an Aire - agus measaim féin go n-aontóidh mo pháirtí agus mo chomhghleacaithe liom, ach beidh an Seanadóir de Paor in ann labhairt agus a tuairim féin a chur in iúl ag deireadh na díospóireachta seo - nár cheart an Bille seo a chur go dtí an Coiste Sláinte. Measaim gur cheart an próiseas a leanúint sa Seanad agus go mb'fhéidir go rachaimid ar aghaidh go Chéim an Choiste an tseachtain seo chugainn nó an tseachtain ina dhiaidh sin.

        <speech by="#DrJamesReilly" as="#Minister_for_Children_and_Youth_Affairs" eId="spk_126">
          <from>Minister for Children and Youth Affairs (Deputy James Reilly)<recordedTime time="2014-11-19T18:30:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_460">I thank the Seanad for the opportunity to debate this important matter. I thank Senators Power, van Turnhout and Healy Eames for the time and effort they put into developing this Private Members’ Bill, as well as to Dr. Fergus Ryan, the legal expert who provided assistance in this process.</p>
          <p eId="para_461"> It is often the case legal instruments lag behind current thinking in a particular domain. This is especially true for adoption. My predecessor has already decided not to oppose a Private Members’ Bill proposed by Deputy Anne Ferris dealing with open adoption. At that time it was noted the practice was for more open adoption arrangements, even though Irish adoption legislation did not provide for it. I do not intend to oppose this Bill either.</p>
          <p eId="para_462"> The history of adoption in Ireland and worldwide means that it is often portrayed in a very negative light. We should be mindful, however, that many have had a positive experience of adoption. I recently attended the annual conference of the International Adoption Association, an Irish support group for Irish prospective adopters involved in inter-country adoption. Presentations were made at that conference by four adopted people and by a family who had adopted several children. P.J. Gallagher, the well-known, newspaper-wielding comedian, was one of those adoptees. All asked that the positive aspects of adoption be highlighted. All stated the love of their adopted parents was the most important thing in their lives.</p>
          <p eId="para_463"> The most appropriate and ideal scenario is that a child is reared by its natural parents. We also have to recognise, however, that where that is not possible, appropriate long-term placement solutions have to include adoption. This includes children placed here through inter-country adoption who may otherwise spend long periods of their lives in residential or care settings that do not afford the loving and nurturing environment that a permanent family care setting can bring. Many of those seeking information about their natural parents have emphasised the support they got from their adoptive parents in their quest for information. Senator Healy Eames made that very clear earlier. We must all be mindful of the responsibilities of adoptive parents in regard to assisting children when they start to ask questions about their background and identity.</p>
          <p eId="para_464"> I have also met many people who have been adversely affected by the adoption regime that existed in Ireland in the last century. These include people who discovered late in life that the people they thought were their birth parents were in fact not. There are people who, decades later, still have not been able to reconnect with a birth parent or child. There are women who never saw the baby they delivered. There are women who had no option, regrettably, but to give up a baby whose loss they would mourn for the rest of their lives. There are many women who simply had their babies taken from them.</p>
          <p eId="para_465"> The statistical evidence of the national adoption contact preference register is that mothers whose children were adopted in the 1940s, 1950s and 1960s have not come forward in significant numbers, even if only to provide important medical information to the child they had to give up. Since I became Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, I have met many adoption groups and heard many painful stories of how young mothers were bullied and cajoled as their babies were taken from them. They were led to believe they would be in breach of the law of God and man if they ever tried to make contact with their child. With this in mind, I strongly encourage those mothers to contact the Adoption Authority of Ireland to assist with the provision of medical information. I also encourage them to consider making contact with Tusla, or the Adoption Authority of Ireland, where they will be afforded confidentiality, care and empathy, as well as the opportunity to get professional counselling about a period of their life that I am sure still causes them pain.</p>
          <p eId="para_466"> I have asked officials in my Department to examine the Adoption (Identity and Information) Bill 2014. There is much to commend in it. Regarding the areas of concern it addresses, it is very much in line with the tenor of the draft Bill being prepared in my Department. However, the regime envisaged in the Private Members’ Bill differs in that it does not differentiate between prospective and retrospective adoptions. In that respect, it does not address the complex constitutional issues that arise in the provision of identifying information to those who were adopted under the Adoption Act 1952.</p>
          <p eId="para_467"> I envisage a comprehensive restructuring of the adoption information and tracing service including the following matters which go beyond the provisions of this Private Members’ Bill: it will set out the information to be provided and circumstances in which it can be provided both for retrospective and prospective adoptions; it will set out arrangements for the management of adoption records; place the national adoption contact preference register on a statutory basis; and provide for information and tracing supports.</p>
          <p eId="para_468"> My overall policy objective in bringing forward proposed legislation on adoption information and tracing has always been to provide people affected by adoption with access to as much information as possible. I intend to be explicit about the information that will have to be retained for future adoptions. I will ensure that, on reaching adulthood, any person whose adoption is registered in Ireland will have access to identifying information. This will require a radical overhaul of the Adoption Act 2010. In future adoptions, birth parents and prospective adoptive parents will be aware from the outset that, on reaching adulthood, an adopted person will be provided with full identifying information on request.</p>
          <p eId="para_469"> It is clear any legal measures will have to be supported by improved processes and services to facilitate people affected by adoption to have greater access to birth records where the law permits it. All records relating to adoption, including less formal care arrangements that operated historically, will be managed and maintained on a statutory basis in a secure and appropriate fashion.</p>
          <p eId="para_470"> I intend to put the national contact preference register on a statutory basis. This will secure the register in the future, provide consistency in the information gathered for the register and will allow the register to operate proactively. The issue of inter-country adoption and future tracing needs for those children adopted from outside Ireland will need careful consideration. Since 1991, nearly 50% of all adoptions processed by the Adoption Authority of Ireland were inter-country adoptions.</p>
          <p eId="para_471">These children become Irish citizens, and it is imperative that every effort is made to ensure their access to identifying information when they ask for it. The Senators' Bill also provides for counselling for persons involved in the information and tracing process. I assure Senators that counselling is central to current and future service provision.</p>
          <p eId="para_472"> It is critical that everyone affected by adoption who approaches the Adoption Authority, the Child and Family Agency, or accredited service providers is offered appropriate support and is treated with sensitivity and understanding. Counselling is provided by professional staff and is often provided long after the tracing process has been addressed, because adoption is a lifelong story. In the legislation I am preparing I intend to ensure that counselling and support is offered to everyone who needs and wants it.</p>
          <p eId="para_473"> The legal advice I have received indicates that a right to know one's identity flows from the legal relationship between a birth mother and her child. However, the effect of an adoption order is to restrict that right to know. Thus, there is a difficulty surrounding the notion that a birth mother's constitutional right to privacy can be dispensed with or retrospectively changed by new legislation. The proposed adoption (tracing and information) Bill 2014 will be explicit on the information that must be provided for all future adoptions. All who consent to an adoption will be fully aware of the information that will be available to an adopted person, on request, once he or she reaches 18 years of age.</p>
          <p eId="para_474"> In regard to adoptions that have taken place in the past, the issue is far more complex. I am advised that the proposed legislation can provide for retrospective identifying information to be given to an adopted person, but some restrictions must apply in relation to birth mothers who wish to protect their right to privacy. I look forward to working with the Senators to progress this issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_475"> The Department will continue to engage with the Office of the Attorney General in finalising the legislation on adoption information and tracing being prepared by the Department. As soon as this work is concluded I intend to seek Government approval to refer the general scheme and heads of the adoption (tracing and information) Bill to the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Health and Children for consideration.</p>
          <p eId="para_476"> The programme for Government contains a commitment to enact legislation to consolidate and reform the law on adoption. The constitutional referendum on children incorporated an important provision proposing to amend the Irish Constitution to widen the scope for the adoption of children of marriage in Ireland. To coincide with this referendum, a general scheme and heads of a draft adoption (amendment) Bill 2012 was published. This showed, using the format of a detailed Bill, the Government's legislative proposals in the event that the amendment of the Constitution is passed. Senators are aware that there are outstanding proceedings in the courts that prevent the finalisation of the constitutional amendment. It is my intention to introduce the adoption (amendment) Bill to facilitate the adoption of children of marriage as soon as these constitutional matters are completed. Furthermore, the issue of step-parent adoption is under review, and I hope it can be addressed in the context of the children and family relationships Bill. The policy intention is to include provisions for step-parent adoption without requiring a child's mother or father to also adopt his or her own child.</p>
          <p eId="para_477"> I commend all those who have heightened the recent focus on adoption and issues related to the historic care of children. The efforts of Deputy Anne Ferris and Senators Power, van Turnhout and Healy Eames have done much to inform the debate. They and others have highlighted the fact that adopted persons have a lifelong and evolving adoption story and the need for adopted persons to investigate that story. My priority is to enact adoption legislation following from the children's referendum and to provide for legislation on adoption information and tracing. In line with the commitment in the programme for Government, it is timely that a review of adoption law more generally takes place with a view to its modernisation.</p>
          <p eId="para_478"> I hope that this review, my own consideration of the Act, submissions received from stakeholders and the contents of the Bills proposed by Senators Power, van Turnhout and Healy Eames, and Deputy Anne Ferris previously, will all inform the reform process for adoption legislation in Ireland. Consideration of all these issues by the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Health and Children will greatly facilitate progress on this very important component of the modernisation of adoption law. I know this issue causes a lot of pain and I know the great need people have to know their identity. I look forward to working with the Senators to progress this. I thank all the Senators, but in particular Senator Power for her contribution to and work on the Bill. No one can doubt her commitment, courage or sincerity on this issue.</p>

          <p eId="para_479">I wholeheartedly thank Senators Burke and Moloney who were the main Government spokespersons on this issue. I know they researched and thought through the Bill before deciding to support it. I also note that in their opening remarks they said this Bill should be allowed to move forward and be amended if necessary on Committee Stage. I appreciate that they said we should all work to help progress it and I look forward to working with them and other Members to do that. I thank every other Senator who contributed to this debate, all of whom spoke with interest and sincerity. Senator Brennan shared his own story, which is difficult to do. In speaking out I feel that I am in a position to do something. I have been fortunate enough to find my mum and this Bill will not make any difference to me, but it would be wrong for me to be in this position and not use it to achieve something positive. That has been my motivation but I know it is difficult and I appreciate that Senator Brennan chose to do that today. It is important to use our personal experience to make a difference to other people. Senators mentioned e-mails they have received over recent weeks and I thank them for reading those and engaging with, and listening to, people.</p>
          <p eId="para_480"> Senator Henry pointed out that reunion does not always work well. That is true but there are many positive stories. Many women contacted me who were petrified for years that somebody would find out and who did not tell their families or their children. When their adult son or daughter contacted them and they told the family, the family could not believe they had not been told. The response was, “You are my mum, I love you. I can’t believe it. This isn’t 1953, this is 2014. Why would you carry that pain, why wouldn’t you let us carry it with you? Why wouldn’t you reach out and talk?” That has been the experience of the majority of women and it is important to note that too.</p>
          <p eId="para_481"> The Bill provides that everybody is different but it provides the right safeguards and supports to enable people to do that. That is far better than the enforced silence and failure to deal with it that we have had to date. I note the Minister said that legislation can provide for retrospective identifying information to be given to the adopted person. That is indeed the case. He distinguished between retrospective and prospective adoptions. I welcome the fact that he is speaking more strongly about future adoptions and that he is working towards an open adoption system. There are, however, 50,000 people who were adopted in the past and we must do right by them. While the number of people adopted in this country now is tiny, all of those adoptions should be open. The issue that needs to be grasped is how to reach out to people who were the subject of secretive, forced adoptions and help adopted people find their own identities and help mothers find comfort by reuniting with their lost children.</p>
          <p eId="para_482"> I am extremely disappointed by the Minister's statement that instead of adopting this Bill he will consider it as part of the work on the information and tracing Bill which the Government promised almost four years ago and which we have not seen. The Government has just over a year to run. That legislation will take time to come through. Philomena Lee’s son died before she found him. Other people have had the same experience. These women are not getting any younger. Every day that passes is one on which somebody else misses that opportunity. There is a Bill before the House today. As Senator Craughwell said, it would be wrong to take the typical Government-Opposition line and say thanks for drafting an excellent Bill, thanks to Fergus Ryan for reading through all the constitutional issues, we will take it on board but we will draft our own Bill.</p>

          <p eId="para_484">There is no need to do that. We have cross-party support across the House. I know there are Members in the Government parties who feel strongly about this as well and want to progress it as much as I do. I would be happy to have input from the Minister if he has amendments to suggest on Committee Stage, or if the health committee, interest groups or anyone else wants to feed into that. My intention is that we continue as a House to progress this legislation, to take Committee Stage. I hope that colleagues will embrace that process and work with us. We need to put aside the typical old politics of Government versus Opposition and all work together on this. As I said at the start, this is a particularly important area that should be far above party politics. We should all be putting our heads together and working on it. I welcome the two Government spokespersons' statements to that effect at the outset and I look forward to working with them.</p>

            <p eId="para_487">I thank the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Jan O'Sullivan, for being here. She knows that the secondary school teachers are going on strike in December and January with very good reason, because they want the junior certificate externally examined in all subjects and forms of subjects. They do not want 40% internal examination regardless of what the 40% entails.</p>
            <p eId="para_488"> Teachers are in favour of new forms of assessment and new proposals and they welcome all new forms of practice. Down through the years they have initiated great creative and imaginative practices on practical assessments in their own subject disciplines. Many subjects have practical assessment procedures at their core, for example, science, art, history, CSPE, music and languages. However, these are always externally assessed. That is the key to their success and the key to why all students regard the State examination as relevant. It is also why teachers are going on strike. They are going on strike to maintain the truth of the external examination assessment, keep it above reproach, maintain its human objectivity, keep it at arm's length nationally, maintain national standardisation and above all to maintain its national honesty. They are in favour of all kinds of procedures in the future. They are not in favour of internal assessment.</p>
            <p eId="para_489"> There is a national impasse and the teachers are correct. I am going to be backing them. The reason the Minister is here today is to possibly tell me how the impasse is going to be resolved and what she intends to do about it because the teachers are experts and correct. The Department is not.</p>

            <p eId="para_490">Cuirim fáilte roimh an Aire. I am not going to ask the Minister to debate the issues she is negotiating with the unions here in public, nor am I trying to negotiate on behalf of the union that I once headed up as president. I know she has noted that members of the unions are in the Gallery.</p>
            <p eId="para_491"> I want to bring a very simple scenario to the Minister. For the sake of argument, let us take Rathkeale in County Limerick, where if children do not want to go to the secondary school in the town they have to go to Newcastle West or into Limerick. There are teachers living in the area assessing those children. Let me give an example of a case of which I have personal experience. A teacher with four daughters is living in a village where his father runs a shop with petrol pumps and an undertakers business. The four daughters have to go through their father's English, history and Irish classes because there is no other teacher to teach those subjects. Imagine if one of those daughters gets an A. The Minister can just imagine the talk in the village, "Ah sure why would she not get an A, with the father teaching above in the school". Imagine one of the next-door neighbours gets a D. That family will not be buying petrol in the teacher's father's shop any more. They will probably look elsewhere to bury their parents because the teacher gave their child a D. </p>
            <p eId="para_492"> The Minister has come a great distance from where we were and I congratulate her. She has done a tremendous job, but there is one small final step that needs to be taken. The 40% that she is proposing will be administered by the teachers in the school by way of compiling portfolios, and the portfolio should then be sent out for assessment as is currently done with 14 other subjects. Science would be a good case in point. If she makes that last little step, we will have peace in our schools and everybody will get back to work. </p>

            <p eId="para_493">I thank Senators O'Donnell and Craughwell for raising this issue. Since my appointment as Minister, I have consulted widely with all education partners on the proposed reform of the junior cycle. I have met with parents, students, management bodies, school leaders and teachers' unions. To progress the debate, it was agreed that Department officials would meet with the teachers' unions. Dr. Pauric Travers was nominated by the teaching unions to act as an independent chair for these discussions, and I accepted the timeframe and terms of reference for those talks which were proposed by the unions. The talks began on Friday, 7 November and concluded on Tuesday, 11 November without agreement.</p>
            <p eId="para_494"> I believe that I tabled a fair and sensible compromise proposal at the discussions, and I thank Senator Craughwell for his acknowledgement of the progress that I did make. I met the teachers' unions again this morning. However, I regret to note that there has been little movement in their position. A significant gap still remains. I reiterated my proposal which was presented to them last week. I highlighted that I am anxious to engage with them in relation to the resources required to support the implementation of these reforms, but based on my compromise proposals.</p>
            <p eId="para_495"> The previous framework proposed the removal of state certification from the junior cycle and would have seen 100% of marks assessed by the class teacher in most subjects.</p>
            <p eId="para_496">The main elements of my compromise proposals included final examinations in third year accounting for 60% of junior cycle marks, which would be set and marked by the State Examinations Commission; a State certificate would issue to every student on completion of the junior cycle; 40% of junior cycle marks would be awarded for project or portfolio work during second and third year, which would be assessed by classroom teachers, and the State Examinations Commission, SEC, would check 10-15% of these marks to ensure consistency and fairness; and well-being would be a compulsory element of junior cycle, encompassing areas such as physical education, SPHE and CSPE.</p>
            <p eId="para_497"> Evidence shows that the current structure of the examination does not serve the best interests of students. The skills young people need for life - such as communications, teamwork and problem-solving - cannot be tested by a final written examination. Assessment practices must change to measure these broader skills. School-based assessment will give students the opportunity to demonstrate their many skills, other than those assessed through a written terminal examination. Unless assessment changes, teaching and learning practices in the classroom will not change. If it is only knowledge that we assess at the end point of three years, then the development of skills and attitudes will be, at best, incidental. Our students need these skills to create new solutions to problems, to be confident in themselves, to apply their unique abilities in different situations, to contribute to society in meaningful ways, and to assist Ireland in the future to compete in a global market.</p>
            <p eId="para_498"> Teachers will be given specific support to enable them to confidently and competently mark their own students and to participate in school-based moderation. This will be done through the continuing professional development, CPD, programmes run by the Junior Cycle for Teachers, JCT, along with National Council for Curriculum and Assessment, NCCA - apologies for all the acronyms - resources, including the assessment and moderation toolkit. It will also include checks of 10% to 15% of material by the SEC to further ensure consistency and fairness.</p>
            <p eId="para_499"> Having a substantial element of school-based assessment encourages the teaching and accrediting of a broader range of skills. Similar reforms have been introduced in Scotland, Finland, Australia and New Zealand - all countries with high-performing education systems. In Ireland we have been talking about junior cycle reform for nearly 30 years. It is high time that we took action. I am convinced that my proposal will allow for the broad range of skills achieved by students at second level to be assessed and reflected in their results. It will also respect the concerns of teachers. It is regrettable that the union leadership is not prepared to engage with the opportunity my proposal presents. I am willing to engage further with teacher unions on the reform of the junior cycle. I hope they will reconsider the decision to take strike action, and will re-engage on the compromise proposals which have been tabled.</p>

            <p eId="para_500">The teachers are going on strike, so they clearly disagree. They are not agreeing with these proposals. We have heard them before - I nearly know them off by heart. They do agree - and the Minister keeps making this point - that assessment practices must change. I know many brilliant, creative, imaginative teachers who have changed practices within schools for the benefit of young minds. That is not the problem. The problem is that they want the assessment to be external. That is the problem - not the great expansion of subjects and what teachers do beyond the call of duty, after 4 p.m. and on Saturday mornings. Even the brilliant all-Ireland choirs, for example, are externally assessed by adjudicators. It is not about subject matter or disciplines, but rather the externality of the assessment and the honesty - my God, it is the one thing we have, and Senator Craughwell will speak to this.</p>
            <p eId="para_501"> The other thing is that we are all over the papers. We are coming down with new skills, attitudes----</p>

They want external assessment of their great work, and the honesty and national standardisation that comes with that, which we all grew up with. It does not matter what the subject is, it should be externally assessed. There will be an impasse and I am backing the teachers, because I am 35 years in education - all aspects of it - and I feel that I come with some experience of what I am talking about-----</p>

            <p eId="para_535">The title of this matter speaks for itself. I have been contacted by a number of parents of children with Down's syndrome, who have told me that they are constantly driving their children - including their adult children - to and from work, swimming, physiotherapy or whatever they need, and they never receive any help whatsoever. I am asking that the primary medical certificate be extended to cover people with Down's syndrome. I understand the criteria for someone to qualify for a primary medical certificate, which the Minister of State will most likely lay out in his answer.</p>
            <p eId="para_536">I know the qualifying criteria off by heart. An applicant needs to be without the use of one or two limbs and so on. Many people with Down's syndrome are very immobile, tend to be overweight and find it difficult to get around. Does the Minister of State know who William Loughnane is? I guess many Members would not know of him and neither did I until I did a little research. William Loughnane is a 26 year old Special Olympic gold medalist and the first and only person with Down's syndrome in Ireland to receive his driver's licence. There is one person in Northern Ireland and one person in southern Ireland with Down's syndrome who has a driving licence.</p>
            <p eId="para_537"> The Minister of State can imagine the pressure on parents with a child with Down's syndrome and a number of parents have contacted me. When one lives in rural Ireland, one is many miles away from facilities, as the Minister will well know, and from a little job one's child may have with Down's Syndrome Ireland, the Network of People with Disabilities or an employer who takes on a person with a disability and gives them a few hours work a week. The person with a disability must be driven to their job because they cannot drive themselves. A mother who is a widow has contacted me and she has to do all the driving as she does not have anyone to share it with her. She is exhausted, completely tied down and is managing under financial difficulties and stress. In some cases she has to make two journeys in that she drives to the facility and home and then drives back to collect her child.</p>
            <p eId="para_538"> I have been fighting for a primary medical certificate to be granted to people with neurological diseases such as Parkinson's disease, motor neurone disease and other diseases. The criteria are very rigid. Even despite appeals to Dún Laoghaire on the matter, those concerned do not seem to win the fight. They have been told that the position is laid down in the legislation, the criteria are set out and they are outside the criteria. I ask the Minister to consider this proposal in a sympathetic way and to say "yes" to it. These people will more than likely never drive and will probably always be a passenger or a passenger with a disability. I ask that the primary medical certificate be extended to facilitate people with Down's syndrome.</p>

            <p eId="para_541">-----but I am also conscious that the Minister for Finance gave me a job to do. It is important to read the reply into the record from a formality point of view.</p>
            <p eId="para_542"> To give a brief description of the scheme as it currently stands, it provides relief from vehicle registration tax and VAT on the purchase of a specially adapted vehicle, repayment of excise duty on fuel and an exemption from motor tax to drivers and passengers with disabilities who fulfil the medical criteria required to qualify for the scheme. The primary legislation authorising the Minister for Finance to make regulations providing for tax concessions to disabled drivers and passengers is contained in section 92 of the Finance Act 1989, and the regulations introduced subsequently to govern the scheme, including the eligibility criteria, are contained in the Disabled Drivers and Disabled Passengers (Tax Concessions) Regulations 1994.</p>
            <p eId="para_543"> Currently, to qualify for the scheme, an applicant must have a permanent and severe physical disability within the terms of the regulations and satisfy one of the six qualifying criteria outlined in the regulations. The senior medical officer for the relevant local Health Service Executive administrative area makes a professional clinical determination as to whether an individual applicant satisfies the medical criteria. A successful applicant is provided with a primary medical certificate, which is required under the regulations to claim the reliefs provided for in the regulations. An unsuccessful applicant can appeal the decision of the senior medical officer to the Disabled Drivers Medical Board of Appeal, which makes a new clinical determination in respect of the individual. The regulations mandate that the medical board of appeal is independent in the exercise of its functions to ensure the integrity of its clinical determinations. After six months a citizen can reapply if there is a deterioration in their condition.</p>
            <p eId="para_544"> The six qualifying criteria, of which the Senator will no doubt be aware, are both strict and precise, and relate only to very specific physical disabilities. They are to be wholly or almost wholly without the use of both legs; be wholly without the use of one leg and almost wholly without the use of the other leg such that the applicant is severely restricted as to movement of the lower limbs; be without both hands or without both arms; be without one or both legs; be wholly or almost wholly without the use of both hands or arms and wholly or almost wholly without the use of one leg; and have the medical condition of dwarfism and have serious difficulties of movement of the lower limbs.</p>
            <p eId="para_545"> The scheme and qualifying criteria were designed specifically for those with severe physical disabilities. The Minister for Finance frequently receives correspondence from applicants who do not meet the qualifying criteria but feel that they could benefit from the scheme. Those also include citizens advocating for the addition of intellectual disabilities to the qualifying criteria. While the Minister very much sympathises with those who do not qualify for the scheme, he cannot, given the scale and scope of the scheme, expand it further within the current context of constrained resources.</p>
            <p eId="para_546"> The Senator will appreciate that the scheme represents a significant tax expenditure. Between the vehicle registration tax and VAT forgone and the repayment of excise on fuel used by members of the scheme, the scheme represented a cost of €43.5 million to the Exchequer in 2013. This figure does not include the revenue forgone to the local government fund in respect of the relief from motor tax provided to members of the scheme. In terms of the numbers of beneficiaries of the scheme in 2013, 4,355 citizens availed of the vehicle registration tax and VAT relief, and 11,436 availed of the repayment of excise on the fuel element of the scheme.</p>
            <p eId="para_547"> The Minister for Finance recognises that the scheme plays an important role in expanding the mobility of citizens with disabilities, and he has managed to maintain the relief at current levels throughout the crisis and despite the requirement for significant fiscal consolidation. While recognising the Senator's position, in the still challenging fiscal environment, the Minister has no plans to expand the medical criteria beyond the six currently provided for in the Disabled Drivers and Disabled Passengers (Tax Concessions) Regulations 1994.</p>

            <p eId="para_548">I guess it is a bad time to come looking for something new but it is important to highlight the plight of people with Down's syndrome. My timing probably is not great but I hope as we move forward that the finances will be available to expand this scheme further. The cost of scheme at €43.5 million seems quite high when only 4,355 citizens availed of the vehicle registration tax and VAT relief and 11,436 availed of the repayment of excise on the fuel element, but I am sure the figures are correct when the calculations are worked out. For as long as I will be a Member of the Oireachtas I will raise this issue again and perhaps in the future the finances will be available to expand the scheme. As the Minister of State said, one of the criteria is for an applicant to have the medical condition of dwarfism. I agree that people with dwarfism should qualify for the scheme, but that criterion also includes the words "and have serious difficulties of movement of the lower limbs". Many people with Down's syndrome have serious difficulty with the movement of lower limbs. I accept that wording in that criterion was referring to dwarfism but it could be expanded. I know that I am not going to get the answer I want tonight but I will continue to highlight the issue.</p>

            <p eId="para_549">Cuirim fáilte roimh an Aire Stáit. The Minister of State is welcome back to the House. It is the first opportunity I have had to engage with him on an issue since he was promoted. I wish him every success in his role. As a Donegal man and a neighbour, the Minister of State will be very familiar with the fracking issue which, initially, is of particular concern in the north west, with particular reference to the Lough Allen basin which covers Fermanagh, Leitrim and part of south Donegal.</p>
            <p eId="para_550"> Last week there was a briefing in this House by the very well-organised lobby which has grown out of the concerns of people in Leitrim particularly and has expanded into the surrounding countries about the environmental impact of hydraulic fracturing on the terrain. Particular concerns have been raised.</p>
            <p eId="para_551">If a licence were granted for exploration there would be a proliferation of wells across the exploration area which would result in severe and long-lasting damage to tourism. Of more immediate concern would be the effect it would have on groundwater. As the Minister of State is aware, the area we are discussing has a significant quantity of water through its rivers and lakes.</p>
            <p eId="para_552"> At the briefing there was a statement which I have incorporated into this question. The main group involved in the protest against fracking is called Love Leitrim. When visiting the Houses of the Oireachtas last week members of that group stated that the original licence granted by Mr. Conor Lenihan, who was then the relevant Minister of State, to carry out exploratory work, which effectively is desktop work by the two companies then but now one, Tamboran Limited, could or would oblige this Government or a future Government to grant them drilling licences. I am concerned over this.</p>
            <p eId="para_553"> The original licences were specific and were of an exploratory nature. I put my hands up and admit that initially I had no objection to an exploratory investigation being carried out because where I live in Drumshanbo in County Leitrim explorations have been going on since I was a child by the Canadian organisation Marathon. It was given a licence to explore the Leitrim and west Cavan area for commercially viable gas deposits. So it is nothing new in the area where I lived. It may have been very new to the people in Manorhamilton, Glenfarne and Kiltyclogher where Tamboran was to do its drilling. When the exploratory licence was granted I did not express much concern. However, when it became more apparent it was planning to carry out hydraulic fracturing, like many other people I naturally educated myself as much as I could and particularly investigated what happened in America where this had been carried out.</p>
            <p eId="para_554"> As a result we are where we are today and the wording of the motion is self-explanatory. I am seeking clarity on the matter.</p>

            <p eId="para_555">I thank the Senator for the welcome back to my <i>alma mater</i>; we had many a good debate over a five-year period. It brings back nice memories indeed. I also thank the Senator for raising this matter. While I have outlined the Government's position on the issue of hydraulic fracturing on a number of occasions in Dáil Éireann, this is my first opportunity to discuss the matter in the Upper House.</p>
            <p eId="para_556"> Three onshore licensing options were granted in the term of the previous Government for the two-year period from 1 March 2011 to 28 February 2013, over parts of the north west carboniferous Lough Allen Basin and the Clare Basin. The licensing options were granted to Tamboran Resources, covering parts of counties Cavan, Leitrim, Roscommon and Sligo; Lough Allen Natural Gas Company Limited, covering parts of counties Cavan, Leitrim, north Roscommon and east Sligo; and Energi Oil plc, covering part of County Clare.</p>
            <p eId="para_557"> The licensing options awarded were preliminary authorisations designed to allow the companies assess the shale gas potential of the acreage largely based on desktop studies of existing data. Exploration drilling, including drilling that would involve hydraulic fracturing, was not permitted under these licensing options. The licensing options gave the holder the first right, exercisable at any time during the period of the licensing option, to apply for the grant of an exploration licence over all or part of the area covered by the licensing option. Tamboran Resources and Energi Oil plc have exercised that right and have submitted applications for follow-on exploration licences.</p>
            <p eId="para_558"> Successive Ministers and Ministers of State at the Department of Communications Energy and Natural Resources, including me, have confirmed that no decision will be made on these applications pending the outcome of the Environmental Protection Agency's research programme into the use of hydraulic fracturing. The key questions that the EPA research programme, which is to be carried out over a minimum of two years, needs to answer are as follows. Can unconventional gas exploration and extraction projects and operations be carried out in the island of Ireland while also protecting the environment and human health? What is the best environmental practice for such projects and operations?</p>
            <p eId="para_559"> The research will consider baseline characterisation with regard to water, seismic and air quality, potential impacts and mitigations and best practice regulatory frameworks. Detailed information on the regulatory approaches of other countries that have extensive experience with this activity will also be considered. The research programme is also expected to consider a minimum of five countries including at least one country where a moratorium on unconventional gas exploration has been introduced.</p>
            <p eId="para_560"> Any application proposing the use of this technology would be subject to the existing statutory framework which includes environmental impact assessment. Such an assessment entails consideration of the potential impacts of a project on population, fauna, flora, soil, water, air, climatic factors, material assets, including the architectural and archaeological heritage, landscape and the inter-relationship between these factors. It is not considered feasible to conduct such an assessment in Ireland until the EPA research programme has concluded and there has been time to consider its findings.</p>

            <p eId="para_561">I am grateful to the Minister of State for bringing some clarity to the question. However, his reply has not totally reassured me. He said:</p>
            <p class="indent_2" eId="para_562">The licensing options gave the holder the first right, exercisable at any time during the period of the licensing option, to apply for the grant of an exploration licence over all or part of the area covered by the licensing option. Tamboran Resources and Energi Oil plc have exercised that right and have submitted applications for follow-on exploration licences.</p>
            <p eId="para_563">That seems to indicate that the Minister of State's hands are tied and that he will effectively have to give them the licence because they have exercised their option.</p>
            <p eId="para_564"> I appreciate what the Minister of State has said in the rest of his reply concerning the EPA research programme and environmental impact assessment. He also referred to a regulatory framework that would have to be brought into play. However, all that points to creating a structure to allow drilling for shale gas using hydraulic fracturing. Essentially that is the question.</p>
            <p eId="para_565"> I am sorry to be pressing the Minister of State on this but I am sure he fully understands where I am coming from. Is the Minister of State saying that based on the granting of the exploratory licence the law as currently constituted has given Tamboran and Energi plc the right to ultimately drill using hydraulic fracturing if they comply with all the regulatory framework, with the EPA conclusions and with the environmental assessment? Presumably the EPA will provide recommendations, assessments and conclusions, but the EPA will not making the law and will just be making a recommendation. I am sure the Minister of State knows exactly where I am coming from on the matter.</p>

            <p eId="para_568">Prior to the start of the EPA research project, I had a number of meetings even during the summer. I met representatives of groups from Sligo. The Minister, Deputy White, and I had a meeting in Dublin with a group from Cavan County Council and Leitrim County Council. There are obvious concerns and I take them very seriously.</p>
            <p eId="para_569">While they exercised their right to make an application, the fundamental factor is that an EPA study has been initiated. I will list a few of the stakeholders to show that this is not just a tokenistic exercise. It is not simply a case of a group compiling a report and setting out a series of recommendations, but not being listened to. I will give the Senator an idea of the composition of this group, which operates on a North-South basis. It includes representatives of Queen's University Belfast, the British Geological Survey, the University College Dublin geophysics group, the University of Ulster geophysics research group and the Dublin Institute for Advanced Studies seismology and geodynamics group.</p>
            <p eId="para_570"> My confidence in the research is borne out of the time that has gone into the preparation of the survey initiated by the Environmental Protection Agency. I have asked my officials to examine the possibility of providing for something, perhaps next summer, that would give the Members of both Houses an update on the research findings in areas like health and the environment. I do not want to call it a mid-term review. I have asked my officials to consider that. They will set about a process in that regard. The important thing is that I have asked the people who are leading this survey, which will last for a minimum of two years and possibly for longer, to take the time to look at it properly. We are talking about what could hypothetically happen down the line. I am not going to presuppose what will come out of this survey. The important thing is for us to continue the debate and the dialogue. We need to feed into this process. I know it is happening at a community level. I will continue to engage in dialogue with people at local council and community levels who may have fears and concerns.</p>
            <p eId="para_571"> We have to look at the cross-Border institutional mechanism that is in place. I refer to the North-South Ministerial Council. This is as much a North-South issue as it is an issue for Leitrim, south Donegal, Cavan or Sligo. Inbuilt political mechanisms have been available since 1998. It would be important to get this issue on the agenda of the North-South Ministerial Council as soon as possible. Given that we have a mechanism involving the universities in Northern Ireland and the Northern Ireland equivalent of the Environmental Protection Agency, there is no point in having different narratives coming out from political parties in Northern Ireland and from political parties in Southern Ireland. A natural North-South dialogue is going on here. I encourage Senator Mooney, who has experience in the British-Irish Parliamentary Assembly and has built relationships with his colleagues in Northern Ireland, to continue this conversation on a North-South level. The Joint Committee on the Implementation of the Good Friday Agreement, which I have experience of as a former Chairman, is another mechanism that would enable this conversation to continue.</p>
            <p eId="para_572"> I reiterate that the two companies that have been mentioned had the right to submit applications for exploration licences. Those applications will not be looked at by me or by my colleague, the Minister, Deputy White, while the Environmental Protection Agency study is ongoing. No decision will be made and no licences will be looked at.</p>

            <p eId="para_576">I welcome the Minister of State to the House. I know he is stepping in for the Minister for Health on this matter. Ireland has the highest rate of hereditary haemochromatosis, which is a condition caused by the gradual accumulation of excess iron in the body, in the world. Haemochromatosis can develop without symptoms until it reaches an advanced stage at which it can be fatal. The treatment of hereditary haemochromatosis simply involves the removal of a pint of blood. At the moment, the process in the Cork region is that it is dealt with in a clinic at Cork University Hospital, CUH. A number of general practitioners who are prepared to offer this service have come together. It is not about trying to take over someone else's territory; it is very much about trying to alleviate the problems in the clinic in CUH. All of this would have huge benefit for patients in the clinic in question. If the GPs were able to deal with it, a substantial cohort of patients would be rapidly and permanently removed from CUH. This would allow the relevant department in the hospital to service an additional clinic. It would be cost-neutral from an infrastructure and manpower perspective. Waiting lists would be gradually reduced.</p>
            <p eId="para_577"> I will set out what the GPs are basically looking for. University College Cork, UCC, is prepared to come on board to research the viability of the project. I understand the amount of money involved in putting it together is approximately €28,000. UCC is prepared to carry out the research. A number of GPs would work with CUH and UCC to develop a clear protocol for the management and treatment of hereditary haemochromatosis. The GP practices would rigorously implement the agreed quality protocol. When patients enter the maintenance phase of management, they would be referred to the Irish Blood Transfusion Service to become blood donors. Patients who are not eligible to become blood donors would continue to attend the treating GP. I understand that the blood taken from the patients attending CUH is destroyed. It does not even go to the blood bank.</p>
            <p eId="para_578"> It is being proposed that this service should be provided as part of a joint approach between CUH, the GPs, UCC, which will do the research, and the Irish Blood Transfusion Service. I understand the annual cost saving in the Cork region alone would be approximately €1.2 million. I am astonished that the HSE is not buying into the proposal. I have been told that the GPs who came forward with the proposal are talking about walking away from it because they feel it is being pushed down the road. I believe it should not be pushed down the road. If this cost-saving exercise leads to the provision of this service in local areas around the county of Cork, people will not have to travel all the way into CUH from north and west Cork, etc. I think that is another one of the advantages of this scheme.</p>

            <from>Deputy Joe McHugh<recordedTime time="2014-11-19T19:30:00+00:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_579">I thank Senator Burke for raising this issue. It is close to my heart, if Members will pardon the pun, because I have haemochromatosis. It is important for me to declare that conflict of interest before we move on. I am delighted that the Senator has raised it. I have worked closely with Margaret Mullett, who is the chairperson of the Irish Haemochromatosis Association. Her husband passed away because too much iron had built up in his blood. Obviously, that was before she became aware of this issue. That is how she ended up getting involved in the association. Her objective is to raise awareness. I hope the raising of this issue by Senator Burke this evening will help Ms Mullett on her journey as she tries to create awareness.</p>
            <p eId="para_580"> I am responding on behalf of my colleague, the Minister, Deputy Varadkar. Haemochromatosis is a relatively common condition in Ireland. If a person has haemochromatosis, his or her body absorbs too much iron from his or her diet. After it has been diagnosed, it is treated by removing blood regularly to get rid of excess iron. This process is referred to as venesection. Patients with haemochromatosis in Ireland were traditionally treated through their general practitioners or as outpatients in a hospital environment. Under a framework agreement that was signed on 4 June last, the HSE, the Department of Health and the Irish Medical Organisation have commenced substantive talks on a new General Medical Services GP contract. The inclusion of chronic disease management for patients and the provision of mechanisms to ensure patients are treated in the community, where possible, will be prioritised in these discussions. I expect that haemochromatosis services will be considered in this context.</p>
            <p eId="para_581"> As the treatment for haemochromatosis involves blood removal, and because patients are often well and eligible to be blood donors, the Irish Blood Transfusion Service has developed a haemochromatosis service in recent years.</p>
            <p eId="para_582">It has resulted in the cost effective treatment of people with this common disorder. It is provided free of charge to those with haemochromatosis and, in turn, the Irish Blood Transfusion Service, IBTS, can use the blood for transfusion.</p>
            <p eId="para_583"> The IBTS started a programme of treating haemochromatosis patients at its Stillorgan centre in 2007. The centre operates a full care model where the IBTS manages the ongoing care of the haemochromatosis patient while performing the necessary venesections. The patient must attend his or her referring clinician for annual review. A total of 600 patients are now being treated at the Stillorgan centre, which is at full capacity.</p>
            <p eId="para_584"> In August 2013, the IBTS commenced a second haemochromatosis service at its D'Olier Street blood donation clinic in Dublin. A further service commenced at its Cork centre in January 2014. At both locations, clinical responsibility for the patient remains with the referring clinician, but the IBTS provides an option of a maximum of four venesections per year. In many cases, where these patients meet all of the normal blood donation criteria, they can then become blood donors. I am delighted to inform the Seanad that the IBTS plans to expand its haemochromatosis service further at its Limerick centre. A planning application in this regard is being finalised by the IBTS.</p>
            <p eId="para_585"> The haemochromatosis service provided by the IBTS is positive for the overall health service. Eligible haemochromatosis patients are provided with a free service and the maintenance of the national blood supply for patients in our health care system is enhanced. Many haemochromatosis patients also have the satisfaction of becoming regular blood donors to the benefit of others. Services for haemochromatosis patients have improved significantly in recent years and I look forward to their further enhancement as current plans come to fruition.</p>

            <p eId="para_586">I thank the Minister of State. His response was positive, but there is a great reliance on the IBTS developing services. We are discussing rolling out a small research project to a number of general practices across the country. By working with general practitioners, GPs, in Cork, Cork University Hospital, the IBTS and UCC could identify the best way of managing this system and set out a national template. The sum of money to allow for that research would be small at approximately €28,000. UCC is prepared to do this work. It has spoken with the HSE, but the latter is hiding behind the Irish Medical Organisation, IMO, negotiations. They should not be used as an excuse not to address this issue. This is a great opportunity to determine whether a more comprehensive service can be provided at a much reduced cost for the HSE and taxpayers. It should be considered carefully.</p>

            <p eId="para_587">I acknowledge the drive of the Minister, Deputy Varadkar, and his officials in working with the IMO on a new contract. I hope that progress can be made on that front.</p>
            <p eId="para_588"> If there are areas of research and sums of money are required, it is important to be as inclusive of the stakeholders as possible. I am aware that there will shortly be a meeting between the Irish Haemochromatosis Association, IHA, and the Minister. The Senator has shown an interest, so it would be important were he at that meeting. I can give him the details.</p>
            <p eId="para_589"> Many people have haemochromatosis<b>.</b> I have it. As I do not know the technical details, I will not go into them. Basically, I must give blood every now and again due to my ferritin levels. Previously, the blood I gave was not used and was instead dumped, so I am delighted that, in recent years, people with haemochromatosis have been able to donate their blood. It is important that their blood can be used. Solutions may be possible at ground level in communities, primary care centres or GPs' surgeries. It is just a question of giving blood. It is not rocket science. It is done to monitor ferritin levels. Science is improving and more companies are getting involved on the monitoring end of things. I will name drop and refer to Randox Teoranta in Dungloe, County Donegal, which is involved in this business and introducing new technologies and sciences to ensure that people with haemochromatosis are diagnosed at an earlier stage.</p>
            <p eId="para_590"> My only anecdotal advice is this - if people are feeling fatigued, they should go to their doctors to get their blood checked for ferritin levels. They may have haemochromatosis. Since I started giving blood, my fatigue levels have improved immensely. I do not get any sleep anymore in my new job.</p>
