#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-04-25 00:00:00	Prelude	0	This morning, I met the directors of a number of aid agencies to discuss the question of clean drinking water in developing countries.  On the morning the Government will launch its environmental programme, it is ironic that I raise the question of clean drinking water in one of the richest countries in the developed world.According to the health services, the people of Galway face a health epidemic because of the contamination of their water supply.  The Health Service Executive is now informing people — particularly the elderly, very young and vulnerable — that they could die from the contamination of water with cryptosporidium.In response, the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government has given a juvenile and irresponsible performance and he has hived off blame to everyone except himself.  As has been pointed out on numerous occasions, there has been a €600 million underspend across the broader region.  This means that places like Oughterard, Headford, Clonbur and Claregalway have completely insufficient sewerage systems.

#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-04-25 00:00:00	Prelude	2	In cases where sewage is not treated or where the lake is completely contaminated, the water supply of thousands of people is now causing the current problem.  This was well known in advance.  The Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, with his smug approach to the problem, has hived off blame and responsibility to everyone else.  The Government and its immediate predecessor did not have the political will to make the investment necessary to deal with this problem.People in Galway now speak of having had a morning cryptosporidium shower.  They are disgusted at the failure to invest in sewerage works.

There is great concern about the effect of a contaminated water supply on tourism in the area, the Galway economy and families with young babies and elderly members.  Will the Taoiseach explain why this has happened and what he proposes to do about it?

The priority under the new national development plan is to finish that job.

#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-04-25 00:00:00	Prelude	18	I do not understand Deputy Kenny's complaint regarding what was said by the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government.  A range of approximately six measures were agreed at the meetings.  First, it was agreed that efforts by the engineers in the area to identify the source or sources of the outbreak will continue.

#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-04-25 00:00:00	Prelude	20	Second, the water supply from Tuam will be increased to augment the city supply and the additional supply from this source will come on stream incrementally during the next two months.  It was agreed that the old water treatment plant in Galway will be phased out — we hope by the middle of June — as additional supplies are delivered from the Tuam system, and that the installation of a water treatment package plant at Terryland in Galway to provide 18 million litres per day will come on stream before the end of the year.

#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-04-25 00:00:00	Prelude	23	There is also a longer term commitment to fast-track the advancement of the new treatment plant in Galway at a cost of more than €21 million and to provide €27.4 million for increased storage of water and conservation measures in Tuam, which will allow for additional water to be made available to the city.  A range of other issues is being considered but those are the main points.

#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-04-25 00:00:00	Prelude	25	The Taoiseach's reply does not deal with the problem faced by the people of Galway and the greater Galway region.  A similar problem exists in Ennis, where people are still on notice regarding water.  The Department of the Environment and Local Government published a study of national urban waste water in April 2004, which contrasts with what the Taoiseach asserts.
#PeterPowerFF	unknown-#PeterPowerFF-party	unknown-#PeterPowerFF-dob	unknown-#PeterPowerFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-04-25 00:00:00	Prelude	26	Deputy Kenny is scaremongering.  That study is three years old.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-04-25 00:00:00	Prelude	27	Considering the different levels of treatment, the study found that more than 50% of all plant and equipment at the eight primary treatment works was in condition grade 4 or 5 and 18% of the mechanical and electrical plant at the 82 secondary treatment works, excluding those with nutrient reduction factors, was in a similar condition.  Grade 4 means serious structural deterioration and grade 5 means that the assets have collapsed or are derelict.When the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Roche, visited Galway, his answers were far from satisfactory.  The water and sewerage services capital budget has declined in recent years.  Investment totalled €506 million in 2001, €487 million in 2002, €449 million in 2003, €439 million in 2004, €417 million in 2005 and €399 million in 2006.  A significant proportion, over 50%, of these plants were in a seriously deteriorated condition or had collapsed, which was well known to the Department and the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government.  The capital injection for sewage treatment services was declining.  The pictures shown on television last night of a polluted lake of the scale of Lough Corrib were a national scandal.

#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-04-25 00:00:00	Prelude	29	The fact that people in the region have to take their daily shower in cryptosporidium has not been dealt with.  The Minister, Deputy Roche, might find that funny, but it is not funny to the people in Galway.

#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-04-25 00:00:00	Prelude	31	If this had happened in a large area in Dublin, what would the response have been?  Would the problem have been sorted out?  What would have been the emergency response?  Are the people in Galway, especially those suffering financial hardship, entitled to free water while the matter is being addressed?  Does the Taoiseach agree that the response from Government should be much stronger?  While there are water tankers, people in Galway cannot use the water in their taps.  They are compliant taxpayers.
#TomKitt	unknown-#TomKitt-party	unknown-#TomKitt-dob	unknown-#TomKitt-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-04-25 00:00:00	Prelude	32	What about the local authority?

#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-04-25 00:00:00	Prelude	52	I will try to reply to Deputy Kenny's questions.  Since 2000, we have invested €1.75 billion in more than 100 waste water treatment schemes, including major new treatment plants in Dublin, Wexford, Cork, Limerick, Galway, Drogheda, Dundalk and Westport.
#DavidStanton	unknown-#DavidStanton-party	unknown-#DavidStanton-dob	unknown-#DavidStanton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-04-25 00:00:00	Prelude	53	It has not worked.
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-04-25 00:00:00	Prelude	54	The water services investment programme for the period 2005-07 contained 899 projects at various stages of development, the full cost of which was €5 billion.  I do not believe there was a lack of investment.The answer to Deputy Kenny on the decline in the figures is that Ringsend, the most significant single water scheme carried out in Europe, was included in the base figures.  When that scheme was finished, it came out of the base figures.  The first ever concerted programme to address the quality of water in group water schemes is nearing completion.  We introduced a Water Services Bill four years ago which is now finishing in this House.  Work has gone on to consolidate and modernise the existing codes of water schemes.I will not get myself into the middle of local Galway politics, but it is a fact that €21 million was provided over three years ago to allow the local authority to implement the scheme.

A sum of €21 million was given to Galway City Council to deal with the scheme and it could not agree on it.

#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-04-25 00:00:00	Prelude	65	That is being worked on.  We are aware of all the issues surrounding that too.  The installation of a water treatment package plant at Terryland will provide 18 million litres per day and should come on stream towards the end of the year.  We can fast-track on two issues.  These are the new treatment plant in Galway, which will now cost €21 million — that money has been allocated for a long time — and the provision of €27.4 million for increased storage and water conservation in Tuam, which will allow additional water to be made available to the city.  The Minister and the Department have fast-tracked that project.

How many hundreds of millions of euro does the Government reckon it has wasted in the past five years?It is solely the prerogative of the Taoiseach to decide when the election is called — we all accept that — but whenever that happens, will we use electronic voting?  If the answer is "no", why did we spend €62 million of taxpayers' money on electronic voting machines that we do not propose to use?  We have them now, we tested them in the last general election and they have been in storage since then.  If we will not use them this time, when will we use them?  How much is it costing us to store them?

Did we have to buy out the leases on the premises where the machines are being stored?I saw the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, Deputy Noel Dempsey, emerge sheepishly at a breakfast he bought for the esteemed members of the press last week in an attempt to induce them to accept his Ladybird fictional guide to the policies on this side of the House and to lecture us on economic competence.  This is the same Minister who spent €62 million on machines that only Robert Mugabe would be interested in purchasing.

He was succeeded by my friend, the Minister, Deputy Cullen, who could not wait to get his hands on the machines either.  The Government spent €62 million of taxpayers' money when there are people waiting for home help hours.

#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-04-25 00:00:00	Prelude	75	One would think that in 2007 the people of Galway would be entitled to clean water.  That could have been provided with the €62 million.  There are so many things which could have been done, for example, for children with autism, the employment of child psychologists and to address the needs of people desperate for home help hours.  We wasted €62 million on machines which the Taoiseach will tell me will not be used on 17 May.  When, if ever, will they be used?  We did not use them in the local or the European elections.  The Commission on Electronic Voting found that the software was unreliable and that the machines were not adequately tested.  Despite these findings, the Ministers, Deputy Noel Dempsey, Deputy Cullen and Deputy Roche, the storage Minister, will go before the people again and ask them seriously to vote for them.  What kind of country is this?

Some €162 million has gone down the drain, and that is symptomatic of the waste we have witnessed.  The Taoiseach appears to be suggesting that because we are spending €50 billion we can afford to waste those millions.  That is what the Minister, Deputy Noel Dempsey, said when asked about PPARS.

Many needs could have been addressed by these moneys which have been frittered away, yet the Taoiseach can only admit to being embarrassed and revert to his "give up your ould pencils" raiméis that he goes on with.

#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-04-25 00:00:00	Prelude	162	The Opposition should have taken a mature attitude to a voting system that worked particularly well in the last two elections.  The voting worked perfectly.  All the analysis showed the voting system worked perfectly, but politically the Opposition would not agree to it and it took off on a political exercise engaging people from around the world to find flaws with it.  That is a disgrace.  Any waste of money on the voting system lies at the Opposition's door.Deputy Rabbitte raised some other issues.  I do not accept his remarks in respect of the €50 billion that is being spent.  The vast majority of that money goes to the approximately one million people in receipt of welfare payments, the 130,000 people employed in the health service, the 100,000 teachers and the Garda Síochána, the Army and others involved in a range of services.  I do not believe, subject to there always being room for improvement, that this money is in any way wasted.On transport, we have done an excellent job right across a range of infrastructural issues.

#JoeHiggins	unknown-#JoeHiggins-party	unknown-#JoeHiggins-dob	unknown-#JoeHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-04-25 00:00:00	Prelude	177	If somebody dropped in from Mars they would think there was an election coming.  How does one explain that in west Dublin, east Meath, Kildare and many other areas of rapidly expanding population in this State hundreds of children wanting to start primary school this September have no classrooms to go to?  The Government made no provision for them, leaving hard-working parents angry and frustrated and in crisis.  That has been a staggering feature of the current Government for more than ten years.  It gave complete freedom to developers to construct tens of thousands of houses and apartments in new areas but did not oblige them to provide social infrastructure at the same time, schools being one of the most vital.  In some cases the Government allowed them to use their control of school sites to blackmail the Department of Education and Science and the local authority for millions of euro extra or for planning concessions.  It allowed developers to hold children's education to ransom and they walked away with billions, leaving communities bereft.  When one looks at the list of donations to Ministers and others by developers one might conclude that, perhaps, that is the explanation.Since last September, 60 children in the Laytown and Bettystown area have been going to school in a gymnasium.  Last June Deputy Cowley and I, representing the independent Deputies, made strong representations to the Minister for Education and Science on their behalf.  We were promised that classrooms would be available for the new school year 2006-07.  The children moved last week from the gym to the prefabricated buildings that were provided.  Now 103 children in that area have nowhere to go in September.  There are two schools with 630 children on one site of 2.5 acres.  In Littlepace, Ongar in west Dublin we have three schools, one permanent and two temporary, cramped on to one site of 3.5 acres and dozens of children are now being excluded from schools in the area because there is no place in Clonsilla and Castleknock.  The position is similar in Kildare.  Pupils wanting to start secondary school face a similar crisis.The Minister for Education and Science has been parading herself around teachers' conferences with an air of it being her first communion day, but she has dismally failed to make provision for new communities and secure school places for children, as would be normal.  Will the Taoiseach set up a special unit, a schools emergency response unit, in the Department of Education and Science to address this crisis instantly, to go into talks with teachers, principals and parents in the area to ensure that each child will have a place this September in his or her local community and that there will be permanent provision from September 2008? That is what is desperately required.  I want a commitment from the Taoiseach that that will happen.
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-04-25 00:00:00	Prelude	178	I visited the Deputy's area on a few occasions recently and attended the opening of the new school in Hartstown.  I spoke to teachers from a number of schools in the area and am aware of the pressures and the school needs of communities in rapidly developing areas, particularly Dublin West and mid-west where the population is growing dramatically.Whatever about setting up a special unit, I assure the Deputy that priority is being given to school building projects in the area.  I spoke to some of the officials concerned after my recent visit.  A new school for Mary Mother of Hope national school in Littlepace is ahead of schedule and is due to open in September.  There are two new schools, the Educate Together national school in Castleheaney and St. Benedict's national school on the site in Ongar.  Extension projects for schools in Castleknock and Corduff in Blanchardstown are being progressed.  A site has been secured for a new Educate Together national school in Tyrrellstown and that building will be provided as soon as possible.Several extra new primary schools for the area are being developed and are at various stages of planning.  Is there a particular one the Deputy wants to ask me about?  I was given a long list of schools.  There is a permanent building for a new 1,000 student post-primary school in Phibblestown.  That will not be ready until the start of the academic year in two years' time.  The Department is considering enabling the school to open before then in temporary accommodation because two years is a long time in that context.A site has been reserved for a further post-primary school in Tyrrellstown and the Department, with the local authority, is examining site possibilities for a new post-primary school in the Castleknock area.  The education reservation in the Hansfield SDZs allows for the development of a post-primary school for up to 1,000 pupils.  A project manager has recently been appointed to oversee the development of education provision on the Hansfield site.  There is spare capacity in two post-primary schools in the Dublin 15 area and the Department is satisfied that there are sufficient places to cater for current demand, even though every pupil may not secure a place in their school of first choice, which is a difficulty in the area.  Enormous attention is being given to the area and new schools will be provided because of growing class sizes.On the question of developers, I and a number of Members of the House were in Adamstown, where a few hundred people are living, to open a railway station in advance of the development of the area.  I also saw the final stages of the school building, to be opened in September, in advance of people coming to live in the area.  Building schools side by side with houses or in advance of houses, as in this case, is the proper approach.  Politicians on all sides congratulated the developer in Adamstown on his initiative in driving ahead and exceeding the commitments into which he had entered to provide educational facilities.  If more developers took that approach we would not have to play catch-up as we do in some areas.If the Deputy wants to know about any other area, I will have it checked out.  The officials gave me a long list of advancements and developments.  There are probably more in this area than anywhere else in the country, not that they are not necessary given the enormous number of new houses in west and mid-west Dublin.  The ones I mentioned are the main ones.
#JoeHiggins	unknown-#JoeHiggins-party	unknown-#JoeHiggins-dob	unknown-#JoeHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-04-25 00:00:00	Prelude	179	Schools, railway stations etc. should be in place before the people arrive to take up residence in new communities.  We knew that 15 or 20 years ago, and the fact that it is being done in the dying days of this Administration in one area is no vindication of the ten years the Government has been in power.  The list the Taoiseach gave me in regard to west Dublin refers to catch-up provision of facilities.  Hundreds of children will still have no classrooms to go to in September and that is the issue I want addressed.Spare capacity in the area means spare capacity in a primary school miles away from where the children live.  Given the traffic crisis and gridlock in Dublin West, and the pressure parents are under to get to work, crèches etc., it is not viable for them to cart their children around the area.  The same applies to Meath and Kildare.  The pressure on school places has some very negative features.  It can set parent against parent on the basis of geography, length of time residing in an area and whether people are renting or have bought, and even, perhaps, on the basis of national origins.  That is very worrying.The 29th Dáil is in its swan song days.  The Taoiseach's reply will, perhaps, be his swan song, as far as Leaders' Questions go.  Will he give me an assurance that this September in the areas I have mentioned there will be a classroom in their local community for every child in primary school and a place in secondary school in their community for every pupil needing to start there next September?  Nothing less is required.

This survey indicates a considerable number of children enrolled in more than one school.  While I understand this from the parents' point of view, it also resulted in inflating the number of children seeking school places.  Notwithstanding this, the Department of Education and Science is aware that extra accommodation is needed for September and it will make this available.I assure Deputy Joe Higgins that all of the options he has raised will be considered to ensure there are enough school places in September.  This will include the provision of school transport if necessary.  The Department has assured me it is well aware of the difficulties and problems, notwithstanding what I said.  I assure Deputy Joe Higgins the Department is doing its best to resolve the matter.
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-04-25 00:00:00	Prelude	214	I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 to 4, inclusive, together.The Government invited the consultation partners who had been engaged in developing the arrangements for the process of structured dialogue between Government and the churches, philosophical bodies and non-confessional organisations of Ireland to Dublin Castle on 26 February 2007 for an inaugural event and a reception.The occasion was arranged to bring the partners together for the first time in this process and to build public awareness of the dialogue process from the outset.  Both the Tánaiste and I addressed the meeting on behalf of the Government.  As I indicated on the occasion, I believe this dialogue will be a new and important strand in the civic and political culture of this State.  This process will build better understanding across a more diverse society.  It will also advance to a new and more appropriate basis the relations of mutual respect and engagement between the civil authorities and those who lead our churches, faith communities and non-confessional bodies, which have been so significant in shaping the ideas, values, and even identity of so many of our people.The inaugural event of 26 February is being followed by a series of bilateral meetings with the dialogue partners.  The optimal arrangements for meetings are still under consideration, including the potential for combined representation of natural groups and smaller communities.  The dialogue partners are being invited to set the agenda for their initial meetings with Government, with both sides adding themes and issues to the dialogue as it develops.  I would not envisage the Government meeting any partner through this process more than annually, although the dialogue could continue through correspondence or with officials.The series of bilateral meetings commenced this week.  There was a meeting with the Church of Ireland on Monday and there will be meetings with the Roman Catholic Church and the Jewish community later today.Having regard to the functional responsibility in the first instance of Ministers and Departments, I would not propose to comment publicly on each meeting and every issue raised.  However, I have no objection to the dialogue partners declaring their agenda and discussing their perspectives in public and through the media.  It is an envisaged goal of the process that the dialogue would stimulate public interest and debate on important issues, providing a constructive contribution to public policy development.I would also like to preserve and develop the annual assembly of the dialogue partners, perhaps involving a themed address and a reception.  I believe that this is conducive to good relations generally and contributes towards an improved sense of community.There is of course a limit to what can be accommodated within this dialogue.  We embarked on this programme with a significant number of churches and bodies, reflecting the pattern of initial consultations and representing the faiths and beliefs of a large majority of the people living in Ireland today.  There remain several groups whose interests have yet to be addressed.  Over the coming months, officials at my Department will seek to develop appropriate arrangements to facilitate their association and contribution.I am pleased with the positive response of the dialogue partners to the initiative.  I believe they welcome the opportunity to present and explore perspectives on important themes, to contribute towards the development among the public and in the media of an informed understanding of the issues and to contribute to a general discussion in wider society of issues of interest.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-04-25 00:00:00	Prelude	215	I thank the Taoiseach for that reply.  I remind him of what he said when he first addressed this structured dialogue with churches, faith communities and non-confessional bodies.  The Taoiseach spoke specifically about aggressive secularism.  Does he consider that kind of comment would have chipped away at the basis of the Republic, taking into account the separation between church and State which is both important and necessary?  Did the Taoiseach have a particular motivation in putting all these people into the single category of what he termed "aggressive secularists"?  Is it not a fact that everybody can have their opinion?  People may not wish to be associated with any particular religion or they may wish to reject all religions.  They may wish to live in a secular society.Is any person involved in this structured debate whom the Taoiseach might call an aggressive secularist?  Perhaps he did not have a particular motivation for addressing it in that way in the beginning?  Is a programme of meetings tentatively laid out for the future or was there an agreement that a number of meetings should be held per year in which the structured dialogue could take place?  I am interested in the Taoiseach's views on these "aggressive secularists".  Perhaps many of them exist in the political life also.  I invite the Taoiseach to comment.
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-04-25 00:00:00	Prelude	216	A number of points have been raised.  Deputy Kenny is totally correct.  Bunreacht na hÉireann guarantees freedom of conscience and free profession and practice of religion.  Obviously, if somebody wishes to have nothing to do with any church or association, he or she is entitled to do so.This dialogue first emerged from the draft constitution on Europe.  A number of countries, France in particular, have been leading the way in this regard.  Dialogue has taken place with churches and non-confessional bodies as a basis for continuing a dialogue with the churches.  The fact is we have changed dramatically.  Files in my Department show that in the past there tended to be involvement and association with half a dozen church bodies.  That is all there was.  People contacted Departments about schools and that continues, but things have changed dramatically and continue to change.  As I stated in my reply, we must try to determine how to accommodate the groups that have surfaced in the country that want to be part of the process but which are not represented in the main body of groups.  Those involved include the Roman Catholic Church, the Church of Ireland, the Moderator of the General Assembly of the Presbyterian Church, the Methodist Church, the Baptist churches, the Lutheran churches, the Moravian Church — Irish district, the Religious Society of Friends, Jehovah's Witnesses, the Salvation Army, the Greek Orthodox Church, the Russian Orthodox Church, the Coptic Orthodox Church, the Romanian Orthodox Church, the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, the Jewish Representative Council, the Imam of the Islamic Cultural Centre, the National Spiritual Assembly of the Baha'is of the Republic of Ireland, the Irish Council of Churches and the Humanist Association of Ireland.There is now a range of other groups of one form or another in the country which have no dialogue with the State and want to be involved.  Needless to say, because of the population change in the country, these groups are demanding they have contact and relevance, be it through structured dialogue or otherwise.  I am not too sure how representative some of the groups are and I have instructed officials to talk to them.  The religions I have listed are only some of those in the country today.On my comment on "aggressive secularism", my personal view is that I do not like, agree with or support the secular State and believe religion has a predominant role to play.  I have no problem with secularists who do not want to have any religion but aggressive secularists are people who infringe on other people's rights.  There are people in society who believe religion, of any kind, has no part to play and they are not shy about making their voices heard either.  As an individual, never mind as Taoiseach, I am not afraid to voice my views in response.  Their views stick in my craw, quite frankly, and I am entitled to offer my views in response to them.  In my job, both as a politician and as Taoiseach, I do not share their view.  If they want to stay quiet, I will stay quiet, but when they speak I believe I am entitled to speak.

Does he expect it will be a feature of dialogue in the future?The Good Friday Agreement makes reference to the proposed establishment of a consultative all-Ireland forum representative of civil society.  Does the Taoiseach expect that representatives of the main or wider church and faith communities will be afforded either direct participation in the civic forum or ongoing engagement therewith?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-04-25 00:00:00	Prelude	220	On the issue of education, Members will appreciate that most of the meetings have been attended by officials.  We have tried to model them on structured dialogue that took place in other countries.  The French model is particularly successful and its constitutional position of not affording any church priority over another religion or faith community is respected throughout the world.  However, there are normal, traditional connections between the main churches and Departments and I do not want to detract from this.  The minority churches would be very strong in this regard and they have always had a position — I will not say a privileged position — in which they were able to state their case and protect the minority communities throughout the country.  They were always afforded the opportunity to do so under the Governments of the day.  I do not want to change a model that works and has worked well.The issues of education, integration and structural change are now considerable for all the churches.  Without stating the agenda, my discussion with the Church of Ireland certainly concerned its desire to protect its community and ensure that the State would continue to provide schools and facilities therefor, although it might not be for a large number.  It is a question of not diminishing the access the church traditionally had to the Departments.  Issues also arise for many of the new churches and faiths, which are now quite substantial in number.During Question Time I mentioned the school in Hartstown.  Its principal and the Archbishop of Dublin, who was speaking on the day of my visit, pointed out that there are 29 nationalities and 14 religions represented in the school.  Although the school is under the patronage of the Archbishop of Dublin, making progress in this regard requires a fair bit of working out.  These are difficulties we have never faced before but which we must face in the future.

The Deputy's question is really whether the representatives of the churches have access to the civic forum.  Although I have not thought about it, I do not see why they could not have access, given the agreement of the civic groups of the forum.
#TrevorSargent	unknown-#TrevorSargent-party	unknown-#TrevorSargent-dob	unknown-#TrevorSargent-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-04-25 00:00:00	Prelude	223	When the Taoiseach was speaking at Dublin Castle last February, his comments on aggressive secularism gave rise to the following observation from journalist, John Waters, of which Edmund Burke would have been proud.  I would be interested to hear the Taoiseach's views on this interpretation: "As we observe our society plunging into the secular paradise promised by the liberal ideologues who triumphed over the custodians of tradition, we observe also the manifestation of the many baneful symptoms of this shift."  Waters referred to drug and alcohol abuse, etc., as part of these symptoms.  Would the Taoiseach also include — I am sure this arose in his discussions — the aspect of one's word being one's bond, as in the case of the Adelaide Hospital?  Did this arise in discussions with the Church of Ireland representatives, given that the charter that led to the move to Tallaght included a commitment that the Adelaide and National Children's Hosptial could remain where they are?  Is there still an opportunity to honour this charter given that the Oireachtas was involved in the bond given?  One was led to believe very clearly that the site of the National Children's Hospital in Tallaght would not be up for renegotiation.  Did this arise in conversation and is it a subject of the ongoing dialogue with which the Taoiseach hopes to continue?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-04-25 00:00:00	Prelude	224	It did not arise under structured dialogue with the Church of Ireland but I have had separate meetings with the representatives of the church on this matter on a number of occasions.  The National Children's Hospital comprises only one aspect of the matter, which has featured for a number of years, as the Deputy knows.  The Government's position is that the Church of Ireland and its ethos have always been regarded as special and have been protected by the State.  This includes the Adelaide.
#TrevorSargent	unknown-#TrevorSargent-party	unknown-#TrevorSargent-dob	unknown-#TrevorSargent-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-04-25 00:00:00	Prelude	225	Both denominations, it is not one denomination.
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-04-25 00:00:00	Prelude	226	In this case I was referring to the Church of Ireland.  I did not have discussions with any other denomination about the issue.  No denomination, other than that of the Archbishop of Dublin and Archbishop Eames, raised the issue with me.  Dialogue with the Department of Health and Children and the HSE is continuing, not just on the children's hospital but on the broad agreement of that charter.
#TrevorSargent	unknown-#TrevorSargent-party	unknown-#TrevorSargent-dob	unknown-#TrevorSargent-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-04-25 00:00:00	Prelude	227	I want to be clear.  The suggestion from the Taoiseach's reply is that the Church of Ireland ethos was the reason for raising the issue.  I have spoken to the people in charge at Tallaght Hospital and they are clear that the ethos of any one denomination is not in question.  Rather, it is the ethos of respecting each parent and background without fear or favour.  Is that the Taoiseach's understanding of the points raised by the Church of Ireland?  It is not only the Church of Ireland ethos that is being considered.
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-04-25 00:00:00	Prelude	228	Let us be clear.  The issue is that the charter of the Adelaide Hospital, negotiated by the Church of Ireland——
#TrevorSargent	unknown-#TrevorSargent-party	unknown-#TrevorSargent-dob	unknown-#TrevorSargent-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-04-25 00:00:00	Prelude	229	Which is multi-denominational in its understanding.
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-04-25 00:00:00	Prelude	230	——would be adhered to.  There is a separate question about children.  Deputy Sargent's first question concerned the Church of Ireland ethos as enshrined in the agreement on the Adelaide Hospital and that this would not be lost when changes are made in any area and that the State would respect the charter.  I accept that.
#TrevorSargent	unknown-#TrevorSargent-party	unknown-#TrevorSargent-dob	unknown-#TrevorSargent-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-04-25 00:00:00	Prelude	231	The charter said Tallaght.
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-04-25 00:00:00	Prelude	232	I propose to take Questions Nos. 5 to 9, inclusive, together.The Interception of Postal Packets and Telecommunication Messages (Regulation) Act 1993 empowers the interception of postal packages and telecommunications messages for the purpose of criminal investigation or in the interests of the security of the State.  The Criminal Justice (Terrorist Offences) Act 2005 provides for the retention of telecommunications data and access thereon for the purpose of criminal investigation and in the interests of the security of the State.  The Acts also include comparable mechanisms for judicial oversight of compliance with their provisions and for addressing complaints.My role in respect of the operation of the Acts is as follows.  A High Court judge, the judge designated for that purpose by the President of the High Court under section 8 of the Interception of Postal Packets and Telecommunication Messages (Regulation) Act 1993, has the duty of keeping the operation of that Act under review, of ascertaining whether its provisions are being complied with and of reporting to me.  That report is usually received annually and is laid by me before the Houses of the Oireachtas.  The most recent report was laid before both Houses of the Oireachtas on 28 November 2006.The Criminal Justice (Terrorist Offences) Act 2005 conferred additional duties on the designated judge.  Those duties are similar to the ones conferred by the 1993 Act and relate to the retention of and access to communications data.  The Act also provides for the designated judge to report to me with regard to its operation and the first such report was laid before both Houses of the Oireachtas on 26 March 2007, in respect of the operation of the Act by the Garda Síochána.  On 12 April 2007 the second report under the Act, this time in respect of the operation of the Act by the Army, was laid before both Houses.Section 9 of the 1993 Act provides for the appointment by the Taoiseach of a complaints referee.  A person who believes a postal package or a telecommunications message or communications data has been intercepted may apply to the complaints referee to have the matter investigated.  The complaints referee will then investigate whether a relevant authorisation was in force and, if so, whether there was any contravention of the provisions in the Act.If a contravention is found by the complaints referee to have occurred, he will report the matter to the Taoiseach.  To date, no such report has been received by me.  Both the designated judge and the complaints referee are judges of standing and are independent in the exercise of their functions under the Acts.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-04-25 00:00:00	Prelude	233	Perhaps the Taoiseach can explain if I am the only one who thinks it odd that, according to the Data Protection Commissioner, over 10,000 requests were made in 2006.
#RoryOHanlon	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-party	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-dob	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-04-25 00:00:00	Prelude	234	The Chair wishes to point out that, according to the Taoiseach's reply, his remit is narrow in this instance.  He receives the reports of reviews by the designated judge and the complaints referee for the Houses of the Oireachtas.  Both are independent of the Executive and questions regarding the day-to-day operation of the legislation should be referred to the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-04-25 00:00:00	Prelude	235	This was a broad brush question and I was not asking——
#RoryOHanlon	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-party	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-dob	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-04-25 00:00:00	Prelude	236	I accept that but my intervention was for the benefit of the House.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-04-25 00:00:00	Prelude	237	——the Taoiseach to go into detail.  It seems odd that, under the Criminal Justice (Terrorist Offences) Act, the Data Protection Commissioner has confirmed there were 10,000 requests or 300 per day.
#RoryOHanlon	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-party	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-dob	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-04-25 00:00:00	Prelude	238	The question should be addressed to the line Minister.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-04-25 00:00:00	Prelude	239	I am not trying to get the Taoiseach to state that it was 299.
#RoryOHanlon	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-party	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-dob	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-04-25 00:00:00	Prelude	240	The operation of the Act is a matter for the line Minister.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-04-25 00:00:00	Prelude	241	I am not asking about the operation of the Act.  I am asking him to give some advice or opinion on whether it is normal that 10,000 requests were made by the Garda Síochána in respect of accessing telephone records in 2006.  The Minister told the House that the Act would be strictly controlled and limited to the investigation of serious crime.  Many law-abiding citizens will be taken aback to hear that on 10,000 occasions it was necessary to invoke the Act in order to combat serious crime and suspected terrorist offences.Regarding the point made by the Ceann Comhairle about the designated judge, whose independence and probity the Taoiseach has commented on and which I accept, the only report laid before the Houses was a result of parliamentary questions.  The designated judge had not laid a report until the parliamentary questions were tabled.  The report relates to the Army accessing telephone records.  There is no report for the Garda Síochána accessing this number of records.  Many people would be surprised to know the Army is accessing these records.I refer to the remarks of the assistant data protection commissioner, who stated that perfectly innocent people are having their private records pored over.
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-04-25 00:00:00	Prelude	242	My role is limited but I will try to be helpful.  Only the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform may authorise interceptions.  The oversight powers of the designated judge and access of the complains referee are part of the systems of checks, balances and safeguards laid out in the Act.  In his most recent report to me, the designated judge stated that he is satisfied the provisions of the legislation are being maintained and the provisions of the 2005 Act are not being used for routine Garda inquiries and investigations.The security services must be equipped with the necessary powers to detect and prevent crime and maintain national security.  Unfortunately, modern communication technologies are often exploited by criminals and terrorists for their own ends and the security services must be able to intercept those communications.  In giving powers of interception, the legislation provides a framework within which the use of those powers are subject to independent judicial oversight.  Mobile phone use is pervasive, with more than one per head of population, and against such a background it would be expected that there would be a significant number of requests for access to telephone data records.On the issue of the designated judge taking until March to provide the annual report on the operation of the 2005 Act, in the report sent to me in March 2007, which was laid before both Houses of the Oireachtas, he stated that he considered those charged with the maintenance of records should be given a reasonable period to set up and maintain the scheme designed and intended by the legislation.  I remind Deputies that the 2005 Act only came into operation on 8 March 2005.  This is a new area of responsibility that requires appropriate new review procedures to be devised and implemented.  That is what took so long.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-04-25 00:00:00	Prelude	243	I am aware the authority to authorise interceptions is a matter for the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform.  Since I presume that power is exercised judiciously, I have no concern about it.  I am concerned, however, to know the Taoiseach's response to the view of the Assistant Data Protection Commissioner that perfectly innocent people are having their private records pored over.  There were 10,000 applications from the Garda Síochána alone, which is an extraordinary number, almost 30 per day.  Will the Taoiseach address this incredible number of resorts to this power?  Is the Taoiseach concerned that the Assistant Data Protection Commissioner made these remarks?
#RoryOHanlon	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-party	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-dob	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-04-25 00:00:00	Prelude	244	That is a question for the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-04-25 00:00:00	Prelude	245	Is it normal in peacetime that the Army would access this information in this way?  Should there not be a public awareness campaign to inform citizens that there is a referee?
#RoryOHanlon	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-party	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-dob	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-04-25 00:00:00	Prelude	246	We are straying into an area that is more appropriate to the line Minister.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-04-25 00:00:00	Prelude	247	I do not think I will get the opportunity in the time remaining in this Dáil to ask the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform about this matter.  I also do not think he will be the Minister in the next Dáil so I hope the Taoiseach might be kind enough to answer the question about the apparently high number of resorts to this legislation by the Garda Síochána.
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-04-25 00:00:00	Prelude	248	Deputy Rabbitte asked if I think the numbers sound high and I do, but I am assured in the report that the proper procedures and requirements are scrupulously observed.  It is not a loose arrangement; a case must be put forward by the gardaí and sanctioned by the Minister.  I do not have the figures for the number of requests made by the Army but I assume those numbers were higher in the past for obvious reasons.The important issue is not the number of complaints made, but the number substantiated.  The complaints referee has never provided me with a report to the effect that a contravention of either Act has occurred.  It seems fair, however, that we should highlight the fact that there is a complaints referee.On the question of the Assistant Data Protection Commissioner asking if personal phone records are being properly accessed, it is my understanding that he has no role in the area and complaints cannot be considered by him or by the Data Protection Commission.  They can only be considered by a complaints referee, who is an independent judicial officeholder.Under the Act, if the complaints referee upholds a complaint, he is required to inform the complainant in writing of this, report his findings to the Taoiseach and, if he thinks fit, by order, do one or more of the following: quash the authorisation, direct the destruction of any copy of the communication intercepted or make a recommendation for the payment of a sum to the complainant by way of compensation.  That is set out in the Act and I am responsible for appointing the complaints referee.  The Act requires that the holder of the role shall either be a judge of the Circuit Court, a judge of the District Court or a practising barrister or solicitor of not less than ten years' standing.  Judge Carroll Moran is the current complaints referee under the Act.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-04-25 00:00:00	Prelude	249	Why was no report laid before the Houses by the designated judge in respect of applications by the Garda Síochána?  The report before the Houses concerns the inspection of the Army records.  The judge says the documents he has inspected related to those located in the premises of the Army.  No such document in respect of the Garda Síochána was laid before the Houses by the judge.  According to the report, in the exercise of his powers of review on 30 March 2007, he attended the location at which the records of the Army are maintained.  I cannot find such a document from the designated judge in respect of applications by the Garda Síochána.
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-04-25 00:00:00	Prelude	250	I understand there must be a review in respect of both and I will raise the point.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-04-25 00:00:00	Prelude	251	Deputy Rabbitte has raised a matter of fundamental importance.  There is extraordinary usage of mobile phone technology in this country and the vast majority of people are not aware of the implications of the legislation.

#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-04-25 00:00:00	Prelude	253	The Taoiseach is going to make a statement on the report he received.  I am not asking any detailed questions but most people do not appreciate that the details, but not the content, of every telephone call, mobile phone call, fax, internet use and e-mail are stored for three years.  The information includes a daily record of the physical location of mobile phone users and data on every number called, the time of the call and its duration.  The vast majority of people do not know that fact.Deputy Rabbitte mentioned 10,000 requests by the Garda Síochána.  Three of the top technology leaders in high profile companies have warned that the data retention legislation could impact on the country's business climate and competitiveness.

#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-04-25 00:00:00	Prelude	255	The Taoiseach is aware of this issue.  The managing director of Microsoft said that Irish legislation is going beyond what is required from an EU perspective and will place significant additional costs——

I cannot answer as regards everything else.  That information is stored.  I cannot answer who has access to it or who can get it because I do not have information on these procedures.  The range of information stored has been highlighted before.  As regards the ways people can access such information, I can only answer in the context that there are procedures.  On the broader question being raised by the Deputy, I say the answer is "Yes", because quite frankly I do not know.
#TrevorSargent	unknown-#TrevorSargent-party	unknown-#TrevorSargent-dob	unknown-#TrevorSargent-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-04-25 00:00:00	Prelude	274	I have listened with interest to what the Taoiseach had to say.  The question certainly raises the old maxim about life imitating art, given the film, "The Lives of Others" about east Germany that is currently being shown in cinemas.  It begs a question that the Taoiseach is in the best position to answer.  Given the think tank report entitled, Power to the People, does he accept that it is not in the interest of public confidence in the authorities if we do not have a clear understanding as to why there is a need for such a large amount of surveillance?

#TrevorSargent	unknown-#TrevorSargent-party	unknown-#TrevorSargent-dob	unknown-#TrevorSargent-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-04-25 00:00:00	Prelude	278	I am simply quoting from that report, which is relevant to the question we are debating.  It says that people have confidence in the Garda, but not in the complaints procedure.  Will the Taoiseach accept that work needs to be done here?  We will not continue to have public confidence in the law enforcement agencies unless there is a clear explanation as regards the extraordinary amount of surveillance that has been brought to light.
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-04-25 00:00:00	Prelude	279	Gardaí have to follow a procedure that is set down if they wish to get interception.  That has to be approved by the Minister and in the case of a complaint the role of the complaints referee is also laid down in legislation.  I have outlined already what has to happen.  If the Complaints Commissioner upholds a complaint, he can inform the complainant of this in writing.  He reports his findings to me.  I have not received any findings.  If he sees fit, he may, by order, do one or more of the following: he can quash the authorisation to intercept under the Act, he can direct the destruction of the copy of communications intercepted, or he can recommend the payment of a sum to the complainant by way of compensation.  All of this procedure is laid down in legislation.As regards questions concerning data in companies and other systems and whether they are properly controlled and maintained, I cannot answer because I do not have the facts.

In view of the importance of this issue I hope the Ceann Comhairle agrees to this request.
#JerryCowleyIND	unknown-#JerryCowleyIND-party	unknown-#JerryCowleyIND-dob	unknown-#JerryCowleyIND-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-04-25 00:00:00	Prelude	282	I had my hand up, by the way, to ask the Taoiseach about an information commissioner of interceptions, such as exists in other jurisdictions, the UK for instance, where people have a right to have this information in the form of an annual report which shows some transparency.  Because of the proliferation of technology and fears that gardaí are using this mechanism as a net to totally blanket an area in investigating crime, while such initiatives are only right, there have to be proper safeguards.  There is a commissioner of interceptions in the UK with powers to do that and we should have something similar here.

This has widespread support politically and within the community.

Last evening, the Criminal Justice Bill went through its final passage with whole sections of it not addressed.  The Offences against the State Act is an important issue which comes up annually.  We all know that it was signalled clearly in the Good Friday Agreement, and during its subsequent endorsement, that all oppressive legislation affecting North and South of this island would be revisited.  I have no issue that the legislation will be discussed but it is imperative we allow for adequate debate.Inadequate time is being provided and it is particularly apt given that the situation has changed markedly regarding these offensive Acts.  The time allotted is grossly insufficient to address all matters concerned.  Will the Taoiseach expand the time for the motion?  I appeal to Members to have the courage to remove these offensive Acts from the Statute Book——
#RoryOHanlon	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-party	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-dob	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-04-25 00:00:00	Prelude	292	There will be an opportunity to speak on that matter.

#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-04-25 00:00:00	Prelude	294	I introduced the Act in 1998 in the aftermath of the Omagh bombing.  The House met in special session to pass that legislation.  The International Monitoring Commission report, published in the past several hours, shows there are at least three militant, illegal, and dissident republican paramilitary groups operating in the State.  That is why it is necessary to extend this legislation.  I would also like to come to the day when we would not require it.  However, it is clear from today's IMC report that it is required.
#RoryOHanlon	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-party	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-dob	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-04-25 00:00:00	Prelude	295	Is the proposal for dealing with No. 1, Medical Practitioners Bill 2007, amendments from the Seanad, agreed to?
#EmmetStagg	unknown-#EmmetStagg-party	unknown-#EmmetStagg-dob	unknown-#EmmetStagg-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-04-25 00:00:00	Prelude	296	It is not agreed.  One of the primary purposes of this democratic Assembly is to hold the Executive to account.  Since Christmas every debate on legislation that has come before the House has been cut off by the Government using its majority in the House.  This is treating this Legislature with contempt and it is unacceptable.  This further guillotining of legislation is not acceptable to the Labour Party.

I agree with the arguments presented by Deputy Stagg.  It is unacceptable that this practice of guillotining continues.  It always applies to the run-up to a recess or the dissolution of the Dáil.  It is time to have a proper debate on the measures contained in this important Bill.  It should be left open to the House to fully debate it.

#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-04-25 00:00:00	Prelude	299	No.  This important legislation deals with the modernisation of water services, a matter not unconnected with the problems people in Galway are experiencing.  It took the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government almost two years to prepare the legislation.  It was published in 2003 but he took until the beginning of 2005 to get it through Second Stage.  He then sat on it for 18 months before bringing it to the select committee, which completed its work on it on 22 November 2006.  The Minister has sat on it for the past five months before ordering Report Stage.  He expects us to deal with it in five hours, late at night and on one of the last Dáil sitting days.  It is not acceptable to the House or as a means of dealing with important legislation.

#TrevorSargent	unknown-#TrevorSargent-party	unknown-#TrevorSargent-dob	unknown-#TrevorSargent-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-04-25 00:00:00	Prelude	302	I concur with Deputy Gilmore.  This legislation should have been dealt with years ago, saving a large amount of grief, money, sickness and problems that will impact on life, health and business.  The legislation needs the time to be dealt with in detail.  Unless we get this Bill  right, what is happening in Galway will happen elsewhere.  The population pressure on the east coast makes the matter more serious.  The number of group water schemes failing standards and public water schemes that are not even inspected highlights that unless resources are put in with this legislation we are wasting our time.  Will the Government specify whether the resources will be allocated to give this Bill effect?

I cannot imagine that in five hours we will deal with the tremendous problems that have arisen in Galway and other parts of the country.  This is an important issue for people's health, particularly for children and the elderly.  Many Members on all sides of the House will want to be involved in this debate.  We cannot do it justice in five hours.

This morning there are no fewer than 280 statutory documents on the Order Paper, some of them going back to 1940.  Will the Taoiseach give some indication of what is happening?  One would not get 280 such instruments following the summer recess.  Where did these come from and what is happening?  Were they overlooked and not laid before the House at the time?By the end of every October schools must furnish the figures for classroom sizes to the Department of Education and Science.  I have tabled a series of parliamentary questions including some as recently as before the Easter recess.  According to the Minister for Education and Science, "the details of the current year are currently being compiled by my Department and the information requested is not readily available".

Deputies will be aware that in previous years this kind of resolution was usually moved in June.  However, to avoid any uncertainty surrounding sittings of the House between now and 30 June, the decision was made to bring forward the consideration of this issue.  A similar approach was adopted in 2002 and it is fully in accordance with law.The 1998 Act was enacted in the aftermath of the Omagh bomb of August 1998, which claimed the lives of 29 innocent people and injured more than 200 others.  That callous atrocity occurred a few months after the signing of the Good Friday Agreement and was clearly designed to derail the peace process.  Thankfully, that end was not achieved.  In fact, we are now moving inexorably towards an historic new beginning with the reinstitution of devolved administration in Northern Ireland.In terms of the Omagh bombing, Deputies will be aware there is an ongoing criminal action against a person in Northern Ireland in respect of those murders.  A civil action against a number of persons is also being pursued by the families of the victims.  I should mention also that the retrial of another individual in connection with the bombing is also pending in this jurisdiction.  Moreover, the investigation into the bombing remains open on both sides of the Border and there continues to be excellent co-operation between the Garda authorities and the PSNI in this regard.Deputies will recall that in recognition of the exceptional circumstances surrounding the enactment of the 1998 Act, there was general agreement that certain of its sections should be regularly revisited by the Oireachtas.  The purpose of this recurring Oireachtas scrutiny is to determine if current circumstances justify the continuance in force of those provisions.  Accordingly, by virtue of resolutions passed by the Dáil and the Seanad on 14 and 15 June 2006, respectively, the relevant sections of the 1998 Act will cease to operate on and from 30 June next unless a further resolution is passed by each House authorising those sections to continue to operate for a further period not exceeding 12 months.Part of the process surrounding the Dáil's consideration of the renewal of sections of the Act requires the Tánaiste and Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to lay a report on their operation before the House prior to the resolution being moved.  The Tánaiste laid such a report before this House on 17 April.  The conclusion of that report is that the relevant sections of the 1998 Act should remain in force for a further 12 months.  In the first instance, this is the firm view of the Garda Síochána, which considers the Act to be vital in the continuing fight against terrorism.  In addition, the harsh reality is that, notwithstanding very positive developments in respect of the Provisional IRA, the dissident republican threat remains real and ever present.For evidence of this unfortunate conclusion, I refer Deputies to the 15th report of the Independent Monitoring Commission, published this morning, which focuses on the period from December 2006 to February 2007.  In the report, the Continuity IRA is found to have been responsible for a pipe bomb which failed to explode next to Lurgan PSNI station in December 2006.  The Continuity IRA also attempted to acquire weapons and undertook terrorist training.  It was engaged in smuggling, fuel laundering and robbery.  Furthermore, the report states that it was responsible for two murders.  These will be more fully reported on in the IMC's next report because they fall outside the scope of the current report.  The IMC's overall assessment of the Continuity IRA is that it remains active but that, for political reasons in the run-up to the elections in Northern Ireland last month, it was possibly less active than might have been the case.Óglaigh na hÉireann, a relatively new splinter group of the Continuity IRA, has recently become dangerously active.  In particular, it claimed responsibility for three pipe bomb attacks against PSNI premises and homes of PSNI officers.  One of the three devices used in these attacks functioned but only to a limited extent.  Moreover, it is reported that persons associated with the so-called Óglaigh na hÉireann were discovered in possession of bomb-making and other terrorist equipment in February 2007.In respect of the Real IRA, the IMC states that it was responsible for a failed mortar attack on Craigavon PSNI station in December last.  The organisation has continued to engage in serious crime, including smuggling, fuel laundering and robbery, and has also continued to recruit and attempt to procure weapons.  Although the Real IRA was less active recently, the IMC assesses that this was purely a tactical decision aimed at not weakening the position of the anti-policing republican candidates in the run up to the recent Northern Ireland elections.The pattern of dissident republicans lending their bomb-making expertise to organised criminal gangs is, unfortunately, well established and has become something of a cottage industry for certain individuals.  The most recent example of this occurred in County Clare earlier this month, when, as Deputies may recall, a viable device was found under the car of a targeted individual.  This is a deeply disturbing development and one which the Garda Síochána is actively seeking to counter.In addition to domestic terrorist groups, the international terrorist threat continues unabated.  The most recent and shocking example of this in Europe involved the planned use of liquid explosives in attacks on civil aviation targets between Britain and the US.  Thankfully, these attacks were foiled in August of last year and the consequences of this have been felt, quite literally, around the world through much more rigorous and extensive security arrangements at airports, including those in Ireland.Although the extent of the terrorist threat within the European Union varies greatly from one member state to another, it would be naive to imagine that Ireland is completely immune from these new forms of terrorism.  The Criminal Justice (Terrorist Offences) Act 2005 was enacted to deal with this international terrorist threat by enabling the application of the Offences Against the State Acts, including the 1998 Act, against international terrorist groups and individuals.  It might be worthwhile for Deputies to bear in mind that other countries have enacted even tougher legislation in response to the international terrorist threat.  In Britain, for example, 28-day detention is now permitted.  In that context, the provisions of the 1988 Act can be seen as a measured response.  I would caution, however, against any complacency in our response to the threat from terrorism.I will now deal briefly with the individual sections of the 1998 Act that the House is being asked to continue in force for a further 12 months.  I will outline the position as regards those sections of the 1998 Act that were used since the end of the last reporting period, namely, from 1 June 2006 to 7 April 2007.Section 2 was used on ten occasions.By way of explanation, section 2 provides that where, in any proceedings for membership of an unlawful organisation, the accused failed to answer or gave false or misleading answers to any question, the court may draw such inferences as appear proper.  However, a person cannot be convicted of the offence solely on an inference drawn from such a failure; there must be some other evidence which points towards a person's guilt.Section 3 was used on nine occasions and this section provides that, in proceedings for membership of an unlawful organisation, the accused must give notification of an intention to call a person to give evidence on his or her behalf, unless the court permits otherwise.Section 4 was used on seven occasions and amends section 3 of the Offences Against the State Act 1972 in such a way as to expand the definition of "conduct" that can be considered as evidence of membership of an unlawful organisation.  Specifically, "conduct" can now include matters such as "movements, actions, activities, or associations on the part of the accused".  This change simply aligns the definition of conduct in the 1972 Act with the reference to movements, actions, activities or associations used in section 2 of the 1998 Act.Section 5 was used on 39 occasions and provides for the drawing of adverse inferences in certain circumstances in the prosecution of a person for any offence under the Offences Against the State Acts, any offence scheduled under the Acts, and any offence arising out of the same set of facts as such an offence, provided that the offence carries a penalty of five years' imprisonment or more.  The effect is to allow a court to draw inferences where the accused relies on a fact in his or her defence that he or she could reasonably have been expected to mention during questioning or on being charged but did not do so.  As with section 2, however, a person cannot be convicted of the offence solely on an inference drawn from such a failure.Section 6 was used once.  It creates the offence of directing the activities of an organisation in respect of which a suppression order has been made under the Offences Against the State Act 1939.  Section 7 was used on nine occasions and makes it an offence to possess articles in circumstances giving rise to a reasonable suspicion that the article is in possession for a purpose connected with the commission, preparation or instigation of specified firearms or explosives offences.Section 9 was used on 79 occasions.  This section makes it an offence to withhold information which a person believes might be of material assistance in preventing the commission by another person of a serious offence or securing the apprehension, prosecution or conviction of another person for such an offence.Section 10 was used on eight occasions.  It extends the maximum period of detention permitted under section 30 of the Offences Against the State Act from 48 hours to 72 hours, but only on the express authorisation of a judge of the District Court.  In this regard, the judge must be satisfied, on the application of a Garda officer not below the rank of superintendent, that the further detention is necessary for the proper investigation of the offence concerned and that the investigation is being conducted diligently and expeditiously.  The person being detained is entitled to be present in court during the application and to make, or to have made, submissions on his or her behalf.  In the reporting period in question, an extension was applied for in eight cases and seven of these applications were granted with charges resulting in four of these cases.Section 11 was used on five occasions and this section allows a judge of the District Court to permit the re-arrest and detention of a person in respect of an offence for which he or she was previously detained under section 30 of the Offences Against the State Act but released without charge.  This further period must not exceed 24 hours and can only be authorised in circumstances where the judge is satisfied, on information supplied on oath by a member of the Garda Síochána, that further information has come to the knowledge of the Garda Síochána about that person's suspected participation in the offence.Section 14 was used on 120 occasions.  The effect of this section is to make the offences created under sections 6 to 9 and section 12 of the 1998 Act scheduled offences for the purposes of Part V of the 1939 Act.  This means that persons suspected of committing these offences are liable to arrest under section 30 of the 1939 Act.I will now turn to those sections of the 1998 Act that were not used in the period under report, namely, sections 8, 12 and 17.  Section 8 makes it an offence to collect, record or possess information which is likely to be useful to members of an unlawful organisation in the commission of serious offences.  Section 12 makes it an offence for a person to instruct or train another person in the making or use of firearms or explosives or to receive such training without lawful authority or reasonable excuse.Section 17 builds on the provision in the Criminal Justice Act 1994 providing for the forfeiture of property.  Essentially, the 1994 provision empowers a court, in its discretion, whenever any person is convicted of an offence under that Act, to order the forfeiture of any property in the possession of that person which was used, or intended to be used, to facilitate the commission of the offence.  The effect of section 17 is, in the case of a person convicted of specified offences relating to the possession of firearms or explosives, and where there is property liable to forfeiture under the 1994 Act, to require the court to order the forfeiture of such property unless it is satisfied that there would be a serious risk of injustice if it made such an order.Although these sections were not used in the period under report, I am sure that the House will agree that their continued availability is essential to an effective response to the threat from terrorist groups.  The information on the use made of the provisions of the 1998 Act is based on data received from the Garda authorities and is contained in the report on the Act laid before this House.The unfortunate fact remains that dissident republican groups remain active, ruthless and determined to strike if given the opportunity.  They remain resolutely opposed to the Good Friday Agreement and to the peace and devolution of powers it has brought, they remain determined to destroy that agreement and, I suggest, they remain prepared and willing to kill indiscriminately to this end.  As long as they continue to exist, there must be robust counter-measures available to the State.  The House, and indeed the people of this State, would rightly question the Government's commitment to defeating these organisations if we did not ensure adequate legislative provisions to meet this threat.It is worth remembering, not as rhetoric but as a reflection of reality, that a terrorist organisation needs to get lucky only once to cause significant loss of life.  It is essential, therefore, to have the means to prevent such acts.  For such powers to work, they must work preventively; otherwise, we risk handing the initiative to those organisations and this is something we cannot do.The Offences against the State (Amendment) Act 1998 is one element of the State's ongoing defence against the terrorist threat.  I urge the House not to countenance weakening any of the tools the State has at its disposal in the fight against terrorism.  I commend the resolution to the House.
#JimOKeeffe	unknown-#JimOKeeffe-party	unknown-#JimOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#JimOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-04-25 00:00:00	Prelude	351	Fine Gael supports this resolution to extend the provisions of the 1998 Act.  This is not an academic exercise.  A total of 247 persons were arrested under these provisions during the period under review.  Alarmingly, we see more and more clear evidence of links between dissident republicans and gangland crime and of dissident republicans co-operating with crime lords.  Today, a newspaper headline reads, "Man taken North and shot was probably victim of extortion bid".  Reference was made to the fact that the Garda "believes the kidnappers have links to the Real IRA in Derry" so we are not talking about academic matters here but real threats to people and considerable criminal activity of a most heinous nature.  Unfortunately the legacy of paramilitarism is alive and well, and it must be countered.As part of this effort we must ensure the availability to An Garda Síochána of the necessary powers to deal with those involved.  It is not that we just have isolated incidents here.  I quoted figures of 247 people having been arrested last year.  Today new crime figures have been released by the Central Statistics Office, with one figure being really alarming.  The number of offences for the discharge of firearms has increased by 41% compared to the first quarter of last year, an indication of the development in this country of people resorting to firearms.  It is also a clear indication to me of proof that former paramilitaries are now making available their expertise and peddling their wares to gang overlords in our society.We must confront this issue with every possible legitimate means.  After Omagh it was considered that certain measures were necessary to confront that threat and that is the reason the Offences against the State (Amendment) Act 1998 was brought into force by this House.  Fine Gael supported the enactment of that measure and supports its continuation.In some ways the threat facing the people of this State is now even greater.  There is clear evidence that the country is awash with firearms, and we have had a failed amnesty.  There is now evidence of increasing use of firearms in an increasing number of crimes occurring in this country.  We also have clear evidence that those who have acquired experience and expertise in this area in the past are now either directly involved in gangland criminal activity or are making the knowledge available to those so involved.  This evidence can be seen from the pipe bomb incidents mentioned by the Minister of State or elsewhere.  We must confront these people and one way of so doing is to continue the operation of this Act.I make these comments in the context that I would wish to see the day where the concept of emergency legislation can be a thing of the past.  I would aim to see two progressions.  The first is an ability to confront the rising crime figures and the resourcing of An Garda Síochána to enable it to do so.  Once those measures are successful, there will then be a case for putting in place the second, legislation which can stand the test of time and will not involve annual renewal of what was introduced as emergency measures.I do not see that happening while we have a continuing increase in crime, particularly serious crime.  I do not see it coming about while we have a continuing use of weapons in committing crimes.  It will not happen while we have the continual denial to An Garda Síochána of resources in manpower and equipment needs, and it will not happen in the context of promises being made in that regard which are not being kept.I have been accused, from time to time, of speaking politically in this matter.  That is what I am here for.  I have listened to the promises to provide to An Garda Síochána the numbers which were required, an extra 2,000 gardaí.  They have not been provided and the Government will have this on its conscience.  Instead of an extra 2,000 gardaí, 1,178 extra gardaí are all we have after five years of this Government in power.There is also a problem with equipment, on which promises were made and not kept.  Gardaí are still operating with 20-year-old walkie-talkies and confronting armed criminals.  It is unconscionable that a Government could face the electorate at this stage having that appalling record.Partly as a result of the neglect of the Government in not providing An Garda Síochána with the resources it urgently needs, I find myself supporting the Government in extending the provisions of the 1998 Act to ensure that at least the statutory provisions are there to enable them as best they can, with their limited resources, to confront this threat.  Until such time as there is a real and determined effort to resource An Garda Síochána to enable it to confront these criminals, be they former paramilitaries, associated with paramilitaries or otherwise, we will then have to speak of continuation of legislation of this kind.I hope to see, in the coming months and years, a new approach in this regard that will involve making those resources available, ensuring An Garda Síochána is fully equipped and aiming for what I have always wanted to see — this country having the best police force in the world.  At that stage we would have some hope in making progress against these criminals.  In the meantime we have no option but to continue these provisions as just one part of the legal armoury available to An Garda Síochána and enabling it to arrest people involved in these heinous crimes.

#RuairiQuinn	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-party	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-dob	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-04-25 00:00:00	Prelude	353	I will not take the 15 minutes.  Although this is not normally my territory, I have read the debate from last year and at the behest of Deputy Howlin, I am making a contribution on behalf of the Labour Party.Why do we have this legislation and why is it so starkly described?  It is useful for us to reflect on the fact that when this State, now only 85 years old, was first established in 1922, only two of the parties currently elected to this assembly actually recognised the legitimacy of the State.  Labour and Fine Gael have that honour.Although I do not have the precise dates, it seems it took Fianna Fáil more than four years to do so, and it did not enter this Chamber until 1927, doing so very reluctantly.  As the leader of the party after Éamon de Valera said, Fianna Fáil was a slightly constitutional party.  There was a big residual cultural reluctance to recognise the legitimacy of the State.  Many on the periphery of Fianna Fáil in the 1930s did not recognise this legitimacy and thought Fianna Fáil, their ally, would indulge them.  These people were put in jail by the party and in some cases, they were hanged.I stand open to correction but I believe Sinn Féin only decided to enter the Dáil in the early 1990s.  The constitutional amendments which repealed Articles 2 and 3 were only ratified after the Good Friday Agreement in 1998, and consummated with the St. Andrew's Agreement, the election of the Assembly and the decision of Dr. Ian Paisley of the Democratic Unionist Party to recognise our legitimacy from across the Border.  There was also the recognition from Sinn Féin, under the leadership of Gerry Adams, to recognise the legitimacy of the Border, however much it may dislike it.Against that entire historical background it is necessary for us to realise and understand the reasons the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform is the way it is to this day about security and confidentiality matters, and why we are today discussing the renewal of essential legislation.  Very few European countries have the legacy of history that Ireland has in this respect.  Some countries like Spain, Portugal and Greece suffered dictatorship for many years.  None of the participants in those countries' struggles, with the possible exceptions of the Basques and, to a lesser extent, the Catalonians, disputed the legitimacy of the states in which they were living.  They merely disputed who should be in control of those countries, which is a different thing altogether.  Our political culture is unique in some ways within the framework of Europe.We are battling against the anti-democratic forces of terror, violence and unreason which have refused to accept a majority vote.  I refer, for example, to the people who brought firearms to Cabinet meetings in the early 1920s as protection.  The SDLP famously had a standing order, which applied to its parliamentary party and political group, whereby the first thing its members had to do at meetings was to take out their weapons and leave them on the mantelpiece.  The tensions which were caused by the physical violence that surrounded the actions of democratic SDLP politicians were revealed some time ago by the late Paddy Devlin.  One cannot live in the kind of environment or culture in which the State lived until very recently without being affected by it.  The small number of people who fostered that culture has declined in recent times, as the political process has been embraced by those who previously repudiated it.  The Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, or more accurately the Department of Justice, is one of the bodies that was badly affected by that environment when it was besieged by forces which were antagonistic to the State.  Perhaps certain officials in the Department knew far more about those forces than many Deputies who were not party to such information.Some of my colleagues were probably present in the House when Deputy Howlin spoke about these matters last year.  I invite the Minister and the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform to be more open with elected Members of the House, as distinct from the security committee of the Cabinet.  While the siege is lifting, it has not lifted entirely.  In a world of international terrorism and global crime, we can begin to reform the State's security culture.  It needs to be recognised, in the offices on St. Stephen's Green and elsewhere, that certain people have recognised the legitimacy of this State.  The historical compromise that has been reached in Northern Ireland enables the vast majority of people who are involved in the political process to recognise the legitimacy of this State, even if they do not like certain aspects of it and are vehemently opposed to those who currently hold office.  They have the right, within a legitimate democracy, to hold such views.I support the proposal to renew the 1998 legislation.  The Minister of State, Deputy Fahey, has placed a stark report on the record of the House.  He mentioned that 247 people have been prosecuted under the legislation.  It would be interesting to get the equivalent figure for convictions.  I do not have that information directly to hand.  The Minister systematically went through the use of certain sections of the Act, which have been availed of on 277 occasions.  That is the figure that has emerged from the rough calculations I have done, although arithmetic has never been my strong point.  I suspect that many non-contentious Acts on this House's Statute Book have not enjoyed such frequency of usage in a single year.  Such statistics indicate that we need to renew this legislation for another year, particularly in the context of the crossover into criminal gangland crime by some dissident republicans in the South and some dissident loyalists in the North.  Now that such people are no longer part and parcel of political movements which have moved in directions with which they disagree, they are engaging in "arms for hire" activities to finance certain lifestyles.We would be wise to retain these provisions for another year.  The Minister or, more properly, the Department might consider in next year's report whether we should retain the Special Criminal Courts in their existing form.  Such courts have been established in the past on the basis of evidence of witness intimidation.  Today's newspapers report that a recent case in that regard resulted in a successful conviction by jury trial, which is the best way to proceed.  However, the Garda fears that there will be a backlash of violence in gangland circles as a result of the trial.  It has been reported that people were shot at, and in some cases killed, during a process of intimidation that was undertaken before the trial came to a conclusion.  Perhaps the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform will review such problems and make a contribution to solving them next year when it makes decision on whether to renew this legislation.The Minister and the Department were right to initiate this process of renewal.  The 1998 legislation continues to be necessary, sadly.  I hope it will become redundant in due course.  There seems to be an indication, on foot of the political process, that it is becoming more redundant.  Certain people have not made the journey that has been made by those who once marched beside them.  That appears to have been confirmed by the reports of an abduction in the last 48 hours, although we do not know the motivation for that incident.  The State has a duty to defend the rights of citizens.  If citizens' lives are threatened by groups which contemptuously consider themselves to be outside the jurisdiction of the State, the power to protect such people needs to be given by the State rightly, and the Legislature properly, to the office holders of the Government, the Garda and the courts.  While I welcome the renewal of this legislation, I ask the Department and the Minister to put in train a process of review of other aspects of our security apparatus, in the context of the progress that has undoubtedly been made, even if the journey has not yet been completed.

#JoeHiggins	unknown-#JoeHiggins-party	unknown-#JoeHiggins-dob	unknown-#JoeHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-04-25 00:00:00	Prelude	357	The Offences against the State (Amendment) Act 1998 was introduced in the aftermath of the Omagh bombing, which was an atrocity that shocked and revolted people in all parts of this island and throughout the world.  The Socialist Party opposed the campaigns of paramilitary organisations from the beginning of the Troubles in Northern Ireland.  It pointed out that it was futile for republicans to believe that their campaign could force a British withdrawal.  The Socialist Party indicated that paramilitary campaigns and actions, in general, helped to increase the divisions between the communities in the North, rather than improving the circumstances of working people there.  It argued that the critical social and economic problems of Northern Ireland, as well as the national question in general, could be resolved not by the campaigns of self-appointed elites, but by the mobilisation of working-class people in Northern Ireland.  My party suggested that working people in the North should unite around their common interests and across boundaries and divisions.  Its position on the negative role of individual terror and paramilitary campaigns over 30 or 40 years has been vindicated.The Socialist Party has always strenuously opposed the introduction of repressive legislation, whether by the British or Irish Governments.  Such legislation is typically introduced on the basis of an emergency, supposedly for a short period of time.  It is usually kept on the Statute Book indefinitely, to be used as the State wishes in cases which sometimes have nothing to do with the initial reasons for its introduction.  The Offences Against the State Act 1939, for example, is a wide-ranging and all-embracing repressive statute.  It does not simply deal with paramilitary organisations and issues of that nature.  For example, it provides for the criminalisation of community organisations' peaceful political campaigns, such as advocating the non-payment of water charges or the withholding of road tax in protest against potholes, as we saw at times in the past.  Similarly, the legislation rushed through in 1998 as a response to the Omagh bomb atrocity introduces criminality into actions that can be quite innocent and provides for a catch-all approach which allows gardaí to obtain convictions.  Speaking in this House, the Minister referred to so-called tougher British legislation to portray the 1998 Act in a good light.  I remind him that serious miscarriages of justice occurred as a result of British legislation.  Have we forgotten the Birmingham Six, the Guildford Four and the Maguire family, all innocent people who were framed on foot of repressive legislation?There is no need to renew this legislation.  We welcome the fact the major paramilitary groups have given up their campaigns, hopefully completely, but it was not this legislation which made the various dissident parliamentary groups in Irish society impotent and non-viable; it was the absolute revulsion of ordinary Irish people and the movements of opposition among working class communities against the campaigns being waged and events such as the atrocity in Omagh.Seo an tairiscint:Go mbeartaíonn Dáil Éireann go leanfaidh ailt 2 go 12, 14 agus 17 den Acht um Chiontaí in aghaidh an Stáit (Leasú) 1998 (Uimh. 39 de 1998), i ngníomh ar feadh na tréimhse 12 mhí dar tosach an 30ú Meitheamh, 2007.Cuirim ina aghaidh sin go láidir.

Caithfidh aon Teachta a chuir luach ar bith ar dhaonlathas i dtús báire vótáil i gcoinne an rúin agus ansin gníomhú chun an tAcht seo agus an cód speisialta a théann leis a aisghairm ina iomláine.Ní leor an méid atá sa tuairisc lenar ghlac an tAire os ár gcomhair chun cíoradh ceart a dhéanamh ar na forálacha mídhaonlathacha seo.  Cad is fiú liosta de cé chomh minic is a úsáideadh na forálacha éagsúla má táimid in ainm cíoradh ceart a dhéanamh ar oibríocht an Achta éigeandála seo, an Achta um Chiontaí in aghaidh an Stáit?  Níl go leor ama agam inniu chun plé ceart nó mion a dhéanamh ar na forálacha éagsúla agus an tslí a dtagann siad salach ar bhunchearta daonlathacha.  Dírím aird ar cheithre alt, 6, 8, 12 agus 17, trí cinn acu nár úsáideadh le trí bliana anuas ar a laghad, agus ceann amháin, alt 6, nár úsáideadh ach uair amháin.  Léiríonn sé sin nach bhfuil siad riachtanach, fiú.Even leaving aside the issues of disproportionality and non-compliance with human rights, the necessity for this legislation has not been demonstrated.  The use of draconian provisions such as the measure proposed for renewal today is no longer tenable.  A new political dispensation has come into being on this island and Martin McGuinness and Ian Paisley will presently take up their positions as Deputy First Minister and First Minister in a power sharing Executive.  It is time for this anti-republican Progressive Democrats Minister and his Government partners in Fianna Fáil to join the new dispensation.  During last year's debate, the Minister rightly noted that the full implementation of the Good Friday Agreement remains an ongoing challenge.  However, the onus is on him and the Government to live up to their obligations under the agreement to deliver security and normalisation.  For that reason, scrapping the Offences Against the State Act should be a goal for all in this House.  Neither the provisions proposed for renewal nor the Act in its entirety has any place in the present or future of this island.The Minister sees imaginary threats to the security of the State when it suits his agenda to do so and his desire to hang on to this legislation regardless of the realities on the ground stems from that tactic.  Last June, he attempted to justify the renewal of these sections on the basis of an Islamic fundamentalist threat or, in his own words, "the newer and more sinister forms of international terrorism, in particular jihadist terrorism".  While I presume he was relying on so-called intelligence from the Garda special branch to substantiate his claim, I cannot know that for certain because there is no independent oversight of this area of policing.  This grave deficiency lends itself to the sort of political policing we have come to know and expect from the Garda special branch.  I need only observe the fabrication of evidence and intelligence in County Donegal to reinforce my concerns.  Garda special branch intelligence often relies on information from the United States, but consider the war that country fought in Iraq based on intelligence about weapons of mass destruction.If public security is to be promoted and protected, it must be seen as part of a comprehensive human security approach.  Such an approach was formalised by the Commission on Human Security at the UN millennium summit in order to promote a shift in security thinking away from the exclusive and invariably militarist focus on states and towards the daily insecurities experienced by most people, such as poverty, disease, conflict, human rights abuses and economic and environmental uncertainty.  If this Government really wants to protect Irish people, it should reverse its current foreign policy in order to pursue a policy of positive neutrality and end the use of Shannon Airport by US troops in their so-called war on terror.The apathy of most of the Opposition on this matter and the ill-advised enthusiasm of others for these measures has obvious negative implications for Irish society.  We need a fuller debate on the effects of this legislation over a period longer than the one granted to us each year.  Given the implications of these provisions, the short amount of time available to discuss them is meaningless.
#DanBoyle	unknown-#DanBoyle-party	unknown-#DanBoyle-dob	unknown-#DanBoyle-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-04-25 00:00:00	Prelude	359	I am grateful to my colleague, Deputy Ó Snodaigh, for allowing me to make a brief contribution.  The annual renewal of this section of the Offences Against the State Act should receive the full engagement of Members of this House.  A truly free society would not need legislation of this type and the fact it has continued beyond its historical setting is more a matter of political expediency than public safety.  We should have a more honest debate on that issue.The Minister is unwilling to introduce the changes necessary to make clauses of this nature obsolete because it does not suit his political hard man persona.  In reality, however, he is a man of straw when it comes to public confidence and safety.  He needs to invent bogeymen and threats because his political existence depends on inculcating fear in society.  There is undoubtedly a need for structures and systems of support for the Judiciary, the legal system and the police force, but this grants extra powers that arose in an historical context and might be deemed counterproductive in an historical analysis, even from the perspective of the legislation's very existence.Given its limited relevance in 2007 and the need to invent pretexts and threats to justify its continued existence, a society that strives to become more free should not have on the Statute Book provisions that allow its citizens to become compromised in such situations.  We should not tolerate that, and that is why we should move as quickly as possible to a genuine reconsideration of this Act and the type of legislation that would address public needs and the real threats nationally and internationally.On those grounds, it may not be worthwhile going through the motions of opposing this, since the Government has decided that it will pass one way or another.  At the very least, however, one must protest against the claim that it is necessary that the provision continue.  A new Government in the next Dáil must examine it properly.
#FrankFahey	unknown-#FrankFahey-party	unknown-#FrankFahey-dob	unknown-#FrankFahey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-04-25 00:00:00	Prelude	360	I thank Deputies for their contributions to this important debate.In an ideal world there would be no need for such legislation.  However, for as long as there are groups and individuals bent on usurping the democratic institutions of this jurisdiction, the State must have at its disposal the means to protect itself.  We know from bitter experience that those organisations have few qualms, if any, regarding the methods they employ to further their aims.  It is their readiness to bomb and kill and the contempt they show for the legitimate will of the democratically elected Government of the country that maintain the need for this Act.The people of this island, North and South, have shown through their ringing endorsement of the Good Friday Agreement their rejection of violence as a feature of political struggle.  Until the various offshoots of the physical-force republican movement that remain committed to violence give up the gun, the State will be required to continue to take measures to ensure public safety.  That includes some former members of organisations that we are all delighted to accept have done so.I will also comment on a commitment made by the Government under the Good Friday Agreement to initiate a wide-ranging review of the Offences Against the State Act 1939.  In 1998 the then Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform appointed a committee chaired by the former Supreme Court judge Anthony Hederman to conduct the review.  The committee's final report, published in August 2002, is extensive and deals with complex issues of law and policy.  It also involves important considerations concerning the balance to be struck between national and international security on the one hand and civil liberties and individual rights on the other.Several Deputies raised issues that I would like to address.  Deputy Jim O'Keeffe mentioned Garda resources.  The Garda Síochána has in its ranks the greatest number of members in the history of the State.  A new, secure digital radio system for gardaí is being developed at a cost of tens of millions.  A requirement to renew the provisions is a function of the Oireachtas and has nothing to do with Garda resources.The Good Friday Agreement commits the Government to initiating a wide-ranging review to reform or dispense with those elements no longer required, as circumstances permit.  Since that time we have witnessed the Omagh bombing, in response to which the 1998 Act was passed.  We have also seen a rise in certain forms of international terrorism, which has cost the lives of thousands, and must also be very vigilant in that regard.  The British Government has introduced extremely strong counter-terrorism legislation, and in the circumstances the continuation of the 1998 Act is not unusual, unexpected or extraordinary.The Garda Inspectorate is an entirely independent body responsible for providing independent oversight of all Garda activities, including the special detective unit.  That issue is very adequately——

#FrankFahey	unknown-#FrankFahey-party	unknown-#FrankFahey-dob	unknown-#FrankFahey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-04-25 00:00:00	Prelude	362	I am not talking about the Garda Ombudsman but about the Garda Inspectorate, an entirely independent body which is responsible for all Garda activities, including the special detective unit.  That some sections of the Act have either not been used or have been used very little is irrelevant.  The important thing is that we have such sections in place in case they prove necessary.It is no exaggeration to state that the environment in which states seek to protect themselves has undergone a drastic transformation following the rise in certain forms of international terrorism.  Ireland, with its EU partners, continues to have a duty to contribute proactively to international security in the interests of public safety, both domestically and internationally.The Criminal Justice (Terrorist Offences) Act 2005 was passed to deal with that international terrorist threat by enabling the application of the Offences Against the State Act 1939 to international terrorist groups and individuals.  Although I do not wish to alarm people, I repeat that it would be very naive of anyone to think that Ireland does not need at its disposal the instruments necessary to fight international terrorism.I have already mentioned the peace process, but I reiterate that the IMC report states that the Provisional IRA has had no recent involvement in terrorist activity, shootings, assaults, sectarian violence or intimidation.  Moreover, the IMC is not aware of any recent instances in which the Provisional IRA has been involved in exiling people.  That is a very welcome development for which people fought over many years.  It is a tribute to those who fought to bring about an end to Provisional IRA violence that it has now happened.  It is a tribute also to those who were involved that they have now put a stop to it.  That was demanded for many years in this House, and it is to be applauded.No one has invented the threats.  The Omagh bomb was not an invention, and those responsible, the "Real IRA", are still pursuing their armed campaign.  It is very important that we be acutely aware of the continuing threat of the Real IRA and the Continuity IRA.  It is also very important to recognise that the threat of international terrorism continues to be very evident and could come to this country at any stage.  For that reason, aside from our domestic situation, it is essential that this legislation remain in force.

#SeamusBrennan	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-party	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-dob	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-04-25 00:00:00	Prelude	366	It is a fundamental principle of our social insurance system that those qualifying for benefits must satisfy a range of contribution and other conditions.  In the case of contributory pensions, this involves commencing payment of contributions ten years before pension age, payment of a minimum number of contributions at an appropriate rate and reaching a minimum average annual contribution rate.  The State pension — contributory — is a valuable benefit and the conditions are designed to ensure that those qualifying have had a sufficient and ongoing attachment to the social insurance system.The case reported on by the Irish Human Rights Commission, IHRC, involves a couple who were over 56 years of age in 1988 when compulsory social insurance for the self-employed was introduced.  Accordingly, they were unable to satisfy one of the basic requirements for pension as they did not commence paying insurance ten years before pension age.  In 1999 a special half rate pension was introduced for individuals in this group based on the payment of 260 contributions and, again, the couple involved did not satisfy the qualifying condition.  While one party of the couple could have qualified had the necessary contributions been paid, because of advanced age the other person would not have been able to make the necessary contributions before reaching pension age.  A refund of part of the social insurance contributions was available to such people from 1996.Having considered the case, the IHRC has recommended that a reduced benefit be paid to people who, because of advanced age, could not satisfy the conditions for the special pension introduced in 1999.  The recommendations of the IHRC are based on its assessment of the situation under the European Convention on Human Rights, the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the European Code of Social Security.On the European Code of Social Security, the IHRC places particular emphasis on provisions in regard to the position of people who, by reason of their age when provisions are introduced, cannot satisfy contribution or employment conditions.  The Department makes annual reports on compliance with this code to the Council of Europe, summarising changes to the social welfare system.  These reports are then referred to the committee of experts of the International Labour Organization, ILO, for its examination.  The Department's 1999 report included details of the provisions on the self-employed that are now the subject of the IHRC investigation.  At that time, the ILO committee confirmed that Ireland met its obligations.Accordingly, as an initial step in its review of the IHRC report, my Department has asked the ILO's committee of experts for its views on the way in which the IHRC has interpreted the relevant articles.  The position will be reviewed in the light of the views received.
#DavidStanton	unknown-#DavidStanton-party	unknown-#DavidStanton-dob	unknown-#DavidStanton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-04-25 00:00:00	Prelude	367	I thank the Minister for his response.  Does he agree that it appears that the international human rights standards, such as the European Convention on Human Rights and the European Code of Social Security, have not been respected entirely in this matter?  Does he agree that the advanced age of a person alone should not exclude him or her from entitlement to the State pension?Is the Minister aware of the submissions of other organisations, such as the IFA's pre-budget submission of 2007, which expresses concern over the treatment of a relatively small group of self-employed people who were between the ages of 60 and 65 in April 1998?  Will he state how many persons were affected adversely such that they could receive no benefits in spite of their having had to make contributions?  What are his personal views and when does he or his Department expect to receive a report from the ILO on the matter?My main point concerns the human rights standard.  Does the Minister agree with the IHRC's recommendation that a reduced benefit be paid to self-employed people who contributed to the social insurance scheme but did not qualify for the pension only because of their age when the legislation came into force?  Does he agree that this policy is ageist and should be reviewed?  How many individuals are affected?
#SeamusBrennan	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-party	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-dob	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-04-25 00:00:00	Prelude	368	As I stated, I asked the ILO's committee of experts for its views on the way in which the IHRC has interpreted the relevant articles.  I do not know when we will receive its views but as soon as we do, the Department will be well disposed to publishing the information.There are obviously anomalies throughout the system and we have made good progress in recent years in ironing them out.  A small number of people are affected.  When I met the IFA, it raised issues similar to the one raised by the Deputy.  One difficulty in addressing the matter concerns the implications for other schemes and the implications if one interferes with the basic principle of attachment to the social welfare system through making contributions from a certain date and meeting the necessary conditions.There are 3,500 people in receipt of the special half rate pension for the self-employed; there are 28,000 people in receipt of the pre-1953 pension; there are 13,300 people in receipt of the pro rata pension on the basis of EU and bilateral arrangements; and there are 1,800 people in receipt of mixed insurance pensions, at the modified and full rate.  There is no precise estimate of the number caught in the manner the Deputy describes and we await the views of the ILO on the matter.
#DavidStanton	unknown-#DavidStanton-party	unknown-#DavidStanton-dob	unknown-#DavidStanton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-04-25 00:00:00	Prelude	369	Does the Minister agree there are approximately 500 individuals affected altogether?  What is his personal view on the matter?  Has any thought been given to paying a pro rata pension?  We know individuals received the half rate pension if they had paid contributions for more than five years.  Some had paid for nine years, yet they only received half the pension, which seems unfair.  In this day and age, given the super-duper computers in the Department, it should be possible to arrange to pay people the pro rata pension.  In the case in question, doing so would be fairer.
#SeamusBrennan	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-party	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-dob	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-04-25 00:00:00	Prelude	370	The number who could benefit from the recommendations of the IHRC is limited.  The people in question were over 61 in 1988 and could not satisfy the conditions for a standard pension at that time and, because of their age, they were not in a position to make the 260 contributions required for the special pension, which was introduced in 1999.  It appears from our records that more than 700 people became insured for the first time in 1988.  This is the best estimate we have.  To pay a half rate pension to such people would cost approximately €4 million per annum and this can obviously be considered in a budgetary context following the advice of the ILO's committee of experts.
#SeamusBrennan	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-party	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-dob	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-04-25 00:00:00	Prelude	371	The second review of the social insurance fund, SIF, which is required under section 10 of the Social Welfare Consolidation Act 2005, has recently been completed.  The review was undertaken in accordance with the requirement that such reviews be carried out at five-yearly intervals, and the previous review was completed in June 2002.  The legislation also requires that the report be laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas within six months of its completion.The SIF provides insured contributors with pension benefits on retirement as a result of old age or incapacity, in addition to a range of short-term benefits.  The fund covers almost all employees and the self-employed in Ireland, although some contributors are only covered for a limited range of benefits.  The review examines the financial condition and sustainability of the fund at the end of 2005 when social insurance fund expenditure was €5.6 billion, income to the fund was €6.1 billion and there were some 2.8 million contributors.  The aim of the review is to establish the medium and long-term financial position of the social insurance fund.The review covers the period from 2006 to 2061.  A key objective of the review was to consider the adequacy or otherwise of the current contributions to finance social insurance fund benefits.  The review investigated the likely impact of different increases in benefit rates and contribution limits.  In addition, the effects of adjusting the retirement age are explored and assessed.  The report examines the potential financial impact of a number of possible future developments to the social insurance system.The review was overseen by a steering committee comprising representatives of my Department along with representatives of the Departments of Finance and Enterprise, Trade and Employment.  Economic assumptions relating to the period of the review were agreed between the steering committee and the consultants who also engaged an independent economist to assist in this process.  Migration projections, based on the projections of the CSO, were developed in a similar fashion.It is anticipated that the review will play an important role in ongoing consideration of appropriate social insurance contribution rates, payments and possible future subventions to the social insurance fund.  I look forward to presenting the report to the Houses of the Oireachtas once the Government has considered its contents.
#WilliamPenrose	unknown-#WilliamPenrose-party	unknown-#WilliamPenrose-dob	unknown-#WilliamPenrose-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-04-25 00:00:00	Prelude	372	The reason the report has not been published is that it runs contrary to what was proposed by the Taoiseach at the recent Fianna Fáil Ard-Fheis.  The report is being concealed.  How long has the Minister had the report?  What does the report contain?  Does it call for sharply increased PRSI contributions to finance the future pensions of an ever-ageing population?  Was a similar warning issued in a report in 2002?  What is the proportion of workers to pensioners?  Is this steadily declining?  In 2002, some 5.3 workers paid PRSI for every pensioner.  What is the figure per pensioner now?  Has it not declined?Social welfare benefits are financed entirely from the social insurance fund.  That is sacrosanct and cannot be touched.  It was run on a significant surplus except for when Mr. McCreevy raided €635 million from it in 2002.  There will be a surplus of €1.3 billion this year and the accumulated surplus will be approximately €5 billion.  It will take more than this figure to finance future pensions according to the report in the Department.  Deputies are entitled to ask questions to ascertain the position.We are all committed to providing a pension of €300 per week over the next five years.  Does that not require a significant amount of funds from the social insurance fund?  If there is a decrease in contributions to the PRSI fund, can the Minister guarantee that the €635 million deficit will be financed by general taxation to ensure that commitments to pensioners and others are met?  Is that the position or was this announcement, like many others at the Ard-Fheis, a surprise to the Minister?  Was the Department consulted?
#SeamusBrennan	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-party	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-dob	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-04-25 00:00:00	Prelude	373	Allow me to clear up the timeline.  This is the second review of the social insurance fund, required under section 10 of the Social Welfare Consolidation Act 2005.  It has been completed and is before Government.  Under the legislation, the review must be laid before the Houses within six months of its completion and clearance by the Government.  From a legal point of view, the Government could wait until the end of the year to publish the review.  There is no delay — we are ahead of schedule and should not be considering this for many months to come.  This is due to the excellent work of the steering group, the consultants and officials involved.There are now 2.8 million contributors to the fund.  The fund, established in 1953, was in deficit until 1996.  It had to be topped up by the Exchequer, as must be done by law if the fund is in deficit.  The pension review and the Green Paper, which is almost ready for publication, makes it clear that the ratio of people of working age to those of pension age is continually falling.  There is increased pressure on the fund.  The cumulative surplus in the social insurance fund was €2.4 billion in 2005.  The provisional outturn for 2006 is over €3 billion.  It is capable of meeting its commitments and this review will enable people to see where the fund is heading.  At present, it has a cumulative surplus.

Will the cumulative surplus disappear?  A significant input from general taxation will be required to cover the outflow arising from commitments on pensions, with which we all agree.  The commitment made by the Minister's party will lead to an immediate shortfall of €635 million.  In order to maintain the surplus general taxation must be used.  What is the position?  Will contributions fall as a result of proposed changes?

The number of people contributing is growing steadily and is currently at 2.8 million.  Assuming the economy keeps growing, in line with the Central Bank and other independent projections, the income to the fund will increase.  Any proposals made in the context of the election campaign and manifestos are the subject of hot and heavy debate in the coming weeks.  From my side of the House, we have recommended reducing the employee PRSI rate from 4% to 2%.  We also propose adjusting self-employed PRSI from 3% to 2%.  There is a cost involved and such costs must be provided from the Exchequer so that the fund will not be short as a result of policy proposals that the public may support.
#SeamusBrennan	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-party	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-dob	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-04-25 00:00:00	Prelude	376	It takes 15 weeks on average at present to finalise claims for carer's allowance.  During 2006, the average was just over ten weeks and in 2005, the average was almost 13 weeks.The reason for the current increase in average claim processing times is the increase in the number of claims being submitted.  The number of claims submitted in 2006 was more than 20% higher than the total for 2005.  A number of steps were taken to deal with this, including the deployment of additional staff and a revision of processing procedures to improve efficiency.  As a result, the number of claims finalised in 2006 was 9% higher than the total for 2005.While this led to an improvement in average claim processing times compared to the previous year, it did not keep pace with the increase in the volume of new claims.  As a result, average claim processing times have lengthened in 2007.  The number of claims submitted so far this year shows a further increase of more than 5% compared to the same period last year.  There are over 28,000 carers' allowances in payment at present, compared to 25,000 at the end of 2005 and 23,000 at the end of 2004.  There are currently 2,977 cases awaiting a decision, of which 67% were received within the past eight weeks.  The majority of claims currently on hand will be processed within 15 weeks.  With regard to the optimum claim processing time, my Department's aim is that 70% of claims for carer's allowance should be decided within nine weeks of submission.Entitlement to carer's allowance is based on an applicant satisfying medical, means and residency conditions.  In determining entitlement to the allowance there are, in certain cases, unavoidable time lags involved in making the necessary investigations and inquiries.  Delays can also arise if persons applying for the allowance are not in a position to supply all the necessary information in support of their claim.Many applicants for carer's allowance are already in receipt of another social welfare payment while their claim is being processed.  Such payments will normally continue until entitlement to their carer's allowance is determined.  Claimants who are not in receipt of any other social welfare payment may apply for supplementary welfare allowance in the interim period.The resources available to my Department must be deployed to ensure good customer service, prevent fraud and abuse of the schemes and achieve value for money.  My Department is engaged in an ongoing process to ensure that available resources are prioritised to the greatest extent possible on frontline service delivery and to ensure that the best possible standard of response is provided across the range of schemes and services.  The position will be kept under review to ensure that the best possible level of customer service and customer response continues to be provided.This approach brought about an improvement in claim processing times in 2006 compared to 2005.  I am confident claim processing times will improve in the coming months.

They pointed out that their circumstances had disimproved because they had taken on the role of carer.  At this most vulnerable time in their lives, they expected State support and were disappointed to find such a long delay in securing an allowance.I understand there can be complex cases but the vast majority of cases are straightforward.  Is there any explanation for the increase in the number of claims?  Could it be related to people being concerned about keeping their relatives out of hospital because of their worries about the health service?Nine weeks is a long optimum time.  I can understand that there will be cases that will take nine weeks because investigation is necessary, but I am surprised that most cases take more than four weeks.  Why is that the case?

On top of that, there is this year's decision to pay a half rate carer's allowance to anyone in receipt of another welfare payment.  There has been enormous pressure on those dealing with the carer's allowance and benefit in the Department.  Those involved must satisfy medical, means and residency conditions.  The number of claims submitted in 2006 was 20% higher than in 2005, a direct result of us ensuring more people are eligible to claim the allowance by relaxing the means test so more people are taken into the system.All applications that can be automatically approved medically are being fast-tracked.  Special arrangements apply in cases of extreme or serious illness as part of the medical assessment procedure.  Priority is being given to claims where a decision on entitlement has been outstanding for more than eight weeks.  Processes and procedures within the decision section have been examined to eradicate any processes that can contribute to the delay.  Every effort is being made to address the backlog.  I regret the delays but they are the direct result of an enormous increase in applications brought about by a relaxation in conditions and trying to ensure more people are eligible for carer's allowance and benefit and respite care grants.

Were additional staff deployed specifically for this purpose?  What does the Minister mean by fast-tracking cases?  Does the Minister agree that family carers play a critical role at a time when they could be a drain on public resources?  Extra attention must be paid to them to ensure such delays no longer happen.

Upwards of 5,000 people are spread across the Department and they work under substantial pressure on the new schemes, making changes and improvements they are asked to implement on a daily basis.  I cannot say that staff were specifically deployed to carers but the Secretary General deploys staff wherever pressure points arise as he sees fit.By fast-tracked I mean the Department will bring good judgment to bear on claims.  Those that are outstanding for over eight weeks will receive earlier attention, as will those where there is serious illness involved, the medical evidence is clear or documentary procedures can be expedited by intervention by the Department.  All cases are important but we want the most urgent to be dealt with first.I will not rehearse my view on carers; I agree entirely with Deputy Murphy on their social value.  It behoves all of us to make improvements for carers who look after those who require it.

#SeamusBrennan	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-party	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-dob	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-04-25 00:00:00	Prelude	382	The Money Advice and Budgeting Service, MABS, provides assistance to people who are over-indebted and need help and advice in coping with debt problems.  There are 53 independent companies nationwide operating the service.  The credit union movement has been a key partner in MABS since its inception.  Many local voluntary and statutory bodies, such as the Society of St. Vincent de Paul, the community welfare service, citizens information centres, centres for the unemployed and local authorities also work closely with the programme.The issues that give rise to problems of over-indebtedness are highly complex.  The cost and availability of credit for people on low incomes and the barriers they face in accessing mainstream and cheap forms of credit add to the difficulties people on low incomes encounter in managing their finances.I am particularly concerned about the level of interest rates currently being charged by some financial institutions, loan companies and legal moneylenders in cases where people have no alternative source of credit available to them.  My concerns in this regard are borne out by the Financial Regulator's report on the licensed moneylending industry, published last week.  It shows that moneylenders may be charging interest rates of up to 188%.  Most significantly, 71% of people surveyed did not know what interest they were paying on their loans.I have held discussions with a number of interests, including the Irish League of Credit Unions, the Irish Bankers Federation and the Financial Regulator about these issues.  The outcome of these consultations, the latest report of the Financial Regulator, together with the Combat Poverty Agency study, Financial Exclusion in Ireland, and the statistical data now emerging from the new MABSIS information system will make a significant contribution to our knowledge about the problems of debt in Ireland. These provide a solid evidence base on which to develop the strategies that need to be put in place by Government and the providers of payment services such as the banks and credit unions to promote greater financial inclusion in Ireland.Proposals to establish the MABS on a statutory basis will be considered by the Government in the near future.  My intention in this regard is to build on the best features of the MABS model of service to the public, combining a continuation of local voluntary involvement with strong national leadership to ensure a high quality consolidated MABS for the future.  Measures to address concerns about excessive loan charges for people on low incomes are important in this context and the MABS could play an important role in this regard.  Officials of my Department have been working closely with the Financial Regulator and the Department of Finance on the detailed arrangements that might be put in place to achieve this.I also want to take account of best practice in corporate governance for a customer focused service that provides value for money for the taxpayers' investment and meets the challenges posed by the rapidly changing face of debt in 21st century Ireland.
#DavidStanton	unknown-#DavidStanton-party	unknown-#DavidStanton-dob	unknown-#DavidStanton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-04-25 00:00:00	Prelude	383	I thank the Minister for his response.  Is it true that his Department issued a press release on 12 May 2006, the same one on 18 September 2006 and the same again on 23 October 2006 in which the Minister is quoted to the effect that legislation would shortly be introduced to strengthen and streamline the money advice and budgeting service, MABS?  That is almost a year ago and we have had at least three identical press releases from the Minister in different parts of the country saying that he is going to do this, and we have the same today.  What is the reason for the delay?  Why has the legislation not been introduced at this stage?  Has the work been completed?  Has the Minister brought proposals to Government or what has gone wrong?As regards the Minister's meetings with the Irish League of Credit Unions, the Irish Bankers Federation and others, what specific actions may we expect eventually from some Department of Government on this issue?  Does the Minister agree with the statement in the Financial Regulator's report, for instance, that 30% of borrowing is for clothes and household items, and not as he suggested in response to a previous parliamentary question I tabled, for luxury items?  Many people are now being forced to go to licensed and unlicensed moneylenders to borrow money for day-to-day expenses.  I asked the Minister before whether research had been done into why this is happening in an economy which the Government claims to be one of the strongest in the world.  Given that there is enormous inequality in our society, with many people being forced to go to moneylenders, will the Minister not agree something is radically wrong?
#SeamusBrennan	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-party	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-dob	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-04-25 00:00:00	Prelude	384	I have held up the legislation because of the complexity of trying to get around this issue.  The legislation allows moneylenders to charge up to 188%.  The Financial Regulator's report on the licensed moneylending industry, published last week, shows that they charge this amount.  The legislation allows them to charge even higher rates in certain circumstances.  The report shows that 71% of people did not know what interest they were paying.I took the time to get it right and the legislation is now completed and will shortly be considered by Government.  What took the time were discussions with the Irish League of Credit Unions, the Irish Bankers Federation and the Financial Regulator.  It was also necessary to have sight not only of the Financial Regulator's report, but that study in tandem with the Combat Poverty Agency study, Financial Exclusion in Ireland.  I wanted to go through all that data to see what type of solution we could come up with.  Obviously, it is not possible simply to introduce legislation to fix interest rates.  That is a complex and difficult area involving the economy generally across the board, so that is not an easy option.As I hinted in my reply, the model I looked at seeks to bring the expertise of the MABS organisation to bear on the whole area of licensing of moneylenders.  That is the approach I am hoping to adopt in the legislation, giving MABS some input into that process.  Owing to the complexity of the issues, however, it has taken longer than I thought.  I believe the result is a good one.  Whether it is I or someone else who will introduce the legislation, it is now on a very solid footing.  It will make a real difference and will give MABS, which has frontline experience of poverty, direct involvement in interest rates on some basis yet to be determined.On the Deputy's reference to luxury and clothing items, the view I expressed was based on what MABS, the Combat Poverty Agency, the Financial Regulator and the banks tell me, that the nature of credit is changing.  There would not have been credit card debt ten or 15 years ago, but it is now a major feature.  Some credit card debt is for motor cars and other items regarded in some ways as essential, which ten years ago would not have appeared on any list in the same way as would, say, clothing and food items.   All the expertise indicates that the nature of credit is changing as expectations rise.  The line between absolute poverty and lifestyle is becoming more blurred every day.  That is based on all research.  Some goods, which would have been regarded as lifestyle items in the past, are now included as poverty items.  Regardless of this, our job is to try to make an impact on the problem.  The different welfare and economic policies of the Government have made substantial progress on the poverty area in recent years.

The Green Paper will be published when the Government has completed its considerations in this regard.The preparation of the Green Paper follows a period of increased activity in the development of pensions policy, which has seen the publication of two major reports by the Pensions Board, National Pensions Review and Special Savings for Retirement.  These two reports built on the earlier report of the board on the national pensions policy initiative, published in 1998.The Green Paper will take account of these reports and examine the situation in a much broader way to deal with issues raised in the partnership talks, such as the operation of the funding standard for defined benefit schemes, together with a comprehensive look at issues surrounding social welfare pensions that arise from time to time in the House and in representations which I receive.The purpose of the Green Paper is not to recommend any particular course of action but rather to set out clearly the current situation and the implications, from an economic and social perspective, of various courses of action that have been suggested.  The Green Paper will set out the key issues and challenges facing the Irish pensions system, including the demographic challenge, issues in relation to the sustainability of the pensions system, pensioner incomes and the contribution various elements of the pension system can make to their adequacy, work flexibility in older age, the roles and relationships of social welfare and private occupational and public service pensions in the future, the role of tax incentives in the current system and their efficiency and effectiveness in supporting Government objectives in the area, the role of annuities and the operation of that market, and the role of regulation, including the charges levied by pension providersPublication of the Green Paper will be the initial move in a series of measures that will culminate in the Government publishing a framework for long-term pensions policy.

Perhaps he will confirm that in a subsequent answer.  If that is the case, does the Minister envisage early publication of the Green Paper?  Given the Dáil is in its death throes, it may be inadvisable to publish it during a general election campaign.  The Green Paper should be considered by the House in a proper and procedural way.  What are the Government's plans in this regard?

We have not yet completed our full consideration of the document but it is a fine work and will add enormously to the debate on pensions.  It is a matter of judgment as to whether such a document should be published in the current political climate.  I did respond to a request from Deputy Stanton on the publication date for the carers' strategy and subsequently cancelled it at his request.  I am not saying I will do likewise with the Green Paper on pensions but I will give some consideration in the days ahead as to whether it might be wiser not to introduce such a document into a political campaign.I have always maintained the pensions debate is an intergenerational issue that should not be mired in political controversy.  I want a mature discussion on pensions so as to ensure people are entitled to a decent income in their older age.  I am taking these matters into consideration as to whether the document should be published in the near future or left to another time.

It provides insured contributors with both long-term pension benefits and short-term benefits such as unemployment and disability payments.The cumulative surplus in the social insurance fund since 2002 was €1.273 billion in 2002, €1.529 billion in 2003, €1.906 billion in 2004, €2.4 billion in 2005 and, provisionally, €3.070 billion in 2007.  This increasing cumulative surplus in the fund is the continuation of a trend which commenced in 1997 when a surplus arose for the first time since the fund was established in 1953.In the previous 44 years, there was a shortfall between the amount of income received into the fund and the amount of expenditure paid out of it.  This was made up by an Exchequer subvention in each year, as provided for under the Social Welfare Acts.The Acts also provide for the investment of the amount of the surplus arising in the fund.  The investment account of the fund is managed by the National Treasury Management Agency, subject to guidelines issued by the Minister for Finance.  The total amount of interest received on investment since the fund came into surplus in 1997 is €329 million.

With this shortfall, if the surplus stands at €3 billion, it will only take five years for it to disappear.  All parties are committed to increasing the old age pension to €300 per week.  Could the situation emerge that the Exchequer will have to pay between €800 million and €1 billion into the social insurance fund?  Is the Minister concerned that the surplus will dissipate?  Steps were taken to ensure it would not be raided by Governments.  Workers rightfully point out they have paid for their pensions and are entitled to them.  It behoves us all to ensure the moneys in the social insurance fund are protected and that the current trend of using the surplus is continued, so as to provide further increases and widen the scope of payments.Does the Minister know the ratio for workers contributing PRSI to pensioners receiving payments?  That is an important statistic and one upon which all pension policy must be predicated.
#SeamusBrennan	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-party	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-dob	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-04-25 00:00:00	Prelude	392	There are 2.8 million contributors to the social insurance fund.  Expenditure in 2005 was €5.6 billion, a substantial part of which went to pensioners and the income to the fund was €6.1 billion.  Employment is strong and income from employment is growing.  The review before the Government examines it from 2006 to 2061, a long-term financial economic strategic review.  In the short term, the fund is likely to be very sustainable.  However, as demographics change and we head from a 4:1 to a 2:1 worker to pensioner ratio in the next 50 years, the costs of pensions will grow substantially.  That is why the Green Paper will assist in the debate on pensions.For example, there is a commitment to increase the State contributory pension to €300 a week.  That will cost approximately €1.5 billion.  Proposed increases in other social welfare payments will bring the cost to €2 billion in a full year.  The social insurance fund must be maintained in a healthy position.  For 40 years it was in deficit but in the past decade it has been in surplus.  It is the Government's intention that it will remain so.  Any policy decisions which affect the fund's surplus must be made up by the Exchequer.  Undeniably, there will be pressures on the fund in the long term.

I certainly do not envisage that in the short, or medium, term but it is a possibility in the long term given the demographic pressures on the fund.  I wish to reassure the House that any proposals which would affect the fund or put it into deficit must, legally, be made up by the Exchequer for the taxpayer.  Taxpayers have paid this PRSI for a long time.  PRSI is a tax on work which is why we are determined to try to reduce it and give people more take home pay.

He said he is trying to maintain a social insurance fund and yet reduce the inputs to it.  It seems utterly nonsensical.  The Minister will have an opportunity to try to explain that in the coming weeks.  Despite asking for it repeatedly, information on the cumulative deficit in the social insurance fund since its inception to 1997 has never been supplied to this House.  It would be very helpful if that information was supplied.  How many billions of euro did the State have to put into this fund until it went into surplus in 1997?

#WilliamPenrose	unknown-#WilliamPenrose-party	unknown-#WilliamPenrose-dob	unknown-#WilliamPenrose-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-04-25 00:00:00	Prelude	404	This is like trying to square a circle.  If the Minister is trying to maintain the surplus under which the social insurance fund operates, that is a very laudable objective.  However, the proposal is to decrease the amount of money going into the fund by €645 million per year based on current projections.  How can one square that circle while, at the same time, the ratio of PRSI payers to pensioners is falling from 4:1 to 2:1?  Fewer people will contribute to the fund, although more money will go out because we are committed to giving more money to pensioners and to other payments, and rightly so.The Minister said that will cost approximately €2 billion.  An additional €2 billion will go out while €645 million less will go into the fund.  How will we maintain the fund in surplus?  Did the 2002 report on the Minister's desk tell us not to decrease PRSI contributions but to increase them?I agree with the Minister who said PRSI is a tax on work.  However, there is no use deceiving workers because we will tax them in order to make up the shortfall in the social insurance fund.  We had better tell the truth.

If one proposes to reduce PRSI from 4% to 2%, which is a tax on people who pay their taxes and for which they have been paying through the nose for a long time, it will cost money.  That will come from the general pool of taxation.  That is from where any deficit in the fund must be made up.  The taxpayer will pay for a proposal to reduce PRSI from 4% to 2%.  I invite the parties opposite to accept that policy because we are talking about a generation of people paying substantial PRSI who now have the opportunity to see the tax on the work they do reduced and spread more evenly because, obviously, the 2% will apply to people on the higher rate, which has not been mentioned until now.  More people will pay.  As the economy expands, presumably more will come into the fund.  It is time we gave back some of the PRSI to hard pressed wage earners.  That is what the Government unapologetically proposes to put before the people in the coming general election.
#SeamusBrennan	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-party	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-dob	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-04-25 00:00:00	Prelude	408	The Government discussion paper, Proposals for Supporting Lone Parents, put forward proposals for the expanded availability and range of education and training opportunities for lone parents; the extension of the national employment action plan to focus on lone parents; focused provision of child care; improved information services for lone parents; and the introduction of a new social assistance payment for low income families with young children.  The paper also proposed the abolition of the cohabitation rule as a condition for receipt of the proposed social assistance payment.One of the proposals in the report was that the upper income limit for the new social assistance payment should be set at €400 per week.  In budget 2006, I increased the upper income limits on the one parent family payment from €293 to €375 per week.  In budget 2007, I completed this element of the proposal by increasing the upper income limit for the one parent family payment to €400 per week thus meeting the proposals in the Green Paper.In addition, the report recommended increasing the qualified child increase for recipients of the one parent family payment.  In budget 2007, the three rates of qualified child increase, which had been maintained at the same levels for a number of years, were combined into a single rate of €22 per week in respect of over 340,000 children of welfare families.The new social assistance payment, under development in my Department, will have the long-term aim of assisting people to achieve financial independence through supporting them to enter employment — the avenue that is widely agreed to offer the best route out of poverty.Any proposed new payment can only be introduced when the necessary co-ordinated supports and services are put in place by other Departments and agencies.  That is why the Government has instructed the senior officials group on social inclusion to draw up an implementation plan to progress the non-income recommendations in tandem with the development of the legislation required in my Department to introduce a new payment scheme.  Work on the development of this implementation plan is continuing.  Issues, including access to child care support, education, training and activation measures continue to be discussed with the relevant Departments and agencies.To further develop the process, my Department, with the co-operation of FÁS, the office of the Minister of State with responsibility for children and the Department of Education and Science, are to test the proposals in both an urban and rural setting.  These tests will focus on identifying and resolving the practical and administrative issues that may arise in advance of the scheme being introduced.  This will allow for operational and logistical co-ordination between the relevant Departments and agencies to be considered and will facilitate the development of the new scheme as soon as possible.
#WilliamPenrose	unknown-#WilliamPenrose-party	unknown-#WilliamPenrose-dob	unknown-#WilliamPenrose-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-04-25 00:00:00	Prelude	409	I thank the Minister for his reply.  He used to issue a statement on lone parents every month but, in fairness to him, he has followed through on it and we had the Government's discussion paper, Proposals for Supporting Lone Parents, and the Farmleigh discussions.  It is still of concern to many people and to lone parents in particular.  The Minister's inspectors are still very vigilant in checking to see who is cohabiting and there seems to be a focus on this issue.  The quicker the cohabitation rule is established, the better, so that the neutral family situation as advocated by the Minister can be adopted.  The success of this scheme depends on a number of factors, one of which is that there should be a proper forum in which lone parents can meet all the NGOs and groups so that the various issues can be dealt with.  Many poverty traps have been created and the advent of a particular policy initiative in one area may well lead to another unanticipated poverty trap being set up in another area.  It is time to set up a consultative forum for all the relevant interests.  The Farmleigh meeting was a response to the discussion document but interest groups will wish to make submissions.It is important the integration process is firmly embedded otherwise it will fall flat on its face.  It will be necessary for FÁS, the Office of the Minister for Children, the Department of Education and Science and the Minister's Department to work in a properly joined-up way and not just in a haphazard, ad hoc manner, using fire brigade-type action.  These bodies must work in a unified and integrated way to ensure that all the steps are taken for child care.  We all accept that the route out of poverty is by means of work but it must be quality work.  Training and upskilling must be made available by FÁS within family-friendly hours, particularly for lone parents who might be under stress and worried about how to avail of the scheme.  There is a significant amount of work to be done in this area.  When will the programme be introduced on a pilot basis in urban and rural areas?  How will the participants be selected?  The quicker this problem is dealt with, the better.  The Minister deserves some credit for progressing the discussion to date.
#SeamusBrennan	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-party	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-dob	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-04-25 00:00:00	Prelude	410	Some good progress was made when the limit was raised to €400 in the budget and this is in line with the document.  The tests will be carried out in both an urban and a rural setting and they will be conducted by the Department of Social and Family Affairs with the co-operation of FÁS, the Office of the Minister for Children and the Department of Education and Science.  The test will aim to target on a voluntary basis all new recipients of the one-parent family payment and qualified adult in the test area.  The test is to focus on identifying and resolving the practical and administrative issues that may arise in advance of the new scheme being introduced.  These include customer profiling, case management, IT development, data storage, interdepartmental agency linkages and outcome monitoring.  Child care and other similar policy issues must also be taken into account by the group.  Although take-up is likely to be low due to the necessary voluntary nature of the test, it will allow for operational and logistical co-ordination to be considered and developed.The Deputy has expressed to me many times his concern that in any reforms, new poverty traps are not created and the implementation group will consider that carefully.  Lone parents are not a homogeneous group; it includes widows and other people.  Care must be taken not to create another problem when tackling this problem.  The paper has been published and the Government has made it available for discussion.  Some of its issues are controversial such as the activation issues which have yet to be decided.  A five-year transition period is proposed.  We can now move away from the lone parent's allowance to a fairer family-friendly allowance based on children who live in low income families as opposed to the marital or other status of the family.
#DavidStanton	unknown-#DavidStanton-party	unknown-#DavidStanton-dob	unknown-#DavidStanton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-04-25 00:00:00	Prelude	411	Are the pilot tests scheduled to take place in the autumn?  Will these trials in urban and rural settings take months or weeks?  Is it the intention of the Department to withhold publication of the legislation in this area until those tests have been completed?  What is the current state of the legislation?  We were informed a month ago that it was at an advanced stage, which is some kind of code.When is it expected the new payments scheme will be operational?  Has the working group with representatives from the main agencies been established yet?  Which groups will be involved in the working group?  Will extra facilitators be employed to deal with demands from lone parents?  Does the Minister envisage the legislation will cover all aspects of the proposals, including the removal of the cohabitation rule?  Will lone parents be included in the NEAP?
#SeamusBrennan	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-party	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-dob	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-04-25 00:00:00	Prelude	412	The Government has instructed a senior officials group on social inclusion, which has been established, to draw up an implementation plan.  It will consider issues such as child care, education, training and activation measures and will discuss co-operation with various agencies.  One of the key points made by the lone parents' groups was that while they were broadly supportive of these changes they wanted the other parallel issues such as child care and education and training to be brought along in tandem.  I took their point and that is the reason the senior officials group is beginning this work immediately.The tests will commence later in the year and I imagine a couple of months should be sufficient time to run those tests.  I envisage legislation on this matter will come before the House next year.  This will depend on the will of the holder of this office and the Government of the day.  I believe these proposals are sufficiently well founded and have a wide degree of public support so that whoever has the honour to hold this post will drive forward with these proposals.  Additional facilitators will be provided if they are required and they can be redeployed from other parts of the system rather than recruited directly.  We will ensure that the facilitation process is fully supported.  The ending of the cohabitation rule is at the heart of the proposals.  The legislation is in draft form and all the major proposals in the discussion document have been translated into draft sections of a Bill that is awaiting the Government's decision to introduce it and that will only happen following these tests and following the completion of the work of the senior officials.

The Minister proposes to establish pilot projects.  Will he acknowledge the lack of ongoing social policy-making within his Department?  We are asking him to describe the problems and we are making suggestions as to the solutions and tentatively putting toes in the water as to whether those solutions would work.  There should be a better system in place which includes ongoing research because agencies exist that are supposed to engage in such research.  Is there information in the system on lone parent families?
#SeamusBrennan	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-party	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-dob	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-04-25 00:00:00	Prelude	414	One thing I have learned in this Department is that it must have a strong policy content at its core.One of my first statements to the House was to the effect that I did not want the Department of Social and Family Affairs to merely be an administrative Department responsible for paying out funds and acting as a form of social ATM.  I am trying to move it on a daily basis towards a point where policy considerations relating to carers, lone parents, travel, etc., will be at the centre of the decisions we take.  We try to pursue a social agenda which helps people build better lives for themselves.I am of the opinion that the Department must continue to have a strong social policy philosophy and objective at its core.  It must not increase allowances willy-nilly simply because that is the way it has always been done.  The Department must consider the reasoning behind allowances and how they assist people to move to better places.  That is what I have tried to do in respect of pensions, lone parent's allowance, carer's allowance etc.  It is important that we continue to operate in this manner.The Deputy is correct that there are many research facilities available to the Department.  Many very fine Government and voluntary organisations provide research on a timely basis.  Research-based decisions are critically and continually important for a Department which is as vital to the lives of so many people as is the Department of Social and Family Affairs.
#SeamusBrennan	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-party	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-dob	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-04-25 00:00:00	Prelude	415	My Department is committed to providing a quality customer service to all its customers and to ensuring continuous improvements in the standard of service we provide.  As part of this commitment, my Department carries out a variety of customer surveys to establish the level of customer satisfaction and to identify where improvements can be made.Every five years my Department commissions an external company to carry out a national independent survey of customer service satisfaction.  In 2006 the results of the most recent national customer survey, Consulting with our Customers, were  published.  This survey, which was carried out by Millward Brown, IMS, was designed to obtain feedback from customers about a wide range of service issues, including overall service delivery, claim processing, information delivery, communications, office facilities and payment methods.  The survey involved a sample of 1,018 customers, representative of a number of customer groups such as people with disabilities, pensioners, lone parents, people who are unemployed and carers.  The results of this survey were very positive and indicated high levels of satisfaction among our customers — with 88% expressing overall satisfaction with the service provided by my Department — were reported.In addition to the national survey, two customer surveys were carried out during 2006, one in respect of child benefit and the other in relation to the medical review and assessment, MRA, service.  The child benefit survey involved a sample of 960 customers and revealed that 87% of customers were either very satisfied or satisfied with the overall service received, 3% were either dissatisfied or very dissatisfied and 5% had no comment.The Department undertook a major review of the MRA services in 2006.  As part of this review, a survey of people referred for medical examination was conducted.  The survey involved a sample of 660 customers.  The questions were designed to elicit information in respect of customer satisfaction with the medical assessment process and our medical assessors.  In addition, information was obtained regarding the quality of service provided by the MRA section of my Department.  This survey revealed that 83% of customers felt the quality of service provided was good, very good or excellent, with 17% rating it as poor or fair.  In addition, 95% rated the overall service provided by medical assessors as good, very good or excellent.The carrying out of customer surveys is just one of the methods used by my Department to gauge its performance and to identify how a better service can be delivered to our customers.  The principal feedback we receive is from our daily contact with customers.  A formal comment and complaint system, which allows customers to express their satisfaction or dissatisfaction with services, provides us with direct information about customer satisfaction levels.Given the extent of my Department's contact with the public, the scale of its services and the wide range of schemes it operates, the delivery of a good customer service is paramount.  I and my Department strive to continue to enhance our services to meet our customers' needs.  I acknowledge the role of public representatives in providing us with feedback on the service.  Such feedback is extremely important to the Department.

It has been suggested that forms used by the Department in respect of carer's allowance and family income supplement, FIS, are a disincentive because they are so long and detailed.  Has the Department conducted any customer surveys in respect of this matter?  How many local branch officers are there and how many have access to touch screen surveys?  The low uptake of FIS and back to school clothing and footwear allowance has been estimated at 35%.  Has research been carried out, from a customer satisfaction perspective, as to why that is the case?
#SeamusBrennan	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-party	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-dob	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-04-25 00:00:00	Prelude	417	The Department is undergoing a modernisation programme and is examining many of the forms it uses.  The FIS form has been brought to my attention on a number of occasions, as have forms relating to disability benefits and allowances.  Such forms are continually modernised and shortened, where possible.  At the same time, however, we must also ensure that they can still be used to elicit proper information.I do not have any information in my possession as regards access to touch screen surveys but I am sure I can procure it for the Deputy.The feedback we get from our network of offices, the hourly contact we have with thousands of customers throughout the country and the intense relationship we have with public representatives of all hues keep the Department in touch with the need to improve the forms it uses and the information it provides.  The House recently passed the Citizens Information Act, which establishes a new approach to and focus on the provision of information through the Citizens Information Board.  In my view, this will all contribute to a better service to the public.Written Answers follow Adjournment Debate.

#DickRoche	unknown-#DickRoche-party	unknown-#DickRoche-dob	unknown-#DickRoche-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-04-25 00:00:00	Prelude	437	I move amendment No. 1:
In page 12, to delete lines 1 to 10 and substitute the following:"(5) The Fisheries Acts 1959 to 2006, section 111 and this subsection may be cited together as the Fisheries Acts 1959 to 2007, and shall be read together as one.(6) The Planning and Development Acts 2000 to 2006, section 114 and this subsection may be cited together as the Planning and Development Acts 2000 to 2007, and shall be read together as one.(7) The Local Government Acts 1925 to 2006, sections 113 and 115 and this subsection may be cited together as the Local Government Acts 1925 to 2007, and shall be read together as one.”.It is worth reminding ourselves what this Bill is about.  It is a radical Bill which fundamentally changes the form of delivery and control of water services on local authorities and some amendments speak directly to this.  It means local authorities must have a water plan similar to their development plans.  Perhaps it is long overdue but we will deliver it at long last.  The Bill creates additional enforcement powers for the EPA to ensure the water delivered is safe.  The Bill prohibits the privatisation of water services.  It gives councillors the responsibility and right to make a water plan.  It also provides powers to the Minister because the Minister is relatively powerless in law as it stands at present.By any standard, this is legislation which not only brings together comprehensively legislation which first came on the Statute Book when Queen Victoria was a small girl.  More important, it also brings together the entire panoply of local government law on water services.  I am grateful for the considerations given on Committee Stage.  I took a great deal of what was stated on board and one will see from the amendments tabled that I have tried to accommodate anything I considered to be appropriate and improving.The amendments we will discuss are technical amendments to update the wording in a number of collective citations to reflect the change of year from 2006 to 2007.  It involves minor cross-referencing for an error.  Amendment No. 1 updates the wording of the collective citations in sections 1(5), 1(6) and 1(7) to reflect the change in the year.  An additional cross-reference is made in section 1(7) to section 113 to correct a clerical error.  The update would normally be picked up automatically.  However, I will move it by way of amendment.Amendments Nos. 40 to 43, inclusive, are technical drafting amendments to update references to the collective citations in the environment protection Acts, the local government Acts, the local government water pollution Acts and the planning and development Acts as inserted in Schedule 12 of the Local Government Act 2001 by section 115 of this Bill to include the current year.So all of these amendments are technical.

In particular I indicate how important it is for our water supplies not to be privatised.  It is crucial that we retain control of our water supplies and not let them get into the hands of private operators.  The Minister may be aware that water will very quickly become a very scarce commodity, and it will be treated as such by unscrupulous private companies.  The poorer sections of society will especially find they have to pay if it gets into the hands of private operators, which we should stay well away from.With regard to this legislation, it seems we have been waiting since the time of Queen Victoria for it.  This legislation has been languishing——

We have been waiting for quite some time since Committee Stage to deal with these very important amendments.  I ask the simple question of what the Minister has been doing, and why he has been sitting on his hands or simply smiling smugly over here at us.  We have tried to emphasise just how important it is to have clean water for citizens.My colleague Niall Ó Brolcháin in Galway has been the standard bearer who has again and again called on the Minister to act on the water issue.  It is not restricted to Galway and my colleague Brian Meaney in Clare has also indicated that we must do something to tackle the cryptosporidium problem.The problem is all over the country, not just in Galway.  Some 13 years ago I went to Inis Meáin and was told I could not drink the water on the island, so it is not a new problem.  There have been comments that we have only discovered it but the reason we are dealing with this legislation now is because we are coming up to an election, and the Minister must be seen to act.  The Minister has done very little and the people will see through this.I am happy to sit over here and accept amendments and I am happy we are dealing with the Water Services Bill.  Where has the Minister been for the past five years?  It is a bit too late and people will see through this.

I do not want to anticipate the discussion we will have on amendment No. 2, which we have strayed into in a way.Amendment No. 1 in the name of the Minister speaks of co-operation between Departments and also takes cognisance of previous legislation arising from planning and development matters.  It makes a specific reference to the Fisheries Acts.  Responding to Question No. 974 on 24 April 2007, the Minister in a written reply stated:Statutory responsibility for protection and improvement of water quality is assigned primarily to local authorities acting under the general supervision of the EPA.  Lough Corrib lies within the western river basin district as designated under the EU water framework directive and Galway County Council is the co-ordinating local authority for this district.Later in the reply the Minister stated:A framework for co-ordination of water management actions by all relevant public authorities within each river basin district has been established for the implementation of the water framework directive.  All relevant public authorities, including Government Departments, are participating in these arrangements which will lead to the adoption by 2009 of river basin management plans for each district.It is to this I wish to refer.  Leaving the Corrib's management plan or system to 2009 is singularly imprudent.  In 2004 I attended meetings which, to be frank, should have brought public support for what we identified in November 2004.  Earlier in that year there had been a kill in the Owenriff river.In 2004 I spoke in Oughterard, suggesting there were more than four or five sources of pollution.  These included some agricultural practices, as well as insufficient sewerage in Oughterard and Moycullen.  Other sources were tree-felling practices, although not forestry, and these may have been related to the loss of the freshwater pearl mussel in the Owenriff river.  Insufficient care in inspecting septic tanks was also a contributory factor, as was the impossible pollution of the tributary that was the Clare river through the insufficient sealing of a dump in Carrabrown.As a result of this, a timescale for action was constructed in 2005.  The water directives from the European Union have now existed for 15 years, and we have examined the main source of pollution of the Corrib, having identified it in 2005.  The answer I received today suggests action "will lead to the adoption by 2009 of river basin management plans for each district, incorporating environmental objectives and a programme of measures to achieve those objectives".  Note the mention of environmental objectives, not regulations.This is singularly insufficient.  I will summarise my comments on the acknowledgement in amendment No. 1 of the relationship between fisheries, environment and local government.  I could put it bluntly.  If the Minister was serious about the European Union directives, he would come in with a proposal for an authority to deliver on these directives.  The county council is not the appropriate body and local authorities in one part of the country or another have rarely been out of the top four or five polluters themselves.  Frankly, it is not going to work.I am making these comments in trying to constructively address the Galway problem.  The Minister will not solve the Galway problem by beginning at the other end and looking back.  In amendment No. 2 we will speak of the right to clean water.  We can move back from that point through a filtration of what is necessary in the short term.  It is absolutely incredible that we would wait until 2009 for actual plans, not procedures, that would make the Corrib safe.In 1996, Dr. Roderick O'Sullivan was drawing our attention through a comprehensive sampling system of the threat that existed to the Corrib.  We were still discussing it eight years later in 2004 and many people should have been supporting action, be it in regard to agricultural or local authority pollution.  As there were multiple polluters it was possible for them to point fingers at each other.  The meeting in question closed at about half an hour after midnight and now, much later, there has been no progress.I feel very strongly that we really need an authority now.  I would support the Minister if he introduced a regulation to achieve European Union directives on water.  I am speaking personally on this issue as I feel very strongly about it.  We have two significant sections of water: the Shannon is managed in a particular way; and there is also Corrib, Carra and Mask.  If we are to make it safe we must take other measures.In my days as a Minister I was involved in designating a number of special areas of conservation and that may be a route to take.  The issue cannot wait until 2009 because tributaries are already polluted.  Who is inspecting the agricultural practices?  Admittedly, an incentive is given to people to comply.  It is positive that such an incentive was negotiated under the nitrates directive.  Nobody is inspecting septic tanks.  A set of guidelines, rather than regulations, applies to septic tanks.  No attempt at compliance is being made.  The local authorities are not giving the public information about where they are taking samples, what the results of those samples are and to whom the samples are being sent.The tree-felling practices in the forestry industry are also relevant in this regard.  When the House considers the other amendments, Deputies will have an opportunity to speak in more detail about such matters.  Approximately 90% of the European population of the freshwater pearl mussel, for example, has disappeared.  Just 10% of those mussels are left.  Our protection obligations apply not only to ourselves, but also to a much wider community.  For that reason, I ask the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government to go beyond amendment No. 1, which acknowledges the inter-relationship of different agencies and Departments, by accepting in principle that a special authority is needed to ensure that Ireland complies with the EU directives on waste water and drinking water.
#CiaranCuffeGP	unknown-#CiaranCuffeGP-party	unknown-#CiaranCuffeGP-dob	unknown-#CiaranCuffeGP-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-04-25 00:00:00	Prelude	446	I echo the sentiments expressed by my colleague, Deputy Gormley, and Deputy Higgins of the Labour Party.  I share their concern about the condition of Ireland's water supply.  I refer not only to Galway city and county, but also to counties Limerick, Clare and Wicklow.  Water has had to be brought in tankers to certain parts of the latter county, which is the Minister's backyard and is supposed to be the garden of Ireland.It is incredible that the European Commission has seen fit to drag Ireland to the European Court of Justice to ensure it complies with EU directives on safe water supplies.  It is incredible that the Minister, Deputy Roche, who prides himself on being a European, is allowing himself, the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, the Government and, by association, the people of Ireland to be dragged into the courts of Europe to ensure that this country complies with the regulations which have been laid down by the EU.  The Minister needs to send out a clear signal that Ireland will comply with the nitrates directive and ensure that farmers play their part in ensuring that groundwater is not contaminated.  Local authorities should be regulated on an annual basis to ensure they do not pour effluent into estuarine waters, such as Clew Bay, and thereby endanger the livelihoods of those involved in the shellfish industry.We need a Minister who will make forestry regulations to ensure that forests are not planted just 2 m from the shores of Lough Corrib.  The Corrib fishermen and others have recommended that all planting should be 15 m or more from the lake.  We need a Minister who will put protections in place, rather than bowing to every interest group in this sector.  We need a Minister who believes in land use planning, rather than tolerates the laissez-faire “whatever you are having yourself” system that has been operating for years in counties Galway, Limerick and Clare and elsewhere.  We need a Minister who believes in planning, and in the principle of planning, so that our water supply can be protected.  We need a Minister who will rise to the dignity of his office, rather than belittle that office in an unbecoming manner by throwing cheap shots at the Lord Mayor of Galway.  I would have thought that the Minister has a clear understanding of the role of local government.  I refer to matters like designated and reserved functions, for example.  I wish we had a Minister who could deal with such issues.  It was unbecoming of his office for the Minister, Deputy Roche, to take such a cheap shot at the Lord Mayor of Galway.The lack of regulation of septic tanks in this country constitutes a timebomb that is ticking and waiting to explode.  We need to put in place regulations which provide for the inspection of septic tanks.  Such tanks are being installed in the north, south, east and west of this country in the absence of an adequate system of ensuring they do not pollute the groundwater.  In certain areas, such as those with karst landscapes, it is very easy for discharges from septic tanks to go straight down into our rivers and streams.  We need to ensure that a system of regular inspection of septic tanks is put in place.Legislation that updates the guidelines covering the protection and extraction of water is needed.  As the Minister pointed out, some of the statutes being repealed in this legislation date back to the 1860s and 1870s.  It is time for this Bill, which has sat on the Minister's desk for three years, to be passed.  It is hard to explain such a delay, but I suspect it results from a lack of bottle on the part of the Minister.  It is time for this draft legislation to become law.  If nothing else, it will stop livestock from drinking from the water that is about to be extracted for human consumption.  It should be simple to erect barbed wire fences to keep livestock away from reservoirs, or to provide for a system of regulation and testing that belongs to the 21st century, rather than the 19th century.  If the legislation does nothing other than that, it is long overdue.  We need to ensure, in the interests of the hundreds of people in Galway who are ill and the tens of thousands of people throughout this country who are experiencing difficulties in acquiring a water supply, that this legislation becomes law and drags our water supply system into the 21st century as soon as possible.

When the House debated this Bill on Second Stage at the end of 2004, I made the point that while the legislation was unlikely to excite the passions of the House, the media or the public, we would return some day, after something had gone wrong, to consider the issue of water services and the manner in which the passage of this legislation had been dealt with.  Following the recent events in Galway, people are showing an interest in water services and schemes, as well as the development, financing and design of water treatment plants.  There is a widespread interest in who should build such plants and what should be done to treat our water.Anybody with an interest in the water problems in Galway should read the transcript of the Committee Stage debate on this Bill, which took place on 22 November 2006.  Over the course of a day, the Select Committee on Environment and Local Government debated all the issues which are relevant to what has happened in Galway.  I proposed an amendment to establish a legal right to clean and potable water.  Deputy O'Dowd proposed a similar amendment.  The committee discussed amendments addressing the possible privatisation of our water services, which I understood to be the Government's agenda.  I argued at the time that the Government was trying to take responsibility for water services from the local authorities.  Many issues relating to water services and water quality were debated on 22 November last.I would like the Minister to answer a couple of questions in this House.  Why, in 2007, are we still dealing with a Bill that was published in 2003?  Why did the Minister sit on the Bill for over 18 months?  It was passed by this House on Second Stage at the start of 2005, but it was not considered on Committee Stage until November 2006.  Why did the Minister sit on the Bill for a further five months, after the select committee concluded its work on it and reported to this House that it had done so?  Why is it only in the dying days of the Dáil and in the wake of the events in Galway that the Minister brought the Water Services Bill back into the House?  I put it to him that the Government's agenda is to deliver water services by the private sector through a variety of PPP and design, build and operate, DBO, projects rather than by the public authorities.  Word has spread among local authorities throughout the country that there is no point in sending the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government water supply or sewage treatment schemes unless they are designed as PPP or DBO projects.The Minister's comments regarding the Galway water situation are guff because he knows it was not a question of his Department allocating money to the local authority or the latter being expected to submit a scheme.  He is aware that the money allocated by his Department carries the rider — perhaps unspecified, unwritten and unspoken but certainly understood by everyone concerned — that water services are to be developed as PPPs.  The delay on the Galway water treatment plant is directly linked to the delays in passing this Bill, the original intention of which was to provide a legal framework that would facilitate the privatisation of water supply and services in this country.  An explanation is owed to the House as to why legislation which the Government itself claimed was essential in order to give effect to the European Union's water services directives has been delayed and sat upon for so long by the Minister.

I agree with Deputy Gilmore that a protracted period of time has passed between the initiation of the Bill and Report Stage.  Public opinion has significantly changed in the interim and, in view of the issues raised today regarding Galway's water supply, the amendments need to be more fully considered because the health of the people who drink the water must be paramount.In some of the decisions made on water supply and septic tanks around Lough Corrib and in areas of my own county, planning permission has been granted without due consideration of water supply issues or the contamination caused by septic tanks.  A family in my own area complained to me that their neighbour's septic tank was causing contamination and asked what I could do about the matter.  I immediately contacted council officials, who quietly but firmly informed me that a motion under section 140 of the Local Government Act 2001 had been passed by councillors in order to grant planning permission against the wishes of the officials.  The health hazard, therefore, had been politically generated.  The public is now strongly of the opinion that authoritative protections must be introduced for water supplies.  If a local authority takes the view that it is not appropriate to grant permission for a septic tank, even under section 140, because doing so could infringe upon the quality of water, we need to change the law to ensure that permission is not granted in such instances.This issue does not only arise in respect of individual houses.  The Minister will know I am not being political when I say that councillors sometimes have others issues in mind when they make county development plans.  The absolute judge on these matters should be the body, such as the EPA, which has statutory responsibility to advise on matters of health or contamination of water supply.  I have received representations on planning matters in Bray, in the Minister's county, regarding my opinion of construction on flood plains.  A similar problem arose some years ago in Ashbourne, County Meath, where building took place on flood plains.

We need to seriously reconsider these issues.  I acknowledge and respect the independent role of the EPA but it needs a stronger voice in this House.  We should consider the reports it compiles on the contamination of water supplies throughout the country.  When representatives of the agency appear before the Joint Committee on Environment and Local Government, they do not receive the legal consideration they deserve.  A sea change is taking place on these issues and we must ensure we always act in the interest of public health.  When a local authority or the EPA states an opinion, nobody should be in a position to overrule it.That is especially important in the context of waste water issues.  The Minister was given a report in 2004 on the country's waste water treatment plants, many of which were seriously disintegrating, yet the moneys provided by his Department for water and sewerage works have decreased over the past five years.  We should be increasing our spending in those areas.
#ArthurMorganSF	unknown-#ArthurMorganSF-party	unknown-#ArthurMorganSF-dob	unknown-#ArthurMorganSF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-04-25 00:00:00	Prelude	453	We should acknowledge that the provision of clean and healthy drinking water is a core public function of local authorities.  I would go further by stating that access to such a service is a basic human right.  Whether one is a pauper or a millionaire, it is a critically important issue.The Minister knows he made an incorrect statement in his opening comments when he said that one of the purposes of this Bill is to ensure water services cannot be privatised.  I accept that one of the core functions of the Bill is drawing together legislation but its overriding intent is facilitating the privatisation of water services, or at least those parts from which the vultures can make substantial profits.  That is the agenda of certain sections of the Bill and the Minister could accept the amendments, including one of mine, which will put paid to privatisation if he thinks otherwise.What are the consequences of privatisation?  First, people will not have access to what is a core function of local authorities and a basic human right, an assertion regarding which the Minister nodded in agreement.  Instead, they will have to pay for it under the terms of the Bill, once enacted.  The function of providing clean water will be removed from local authorities and given to private developers.  That in turn will lead to redeployment or redundancy for a substantial number of local authority staff, meaning a significant loss of historic or corporate knowledge and individual expertise in the field.The developers will do what they have always done — operate on the cheap.  They will not worry if 50% of the water continues to leak from pipes before reaching the householder.  They will be concerned, like many local authorities hitherto, only that water comes out on the other side and that they collect their money for it.  That is extremely bad for the population of this entire island.  Currently, there are many treatment plants all around the State, some of whose locations have been cited, in urgent need of upgrading and repair.As Deputy Gilmore said, the Department does not want to hear from local authorities about upgrading those plants unless it is on "design, build and operate" lines — a public private partnership, in other words.  That is not the most efficient way of dealing with the matter.  I am sure that the Minister has seen the report by Professor Eoin Reeves of the University of Limerick clearly indicating that it is the most inefficient way of dealing with the issue.  I heard that no report has ever been written in this State on the efficiency or otherwise of PPPs, yet one in existence clearly indicates that, regarding water treatment, they are definitely not the way to proceed and that is most unfortunate.What we have seen in the case of the M50, whereby a great public asset was handed over for a pittance to private developers and is now to be purchased back at astronomical cost to taxpayers in this State, will be repeated under the terms of this Bill when enacted.  A Minister in a future Government will have to negotiate with those developers in an attempt to purchase back the infrastructure to be handed over to them under the terms of this Bill and that is extremely worrying, since it will come at great cost to the taxpayers of this State.  We have the example of the M50 toll bridges, in which regard taxpayers will be needlessly fleeced by developers owing to bad Government policies.  Whatever the political hue of the incoming Government that we will have in a few weeks, I hope that it will address this matter and amend the Bill.  I do not disagree with its entirety, but I am extremely concerned at this element, which could bring catastrophic consequences for many people in the State on low incomes.

#CatherineMurphy	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-party	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-dob	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-04-25 00:00:00	Prelude	455	Regarding how this manifests itself, there are two waste-water treatment plants in my constituency, but one straddles north and south Kildare.  Osberstown is one and the initial paperwork came to the Department in 2002.  I know the Minister has responded to me on this before, but we are now starting to be contacted by people in the construction industry who are saying that they now have no option other than to cease building, since they will not secure planning permission because the land cannot be serviced.  They will get a refusal based on the application being premature, since the service has not been provided.  If the reason was that there would be public private partnerships, it has had an incredible impact on the private sector by virtue of people in the construction industry not being able to build houses or industrial sites.  That is an extremely important factor.It seems that we have a system of crisis management unique to Ireland.  We tend not to believe that something will happen until we see it.  For example, I have seen entire housing estates in such places as Kilcock built because of a shortage of houses and a need to give people a roof over their heads.  Some of those estates are on timers that kick in at 10 p.m. or 11 p.m. to allow people to use water.  This is all rather redolent of the Third World.  I know that a new system is to come on stream within a few weeks in that case, but some of those housing estates now look mature.  They were not built today or yesterday.  They are fully occupied and people have settled in.A mismatch between the provision of services and the occupation of houses creates a problem.  People do not care where the water comes from as long as there is a safe and abundant supply, and the same is true of the reliability of sewage treatment plants.  Members of local authorities see the mismatch regarding the level of house-building and industrial activity and one knows that things are on a knife-edge.  It is only when that happens that people ask how it was allowed to come to pass.  We must do things differently to prevent this situation recurring."Design, build and operate" public private partnerships complicate matters and the future is very uncertain if one cannot guarantee that such a vital service will be provided.  The lack of delivery at Osberstown has certainly proven a disaster for Kildare, since it has slowed everything down.
#DickRoche	unknown-#DickRoche-party	unknown-#DickRoche-dob	unknown-#DickRoche-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-04-25 00:00:00	Prelude	456	I thank Deputies for a very wide-ranging discussion covering such matters as likely outbreaks of cryptosporidium, public private partnerships and DBOs.  We have also discussed the very fundamental point touched on by Deputy Michael Higgins, namely, the appropriate place to allow them.  The last three contributions were particularly interesting, since they go to the very heart of the Bill.  Deputy O'Dowd made a very thoughtful contribution in which he put his finger on the nub of the matter, anticipating points made by Deputies Catherine Murphy and Morgan.  I will deal with them in the order in which they were presented.While I always respect Deputy Michael Higgins's views, I fundamentally disagree with the proposal that we create another quango to deal with water and I will explain why.  Deputies O'Dowd and Catherine Murphy illustrated the fallacy of that route.  I found myself smiling while the latter was speaking, since I entered politics through my involvement with the residents' association in Greystones many years ago, which included a housing estate called Applewood Heights.  A lady who has now moved on from the area was the secretary of the residents' association.  She famously called her house "High and Dry" because she could not run the washing machine until 2 a.m.  This is part of the debate that went on in the background to this Bill.  I was asked why there was a delay.  The reason I would respectfully disagree with Deputy Michael D. Higgins is that it is critically important that physical planning and development and the development and manning of the strategic planning for water are married.  They are absolutely inextricable.  Deputy Catherine Murphy is correct; it is wrong and there has been a mismatch.  Unless one creates a solid legislative base and identifies the appropriate locations, I do not think one will get that.With all due respect, I do not think establishing a quango, a national body similar to the HSE would either improve public accountability or improve the delivery of water services.  I have put much thought into this matter.  It is absolutely appropriate that the planning authorities which are responsible for drawing up the development plans should also have the power, duty and responsibility for drawing up the water plans for their areas.  One should be a reflection of the other.  To disconnect that would be fraught with difficulties.  I understand all the benefits that would come from having a single body but they would be better if they were to come from having an oversight body.  I make this point because it was dealt with in the contributions.  The purpose of the legislation is to take all of the legislation, as Deputy Gilmore said, that dates back to the 19th century and to consolidate it, to give it a coherence and focus and to give a particular locus for responsibilities we do not have currently.Like a butterfly, Deputy Cuffe floated into the House, made his contribution and then flitted back out.  He made some references to the situation in Galway.  I will deal with those because I wish to respond to each point that was made.  I do not wish to get into a discussion about Galway in particular.  The situation in Galway County Council and other local authorities well illustrates one of the difficulties we have in regard to water.  The local councillors who are democratically elected to represent the people do not feel involved in this process.  That is why in this legislation it is becoming a reserved function of the elected councillors.  It is proposed that councillors will make the strategic water plan, in the same way as they make the strategic development plan — the physical plan.  It is clear where the nexus comes together and where the responsibility lies at local level.  It is right in a democracy that we should focus responsibility in an area where the public can pass its judgment.  I say to Deputy Michael D. Higgins that it would be wrong to disconnect water provision from the system and to put responsibility for it into a quango.  I respectfully differ from him on that point.  We will just have to agree to differ.An interesting point was made by Deputy Michael D. Higgins.  He referred to afforestation and related matters.  It is worth pointing out that there is a continuing moratorium on all tree felling in the pearl mussel areas.

Higgins as he raised the important point about the pearl mussel.  It is not simply an airy-fairy or touchy-feely issue, it is a matter of some significance because the pearl mussel, in addition to being a species which we should protect, and biodiversity would demand we do that, is also important as an indicator of water purity.  That was the point made by the Deputy.

#DickRoche	unknown-#DickRoche-party	unknown-#DickRoche-dob	unknown-#DickRoche-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-04-25 00:00:00	Prelude	460	That is correct.  I agree with the point the Deputy made.  When I met the anglers in Galway, including the "gentleman" to whom Deputy Michael D. Higgins referred in derogatory terms recently on television, and not entirely truthfully either, they made some interesting points.  One issue related to the point dealt with by the Deputy; the haphazard tree-felling system.  There is  currently a moratorium on tree felling in the pearl mussel areas.  It is appropriate that proper guidelines be put in place to deal with that issue.  I agree with Deputy Michael D. Higgins.  A forest management plan for pearl mussel areas is being prepared by the Department of Agriculture and Food, which has responsibility in this area, with the support of my Department.  In the context of Galway and the other issues we discussed this may not appear an important point but I agree with the Deputy that it is important.To return to the main point which was made by Deputy O'Dowd, it is very important that we locate responsibility for strategic planning for water in the same place as we locate responsibility for drawing up development plans.  Deputy O'Dowd is absolutely correct.  He has hit the nail on the head.  This is reflected in the point made by Deputy Catherine Murphy.Deputies Morgan, Gilmore and Michael D. Higgins — forgive me if I am wrong — referred to privatisation.  I do not understand how any clear reading of the Bill could suggest this is a charter for privatisation.  I said on Second and Committee Stages that I would examine the matter.  I accept we were anticipating another amendment.  This point has been made several times in the contributions.  Amendment No. 17 specifically addresses the issue.  It puts the ownership of public water outside the remit of privatisation.  Deputy Morgan and I would agree that one of the extraordinary things that happened a few years ago on an island not a million miles away was that privatisation of water resulted in a disaster.  It cannot happen here and it will not happen if we enact this Bill, especially amendment No. 17.Deputy Morgan also asked a question that was touched on by Deputy Gilmore about whether charging could be reintroduced.  If one recalls, we discussed this issue on Second Stage and on Committee Stage I introduced an amendment in this regard.  Section 105 specifically prohibits charging.  That section reflects the prohibition on charging which is contained in the Local Government (Financial Provisions) Act 1997.  It is worthwhile making that point because it anticipates a point that will be made when we discuss future amendments.As is his wont, Deputy Cuffe strayed fairly dramatically from the general area of reference in the Bill.  He referred at some length to Galway.  He said the people of Galway are looking for action.  I agree with him on that.  I also agree there have been some contretemps between the mayor and me.  It is my view that the mayor has looked after Galway in a way that is extraordinarily desultory but he is not here to defend himself so I will not engage in a discussion on that issue.  The mayor, the chairman of the county council, the manager of the county council, the manager of the city council and I met on 30 March and we specifically agreed a number of measures for Galway — to identify the source or sources of the infection; to supply water from Tuam to augment the city’s supply; to switch the water from Tuam by June; to phase out the old treatment plant in June; in the medium term to install a packaging plant at Terryland with a capacity to handle 18 million litres of water per day; in the long term to fast-track the advancement of the new water treatment plant for Galway city; and, also to provide augmentation of the treatment plant in Tuam.  All of that is happening.As the Deputy will be aware, the county council is in the process of transferring water from Tuam, where there is a clean water supply, to Galway.  I understand this will take a number of weeks for technical reasons to do with sludge build-up.  It is anticipated that the county council will be pumping that water by 8 May and that the process of transfer will be completed by June, with the Terryland plant being completed by June.Deputies Catherine Murphy and Gilmore referred specifically to the plight of families in Galway who are without water.  I can well understand their frustration.  It is an extraordinary situation.  I have indicated to Galway City Council that I will make resources available to it.  In the past week and a half, I made additional resources available to it to help it to fund the delivery of water.  I have, on three separate occasions, offered the use of water tankers.  It is an issue for decision by the local council and it decided, for its own good reasons, not to accept my offer.Deputy Cuffe has continually and very unfairly made efforts to blame the farming community for all the problems with water supply.  The nitrates directive was negotiated over 15 long years and implemented last year and some credit is due to the farmers and particularly its leadership in this regard.  It was a very difficult bullet for them to bite, but bite it they did, and there is now an improvement in that there are very strict controls on spreading.  It is unfair for Deputy Cuffe to single out the farming community continually because it has done its bit.The issues of spreading human sludge and delays in the implementation of schemes have arisen recently.  Deputy Cuffe has an extraordinary brass neck to stand up in this House and refer to the problems in my constituency.  The problem with the Arklow sewage plant was caused by a group of people who decided to take the matter to court.  It has been tied up in court for an interminable period and the only political party that supported the group in bringing the matter to its current impasse was the Green Party.  It is astonishing that the Green Party, as opposed to all the other parties and independent members at the local council, opposed the putting in place of a sewage treatment scheme that the people of Arklow desperately need.  It is incredible that Green Party Members stood up in this House and made such an accusation.  It is an extraordinary, duplicitous stand.Had Deputy Cuffe bothered to remain in the Chamber, I could have reminded him of the rather opportunistic opposition and difficulties faced by Deputy Michael Higgins when he spoke in Galway about common sense in the placement of housing and planning policy.  I agreed with Deputy Michael Higgins's comments and we have captured our views in this Bill.  I could also have pointed out to Deputy Cuffe, had he bothered his barney to stay here, that there was some rather opportunistic opposition from across the political spectrum to the project on Mutton Island, which opposition made progress somewhat difficult.  An extraordinary set of circumstances arose when there was a vote to create the big facility in Cork and the motion was carried by only one vote.  Councillors of some of the major parties had to stand up and make the decision, as they always do, and they made the right one, as has been vindicated.Amendments Nos. 1 and 40 to 43, inclusive, are technical.

The Minister said part of the short-term solution to the water problem in Galway involves a proposal to transfer water from the Luimnagh scheme at Corrandulla to Galway.  I have no problem with the policy in this regard in the short term but I would like to draw the Minister's attention to the mid-Galway group scheme, in which 3,000 houses participate and which is one of the largest schemes of its kind.  For the first time in many years, Galway County Council, bearing in mind planning considerations, had to deny a certificate confirming that water would be obtainable by people who wish to build their own houses.  This first happened on 1 January.When the Luimnagh plant was built — one would want to be local to understand this matter — I was a member of Galway County Council and noted the plant was one of the best projects the council ever completed.  We call it the "water factory" locally and that is exactly what it is.  It was built specifically to ensure the regional water schemes in north and mid-Galway would have a water supply over the years but not half this area has been connected to the source in Luimnagh.  The irony is that some years ago the then county manager allowed the pipeline to extend from Luimnagh to the outskirts of Galway city, that is, to Claregalway, for the very good reason that the draw-down of water at the time was insufficient.

#MichaelDHiggins	unknown-#MichaelDHiggins-party	unknown-#MichaelDHiggins-dob	unknown-#MichaelDHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-04-25 00:00:00	Prelude	487	I will remain strictly within my two minutes.  I want to deal with one point raised by the Minister in his reply, which concerns why there should be a separate body to manage water quality.  The overview in the explanatory memorandum to the Bill states:The Bill concerns itself only with the actual provision of water services.  It does not seek directly to take on board wider environmental issues surrounding water resources (pollution control; water quality in its broadest sense; river basin management, etc.), although it complements the relevant legislative codes in this regard.Far from advocating the division of physical planning from general planning in regard to water quality, I was really arguing that physical planning should be disciplined by making planners responsible to an authority that would implement the EU directives.  This Bill leaves everything exactly as it is regarding responsibilities and that is a defect.  I pointed out that proposals for the management of the Corrib will not be in place until 2009.  I suggested that was too late.Disastrous results will flow from the fact that local authorities, in which the Minister has total and exclusive faith, do not have capacity in terms of environmental microbiology to deliver the safety we require.  Neither is it the practice of local authorities to allocate exclusively people with competence in water quality to the monitoring.  These are serious defects.In respect of the reference made by Deputy Gilmore and I to design build operate, we refer to page 21 of Professor Reeves's article, in which he refers to a monoculture of design, build and operate, the ethos of the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government at present.  He advocates that one should consider all procurement strategies in terms of reasonable value.
#CatherineMurphy	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-party	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-dob	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-04-25 00:00:00	Prelude	488	I agree with the Minister in respect of the relationship between physical planning and the supply of essential services such as water and waste water.  I will use my constituency as an example because I am familiar with it.  A major debate took place before the 2002 county development plan was adopted.  It was an uneasy debate and resulted in a broad strategy with the intervention of a previous Minister into the process.  A strategy on how development should take place was drawn up.  Each sub-county plan fitted into the strategy.  These were predicated on sufficient water and waste water services but it was not in the gift of the local authority to provide this.  It was for central funding to fund the major element of such services.  Spills occurred in the River Liffey as a result of not upgrading the waste water treatment plant at Sallins.  These were identified by residents in the area.  Some remediation work has taken place as the first part of the upgrade.I remember asking the council engineer about the contents of the river and he responded that there was "some enrichment".  I had to press him to understand this.  It did not sound that I would want this in the water.  I discovered that it referred to raw sewage.  I certainly did not think this was desirable if it was upstream of the water treatment plant.Responsibility to connect physical planning with the ability to provide water and waste water may lie with the local authority.  However, the Minister has responsibility to provide funding to allow this to happen.  This is where the scheme has fallen down in Kildare.  It is a fault at national level rather than at local level that there is insufficient funding to carry out the upgrade of the wastewater treatment plant at Osberstown and Leixlip in a timely way.  The local authority approached the Department in 2002 and although the Leixlip upgrade has been sanctioned it will be two or three years until the Osberstown plant is up and running.  That timeline has caused a serious problem.
#DickRoche	unknown-#DickRoche-party	unknown-#DickRoche-dob	unknown-#DickRoche-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-04-25 00:00:00	Prelude	489	I am aware of the concerns of Deputy Connaughton.  I have provided €27.4 million specifically to Galway County Council to provide for upgrading and further capacity.  Luimnagh produces good water and this funding will provide conservation measures and storage capacity as well as additional treatment.  There is a problem at Luimnagh and Tuam, as Deputy Connaughton is aware, because 70% of the water at Tuam is lost through cracked pipes.  I sanctioned the local authorities to address this on 30 March.  This matter prevents the water going to where one would wish.I referred to 2009, which is the end date mentioned in the directive.  It is not necessarily the only date.  The other point made by a number of contributors considered whether the Department is besotted by PPPs.  This is possibly not the place to debate that.  The water service investment programme for 2005-07 contains 899 schemes, with a value of €5.1 billion.  Some 16 schemes currently under way are PPPs.  It is not correct to state there is a preponderance of PPPs.Deputy Higgins referred to independent oversight in addition to where water plans are made.  This year I made additional regulations granting more power to the EPA.  It has the power to monitor and report.  It has carried out some excellent reports on the monitoring systems but did not have power to enforce.  I granted the EPA additional enforcement powers by regulation in early March, before the Galway outbreak.  This enforcement power and oversight function exists through the EPA.  This is the independent supervision to which Deputy Higgins refers.Deputy Murphy referred to the relationship between local authorities and central Government.  More power should be given to local authorities and local authority power should reside in council members.  They have a responsibility to draw up a development plan.  I agree with Deputy O'Dowd that extraneous issues sometimes creep into it.Deputy O'Dowd referred to flooding, one of the issues in Galway.  The area had an extremely high water table, as Deputies Connaughton and Higgins are aware.  The latter referred to his contribution on a debate on this matter years ago.  A high water table pulls in material from septic tanks and the land.  His point about flood plains is correct but there have been positive developments in this respect in recent years.  I indicated I would strike down part of the Monaghan plan because it was imprudently involved in development near flood plains in the Ballybay area along the lines indicated by the Deputy.  That is not right.  An Bord Pleanála takes flood plain issues into account to a greater extent than in the past, including the case in Kildare to which a Deputy referred.

#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-04-25 00:00:00	Prelude	491	I move amendment No. 2:
In page 14, between lines 4 and 5, to insert the following:""fundamental right of the individual to access to sufficient, safe, acceptable and accessible water" includes the right to access to water which is free from contamination that is likely to cause injury to human health;".This goes to the heart of the problem that arose in Galway, the absence of a legal right to water from this legislation and Irish law.  This Bill should include the fundamental right of the individual to access to sufficient, safe, acceptable and accessible water for personal and domestic use, having due regard to international legal standards, and subject to any necessary conditions or limitations that may be prescribed by law.  Where a local authority is making a strategic water plan, among the matters that the authority must consider is the right of each person within the functional area of the authority to have access to water services.  The amendment defines the fundamental right of the individual as including the right to access to water which is free from contamination that is likely to cause injury to human health.  I moved those amendments on Committee Stage on 22 November 2006.  On that occasion the Minister dismissed them, saying I was trying to make provision for "an eccentric millionaire who might buy John Lennon's island in Clew Bay and decide to build a palatial premises there" and that the State could not be expected to guarantee a right of water in such circumstances.  I pointed out to him that was not the circumstance I envisaged and that although this country has plenty of water, too much of it at times, there is no right to water in our law.As a consequence, one ends up in situations, as I said on Committee Stage, where if the quality of water supplied through a public system to households is deficient, if the pressure of water supplied through a public system to households is insufficient or if one wakes up one morning with no water supply until lunch time, there is no legal right of redress against the public authority.  I went on to argue that under Irish law, the polluters of our water system have more legal rights and protection than the consumers of the water supplied through the public system.  That must be addressed.We have before the House legislation that deals with the provision of water and delivery of water services.  This is a fundamental issue, that the people of this country are entitled to a water supply and good quality water, and that right should be enshrined in law.  The unfortunate people of Galway have no redress.  They cannot sue anyone.  For two months their public authority and the State has been delivering water to their homes that could poison them and that has made 200 people in Galway seriously ill.  That is wrong, and it wrong that those who cannot drink the water from the public supply have no legal redress.I say this because the Bill places obligations on householders and the owners of premises regarding their management of the water supply.  Under this legislation, a householder who is wasting water can be prosecuted.  A garda can walk into a private home under this legislation to see if a person is wasting water by running a hose in the back garden on a hot summer's day and can take that person to court.  That householder can be liable for a major fine and the cost of the recovery of the water.  In some sections of the Bill there is provision for fines of up to €15 million.  It is not unreasonable that the law should prevent the abuse of water when there is a water shortage but if we are putting in place legislation that imposes on the individual householder a legal responsibility for the management and conservation of water which is punishable by large fines and forms of restitution to the public purse, it is then essential that there is a corresponding right provided to the public to a reliable, safe water supply.If we had that legal right, the lethargy and neglect between the Minister, his Department and the local authority in Galway for the past five years would not have happened because, if there was a legal obligation imposed on the local authority and, by extension, the State through the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, we would not have a situation where people are suffering while the Minister and the mayor of Galway city engage in a blame exercise.  The people of Galway cannot consume the water and we know from studies carried out by the media and the Environmental Protection Agency that up to 20% of the public water supply is as vulnerable as the water in Galway.  This problem may be repeated.We must provide a legal right to water in this legislation.  When we concluded the debate on the issue addressed in the three amendments I am now proposing, the Minister gave a general indication that we had made a good case.  He understood that we were not just talking about the billionaire who might buy John Lennon's island.

He has now had five months to reflect on this and I am disappointed there is no Government amendment on the list that would acknowledge the right of the public to a safe and reliable water supply.  This is a fundamental issue and it is not new.  The Labour Party proposed it on Committee Stage, as I had indicated it would on Second Stage in 2004.  It is, however, given a new urgency by events in Galway in the past two months.
#PaulConnaughton	unknown-#PaulConnaughton-party	unknown-#PaulConnaughton-dob	unknown-#PaulConnaughton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-04-25 00:00:00	Prelude	494	I find it difficult to disagree with the sentiments Deputy Gilmore expressed.  I have spent a lifetime involved in group water schemes and I am a trustee of one such scheme.  As the Minister knows, those small schemes brought water to rural Ireland and there has been little thanks given to those who spent a lot of time on the issue.At least it could be argued that we were legally responsible for the water flowing through the pipes.  At the corporate end, however, it is difficult to find anyone who will take responsibility for anything that might go wrong.  The water supply could be off for two days and people might be told why but they will not have any redress.As for the supply of proper drinking water, there are so many aspects to it now, particularly as a result of Galway, that people are beginning to ask how safe is their source.  The Minister must find it difficult to guarantee that treated water is fit for human consumption.  I do not accept that after what has happened in Galway.The catch-all method to ensure water was potable was to give it a dose of chlorine.  The chlorine solution was to solve everything.  That will not work as we know and is just not on.  Is it not reasonable to assume that somebody should ensure that the quality of every gallon of water produced by local authorities on behalf of the State for people in their private houses is perfect all the time?  That is not happening.  If Galway has achieved nothing else, it has raised that spectre right across the country.  Somebody should be accountable in matters such as this when something goes grievously wrong.  As far as I am aware, nobody is accountable, and I am long enough dealing with this area.When the Minister went to Galway he blamed the Mayor of Galway, quite wrongly in my view.  Ultimately, it is important from the viewpoint of the local authority and the State to ensure that every drop of water going into houses is guaranteed and that in the event the end users or consumers can have recourse to damages if they have been blatantly blackguarded.  In other words, if the quality is wrong, they do not get it on time or the source does not function, for whatever reason, they should have redress.  We send a great deal of money from this country and missionaries through Government agencies and NGOs all over the world to ensure people have drinking water, yet in many parts of our own country we do not have it.I have always accepted, as Deputy Gilmore said, that there must always be counterbalance and people should not waste water.  Even from the farming community's viewpoint it has been acknowledged that there must be metering of water.  There is no question that we must avoid waste and that water, as such, must be metered.  The big problem is that the system of measurement is very unfair to farming, particularly where there are fragmented holdings.  Commercial users avail of a metering system and that is the right way to do it.  In my case, in the event, I will have seven fragmented parts of my holding which will require seven different meters.  That is very unfair.  In the Galway context it is €88 for the first meter and €35 thereafter.  The Minister introduced an overall limit of 180% above the cost of the first meter, but that is of no use to me as I would not even reach that.  Instead of paying €75 a year for my usual source I will be charged about €700 or €800.  That is the type of increase in water charges we are talking about.Against a background that will require us certainly to conserve water — we all accept there will have to meters — the way the Minister is treating the farming community is extraordinarily unfair.
#MichaelDHiggins	unknown-#MichaelDHiggins-party	unknown-#MichaelDHiggins-dob	unknown-#MichaelDHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-04-25 00:00:00	Prelude	495	This is an absolutely crucial amendment.  It establishes a fundamental point, namely, where we stand as regards the right to clean water.  I urge the Minister to accept it, because this will enable him to respond beyond the time of the drafting of this Bill, originally, to both current and other issues.On page 1 of the explanatory memorandum it is stated:The Bill concerns itself only with the actual provision of water services.  It does not seek directly to take on board wider environmental issues surrounding water resources (pollution control; water quality in its broadest sense; river basin management, etc.)...This is a great pity.  It is also a great pity that we will have no more than plans in 2009, not regulations.  It continues, "although it complements the relevant legislative codes in this regard".  There are not relevant codes in many of the areas.  It continues:To appreciate the overall thrust of the Bill therefore, it is helpful to visualise its application as pertaining to management of "water in the pipe", i.e., from the time, following abstraction, that it first enters a supply pipe to the point of its subsequent discharge again to the environment as treated waste water.That is necessary, but it is far too narrow and certainly does not address the circumstances in which we find ourselves in any sense, locally, nationally or internationally.The right to water is being debated abroad at present.  It is being debated here.  Fortune magazine has referred to water as the oil of the 21st century.  It is likely to be the source of wars and conflicts into the future, although I hope not.  However, internationally, in areas that have been conflict zones in the Middle East, the path of the Euphrates and all of the other rivers have been matters of tension.  Much more than that, the UNDP in its report last year, which took water as its main theme, opened up a debate which it left without conclusion.  For example, it discussed the right of the person to water both for life and health.  That raises other issues which I will not stray into here, as to whether this right is universal, is included in the right to development and whatever.There were interesting differences, however, even in the UNDP report.  It did not have the same figure for what is necessary for human life as the WHO.  However, there was a fundamental issue in the debate the UNDP introduced.  Agreement can be had across the board, and internationally too, that water is a scarce resource.  More than 30 countries already are in difficulty as regards the provision of water, droughts are threatening and climate change makes matters worse.  However, the issue concerns water as a scarce resource to be managed.  Where everyone is divides — a clear division emerges everywhere — is on how to address the issue.  One theory is to first switch off the water and then switch it on with regulation, in other words to treat it as a scarce resource that is commodified.  This is the practice that prevails in the leading French company, for example, which limits water in South Africa and at the same time to black residents of Los Angeles, regarding water as the oil of the 21st century, as Fortune said.Standing against that are communities in India which are in competition with Coca-Cola and other companies as regards the volume of water required in the villages and so forth.  They suggest that water is needed as a matter of personal survival, for life and so on.  There is a discussion, which I will not go into, about the right to water for life.  This amendment addresses the second approach.  I believe strongly in the right to clean water as a fundamental legal principle.  In the discussion it is interesting that the UNDP report, to its credit, spoke about the need for regular and accessible water.  However, the right to water goes beyond the right of access.  It is not a right of access through the market, but a fundamental right.  We are either in favour of establishing the legal right of a person to water for life as fundamental or we move away from that.I have addressed two issues.  The first concerns the dangerous vacuum that is being created by the narrow structure of the Bill, not least in relation to environmental issues. Environmental microbiologists who will give reassurances on the quality of the water supply are not in place.  Those appointed to water management in local authorities do not necessarily have expertise in water quality, usually having been moved from various sections of local authorities.  The Minister and I agree to fundamentally differ as to whether a local authority is the appropriate body to implement the EU water directives.The other vacuum relates to confining one's concern to the water in the pipe.  What is unfortunate and pathetic about the situation in Galway is that everyone has moved into a defensive mode.  The city council claims it was restrained by EU procurement guidelines which is a nonsense.  The 2004 directive on procurement states:Nothing in the directive should prevent the imposition or enforcement of measures necessary to protect: public policy, public morality, public security, health, human and animal life or the preservation of plant life, in particular in the view to sustainable development provided that these measures are in conformity with the Treaty.There is nothing in EU law that delayed anyone's response to the Galway situation.  It is claimed by the Government that funds were put in place as early as 2002 to ensure the quality of the water supply in Galway but the Department received no proposals from the council.  Why did this not emerge when evaluating the bonuses for managers, assistant managers and directors of services?Dr. Eoin Reeves of the University of Limerick, who has conducted a study on PPPs, argues that a prevailing single model is canvassed in the Department.  Is this what is causing the delays?  There are two sets of guidelines on the operation of design, build and operate, DBO, and PPPs from the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government and the Department of Finance.  Dr. Reeves suggests — and this is not a left wing suggestion — that all procurement models must be examined on a rational basis.  He points to failures in Halifax in Canada and successes in the US.  In his paper, " Public Private Partnerships in the Water and Wastewater Sector: An Economic Analysis", from September 2006, he states:It is a matter of concern that the DOEHLG [Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government] in Ireland is implementing the water services investment programme on the basis that DBO is the preferred model of procurement.  This approach is at odds with the rational model for public procurement outlined above.  By failing to consider different procurement models there is a danger of creating a monoculture of procurement based on PPP.  The UK experience highlights the dangers associated with such an approach.  For example, the IPPR in 2001 presents evidence from the health sector where a significant number of projects proceeded despite a lack of convincing value for money gains.  This was attributed to the belief on the part of public sector managers that PFI was "the only game in town".We are suffering from this in every Department from Transport to Education and Science, for which we are paying a heavy price.Amendment No. 2 states it should be the "...fundamental right of the individual to access to sufficient, safe, acceptable and accessible water includes the right to access to water which is free from contamination that is likely to cause injury to human health".  The narrow structure of the Bill, which is singularly insufficient as to be pathetic, only deals with management of water in the pipe.  Management of water in the pipe can include from the moment of extraction to wastewater.  The Minister is an enthusiast of local authority management.  May I ask him about the continued development in Doughiska, County Galway, where I am not aware of a wastewater management system being put in in advance?Is it not relevant to question the management of the supply source for Galway?  I accept the Minister's comments about giving additional powers to the EPA.  However, the EPA's director wrote to me in 2005, acknowledging pollution problems in Lough Corrib.  It is scandalous that the pollution was allowed to continue since then.  This is why I have no faith in the local authority's management of the water supply of the Corrib.A great deal of time has been wasted in discussing the use of an ultraviolet method of screening.  It is claimed that it is not suitable for water coming through peaty soil because it is tinted and the water supply must be slow-running.  It is extraordinary how every party involved in the Galway situation went into defensive mode.  Why was there not a public forum on the science of water pollution?  It could have been used to discuss choosing a screening model and the various treatments such as electromagnetic and slow sand processes.  Instead, the director of services is only available for consultation with the local authority members.  How satisfactory is that?  I am hoping sometime in my life there will be a genuine discourse and consultation where citizens will be shown not what has been decided but all the information that will make up the decision-making process.No one is interested in crucifying anyone for a mistake but we are entitled to the results, the response, the scientific and policy options available.  None of this happened which only infuriates people who are correctly concerned as to effects on their health.  This problem must be managed but it cannot be if we damage the tourism industry and the economy.  It is not served by people imagining that what must be done is a run of press releases to keep their defence going.  Going into defensive mode, be it the Department or city council, is singularly insufficient.  I strongly suggest this amendment is fundamental to the legislation.  If one accepts the amendment, one will be putting in place a building block in regard to rights upon which one can move forward.  However, if one does not accept it, one is putting one's stamp on a narrow version which only addresses a very limited part, welcome though it is.When speaking about what is happening around the country, why should we confine ourselves to water in the pipes when what we want is a genuine water services structure that will be able to take the quality of water into account, properly monitor the environmental issues and, most importantly, accept for the citizens the right to water as being a fundamental one.  By doing so, we will give an indication of where we are in the general development debate about water, namely, that we do not see it as a commodity or the gold of the 21st century, as it was described in  Fortune magazine, but something that is essential for life itself.  The legislation should follow that path rather than the narrow one.
#ArthurMorganSF	unknown-#ArthurMorganSF-party	unknown-#ArthurMorganSF-dob	unknown-#ArthurMorganSF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-04-25 00:00:00	Prelude	496	I support the three amendments tabled by Deputy Gilmore and look forward to hearing the Minister's reply.  I suspect one of the reasons the Minister will not accept the amendments, although he may do so and it would strengthen the Bill, is that he is concerned about the consequences of doing so because, for example, the infrastructure is simply not in place to meet the requirements of any of them.I will give a brief example.  In the village from which I come, Omeath, County Louth, from June to September, approximately one third of homes in that village will not receive a water supply after about 2 p.m. or during peak times due to poor water pressure.  The infrastructure is not in place.  The local authority is making some effort to try to resolve the matter.  If these amendments were accepted, I suspect the Minister would be concerned that the State would be opened up to all types of litigation etc.  Perhaps that is the only excuse.  This Government has had the wealth to put infrastructure in place — unfortunately, previous Governments did little as well, but this one is more culpable because it had the resources to deal with many of these cases.Development is not permitted in the village because the sewage treatment capacity does not exist.  At present there is a holding tank and twice a day as the tide goes out, the sewage is discharged into the waters of Carlingford Lough totally untreated.  That is one step short of villagers going back three or four centuries when there was no tank and they peed directly into the lough.Given the EU shell fish directive, we are leaving ourselves wide open to substantial fines.  I am so frustrated lobbying to try to get the local authority to do something about the water and, in particular, the sewage treatment capacity that I am at the point of making a complaint to the European Commission about it.  I have not done so as yet because I do not want us to incur the wrath or, in particular, bring on the fines of the European Commission.  However, given the lack of movement, I am within weeks of doing so and I have already begun to prepare my complaint to the European Commission in this regard.  This will probably be replicated in other areas.  The State will incur the cost anyway so it would be much more efficient to deal with the issues and put infrastructure in place rather than plough money into paying EU fines.
#PaudgeConnolly	unknown-#PaudgeConnolly-party	unknown-#PaudgeConnolly-dob	unknown-#PaudgeConnolly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-04-25 00:00:00	Prelude	497	I too support the three amendments, in particular, that the fundamental right of the individual to access to sufficient, safe, acceptable and accessible water includes the right to access to water which is free from contamination that is likely to cause injury to human health.I will give an example from my constituency of Cavan-Monaghan where this has become a major problem recently.  There has been a problem with a number of our group water schemes for which people have taken responsibility and put in place at great expense.  The schemes to which I refer are the Dernakesh, Crosserlough and Kill in County Cavan and the group water scheme in my area, Glasslough-Teeholland.  The problem was a foul smell which was chemical-like.I have a number of concerns, including how these matters are reported.  Had the users of the schemes not complained for at least three weeks from mid-March, nothing would have happened.  When one adds chemicals to water, there is no doubt there is an impact on health.  I am very concerned that nobody liaised with the users of any of these group water schemes to inform them as to whether there would be knock-on effects in regard to health.  Sometimes when bad water comes through a system, the advice on radio is to boil the water.  That is fine if the water supply has been contaminated by bacteria.  In this instance, however, the problem related to chemicals and the boiling of water would have absolutely no effect.  The chemicals would remain in the water regardless of how many times one boiled it.This problem could affect a number of the food producing industries.  One must bear in mind that there are many food producing industries in the Cavan-Monaghan area.  In particular, I refer to Silverhill Ducklings, the mushroom industry and the numerous bakeries in the area.  These industries depend on clean water.  Since young children are particularly susceptible to injuries to their health as a result of drinking contaminated water, more decisive action should be taken.Most of these group water schemes have employed private companies to monitor the water but, ultimately, overall monitoring is the responsibility of the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government and the county council.  The problem in this case was a faulty supply of chemicals which had originated in Ringaskiddy in Cork.  The storage area in Cork had been changed and this caused the problem.  The company in Cork sent its product to Northern Ireland where the company monitoring the water quality sourced the chemicals.  Was information deliberately withheld from people?  People should be told exactly what is happening.  It was only through word of mouth that those involved in one scheme discovered that another one had similar problems.  Is this occurring in other parts of the country without people knowing?  Have people accepted the fact that we have poor water quality and now buy water?In this instance, the county councils accepted that they should supply proper drinking water to the food industries, the schools and at three locations in the Glasslough-Teeholland scheme.The use of chemicals allows for human error where somebody may put an incorrect mix into the water.  What plan of action is in place to deal with such a situation or where faulty chemicals are introduced into the system?  There should be a plan to deal with these situations.  I call for a faster and better response.
#SeymourCrawford	unknown-#SeymourCrawford-party	unknown-#SeymourCrawford-dob	unknown-#SeymourCrawford-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-04-25 00:00:00	Prelude	498	When this serious issue was raised by Deputy Connolly I consulted with Monaghan County Council because County Monaghan is one of the busiest food producing areas in the country and the county depends on food production for income and employment.  Any adverse publicity could be very serious.  I am happy to say that the county council officials have made every effort to rectify the situation as quickly as possible.  I agree with Deputy Connolly that there should be a much better means of checking the situation.  The first I heard was that chickens and cattle were refusing to drink the water.  It is obvious that the company which was handed the bundle system has literally bundled it themselves as the problem is not just in the Teholland-Glasslough area but also in significant areas of County Cavan.  There is no excuse for this and decisive action must be taken. In the past these water schemes were run by voluntary committees.  These voluntary groups made sure that while the water may not have been perfect, it certainly would not do any damage.I refer to a reply I received from the Minister this week to an inquiry on behalf of the Donaghmoyne group water scheme.  This was one of the first schemes in the country to install a plant to deal with the problem which is now in Galway and it treats the water for the same parasite problem.  This scheme has done its best to work with the system, albeit outside the bundle.  The Minister in his reply stated that the scheme did not seek or obtain approval.  This scheme sought to meet the criteria in every possible way.  It is nothing short of a disgrace.  It was informed that if it did not go into the bundle it would not be penalised and that has not been denied, yet when it made the effort to go otherwise, it was stalled.  Although it had a totally clean record with its bankers, the bank withdrew the money when it was about to start.  The amount of skullduggery associated with this issue is unforgivable.The Minister should arrange a full inquiry to see how the group can get water for its producers at a realistic price while the cost of water to so many others is at such a level.  Legislation is extremely important but common sense must prevail.  This group is providing water to 1,500 households plus another couple of hundred people and it finds that because of a difference of opinion, it is allowed to suffer and that is wrong.  I assure the Minister that whether it is given a grant, the job has been done and has been financed, and that raises more questions.  If the group can proceed on its own without a grant, how is all the money being spent and why is it being spent?I question the long-term commitments made by other schemes which now find themselves with organisations that are increasing the costs far above inflation and are producing unacceptable water as a result of the chemicals used.  I ask the Minister to examine the situation and I thank him for listening.  I hope he will deal with the situation in a practical way before it is too late.
#SeamusHealy	unknown-#SeamusHealy-party	unknown-#SeamusHealy-dob	unknown-#SeamusHealy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-04-25 00:00:00	Prelude	499	Water is a basic necessity of life and citizens should have a statutory entitlement to good quality water that is free from impurities and from anything that might give rise to illness.  This right should be a statutory right enshrined in legislation.  Issues that have arisen in recent times and in the past mean that water supplies in various areas of the country are not fit for human consumption.  Local authorities, which are effectively State agencies, should be able to deliver a water supply that is clean and free from impurities and that poses no danger to health.Citizens should also be entitled to a sufficient supply of water.  When we were growing up we always believed we had too much water but in recent years there have been shortages and deficiencies in supply.  A few dry days cause water shortages and water is turned off from midnight until 7 a.m. or 8 a.m.  Areas of my constituency have had consistent periods of water turn-off, particularly during last summer.  Breakdowns in the system have also occurred frequently.  During weekends last summer the area of Slieve Ardagh had no supply of water for humans or animals.  The entitlement to a sufficient supply of water should also be enshrined in legislation.As is the case in south Tipperary, in many local authority areas the networks which carry water supplies have not been upgraded.  Up to 50% of supplies can be lost from networks that have not been modernised.  In many instances, the pipes that comprise these networks are made from asbestos and this gives rise to other concerns with regard to health and quality of supply.It is only right that the quality of water should be monitored on an ongoing basis.  This monitoring should take place at source, regardless of whether the latter is a borehole, a lake, a mountain stream or whatever.  Water should also be monitored on arrival in people's homes, at commercial undertakings or whatever.Monitoring should be carried out without reference to the costs involved.  I heard in recent days that some local authorities have not tested for cryptosporidium because it is too costly to do so.  In light of the importance of water in people's lives, its quality is vital.  We must ensure, irrespective of cost, that a quality supply of water, which is free of impurities, is delivered.  If that means testing for cryptosporidium or other impurities, then we must make arrangements in that regard.The situation in Galway gives rise to questions of trust as regards monitoring by local and national agencies.  A proposal was recently made to locate a dump in my constituency at a place called Hardbog.  The dump will be situated close to the River Linaun, which provides the water supply for Carrick-on-Suir.  There should be no development of any kind at the dump site until it has been reassessed and re-evaluated from the point of view of ensuring that the River Linaun will not be polluted.  An assessment must be carried out by independent international experts in order that everybody can be satisfied that an proper examination has taken place.  The need to use such experts arises because of people's perceptions and the fact that there is a lack of trust as regards local and national agencies monitoring our water supplies.The proposed dump at Hard Bog near Grangemockler in Carrick-on-Suir should not proceed until a full re-evaluation is carried out by independent international experts.  No development should take place until a report from such experts is made available to the public for examination.
#DickRoche	unknown-#DickRoche-party	unknown-#DickRoche-dob	unknown-#DickRoche-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-04-25 00:00:00	Prelude	500	I thank Members for a series of wide-ranging and important contributions.  If Deputy Crawford provides me with details of his concerns regarding the case to which he referred, I will have them examined.Deputies Connolly and Crawford raised the fundamental issue of information.  I introduced regulations in early March which, as a result of complaints made in the past, require local authorities to retain monitoring records and make them available to the public.  It is important that information relating to the monitoring of water supplies should be available.  I envisage that this information will be posted on local authorities' websites.  Guidelines will issue in respect of this matter in due course.With regard to culpability, responsibility and the matter of redress, local authorities are statutory bodies and there are certain rights of redress against them in respect of injuries caused.  Non-compliance with the 2007 drinking water regulation is an offence and the EPA has the power to prosecute in that regard.  In the regulations introduced in March, I gave specific power to the EPA to prosecute.  The authority previously only had power to monitor and publish monitoring reports from time to time.Deputy Michael D. Higgins raised wider pollution issues and the other codes to which reference was made.  Those codes include the Water Pollution Acts and the nitrates regulations.  I differ from the Deputy because I do not believe it would be possible to encompass all of the issues relating to potential pollution and water supplies in a single item of legislation.  It is more appropriate that legislation should refer to one or the other.  The nitrates regulations would be encompassed and their implementation would have a direct impact on water quality.  Regulations or guidelines that are going to be produced on the issue of forestry and tree felling and the manner thereof will also have an impact.  I also envisage the introduction of regulations, arising out of correspondence and contact with the Corrib anglers, relating to phosphates and detergents, particularly dishwasher detergents.  To try to capture these various matters in one item of legislation would make it extraordinarily cumbersome.  I also disagree with the Deputy's assertion that the focus of the Bill is narrow.On the wider issues of DBO and PPP, I already stated that only 16 of the schemes currently under construction come under the PPP model.  PPP and DBO are not the same as ownership.  The PPP model is only applied in respect of water services where it is clearly established that it provides the best overall value for money.  Local authorities are obliged to examine all potential procurement methods.  A variety of different approaches were taken in recent times by local authorities.  In some instances, DBO was the chosen model while in others it was not.  It appears, therefore, that the reality on the ground is somewhat different.  A fundamental principle of PPPs is that the relevant infrastructure is operated under contract to the local authority.  In the area of water, ownership lies with the local authority.On the issue of an unencumbered right to water and the provisions of the amendments, Deputy Gilmore is correct to state that I gave a great deal of consideration to this matter.  The Deputy made an extremely coherent argument during our lengthy debate on this matter on Committee Stage.  There are, however, practical problems in incorporating in law an unencumbered right to water.  I accept that it is not the intention but doing so could potentially prove to be a recipe for chaos in the area of water.  Amendment No. 6 attempts to subject such a right to any necessary conditions or limitations that may be prescribed in law.  It appears, therefore, that amendment No. 2 makes provision for an unencumbered right, while amendment No. 6 recognises the difficulties attaching to any such right and suggests the putting in place of certain controls.  When one considers the amendments together, it appears that their acceptance could give rise to endless litigation.The Deputy has a good memory as he is correct to state we referred to somebody on John Lennon's island.  Certain cases are easy to consider.  In my constituency a person has a house half way up a mountainside.  If we gave that person, who is extremely wealthy in order to be able to buy and operate that house, an unencumbered right and he or she chose to exercise that right in law — which the current occupant may not wish to do — it would place extraordinary pressure on the taxpayer and the public purse to bring a pipe to an area with no other house where, because of scenic amenity and planning considerations, there will never be another house.This is an extreme example as is the other case, but they illustrate that one could run into difficulties whereby people with deep pockets and a willingness to go to court could do so and cause significant loss.  I acknowledge the sentiment behind the amendments.  While I am not in a position to accept them I refer to a change, arising out of our previous debate, we made in the Long Title of the Bill which included a reference to the common good in a summary expression of the objectives of the Bill.Wholesome and clean water is the objective of any water treatment system.  The enforcement provisions in place, particularly those in place since March deal with some of the concerns expressed in a number of contributions including that no watchdog was in place.  It is made clear the EPA was provided with the enforcement standard.  I listened attentively to the contributions made.  For a variety of practical reasons which I previously outlined, taking this course could cause us difficulties and regretfully I cannot accept the amendments.

In general, when legislating for rights one can draw a distinction between the construction of law from civil and political rights and the international convention on economic, culture and social rights.  Usually when doing so, one makes reference to the progressive realisation of a right.  The Minister chose not to go down this road.  Neither did he fall back on the normal drafting strategy of the phrase "such as is practicable".  By not accepting the amendment he rejects absolutely the principle.  He has not met either the substance or spirit of the amendment in any way in this regard.  Far from amendments Nos. 2 and 6 containing anything contradictory between them, amendment No. 6 addresses the issue that conditions may arise which would make it either practicable to implement it within a particular set of conditions or to specify the progressive realisation of what is accepted as a right.
#DickRoche	unknown-#DickRoche-party	unknown-#DickRoche-dob	unknown-#DickRoche-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-04-25 00:00:00	Prelude	502	On this specific point, I accept amendment No. 6 recognises a practical difficulty exists.  I also accept the point the Deputy made previously that the conventional script "in so far as is practicable" can be used.  However, they are slightly "weasel words" because they lead us to difficulties.I gave this consideration and it was not that my contribution here was short.  We discussed this at extraordinary length on Committee Stage.  I promised to examine it and it would mean we would run into difficulties.  Notwithstanding the intent of amendment No. 6, I am convinced if we accepted amendment No. 2 even with amendment No. 6 we would find ourselves in difficulties and subject to regular challenge.  This is not the way forward.  For practical considerations I regret I cannot accept the amendments.

The Minister mentioned practical difficulties prevent him from accepting three amendments which would give Irish people a legal right to water.  Such a legal right is hardly an unreasonable request to make in the first decade of the 21st century.  Water is essential for life.  The practical difficulties referred to by the Minister relating to delivery of a water supply in cases where an exceptional physical difficulty exists or where a house was developed some time ago can be controlled through planning laws.  If it is not possible to supply water to a new dwelling, it is grounds for refusing planning permission.

Many hundreds of houses in the upland areas of County Wicklow and the mountain areas of County Dublin depend on water from private wells.

This is not about the supply of a luxury.  It is about the supply of something which is essential for life.  The Minister spoke about the practical difficulty that this would somehow impose an enormous burden on the State.  We know one third of the country's entire housing stock was built during the past ten years, presumably connected either to a group water supply or a public water supply.  Certainly this would have been a condition of planning permission.Dwellings built post-1963 under the terms of the Local Government (Planning and Development) Act 1963 are all subject to planning permission which establishes how water is supplied.  It removes them from the equation.  The Minister stated dwellings built before 1963 operate on private water supplies.  If the water supply is contaminated by someone outside of the control of the householder——

If somebody living in a rural area draws his or her water from a well or other private supply and it is polluted by the activity of someone else the State has a duty of care to protect the right to water of that person.  It is up to the State, through water pollution laws, etc, to ensure those people are protected.The reality is that in the vast majority of cases, people's water is delivered either through a public water supply or a group water scheme.  Today, we are in the business of making the legislation which will govern the way in which public authorities deliver the water supply and the framework of group water schemes in the delivery of a water supply.There is an obligation on the State to ensure people have access to clean and potable water.  It is not an unreasonable position to take and in this day and age people ought to have a right to a supply of water in the first instance, and of the water being of sufficient quality for domestic use in the second instance.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-04-25 00:00:00	Prelude	520	Unfortunately, there is a time limit on the Deputy's contribution at this point.
#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-04-25 00:00:00	Prelude	521	I am replying to the debate.If the Victorians could deliver clean water to towns and cities when this country was under British rule in the 19th century, it is not unreasonable to ask that, in the 21st century, the Government of this independent State should be able to deliver and guarantee to people that they will have a good quality water supply.The Minister is standing back from the issue — we are getting this over and over again from the Government.  It takes responsibility for nothing.  The Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government does not want responsibility for delivering clean water to people and the Minister for Education and Science does not want responsibility for the schools, as she has indicated that boards of management are responsible.  The Minister for Health and Children does not want to take responsibility for the hospitals as the issue is now under the Health Service Executive.Nobody on the Government benches is taking responsibility for anything but it wants to take the credit for everything.  There is always a Minister present for an opening, and the Minister is a great man for pipes.  As for the single-model PPP, the Minister is a two-model man from what I have read recently in newspapers.  The Minister cannot always take credit without taking responsibility for delivering as well.This is a critical amendment looking to ensure that people of this country have a legal right to water.  It is a very fundamental question and I ask that the amendment be put to the House.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-04-25 00:00:00	Prelude	522	I will allow the Minister to answer a specific question before putting the amendment.
#DickRoche	unknown-#DickRoche-party	unknown-#DickRoche-dob	unknown-#DickRoche-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-04-25 00:00:00	Prelude	523	There are 200,000 households connected to wells in this country.  Not all of those would have been built post-planning; many would have been built before planning.  It would be irresponsible to suggest that every one of those be connected up to a pipe.

#DickRoche	unknown-#DickRoche-party	unknown-#DickRoche-dob	unknown-#DickRoche-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-04-25 00:00:00	Prelude	526	That is the effect.
#DickRoche	unknown-#DickRoche-party	unknown-#DickRoche-dob	unknown-#DickRoche-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-04-25 00:00:00	Prelude	527	I move amendment No. 3:
In page 14, to delete line 5 and substitute the following:""groundwater" means all water below the land surface that is not in a pipe or similarly contained;".I promised on Committee Stage to revisit the definition of "groundwater" on Report Stage.  Deputy Gilmore mentioned on Committee Stage that the ambiguity in the wording of the existing definition could result in water below the land surface — in water pipes and swimming pools, for example — being regarded as ground water.  He made the clear point that the legislation did not have such an intention.  The definition of "groundwater" is intended to apply solely to water in a free state that seeps down through the subsoil from the surface above, including aquifers.  The revised definition clarifies explicitly that the prescribed interpretation is not intended to apply to water in pipes or any artificial container.  Therefore, I think it deals with the issue that was discussed at some length on Committee Stage.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-04-25 00:00:00	Prelude	528	As amendments Nos. 4 and 17 are related, they may be discussed together.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.
#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-04-25 00:00:00	Prelude	529	I move amendment No. 4:
In page 15, line 4, after "accordingly" to insert the following:", but references to prescribed persons and cognate expressions shall refer only to householders involved in group water schemes and similar arrangements, and shall not refer to those engaged in commercial activity".During all the debates on this Bill, I have expressed concern on behalf of the Labour Party about the possibility that this country's water services might be privatised.  I outlined my fear that the Water Services Bill, as it was initially presented to the House, would have provided a framework for the privatisation of water supplies.  I have to acknowledge that the Minister responded strongly on Committee Stage by stating that he did not intend to privatise water services.  He agreed a number of amendments to the Bill which somewhat calmed my concerns about the possible privatisation of water supplies.  I acknowledge that amendment No. 17 represents progress in so far as it appears to prohibit a local authority from handing over water infrastructure assets to a private company.  However, that does not protect us sufficiently against situations in which water supplies are privatised on a de facto basis through the introduction of the design, build and operate formula.  If, for example, the Terryland water treatment in Galway becomes a design, build and operate scheme, the operation of the plant will be in the hands of a private company for 20 or 25 years before being transferred back to the local authority.  In all probability, further upgrades will be required at that stage and presumably we will be back on the roundabout.In order to make absolutely sure this legislation will not be used to privatise the country's water services, amendment No. 4 provides that prescribed persons and cognate expressions refer only to householders and group water schemes and do not include commercial water companies.  That would give us protection from the privatisation of water supplies.
#ArthurMorganSF	unknown-#ArthurMorganSF-party	unknown-#ArthurMorganSF-dob	unknown-#ArthurMorganSF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-04-25 00:00:00	Prelude	530	On careful reading, amendment No. 17 appears to have the effect of prohibiting the privatisation of water schemes.  If that is indeed the case, it will be a significant amendment.Can the Minister clarify how the amendment relates to section 31(12), which states: "Subject to any regulations made under section 79(2) or (3) a person shall not provide water services in the functional area of a water services authority without the agreement of that water services authority”?  That implies a private operator could use the facilities as long as the permission of the water services authority has been granted.  Which holds sway, amendment No. 17 or section 31(12)?  The subsection clearly indicates there is provision for a developer or operator to use the facility, whereas the amendment appears to overrule such a possibility.  A clarification on that issue would be welcome.
#DickRoche	unknown-#DickRoche-party	unknown-#DickRoche-dob	unknown-#DickRoche-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-04-25 00:00:00	Prelude	531	I strongly hold the sentiment that water services should not be privatised.  We had a lengthy discussion on this issue on Committee Stage.  Amendment No. 17 prevents the asset from being transferred because the essence of privatisation is the question of who owns the asset.The new subsection (12) inserted by the amendment needs elaboration because I do not have any principled disagreement with the cogent and sincere points which Deputies have raised.  The subsection prohibits a water services authority from entering into an agreement for the purpose of divesting itself of the water services asset other than to another water services authority or a group scheme.  We want to ensure that we do not prohibit exchanges between group schemes.  Basically, paragraph (a)(ii) prevents the transfer of water services assets outside the local authority.  The design, build and operate process does not confer ownership of the asset.I trust Deputies will accept that privatisation was never on this Government's agenda nor was it the intention of this Bill.  I assure the House that I believe certain services, such as water, should lie within the public sector.  The prohibition in the new subsection will not apply to arrangements reached between individual water service authorities or water service authorities and group water schemes, which have been defined elsewhere.With regard to why I do not simply provide by law that water services cannot be privatised, such a measure could be interpreted as placing an obligation on a water service authority to provide water in all instances.  More importantly, if we were to introduce an absolute prohibition along those bald lines, we could face a challenge.  It is better and more effective, therefore, to focus on the ownership of the asset.  Existing provisions in the Bill already provide an effective mechanism to prevent de facto privatisation, which may have been at the back of Deputy Gilmore’s mind when we discussed the manner in which local authorities divested their functions in waste collection.  The question was raised of whether a surreptitious divestment could take place but the Bill makes clear the intention that ownership will remain in the public sector.Section 31(7) is important in this regard because it enables the Minister to direct a water service authority to provide services.  One of the issues which arose in the Galway debate was that the Minister has limited powers under the law as it stands.  The local services authority will now be bound to comply with a direction to provide services in any particular area.  A water service strategic plan, which also provides for such an action, is required to be approved by the elected members of the local authority.  This pertains to the point I made earlier about the importance of involving democratically elected members rather than making the matter an executive function.  It is imperative it remains a reserved function because, if efforts were made to do something underhand or if there was uisce faoi thalamh, elected representatives could be made aware of it.  As with the controls provided in planning law, if the representatives went mad and decided to act perversely, their plans would be subject to the scrutiny of the Minister.  Not only is full democratic accountability provided for in the legislation; there is a control mechanism of reference to the Minister and if a local authority tried to go in this direction, given the Bill's provisions, it would encounter very significant difficulties.  It is complex, but the reality is that the asset cannot be transferred and although local authority members will have the policy decision in the area, the Minister has the power of final scrutiny.  The protection that we seek is provided in the Bill.  I ask the Deputy not to press the amendment.
#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-04-25 00:00:00	Prelude	532	I acknowledge that, since the Bill was published, we have made considerable progress in limiting the potential for the privatisation of water services.  It is certainly the case that, when the Bill was originally published, provisions in it expressly allowed for the privatisation of water.  The original section 27, which I believe has now gone, referred to that.  The same is to some extent true of section 28.  The Bill was peppered with provisions whereby the Minister could, by order, effectively transfer the functions and responsibilities of water service authorities to others, who could include commercial companies.I accept that, in the course of the debate on Committee Stage, the Minister agreed to the introduction of the democratic accountability provision and that he has put an amendment before us on Report Stage that protects against the transfer of assets and infrastructure that is in the ownership of the local authority.  However, I am still unclear about what happens in a DBO situation.  For example, if a new water treatment or sewerage plant is being built, the local authority advertises.  There is no existing plant and a new one is being built.  Whose asset is that?  Who owns the infrastructure?  One has an asset not originally in the ownership of the local authority so what happens to it?I am also concerned about the de facto situation.  While I acknowledge that provision has been made for democratic accountability in the DBO scenario, the de facto case is that, where one has a DBO set-up, control of the facility and the service will rest in the hands of a private company.  The Minister may say that, in theory, the asset is owned by the local authority and that it will all return to it in 25 years.  In practice, however, it is——
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-04-25 00:00:00	Prelude	533	The Member is allowed only two minutes to speak so that the Minister has an opportunity to reply.
#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-04-25 00:00:00	Prelude	534	I have asked the question and I await the Minister's response.
#ArthurMorganSF	unknown-#ArthurMorganSF-party	unknown-#ArthurMorganSF-dob	unknown-#ArthurMorganSF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-04-25 00:00:00	Prelude	535	That was useful and it will be interesting to tease this out if "transfer" relates to transfer of the possession.  The way in which amendment No. 17 is worded appears to refer to the transfer of ownership of the system or the asset.  However, perhaps the Minister will clarify that it also means transfer of its use.  For example, the DBO does not bestow ownership on the developer, that would remain with the local authority.  It is therefore critical that we secure clarification regarding a potential loophole.  Perhaps the Minister will also clarify section 12.  It clearly states that there is provision, subject to the local authority's permission, for a third party to use the system.  In other words, there appears to be provision for privatisation under that section.
#DickRoche	unknown-#DickRoche-party	unknown-#DickRoche-dob	unknown-#DickRoche-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-04-25 00:00:00	Prelude	536	All I can do is assure the Deputy that the words mean what they appear to mean.  The central issue of privatisation is who owns an asset.  That asset may not be transferred in law, and amendment No. 17 specifically deals with that.  The same question arises regarding use and the DBO.  In the latter case, the contracting parties are contractors to the council, but that does not give them ownership of the asset.
#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-04-25 00:00:00	Prelude	537	Who owns the water in each case?  We must test this.
#DickRoche	unknown-#DickRoche-party	unknown-#DickRoche-dob	unknown-#DickRoche-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-04-25 00:00:00	Prelude	538	It is the local authority.
#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-04-25 00:00:00	Prelude	539	In no circumstances will the water be owned by the private company.
#DickRoche	unknown-#DickRoche-party	unknown-#DickRoche-dob	unknown-#DickRoche-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-04-25 00:00:00	Prelude	540	No, it cannot.  Section 40(7) provides that, notwithstanding the contracting out of the service to a third party, the contracting water services authority will retain responsibility for ensuring that it complies with all statutory requirements.  There will be no danger in a DBO process of any slippage.  The asset, which is the water and the system, will remain with the water services authority.  In the DBO process, a contractor is contracted by the council for specific work over a specific period.  I realise that there are arguments, issues and debates about the DBO process as opposed to councils operating the services themselves.  However, that is an argument about operational matters.The core issue in privatisation is ownership and I am grateful that the Deputy accepted on day one that I eviscerated any opportunity to create privatisation that may have existed.  I do not accept that it was ever part of the ethos of the Bill, but I have gone through the legislation to ensure that there is no chance of the asset being privatised.  That is the whole point of amendment No. 17 and I hope that the Deputy accepts my bona fides in this matter.  The House should accept amendment No. 17.
#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-04-25 00:00:00	Prelude	541	I am happy to accept amendment No. 17, which improves the situation.  I have been comforted to hear the Minister state that in no circumstances will the assets or infrastructure of our water services be transferred to private ownership.  I am also satisfied to have heard that the water itself will not in any circumstances be owned by anyone but the public authority.  I hope that I am right in my interpretation.
#DickRoche	unknown-#DickRoche-party	unknown-#DickRoche-dob	unknown-#DickRoche-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-04-25 00:00:00	Prelude	542	This is a very important point and the answer is that it will be owned by the water authority.  Water is extracted under abstraction orders and those provide ownership of an abstraction right to the local authority.  The Deputy brought up that point previously and I am sorry that I did not answer it.  He raises a very important point, which has been dealt with.
#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-04-25 00:00:00	Prelude	543	We have come a long way on this since the Bill was published and, to be fair, the Minister has responded to the issues raised on this side of the House.  Having come this far, I do not see how he cannot accept the amendment in my name, which would put the matter completely beyond doubt.
#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-04-25 00:00:00	Prelude	544	I move amendment No. 6:
In page 18, between lines 22 and 23, to insert the following:"6.—In addition to the matters specified in section 5, the purpose for which this Act is enacted includes giving effect to the fundamental right of the individual to access to sufficient, safe, acceptable and accessible water for personal and domestic use, having due regard to international legal standards, and subject to any necessary conditions or limitations that may be prescribed by law.”.

I hope he does not mind me cracking the same joke again but I said on a previous occasion that the perception is that he and I are under a little pressure from Fine Gael candidates.  I am pleased he is coping as well as I appear to be.  I wish Deputy O'Dowd well in that regard.This is important business and I am pleased we have an opportunity to discuss it this close to the general election.  Members may have noted that in the past I often referred to how long it was to the general election.  First it was so many thousand days, then hundreds and recently the numbers have become much lower.  I am not sure whether the election will be in 22 days, 29 days, 35 days or otherwise.  I have no idea.

I have always said I am not looking for a job, that I have a job and I will let the people of Dublin South-West judge me.  I am quite happy about that.  Whenever the election day will be, bring it on.  I have great confidence the Taoiseach will deal with the matter as he would wish.I will deal with the Bill before the House in due course but I wish to make an appeal about citizenship.  Like many colleagues I have always been brave enough to make the point, certainly in my community in Tallaght, that it is even more important that we encourage people to vote because otherwise none of us will get their votes.  We are all competing for votes and I am comfortable with that.  I am pleased a number of organisations in my constituency have taken a particularly proactive view in that regard.  I got an invitation during the week from the Tallaght Partnership to attend a "meet the candidates night".  I welcome the progress made by An Cosán in Jobstown in Tallaght west in recent years.  This group has also highlighted the importance of citizenship.It is important to cross the party lines.  In Dublin South-West, Deputies Crowe, Lenihan, Rabbitte and Senator Brian Hayes and I have encouraged that attitude.  I am not being more brave than I have to be; if people do not come out to vote, they will not vote for us anyway.  This is something we should encourage.  Whatever else emerges from tonight's debate, I hope we will hear a positive message about voter participation.  Regardless of the party political issues and points that will be made in the next hour and a half, we must send a positive message to encourage people to vote.  I hope people will do that.I recall all those years ago when I was approaching the first occasion on which I voted — I hope this does not sound too sad but I was quite excited about it.  If those present do not tell anybody, I will tell them that the first time I voted, I did not vote for the party I now represent, only because I voted for a neighbour.  I hope all my neighbours in Tallaght will vote for me too.

#CharlieOConnorFF	unknown-#CharlieOConnorFF-party	unknown-#CharlieOConnorFF-dob	unknown-#CharlieOConnorFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-04-25 00:00:00	Prelude	558	I am sure my parish priest will not mind me telling this story.  He was listening to some people saying I was a good man and one lady said I would not get any votes in the area and the parish priest said I would, that I would vote for myself.  That is what we do.In reply to what my colleagues across the floor have said about the election day, my view is that it does not matter what day one picks, it will be right for some and wrong for others.  That is fair enough.  If the Taoiseach had indicated it would be any other day, there would still have been an argument about it.  The Taoiseach has made the valid point that until the election is announced, we will not know on what day it is to be held.It is important to note that voting in this country to date has taken place on every day of the week except Sunday and Monday.  We are aware that the second referendum on the Nice treaty in 2002 was held on a Saturday, as was the Tipperary South by-election in the previous year.  Arguments can be made for or against the choice of any particular day.  That is fair enough in a democracy.  The Minister made the point that in attempting to accommodate one group of voters by choosing a particular polling day, another group may be inconvenienced.  There will be advantages and disadvantages no matter what day is chosen.  I have great respect for Deputy O'Dowd and the points he made but I think he would accept that is true.I understand there is little evidence to suggest the choice of a particular day of the week has a significant impact on voter turnout or that, for example, voting on a Friday produces a higher turnout.  I will be going around Dublin South-West over the next three, four or however many weeks before the election — as I always do, I am not just waiting for the election to be called — and I will go to every street in Tallaght, Firhouse, Greenhills, Templeogue, Brittas, and every farm in Bohernabreena.  My first message will be that people should come out to vote because it is important for democracy.  It is important there is a choice of candidates and that there would be stable government.  I hope people will listen to this message.It is also important that we make the point to Government that polling stations should be open for as long as possible.  Some people think it is a good idea to have polling stations open from 7 a.m. to 10.30 p.m. while other people do not hold that view.  I think it is a good idea.  I will only be voting once but I intend to be up and about at 7 a.m. on the morning of the election.  I will go out to vote and I hope lots of people will do that also.I wish to take the opportunity to talk about my constituency for a moment.  One of my concerns relates to the new communities that have developed there in the five years since the last general election.  I am not clear how these people will be catered for in terms of polling stations.  I have appealed to the sheriff and the council to ensure they take account of the needs of voters in these new communities.  It is important that people can vote in locations convenient to where they live.  Tallaght, Firhouse and Ballycullen in the constituency of Dublin South-West are no different from anywhere else in the country.  I am sure this problem also arises in County Louth, County Cork and County Sligo.  Issues arise in this regard in my constituency and I hope the list the sheriff gave me this morning will be improved on and that new polling stations will be set up where possible.This is a challenge in every single constituency because of the absence of new buildings, community centres and schools in certain communities.  There is room for improvement in this regard.  Election day presents particular challenges.  I am sure this is not just an issue for me in Dublin South-West; I suspect it is also an issue in the new communities in Limerick as much as anywhere else.  Local sheriffs will have to take account of the needs of the population to ensure polling stations are properly marked and people can gain access to them.I welcome the opportunity provided to us by Deputy O'Dowd and the Fine Gael Party to debate this issue.  He has heard my views and he would be somewhat surprised if I agreed fully with him.  I will listen carefully when he concludes the debate later and I hope he will join with me in making an appeal to all voters, whatever their political affiliations, to show they care about our democracy at a time when we hear stories from all over the world about democracy being challenged.  It is good that we use our vote.  I look forward to election day.  As I may not have another opportunity, I wish all my colleagues well and I hope they wish me well also.

#JimmyDevinsFF	unknown-#JimmyDevinsFF-party	unknown-#JimmyDevinsFF-dob	unknown-#JimmyDevinsFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-04-25 00:00:00	Prelude	563	There is no doubt about that.  I am delighted to have the opportunity to speak on this Bill and I pay tribute to Deputy O'Dowd for introducing it.  It is a great tribute to him that his name is attached to a Bill rather than just a motion.  He distinguished himself during the lifetime of this Dáil, particularly in his work on nursing homes.  Like Deputy O'Connor, I wish all the Members present the very best in the forthcoming election.Before discussing the Bill, it is important to consider what it proposes to change.  In this regard, section 96 of the Electoral Act 1992 states quite clearly that a poll at a Dáil election shall take place on any day of the week, provided it "is not earlier than the seventeenth day or later than the twenty-fifth day next following the day on which the writ or writs for the election is or are issued."  The Bill before us proposes that the poll should be on a Friday, Saturday or Sunday.  This is somewhat regressive because it is removing the right to hold the election on a Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday or Thursday.  In that regard, it is worth noting that voter participation is perhaps the key element of our democracy, as has been mentioned by all the previous speakers.  If there is no voter participation, we will surely have lost what our democracy is all about.We are ultimately discussing how personal opinions stand up regarding this issue but it is worth considering some of the facts and figures pertaining to previous elections and referenda.  The past two general elections, in 1997 and 2002, were held on a Friday.  The 2002 election turnout was 62.6% and that in 1997 was turnout of65.9%.  The general election prior to that, held in 1992, was held on a Wednesday and the turnout was 68.5%.  The 1989 election, also held on a Wednesday, had a turnout of 68.5%.  It is interesting to note the 1987 election was held on a Tuesday with a turnout of 73%.  If we consider these figures purely from a statistical perspective, we will note a drop in turnout of almost 10% as the elections were moved closer to the weekend, from a Wednesday in 1987 to a Friday in 2002.  If we were to take this argument to its logical conclusion, we could assume the turnout at a weekend would be much lower.  Statistics are very much open to individual interpretation and can be used for different purposes.  However, we are all agreed that voter participation is the key, as Deputy O'Connor stated.An interesting point made to me repeatedly concerns the hours for which polling stations open.  I note the legislation states they must be open for not less than 12 hours.  I urge the Minister, when signing the relevant legislation, to allow the stations to open between 7 a.m. and 10.30 p.m., that is, for 15.5 hours.  I hope this will allow as many people as possible to vote.  Thanks to the wonderful economy the Government has maintained for the past ten years, an enormous number of people are at work.  The employment level is the highest ever in the State and it is important that those working late in the day can be facilitated by the 7 a.m. opening and those working earlier in the day can be facilitated by the 10.30 p.m. closure.It is interesting that the Government set up an electoral commission to encourage people to vote.  This was achieved under the auspices of the Taskforce on Active Citizenship, which was established in April 2006 and which reported in March 2007.  Its very interesting report contains a section that deals specifically with political issues.  I am very much in agreement with many of the recommendations of the taskforce, one of which was to establish a totally independent electoral commission to deal with all aspects of elections, including the determination of the dates on which they should be held, how best to encourage people to engage in the electoral process and how voting can occur.  In this regard, it was interesting that there was a debate this morning between the Taoiseach and some leaders of the Opposition on electronic voting.  This is an issue that the electoral commission might be able to examine when it is established.  It can remove the political hot air from the debate and consider the matter purely from an objective viewpoint.It is also worth noting that, despite the decline in voter turnout, we do not know how many young people are voting.  Hearsay would indicate that an increasing number of young people are not voting but I note from experience that if they are afforded the opportunity and encouraged, they will do so.  In this regard, I commend all the Members of this House who spend time visiting secondary schools to talk to children in transition year or those who are about to turn 18 to explain to them how the Dáil and political process work.Last Monday, I spent an hour visiting a class in Summerhill College in Sligo and I was astounded by the interaction that occurred.  The students were very keen on the electoral process and knew much more than I expected.  We engaged in a question and answer session which unfortunately had to end after an hour because of time constraints, but I have no doubt that it could have proceeded for much longer.  I was really encouraged by the wide range of political opinions expressed by the students.  Some of their questions were of a very searching and intelligent nature and, in this regard, it is encouraging to realise they will become engaged in the political process.  I was delighted to encourage as many of them as possible to join the Fianna Fáil Party, which is obviously very progressive in its thinking on a wide range of issues.As a Member from a constituency some considerable distance from Dublin, namely, Sligo-North Leitrim, I stress that many students attending college in Galway, Limerick or Dublin would like to return home to vote at the weekend.  However, it is important that the House send out the message that the existing legislation provides that students attending full-time education away from their place of residence are entitled to apply for a postal vote.  It is important to encourage as many students as possible to do so.I thank those who acted as Chairman in the House over the past five years and wish them well in the forthcoming election.  The main message from tonight's debate is that we must encourage as many people as possible to vote.  It is important that the diverse range of candidates be supported by as many voters as possible.  I will not support the Bill for the reasons I have outlined but I will support the ministerial amendment.

#CatherineMurphy	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-party	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-dob	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-04-25 00:00:00	Prelude	566	When I was 17 or 18, I went on holidays to Scotland.  In saying this I am not trying to kill time as I have a genuine point.  Ireland was a Monday to Friday country at the time.  We travelled out on Saturday evening and arrived in Liverpool at 7 a.m. on Sunday.  The number of people going about their business on a Sunday morning took us by surprise.  They were working in great numbers.  Ireland is no longer a Monday to Friday country and over the past three decades has become a 24/7 country.  We market ourselves in terms of flexibility.  It is a key word and a quality that people seek.  The Government argues that flexibility is needed in the health services to make full use of technical equipment and quality facilities where they exist.  However, Ireland is still a Monday to Friday country in terms of elections.  There is a total lack of flexibility.Some decades ago, only wealthy people went to college.  We have made progress in the meantime but we pay lip service to our young people if we do not accommodate them in the manner in which they want to be accommodated in respect of elections.  We expect flexibility from them and they expect the same from us.  Thursday is not a good day for students and Friday is not a good day for workers.  To avoid traffic jams those in my constituency must leave too early in the morning to vote.  Friday is not a good day for young workers who may wish to remain in the city centre after work.There was a particularly low turnout in the by-election in Kildare in which I was elected two years ago.  People who wanted to vote were critical because they could not vote.  They did not return from the city centre in time to vote and it is a big deal to ask them to disrupt their social life.  This had an impact, although it may not have been significant.  The people to whom I refer are flexible and are contributing to our society and economy.  They pay taxes, of which we have no problem relieving them.  These people should be accommodated on a Saturday or Sunday, the days I favour.  If we truly embrace democracy we must make it possible for people to vote and the weekend is a better time.  On Sunday 85% of people voted in the French election.We must stop the nonsense about when an election will be called.  I cannot believe how much of a rumour factory the Dáil is in respect of the date of the election.  Anyone who asks about the election is concerned about when it will happen.  We must go beyond one party suiting itself and create some certainty about it.  There should be a predetermined formula for setting an election date.  We should not take a healthy democracy for granted.  We must work at it and permitting people to vote at weekends is important.  That is why I support this Bill.
#PaddyMcHughIND	unknown-#PaddyMcHughIND-party	unknown-#PaddyMcHughIND-dob	unknown-#PaddyMcHughIND-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-04-25 00:00:00	Prelude	567	This Bill is important because its aim is to give the opportunity to vote to the maximum number of people.  It needs no elaboration that midweek elections do not suit many categories of people.  One such category is students who study at colleges away from their homes.  Students are mainly young people, many of whom are sceptical of politics and politicians.  Members should do everything in our power to ensure this scepticism is minimised.  The Taoiseach has a similar responsibility but his recent comments suggest he has no intention of acting to facilitate as many people as possible to vote with the minimum of difficulty.The uncertainty about the date of the general election is unfair to students, particularly those doing exams.  Some 650,000 people are aged between 19 and 28, many of whom are students.  Every effort should be made to accommodate them.  Those studying away from home do not know whether they will be finished their exams when polling takes place.  They are faced with the impossible task of applying for a postal vote within two days of the dissolution of the Dáil if they are sitting an exam on election day.  In those two days they must have the application form stamped by the college and submitted to the local authority.  It is impossible, impractical and unfair to young people.The Taoiseach has a duty to the students to ensure they are accommodated.  The election should be held during the weekend.  The Taoiseach should name the day of the election and allow Members to get on with it.  We should stop the shadow boxing and the phoney war taking place at present.  Members are fed up with this.  I wish we had legislation to define the date of the election so that Members would know when the following election would take place.  The current situation is absolute rubbish.

A vote is a basic democratic right.  Many people like to have it but a number of people do not want to use it.  That is a tragedy.  Examining the history of how people won the vote might bring people back to their senses.  Some 50% of the population, women, did not have the vote at one stage.  At another stage one had to be a property owner or 21 years of age to vote.  When one considers how much those in Africa had to fight for the right to vote and the effort these people go to in casting their vote it shows the true value of a vote.  If people examined how dictatorships controlled people it would wake them up.  I encourage people to cast their vote in a way that uses the full proportional representation potential of the vote.  Many people do not realise the value of the proportional representation and the value of going through the whole card.  I encourage people to do so.Some believe we have too many Deputies but I would like to have one more to facilitate the position of Ceann Comhairle.  The party from whose ranks the Ceann Comhairle is selected has a strategic advantage in the following election.  Cavan-Monaghan was a five seat constituency but it has been reduced to four seats for this election and that is wrong.  A seat should be reserved for the Ceann Comhairle but the people of the constituency should not be disenfranchised.  There have been constitutional rows about the numbers of people in constituencies.  This is a real issue and will affect whoever is in the constituency of the present and next Ceann Comhairle.  It is entirely wrong and unconstitutional.Students have been written out of the electoral equation by proposing to hold the election on a Thursday and that is completely wrong.  Also, to avoid voter fraud people should use their PRSI number so they could only vote once.
#DanBoyle	unknown-#DanBoyle-party	unknown-#DanBoyle-dob	unknown-#DanBoyle-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-04-25 00:00:00	Prelude	569	I do not know why Fianna Fáil fears young people so much but it has a history of disenfranchising them in various elections.  When the Constitution was changed in 1972 to allow 18 year olds to vote, the then Taoiseach Jack Lynch held the 1973 election before the legislation passed on foot of the constitutional referendum took effect, thereby disenfranchising thousands of new voters.That attitude is maintained to this day.  Those who crunch numbers on behalf of Fianna Fáil have realised that growing numbers of younger people are less inclined to vote for Fianna Fáil.  Twice in its history, Fianna Fáil achieved 50% of the vote and regularly in the 1980s it achieved levels of 48%.  The Fianna Fáil component of this Government was elected with 41% of the vote and the likelihood is that after this election the figure will be somewhere in the 30% bracket.

The trend is marked and irreversible.  Fianna Fáil is a dying breed and it is nothing to do with climate change.  It may take 50 years but the dominance of majority Fianna Fáil has gone and its dominance in two party Government will slowly disappear because it is just another party.  It is the last party in Europe that has any degree of dominance in the 30% range.  There is nothing unusual about political parties in Europe not getting anything like Fianna Fáil's present vote so the trend is for it to get smaller and smaller votes.  I am sorry about that.  Actually, I am not really sorry about that, I look forward to the day it becomes a fringe party.

#DanBoyle	unknown-#DanBoyle-party	unknown-#DanBoyle-dob	unknown-#DanBoyle-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-04-25 00:00:00	Prelude	583	The Minister of State is demeaning the House by introducing gambling.  I know it is the habit of this Government to play loose and fast with the public finances but I will not resort to such economics.  The people of this country have had enough of that.  We can debate the figures in the coming weeks.Young people are less and less likely to vote for Fianna Fáil.  It may hold the dominant position in Irish politics but it is becoming less dominant and the party knows that.  Every opportunity it can get, therefore, to distort the electorate and give fewer people the opportunity to vote is being taken.  It is a sleight of hand that may not be illegal but ethically and morally it is dubious.  A date should be picked that is most opportune for the maximum number of citizens to participate in an election.The philosophy behind the Bill is unarguable but I would go further.  It is now time to change the Constitution to allow for fixed term parliaments.  This will be the second Dáil that has run for a full five years.  We should know on leaving this Dáil when the election for the 31st Dáil will take place so that all the nonsense the Taoiseach has put us through for the last six months will be history.  Any new Government should make that a priority in the 30th Dáil.

I would also point out at the outset that we would have preferred for this Bill to have gone further and allow for elections to be held either on a Saturday or over two days as is the case in many of the continental elections.  Our European counterparts have proven this can and does work.  Such an approach would ensure the maximum turnout possible.Electoral politics must be accessible to everyone but the current arrangement, and that signalled for the upcoming general election, simply does not accommodate that requirement.  If a one day election must still be held, Sinn Féin would prefer it to be held on a Saturday to accommodate the many students, young people and those who work away from home who will not be able to make it back to their home constituencies on Thursday to vote.This Government has disproved its own arguments about having elections or voting on a Saturday when it decided that the electorate got it wrong in the first Nice treaty vote and held the second vote on a Saturday.  A Saturday vote would avoid disruption of the leaving certificate examinations, as happened in the 2004 local and European elections, and would also ensure that most third level students would not be disenfranchised as a result of the election being held on an examination day.  What possible benefit is there for the Government to disenfranchise so many?

That is the critical point and the statistical information exists to support the arguments made by the Opposition.  The CSO survey on voting attitudes in 2002 proved that a weekend election is preferable, an undoubted fact.  The European elections in 1999 were held on a Thursday with a turnout of 50.21%.  When the 2004 European and local elections were switched to a Friday, turnout rose dramatically to 58.8%.  Logic would indicate that if elections were switched to a Saturday, turnout would increase even more.This Government has a moral responsibility to make voting as democratic and accessible as possible instead of putting ridiculous barriers in the way by holding the vote on a weekday.  No amount of peddling the notion that access to a postal vote will necessarily cater for all and sundry will suffice.  Many young people and others who do not know where they may be still prefer to return to their home constituencies to vote with their families and friends.  Whatever the reasons the Government has for insisting on a Thursday vote on this or any other occasion, students in Dublin and elsewhere, young people working away from home and those who will find themselves unable to get to their constituency must be accommodated while we look for a real and permanent change in the conduct of all elections and referenda into the future.I therefore record my support for the Bill as presented by the Fine Gael Members, last evening and again tonight.
#SeymourCrawford	unknown-#SeymourCrawford-party	unknown-#SeymourCrawford-dob	unknown-#SeymourCrawford-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-04-25 00:00:00	Prelude	596	I welcome the opportunity to speak on this important Bill.  I realise the Government will oppose it, as with so many other issues, for the sake of opposition.  I think back on some of the proposals brought forward by Fine Gael in the past five years, which we were assured would be replaced by Government Bills, and this never happened.  I recall the Bill to attach fines to social welfare or to employment.  We were guaranteed that would be brought in and it never happened.  The same thing happened with so many other Bills.It is clear the Taoiseach has not too much respect for young people, especially.  He wants to force them to stay in Dublin city, if at all possible, to vote, hopefully, for him and his party.  It is obviously a last ditch effort to maintain his vote and that of his party in that area.  I spoke recently to a young group in Castleblayney college, as did Deputy Ó Caoláin and others.  Those students showed tremendous interest in the whole political system.  Anyone who thinks young people do not have an interest in the political system, if given a chance, is not being fair to them.  Why does Fianna Fáil, especially, fear allowing young people home to vote on, say, a Friday or Saturday?  Thursday is impossible for them for many reasons.  It was interesting to see that the Minister was so sure of himself as regards the voting rights of students.  Many taoisigh have made efforts over the years to try to solve the Northern Ireland problems.  Yet there are students from my constituency, Cavan-Monaghan, Donegal and from around the Border, mainly, who go to college in Northern Ireland and who, in effect, are being refused a vote.  They are being refused a vote, although they live on this island.  Is that fair or realistic?If they go from this jurisdiction to Queen's University, St. Mary's, Jordanstown, Coleraine or Magee, they are not allowed to vote. People in Northern Ireland have a right to an Irish passport but they have not a right to a vote here even though born, reared and still domiciled in this State.  I ask the Minister, even at this late stage to reconsider the situation.  He possibly has a few days left for legislation and perhaps a Bill could be rushed through the Oireachtas to give students from the Border counties the same rights as any other student here.  Students living across the Irish Sea, who for different reasons might have had to study in Britain, should also have that right.  This Government has totally failed to provide jobs for young people, especially graduates, in areas such as Cavan-Monaghan or Donegal for that matter.  They have been forced to go to work in Dublin or elsewhere and at least they should be given the opportunity to come home on either a Friday or Saturday and vote for the people they want to elect in their own constituencies.

Since 1981 voter turnout has moved downwards, culminating in a low of 63% in 2002.  The trend is 13% lower now than it was in 1981.  Average turnout in Ireland over the three decades since the 1970s has been lower than in any of the other countries of the European Union — the rate of decline has been well above average.  We have the lowest average voter participation in the European Union for general elections over the past 30 years.  This is very serious.  A major debate is needed on this issue when the election is over.  An electoral commission needs to be set up to look into it.  Polling hours have been extended and the polling day has been changed to the weekend.  While these recent initiatives have not increased turnout, their real impact, according to political scientists Drs. Richard Sinnott and Pat Lyons, who have done much work in this area, may have been to stem the decline.  Many Members have put forward statistics in the House on this issue.  By moving to weekend voting we have stemmed the decline.  Otherwise, the figures would have been even lower.  This is extremely serious.In Quebec, Canada, the province with the highest turnout, the election day is a public holiday.  I am not saying we should have a special holiday in Ireland, since we have many as it is.  However, it just makes the point.  In its recent submission the Union of Students in Ireland recommended that all State elections be held at weekends to facilitate more than 540,000 students who are eligible to vote in exercising their constitutional right.  That is quite important.  In 2002, Ógra Fianna Fáil called for Saturday polling for the forthcoming general election that year, to increase voter turnout and to facilitate young people in particular.  If Saturday polling was impossible, they wanted it on a Friday.  However, the Taoiseach wants it on a Thursday, although he has not explained why.The 86 countries labelled "democratic" by Freedom House in 1996 hold their elections on one single day.  Almost half held their most recent elections on a Sunday, it was reported internationally.  Saturday and Sunday were the second most frequent days around the world.  Ireland is therefore out of step, across the world, in holding elections on a Thursday.  I notice that the Fianna Fáil Dáil candidate, Mr. Jim O'Callaghan, has also called for weekend voting.The Taoiseach made big play of establishing the task force on active citizenship.  The task force said in its report that it wants to encourage everyone who is eligible to register and vote in elections through organisation, with particular reference to the timing of voting.  Everyone is saying it is better to hold elections at the weekend.  Another study, Democratic Freedom: Reinventing Political Activism, published by Cambridge University Press, says that holding elections on a rest day such as a Saturday, Sunday or bank holiday can boost turnout by about 6%.  When one bears in mind that we have had a steady decline in turnout over the decade the statistics being quoted in the House mask the decline.  Holding elections on a Friday arrested the decline, somewhat.  I notice that the task force has also come to similar conclusions.This is very serious.  I have a personal interest in that my son is in college in Dublin and he may not be able to come home to vote.  The Minister talks about postal voting.  Students find it difficult enough to organise themselves, to get postal votes.  It is not an easy thing to do.  It is difficult and challenging for them.  Many of them do not know about it.  It is far better if they could travel home to vote.  They will have a choice, then, to either vote at home, or——

I do not believe the Minister of State, Deputy Fahey is convinced.  However, I hope we may be able to convince the Taoiseach as a result of the debate that the election should be held on a weekend.  I regret the Minister of State, Deputy Fahey, is leaving the Chamber because I wanted to highlight some statistics on the electoral register for the Galway West constituency.  The September 2006 census recorded 52,000 people over the age of 18 years in the constituency.  The electoral register, published in February, contained only 40,000 people.  This means there are 12,000 voters in Galway West who are not registered.  The majority are students attending one of the several third level institutions in Galway.  From knocking on doors for the past week, I noted most of these students are registered in their home constituencies where they wish to vote.  With study and examinations, they will not be able to go home to vote if the election is held on a Thursday.  By having the election on a weekday, the Taoiseach simply does not want these young people to have the opportunity to vote because they are independent-minded and most likely will not vote for the Government.The aforementioned figure represents a sizeable proportion of the electorate.  Reflecting the national average turnout, 60% of those voters could easily represent an electoral quota.  It is interfering with the democratic process to deny them their vote.  Many seats will be won by 100 votes or less, sometimes even by six votes.  These 12,000 voters do not want to cast their votes for me or Deputy Fahey but for the representatives they know in their constituencies.  I cannot understand why the Taoiseach is hinting the election will be held on a Thursday.  The word has probably come back to him of the Fine Gael Party's strength of support among young people.  The Fine Gael branch of the NUI Galway has more than 200 young members.  Young people want to be involved in the democratic process but they are being denied the opportunity to vote.

#DamienEnglishFG	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-party	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-dob	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-04-25 00:00:00	Prelude	617	What is the Government's problem in giving people the opportunity to vote in the forthcoming election?  I would not be surprised if the Taoiseach decides to hold it on a Saturday.  It is causing great confusion among people.Democracy is about involving the people, yet day in and day out Dáil Éireann is becoming less of a democracy.  We are heading towards a dictatorship.  It must be our duty to give people the best chance to vote.  Which provides the better opportunity to vote — a weekday or a weekend day?  The answer is obvious, a weekend day.  Although I am aware of the constitutional implications, I support the calls for a two-day election process.  People are losing interest in politics and politicians for many reasons.  They are not, however, losing interest in the issues, particularly the young.  They do not feel they are involved in the process and the best time to address this is during an election.  Instead, the Taoiseach is giving them the message that we do not want them to be involved in their democracy by shutting down their opportunity to vote.  The Taoiseach would rather people do not vote.  It might suit him better but it is not about him.Patterns of life have changed considerably and elections should be formulated around these.  The Government may make life difficult enough for people but it is its duty to make life easy for them when it comes to voting.  Elections should be based around people's daily lives.  Many people do shift work lasting up to 15 hours.  Many travel up to three hours to work.  The Taoiseach is still living in the Dark Ages because he does not realise what is going on around him.  People already have enough stress but holding the election on a weekday will only put more stress on them.  People will be forced to drive home late at night in horrendous road conditions, and we all know what that could lead to.  That will be on the Taoiseach's conscience because he has not given a valid reason the election should be on a weekday.  The only reason for this is that it simply suits him.  This is not about him but about our democracy and getting people involved in it.
#NoelAhern	unknown-#NoelAhern-party	unknown-#NoelAhern-dob	unknown-#NoelAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-04-25 00:00:00	Prelude	618	This side of the House welcomes the opportunity provided for by the Bill to consider the important issues of participation in our democracy, including what is the ideal day of the week to hold an election.  Last night, the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Roche, set out the pros and cons of choosing different days of the week for polling day.  Polls have been held on five of the seven days of the week.  One can argue for any particular day of the week but none has worked in achieving higher turnout.Weekend voting could be beneficial to students and others who are away from their primary residence.  It would also eliminate the need for primary school closures but I wonder if that would make us popular with primary school students.  Weekend voting could equally reduce turnout because of clashes with holidays, sporting events and festivals.  Society has changed.  In three weeks many of the third level colleges will be shut.

They do not come home at 7 p.m. or 8 p.m. on a Friday night to vote.  Many Dublin people seem to go down the country for the weekend or do something else.  They are not at home and are not dedicated enough to go out to vote even if we open the polls at 7 a.m.  The notion of holding the poll on a Friday seems great from one point of view but it has not delivered.  If the Taoiseach has expressed reservations, it is from that point of view.  It looked like a good idea and it was when we did not have a shilling in our pockets and had nothing else to do except go out to vote.  However, in recent years people have become mobile and have weekend and holiday homes.  Even the people who remain in Dublin are otherwise engaged.  While one group is facilitated by the choosing of a particular day of the week, another group may at best be inconvenienced or even disenfranchised.There is no clear evidence, nor has any been provided by the Deputies opposite, supporting a direct link between weekend voting and increased voter participation.  The House has been given detailed turnout data in regard to Irish elections and international perspectives in this regard.  What is clear is that our current legislation, which provides for the holding of a Dáil election on any day of the week, allows all relevant factors to be taken into account at any given time.  Limiting the holding of elections to a particular day, or to Fridays, Saturdays and Sundays, as proposed in this Bill, would be a backward step from the flexibility provided under the current legislation.  That is why we cannot support the Bill.Elections have been held on five of the seven week days.  Perhaps we should try Sundays and Mondays because many of the other days have not worked.  If we have the flexibility to hold an election on any of the seven days, why restrict ourselves to only two or three days?  There is a bank holiday coming up and perhaps that would suit everybody.  People have different ideas on this.Levels of voter turnout are important in a democratic society.  We have witnessed declining rates of political participation in recent years.  Weekend voting, however, is not the panacea for problems of low participation and it is wrong to suggest otherwise.  While it might suit some, it might work or militate against others.  The solution lies in working at a much more fundamental level towards having an electorate who are well informed, interested, engaged and willing to play their rightful role as active citizens.  It is in everyone's interest that voters are motivated to play their part and there is a great onus on all of us to achieve this.There have been advances in this area in recent times.  For example, at each referendum, the Referendum Commission now has a mandate to prepare and disseminate information on proposed constitutional amendments, to promote public awareness of the referendum and to encourage the electorate to vote at the poll.  I am glad the Deputies opposite have acknowledged the improvements to the accuracy of the register which have been achieved over the past year.

No matter who forms the next Government, the challenge of engaging our citizens more fully in the democratic process through awareness, education and other measures is a continuing one and must be high on the agenda.  In the meantime, we must all work to encourage people to consider the important issues which will be put before them in the coming election, to examine the alternatives available and to get them out on polling day.I already referred to the notion that this would be marvellous for students and that it would increase the overall vote.  One will find that by the time polling day comes, most third level colleges will be on holidays and the students will be gone.

We will all know about our running mates when the election is over, including the Minister of State.I support the Bill brought forward by my colleague.  Anything we can do to encourage voter participation and to include the public in the whole democratic process should be done.  What is most likely to encourage voter participation is for the political establishment to be honest and fair with the electorate.  If it makes promises, it should keep them.  Nothing disenchants young people, in particular, as much as a firm undertaking given at election time being completely ignored thereafter.  The Government needs to be careful about the number of young people who will have their say at the forthcoming general election.  Regardless of what day of the week the election is held, those people will remember the things the Government has ignored since the 2002 general election.  They will also remember the electronic voting machines and the fact they are paying for their storage.The Minister of State said we were interested in voting when we had no money in our pockets.  I am not so sure about that.

They will remember that on election day.  The Minister of State can hold the election on a Monday but they will still remember.Unlike everybody else, I believe there will be a massive turnout at the next general election.  It will be the highest we have seen since the early or late 1970s.  The turnout in the early 1970s was probably the highest in living memory.  The Government does not want a massive turnout.

I know he cannot agree with me and applaud what I am saying but he knows in his heart and soul that what has been done to the unfortunate electorate is appalling.  They were hoodwinked and trapped, bought and paid for and sold down the river when it was all over.  The Government can dress it up any way it likes; have the election on any day of the week it wishes; pick the time it thinks the least number of people are likely to be accommodated by coming out to vote but I think they will still come out to vote.  They will pay back.  Many young people will decide it is now payback time.Some of the ceremony associated with elections in the past has gone.  I remember being told by a Minister for the Environment from that side of the House some years ago that the people outside the polling stations were a nuisance and were impeding voter participation.  As soon as the people were removed from outside the polling stations voter participation dropped simply because it was part of the ceremony and the ritual.  It was what we grew up with and it was part of our tradition.I know of members of families who did not speak to each other before they went to vote and went to vote separately because they were on opposite sides of the house yet when the voting was over they were the best of friends.  That was the tradition which this country grew up with since the foundation of the State.We all know of Fine Gael people and Fianna Fáil people living side by side.  They were the best of pals and went to hurling, football, rugby and soccer matches together.  When the heat generated by the election took over, they sulked and avoided each other.  They manned the polling station the day before and hurled abuse and all kinds of catcalls at each other and derived much enjoyment from it.  It was amazing that no offence was ever taken because they had forgotten about it at the count and they were the best of pals again.  They were participating in the ritual that was born at the foundation of the State and in which they contested and competed vigorously in the selection of their public representatives.It was a wrong decision to remove that ritual as the interest in the voting process dropped dramatically as a result.  I have an example from my own constituency.  People stopped to ask me directions to the polling station and this was a question never asked before because it was always recognisable from the flags flying.  Politicians stood outside the polling stations to greet the people on their way in.  The system has been depersonalised and I am certain this was a diminution of the public interest in the democratic process.  The election should be held on whatever day is most convenient for the greater number of people.

The Government can hang on and hope but no help will come and its cries in the wilderness will be heard long after the election has taken place.  I am not sorry even though I hate to see anyone lose his or her seat and I would never wish it on anyone, particularly myself.  If those in the political establishment give an undertaking to the public they then have a moral duty to deliver.  I do not care what the consequences are because once they make that promise they should stand over it.  This is the reason our leader, Deputy Kenny, has entered into an electoral pact with the public.  He has given an undertaking and entered into a contract in order to give some integrity to what is happening in the political process and to restore public confidence in the process and in democracy.  Everybody can make promises and some people do not even know when to stop making promises.I refer to the cynicism generated by the electronic voting.  This system was neither wanted nor requested by the public.  People questioned the Government's expenditure of €60 million on something nobody either wanted or asked for.  I have been holding clinics for many years but nobody ever suggested a system of electronic voting or led a deputation on the subject.  The Government ignored what the public said and it ignored what the experts said.  On close questioning the Government said it could not have a paper trail lest it gave a different result.  This was a most extraordinary admission because it clearly indicated what was going on.The time has come for the accounts to be levelled and for the public to come out and they are willing to come out.  I ask the Minister of State to take on board this motion and accept it and have the election at the time that suits the general public.  The Government has done little else to suit the general public in the past five years and it has ignored the wishes of the public.  Everything the public thought and said was ignored by the Government.I would like to continue my contribution and bring many other anecdotes to the attention of the Minister of State as to the reasons he should agree to the Second Stage reading.  I ask the Government to come on side for once in its life and not divide the House on this issue.
#TomHayes	unknown-#TomHayes-party	unknown-#TomHayes-dob	unknown-#TomHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-04-25 00:00:00	Prelude	648	This motion proposes an amendment to the Constitution to allow for voting on Friday, Saturday or Sunday.  A general election is always a big occasion for the country.  I agree with Deputy Durkan's point that the next election will see a large number of people who wish to vote.Last night I canvassed 100 households in my constituency of Tipperary South.  I noted in excess of 20 of those houses where people expressed the wish for the election to be held on a Friday evening or a Saturday.  This is rural Ireland, rural County Tipperary.  People are working in Cork and in Dublin on building sites.  There is no third-level college in our constituency so all students must leave and the Government is disenfranchising them.  This is one practical reason a Friday or a Saturday should be chosen.The by-election which led to my becoming a Member of the House was held on a Saturday.  Since 2000, there have been two by-elections in south Tipperary — one was held mid-week and the other on a Saturday — and local elections were also held.  These elections all took place within a short period and there was a higher turnout at the by-election held on the Saturday.  It is unfair of Government representatives to state that the turnout at elections held on weekdays is higher.  I plead with the Government to listen to the people who are stating that they want the election to be held on a Friday or a Saturday.As already stated, many people work in Dublin or on building sites throughout the country and they only return home at weekends.  People in Ireland have a major interest in both politics and the outcome of the forthcoming election.  There are issues in respect of which they will engage in debate with one on the doorstep and with regard to which they wish to make decisions.  There are people who want to vote for the Government because they believe it has brought about a great deal of prosperity.  Likewise, there are those who want to vote for parties on this side of the House because they believe that this Administration has made a mess of things.Everyone in this country should be given an opportunity to vote.  It is five years since a general election was held and, following the impending poll, it will probably be a further five years before another is held.  In a ten-year period, therefore, people will have few opportunities to vote.  It is disingenuous of Government spokespersons to state that the Administration will facilitate the electorate by holding the election on a weekday.As already stated, the by-election which led to my becoming a Member of the Dáil was held on a Saturday.  Many people returned home to the constituency from Dublin and elsewhere for the weekend, voted on the Saturday and attended the Munster final involving Tipperary and Limerick on the Sunday.I implore the Government to give way on this issue and provide people with the opportunity to vote in the election by holding it on a Saturday.
#FergusODowdFG	unknown-#FergusODowdFG-party	unknown-#FergusODowdFG-dob	unknown-#FergusODowdFG-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-04-25 00:00:00	Prelude	649	I thank everyone who contributed to the debate, particularly Members on this side of the House.  Those on the Government benches did not take up all the time allocated to them to make contributions.This Bill is about the future, not the past.  We are living in an Ireland of change.  The country has changed radically in many ways.  The emphasis of the contributions on this side of the House has been on the future of the country and, in particular, the role of young people and their organisations.  All Members, including the Minister of State, were e-mailed by those organisations and informed that they want the opportunity to exercise their franchise to the maximum extent.  In their e-mails, they indicated that they do not support Fine Gael, Fianna Fáil, Labour or the Green Party.  They merely seeking inclusivity and an opportunity to participate in the election.  The Union of Students in Ireland indicated that it wants the election to take place at a weekend.The Government represents the forces of reaction to change.  It does not want change, it merely wants to batten down the hatches and make it as difficult as possible for the electorate to participate fully in the forthcoming election.  Therefore, it represents the past, the forces that do not want to change, the Thursday voting syndrome and the those who want to keep as many people as possible away from the polls.  The Government wants to forget about third level students or to make it as difficult as possible for them to vote.  It is aware, as are we, that they represent the swing vote.  Those students want change and they want to exercise their franchise in full.  It is not practical for many thousands of them to travel long distances on a Thursday in order to vote and then return that night or on the Friday in order to either continue to prepare for or sit their exams.The Minister of State is correct to state that many students' lectures have concluded.  However, they are preparing to sit their exams and it is a difficult time for them in terms of making grades or doing well enough to obtain their degrees.  Not allowing them to vote on a Friday or a Saturday, days on which they would normally return home, is a retrograde step on the part of this reactionary Government.Another group about which I am concerned is that which is comprised of commuters.  Thousands of people get up early each morning in order to travel to work — the roads in my constituency are usually extremely busy by 6 a.m. — and return home late at night.  It is almost 8.30 p.m. and many people who live in counties Louth, Meath, Wicklow, etc., will only now be arriving home.  These individuals know that on Thursday evening when they return home they must prepare to go to work again the next morning.  Holding the election on a Thursday represents another reaction on the part of the Government to commuters who, as Deputy Durkan stated, are paying additional mortgage costs as a result of increases in interest rates and who are obliged to spend extra hours commuting by road and so on.  Those people want to vote the Government out of office and they are being denied the opportunity to do so.Those of us on this side of the House represent change.  We want commuters and young people to be able to vote at the most opportune time.  The natural work cycle for the many thousands of people who work away from home ends on Friday.  They return home on that day and begin to engage with their families again.  They are not obliged to get up on Saturday in order to commute to work and they, therefore, have the time to vote either on Friday or Saturday.Evidence relating to weekend voting in many of the modern vibrant democracies across Europe was provided last night.  The Taoiseach himself referred to the elections in France, where there was a turnout of 85% on Sunday last.  The position was similar in past elections held in Greece and elsewhere at weekends.As it votes down this Bill, the Government is really saying that it does not want young people and commuters to participate, to the fullest extent possible, in our democracy.  As times change, so governments change.  We are of the view that there will be a change following the election that is almost upon us.This debate has engaged young people and the organisations that represent them.  We want a modern, new democracy, we want change and we want to give people the greatest possible opportunity to vote, one way or the other.  We believe that weekend voting represents the way forward.This simple Bill before the House states that the election ought to be held on a Friday, a Saturday or a Sunday.  That makes sense.  The Bill is a practical and focused measure to allow those who, because of their working or educational arrangements, find it most difficult to vote mid-week.  I commend the Bill to the House.

#ArthurMorganSF	unknown-#ArthurMorganSF-party	unknown-#ArthurMorganSF-dob	unknown-#ArthurMorganSF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-04-25 00:00:00	Prelude	651	I move amendment No. 7:
In page 18, between lines 22 and 23, to insert the following:"6.—Nothing in this Bill will enable local authorities or Water Service authorities and providers to charge domestic users for the provision of water supplies.".We heard earlier from the Minister on the privatisation issue, when he told the House he is against the concept of privatising such a basic human necessity as a water service.  I look forward to the Minister assuring the House that he is totally opposed to any prospect of charges applying to a major basic human right and necessity.  I hope the Minister will provide such assurances.  However, while assurances are one thing, the most effective way of ensuring there will be no service charges on water is to accept this amendment.  This will put the issue beyond discussion in terms of legislation, which is what we want.Currently, almost 50% of water escapes through various leaks in a cranky system.  Very little has been done to try to check such a large loss, although I accept that some minor effort has been made to try to at least quantify more accurately the level of loss in our water service.  That occurs at significant expense because it invariably happens between production point and the tap.We are sometimes told householders are wasting water but they are not a patch on those primarily responsible for it, the local government as agent for the Minister and the Government.  If this significant waste is checked, the attending cost savings will be notable.The prospect of charges for water will represent an imposition of a double taxation system.  We are used to double taxation but this one will not be accepted.  In the late 1980s, there was a significant battle over the issue and many Members will remember those hard times.  I have no doubt we will return to that battle whenever a Government tries to introduce water charges again.For me, it will be a battle North and South as the British Government is trying to impose water charges in the North.  That battle has been won temporarily but I do not doubt for one moment the issue will return.  I hope a number of the Unionist parties will be on our side in that battle.  Who knows, they may even come to join us here should a Government decide to introduce water charges on this side of the Border.This water war could be interesting.  The first major water war took place in Cochabamba in Bolivia in 2000, when thousands of people took to the streets in opposition to the imposition of charges.  That case was so ridiculous that it got to a stage where the Bolivian Government would not allow people to dig a hole to retain rain water.  That became an offence under the legislation, so even the rain was privatised.  People would have been asking if fresh air was next.In 2005, Uruguay changed its constitution by means of referendum, defining water as a human right and a public natural resource.  Any prospect of ever privatising public water supplies for domestic use was banned.  That is where we should be heading in this State.  This House should have that assurance from the Government not just verbally from the Minister, but through the acceptance of this amendment.  The inclusion of the amendment would ensure there will be no water charges.Why should poor people, those on a very low income and already categorised as living in poverty, be hounded over this basic human right?  Why should anybody, irrespective of income, have to pay for something so critical to human life itself?  I hope the Minister will recognise this.  I look forward to his reply.
#DickRoche	unknown-#DickRoche-party	unknown-#DickRoche-dob	unknown-#DickRoche-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-04-25 00:00:00	Prelude	652	I thank the Deputy for his remarks.  Given that water charges are specifically prohibited in this State under the 1997 Act and will be prohibited under section 105(1) of this legislation, it seems to me that a third prohibition is probably unnecessary.  Section 105(1) of the Bill before the House, which was inserted on Committee Stage, explicitly prohibits charging for domestic supplies and cannot be changed by regulations.  The 1997 Act cannot be changed unless it is the will of the Oireachtas that a change be made.  It is not necessary to provide for yet another prohibition in law.  I ask Deputy Morgan not to press the amendments.The Deputy quite rightly highlighted the loss of water through cracked and fractured pipes, especially old pipes.  We announced some weeks ago that we intend to pursue a €240 million water conservation scheme.  The Deputy might not be aware of the scheme because its announcement was overshadowed by a welter of publicity about photographs taken on that occasion.  The water authorities in Dublin are introducing a forward-looking scheme that will involve the replacement of approximately 240 km of piping over a short period.  Eight or nine contractors have been engaged to pursue the scheme in a progressive manner.  The press conference at which I announced the water conservation scheme did not get as much publicity as the photographs, unfortunately.  Dublin City Council has dealt with this big issue.I mentioned earlier that there is an issue in other parts of the country where water service authorities are responsible for mending pipes.  When it was decided recently to pump water from Tuam to Galway city, it was discovered that up to 70% of the water was being lost through old pipes.  The Government has allocated €27.4 million to Galway County Council to deal with that issue.  The Deputy is quite right to suggest that the issue of the loss of water from the system as a result of bad piping is a critical one.  The Government devoted massive funding last year and this year to deal with the issue.  Moneys will continue to be spent on it throughout the rest of the water services programme.  I agree with Deputy Morgan that this is an important point, but it is being dealt with.
#ArthurMorganSF	unknown-#ArthurMorganSF-party	unknown-#ArthurMorganSF-dob	unknown-#ArthurMorganSF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-04-25 00:00:00	Prelude	653	I thank the Minister for his reply, which unfortunately does not allay my concerns.  Section 72 of the Bill states:72—(1) Subject to any direction of the Minister under this Act—(a) a water services authority may—(i) supply water by measure,(ii) meter or otherwise measure the volume of water supplied or the volume of waste water discharged,(iii) subject to complying with other enactments in relation to charging for water services, charge a rent or otherwise recover from a consumer the costs incurred by it in respect of every meter or other instrument provided for measuring the water supplied to or the waste water discharged by that consumer.The Minister has told us that he will not charge for the water, but it seems to me that he intends to find a device whereby charges can be imposed.  The effect of that device, which will be called something else, will be to impose charges for water.  If the Minister accepts this explicit amendment, he will ensure that such a situation simply cannot arise.I will give the Minister a moment to examine section 72, which appears to be quite explicit in its reference to costs pertaining to the domestic use of the water supply.  The Minister can call it what he wants, but it amounts to the same thing — the imposition of charges on consumers for water.  I ask the Minister to delete section 72(1)(a)(iii) to deal with some of my concerns.  I look forward to hearing the Minister’s reply.
#DickRoche	unknown-#DickRoche-party	unknown-#DickRoche-dob	unknown-#DickRoche-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-04-25 00:00:00	Prelude	654	I will remind Deputy Morgan of what section 105(1) of the Bill states:105.—(1) A water services authority shall not charge for water supplied to or discharged by—(a) a household, which is used by that household for domestic purposes, or(b) a person, other than another water services authority, providing water services to a household for domestic purposes.It could not be clearer.  The Deputy referred to section 72, which deals with the provision of meters.  Meters, other than domestic meters, are charged for.  If a meter is installed at a commercial premises, including an agricultural holding, a charge is imposed.I will take this opportunity to address the concern expressed earlier by Deputy Connaughton that a farmer with seven disjointed holdings might have to pay for seven meters.  That has not been the case since earlier this year, when I introduced a specific prohibition on the imposition of such multiple charges.  Under the new system, a farmer has to pay for the first meter in full, for a portion of the cost of the second meter and for a smaller portion of the cost of the third meter.  He will not pay for more than 1.8 meters in total.  If one is running a large multinational company, there is no reason in God's earthly world the taxpayer should pay for the provision of one's meter.

#DickRoche	unknown-#DickRoche-party	unknown-#DickRoche-dob	unknown-#DickRoche-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-04-25 00:00:00	Prelude	656	The imposition of water charges on domestic consumers is specifically prohibited by section 105(1).  The 1997 Act also specifically prohibits the imposition of such charges on domestic consumers.  Ireland is probably the only country in the world that has two separate statutory enactments prohibiting the imposition of charges on domestic consumers.  I do not think it would make any sense to provide for a third such prohibition.  If Deputy Morgan checks section 72 again, he will find that it clearly deals with metering.  There is no reason commercial operators and big businesses should have taxpayers paying for their meters.
#ArthurMorganSF	unknown-#ArthurMorganSF-party	unknown-#ArthurMorganSF-dob	unknown-#ArthurMorganSF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-04-25 00:00:00	Prelude	657	I agree with the Minister's last point.  We do not object to businesses and commercial users having to pay for the water they use.  We do not disagree with that at all.  We do not approve of the use of the term "consumer", however, because it is a catch-all phrase.  If that term were more closely defined, I could more easily accept the Minister's argument.  In the unfortunate absence of an acceptable definition, I will have to press the amendment.

In page 20, line 40, to delete "subsection (1) or (2)” and substitute “subsection (2), (3) or (4)”.This technical amendment intends to correct a cross-reference in section 8(5) so that it refers to the appropriate penalty provision in the section.  It arises from the insertion on Committee Stage of additional subsections earlier in section 8.

In page 21, line 33, to delete "5" and substitute "3".This amendment has been proposed because it is in everybody's interests that prosecutions or other follow-up actions are taken during a period that is as close as possible to the time of the offence.  The five-year period proposed is too long.  Deputy O'Dowd has proposed this amendment, which provides for a more realistic three-year period.  It will have the effect of concentrating the legal activities at a time that is as near as possible to the time when the offence took place.
#DickRoche	unknown-#DickRoche-party	unknown-#DickRoche-dob	unknown-#DickRoche-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-04-25 00:00:00	Prelude	660	This amendment, as well as ensuring that action is concentrated nearer the time of the offence might also have the unintended effect of making the prosecution of such offences more onerous.  The advice obtained from the Office of the Attorney General indicates that five years is a standard provision which applies, for example, in the waste management and environmental protection codes.  I do not see why we should constrain a local authority by making a prosecution under this Bill more difficult than is the case with the Environmental Protection Agency Act 1992.  Perhaps if the Deputy reconsidered the issue, he would understand that five years is a prudent provision in other environmental legislation.  We should not provide for a shorter period and I ask him to withdraw the amendment.
#BernardJDurkan	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-party	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-dob	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-04-25 00:00:00	Prelude	661	I was interested to hear what the Minister had to say but the opinion of the general public would differ with regard to when a prosecution should take place and the most cost-effective means of bringing an action.  He argued that it might be better to align the provision with other relevant Acts because a local authority might not be in a position to bring a prosecution within three years.  However, the longer the delay from the time of the offence, the more irrelevant a prosecution can become.  The measure as it stands could encourage unnecessary delays in prosecutions.  The speedier the prosecution, the more it would be perceived by the general public as a response to an offence.  I do not know how much additional time a local authority might need but concentration of the mind would have beneficial consequences.  I understand why Deputy O'Dowd tabled this amendment.I am a former local authority member, although I left voluntarily before there were any redundancies in that regard.  I always held to the view as a local authority member that if a decision must be taken, it should be taken immediately.  While I do not want to go down the watery roads we have travelled in past weeks, decisions should be taken on foot of the legislation and procedures being put in place.  The longer one delays, the less effective one's action becomes.  It would send a salutary message if a prosecution took place within months of the offence.  I do not know how beneficial a long drawn out prosecution could be, even if such a delay is set out in other legislation.
#DickRoche	unknown-#DickRoche-party	unknown-#DickRoche-dob	unknown-#DickRoche-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-04-25 00:00:00	Prelude	662	I will oppose this amendment because it gives criminals a way out, even if that is not the Deputy's intention.  We should make it as clear in this Bill as we have in other environmental legislation that people who commit environmental crimes will be brought to court and punished with severe penalties.  I am surprised that Deputy Durkan is pressing the amendment and ask him to withdraw it.I remind the Deputy of the browbeating and bullying required to force local authorities to take action against criminals who were involved in widespread dumping.  Many of the investigations into these offences were very difficult and some required officials to take risks.  I do not think we should constrain their rights.  Once a crime has been committed, we should resource the investigation and the prosecution rather than make it easier for environmental criminals to escape.
#BernardJDurkan	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-party	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-dob	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-04-25 00:00:00	Prelude	663	I am not convinced by the Minister's argument.  This amendment does not represent an attempt to give criminals the opportunity to find the easy way out but an effort to concentrate the mind of the statutory body on prosecuting within the shortest possible space of time.  Deputy O'Dowd's intention was that the necessary resources would be provided to the local authority to ensure that the maximum amount is spent on the investigation with a view to identifying sources and administering the necessary punishment.If the culprit in the case of the water supply in Galway was brought to book, would it be better that the prosecution took place within five rather than three years?  The preferable response would be to prosecute immediately.  I am not suggesting for one moment that the Minister will be prosecuted or imprisoned but postponing the response to any offence will not necessarily improve the quality of the service.  I will not begin a long tirade on the countless questions I have put down on that subject to the Minister and his predecessors.  I have repeatedly attempted to remind the responsible authorities of the need to ensure adequacy and quality of domestic water supplies.  Any deviation from that requires a response and the more immediate, the better.  There is little to be gained by saying we might not have the evidence.  It did not take long to discover the real culprits for the water pollution in Galway.  I do not propose to press the amendment but the Minister's reluctance to accept it will reflect on him and his Department.

In page 24, to delete lines 33 to 38.These amendments delete identical provisions inserted on Committee Stage to enable the Environmental Protection Agency Act 1992 and the Local Government Water Pollution Act 1977 to be used as the basis for regulations to transpose EU directives on related matters.  In the absence of such a provision, any treaty or Act of the EU would require new legislation to enable it to be transposed.  However, since Committee Stage was completed, the European Communities Act 2007 has been enacted with a general provision similar to those being repealed, thereby obviating the need for separate provision in any other enactment.  The related provisions in the Bill are therefore redundant and the proposal to delete them makes good drafting sense.

With regard to electronic mail, paragraph (f) already provides that a notice must be served by one of the more traditional methods provided for in the earlier paragraphs of section 19.  Service of the notice by electronic mail is effectively an additional method rather than an alternative one.  If the Deputy considers the matter, he will see that depending on e-mail alone could lead to some difficulty.  The purpose of providing for service of a notice by e-mail is to facilitate speedy transmission.  It could also facilitate reproduction of additional copies of the notice.  At any rate, it does not seem practical to me to provide for a system that confirms that a recipient of an e-mail has read it.  That would land us in difficulties and I ask the Deputy not to press the amendment.

In page 38, to delete lines 30 to 33 and substitute the following:"(9) The obligation on a water services authority to comply with a request from the Minister under subsection (7) shall not apply where the water services in question cannot be provided due to climatic conditions or other circumstances beyond the reasonable control of the water services authority.”.I promised to return to the provision on Report Stage to address a specific concern expressed by Deputy Gilmore on Committee Stage.  He expressed concern that the current wording of subsection (9), which is couched in terms of the liability of water services authorities regarding a water service, might be interpreted as relieving it of all legal liability as a consequence of providing substandard water services, even where the problem might have been aggravated by underlying incompetence on the part of the authority in the first instance.It was never intended that the proposed provision be given such an interpretation.  Its only purpose was to provide that, where the Minister requests a water services authority under subsection (6) to provide a water service, the obligation on the authority to comply should not apply where circumstances such as adverse climatic conditions beyond the reasonable control of the water services authority prevent it from doing so.To address the Deputy's concerns, the revised wording in subsection (9) avoids reference to liability or any similar construction, providing only that a water services authority will not be obliged to comply with a request from the Minister under subsection (7) to provide water services in a given area where circumstances outside its reasonable control prevent it from doing so.  I regard the provision as a reasonable restriction on the application of the powers under subsection (7) and trust the clarification will meet the concerns that the Deputy expressed on Committee Stage.

In page 57, line 18, to delete "Part 7” and substitute “Part 7 or 8”.The purpose of this essentially technical amendment is to amend the cross-reference to Part 7 in section 42(11)(b) to include a reference to Part 8 as well.  It arises from the insertion of a new section 97 into Part 8 on Committee Stage.  That provides for the powers of the water services authority to lay water pipes and related cables and wires through land.  Such powers for the purpose of installing a pipe are clearly necessary under section 42(11) or (12), and the amendment will therefore ensure they are available to the water services authority if required.

In page 57, line 51, after "repair" to insert the following:"and may recover a contribution to the cost of meeting his or her obligations under this section from the persons using the connection, in direct proportion to their level of use of the connection".We discussed this at some length on Committee Stage.  It addresses problems where there are combined drains or services and liability for repair and maintenance rests with the householder.  I had hoped that the Minister might have produced an amendment to deal with the issue because we debated it quite extensively.
#DickRoche	unknown-#DickRoche-party	unknown-#DickRoche-dob	unknown-#DickRoche-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-04-25 00:00:00	Prelude	680	We carefully considered amendment No. 20 in particular, which could have a very dangerous, unforeseen and unintended consequence.  It would allow the owners of service connections to charge users for their upkeep, albeit in direct proportion to the level of use.  That would effectively amount to a charter for water charges for all consumers, domestic and non-domestic, which I know certainly was not the intention of the Labour Party or Deputy Gilmore.For example, it would allow the developer of a new housing estate to charge every household for the upkeep of drainage and water supply pipes on the estate until such time as they are taken in charge by the relevant local authority.  I am convinced that Deputy Gilmore did not intend that.  No one in this House would want that because developers get away with enough already.  There is a potential danger, and I ask the Deputy to withdraw the amendment.The principle espoused in amendment No. 21 of recovering costs from users based on the level of use for a connection is already enshrined in section 43(3) and (4).  Subsection (3) places responsibility for the upkeep of a connection on the person who owns or is in charge of it.  Where such a person cannot be identified, subsection (4) provides that such responsibility falls proportionally on the owners of the premises using it.Regarding amendment No. 22, section 43(2) provides that a water services authority may, at its discretion, provide, repair or replace a connection itself or, alternatively, contribute to the costs of such works.  I consider that it would be preferable in the first instance to allow individual water services authorities in a spirit of local democracy to exercise their discretion regarding the extent of assistance to individual premises for the purposes of section 43.  I expect a reasonable line would be taken depending on individual circumstances.  If further direction is necessary, I will exercise my powers under section 33(1) to issue appropriate guidance.In summary, a quite dangerous and entirely unforeseen consequence would arise from amendment No. 20, and I do not suggest for a moment that it reflects the Deputy's intention.  Amendment No. 21 has already been addressed, and the Deputy's concerns expressed in amendment No. 22 can be dealt with in guidance.  I ask that the amendments not be pressed.

If that person is the owner of any premises, whether domestic or non-domestic, it is reasonable to place a charge on it for the recovery of the debt in due course when the premises are sold.  That is standard civil and commercial practice.  There is no case for limiting its application regarding the recovery of debts due.  If the Deputy's concern relates to the possibility of the provisions in subsection (2) facilitating the return of domestic water charges, I can only reiterate that there is an ongoing prohibition under the 1997 legislation, which is restated in section 105.

#DickRoche	unknown-#DickRoche-party	unknown-#DickRoche-dob	unknown-#DickRoche-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-04-25 00:00:00	Prelude	686	I cannot accept these amendments, which we discussed previously.  Section 54(1) and (2) place a duty on the owner of a premises to maintain the internal water distribution system of the premises in good repair and in such condition as to ensure that drinking water meets subscribed quality requirements at the taps used for the purpose.  The owner is also required to ensure that all taps connected to the distribution system do not leak water from the system.As I indicated when we discussed this matter on Committee Stage, removal of the absolute requirement in this regard, for which the current wording of the subsection provides, could undermine enforcement actions by a water services authority under the section and protracted legal argument over what constitutes reasonable steps could in time potentially allow serious water wastage or contamination to go on unchecked and unpunished.  The only people who would benefit from this may well be the lawyers who would be involved in the cases.  I am sure Deputy Gilmore accepts the point.  The aim is to ensure due care is taken on internal piping.  I urge him not to press the amendment.

In page 80, line 35, after "subsection (1),” to insert the following:"fails to comply with a requirement applied by regulations under subsection (14),”.The purpose of these two linked amendments is to enable the Minister to make regulations to add specified classes of domestic discharges or storm water to subsection (1) for the purpose of applying the licensing requirement of this section to them.  Non-compliance with regulations under subsection (14) will be an offence.It may, for example, be appropriate in certain circumstances to license particular classes of domestic wastewater discharges to control the biological load arriving at the receiving wastewater treatment plant.  The issue of load has been a problem in a couple of plants.  The accumulation of a particularly concentrated load from a large number of premises may have adverse implications for the capacity of a wastewater treatment plant to deal with the normal wastewater inflow for which it was originally designed.For example, should the practice of discharging domestic food waste to the sewer, for example, via under-sink food waste disposal units, rather than disposing of it or composting it with the biodegradable waste stream become widespread, it could have a significant impact on the volume and biological loading of the effluent received at wastewater treatment plants.  A study on the use of food waste disposal units, carried out by RPS Consulting Engineers, which is due for publication shortly, indicates that over one third of the waste produced by households is organic.  A trend towards increased disposal of this waste to the sewer to avoid paying refuse charges could have a significant negative impact.  The situation is currently being monitored.  The aim of the proposed amendment is to prevent what is called shock from heavy loads reaching any particular water treatment plant.  It is a prudent provision.

In page 89, between lines 27 and 28, to insert the following:"71.—This Part shall not apply to domestic dwellings.".This amendment essentially deals with the issue of charging for water.  The Minister has devoted an entire part in this Bill to the legislative provision for water metering.  I propose that this measure should not apply to domestic dwellings.  As we all know, the purpose of metering is to provide for the charging for water at some stage.  The argument will be made that there may be water conservation reasons for installing meters but I do not accept that.  Amendment No. 28 proposes that the whole metering regime should not apply to domestic dwellings.  There is no point in it applying to domestic dwellings if, as the Minister stated, there will not be charging for water.I am also concerned the introduction of meters would in any event be a back door method for introducing water charges.  The provisions in the Bill allow for the rent or hire of the meter.  I fear this might operate in the way in which the old rental charge for telephones used to operate.  It was not really regarded as a telephone charge but in practice it was one.  In theory, one could have a situation whereby one was not charged for water but a charge could be imposed for the meter.I propose, first, that metering should not apply to domestic dwellings and, second, that the idea of the meter being leased or rented out should not apply because it is, in effect, a way of charging for water without calling it a water charge.
#DickRoche	unknown-#DickRoche-party	unknown-#DickRoche-dob	unknown-#DickRoche-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-04-25 00:00:00	Prelude	691	Metering is a central element of every water conservation programme.  I listened recently to the president of the National Federation of Group Water Schemes talking at length about the value of metering and the astonishing impact of putting in meters just to make sure water is not being wasted.  Metering is a prudent provision because it helps to pin down leakage and stem wastage, and is an essential aid to water management.Deputy Morgan referred to the huge amount of water that is lost every day through bad maintenance and bad pipes.  Local authorities are coming abreast of that and they are doing major replacement works on which I congratulate them.  The Government has provided them with funding for this purpose.  It would be folly to take away the opportunity to install meters which would measure and would help to determine leaks.  It is not easy to determine leaks, especially in built-up areas and periodic meters are a good way of dealing with this issue.  Domestic metering is also used extensively in the rural water sector where it is found to be a positive measure.Like Deputy Morgan, Deputy Gilmore expressed concern that metering could be a back door method of introducing a charge or could introduce another charge like, for example, telephone line rental.  I refer them to section 72(1)(a)(iii), which makes it clear that the measure is “subject to complying with other enactments in relation to charging for water services”.  The other enactments referred to are section 105 of this Bill and the 1997 legislation.  We have a unique position in this country in that not only have we prohibited charging for water once but we have done so twice.  It is unnecessary to do it a third time.  It would be unwise to remove metering because it is a way of detecting leaks.  The Deputy’s concerns about metering, which I acknowledge he expressed on Committee Stage, are dealt with in the relevant subsection of section 72.  I ask Deputy Gilmore not to press the amendment.

In page 115, line 37, to delete "section 36(10)” and substitute “section 36(18)”.This is a technical drafting amendment to correct a cross-referencing error.  Section 36 was significantly and very positively redrafted on Committee Stage to stipulate that the making of strategic water services plans should be a reserved function rather than an executive function.  We all agreed with this measure, which was to return the control of water services to where it belongs.There were a couple of consequential drafting amendments and this amendment is one of them.  This area is one in which we have all done good work because the local authority members who are elected and answerable to the people are now becoming responsible for the preparation of the plans.  This will allow councillors to be more closely involved in water control in their local authority areas.  In areas other than Galway in recent weeks, councillors told me they did not know what was happening in respect of water services.  This will no longer be the case.

In page 119, line 27, to delete "hardship," and substitute "hardship or quality of water supplied,".This amendment inserts an additional provision into the existing text of section 105(4)(a) to enable a water charge, or part of a water charge, to be waived where there is a problem with the quality of water supplied.  This is certainly very topical at present because it is obviously wrong that people should be charged — in Galway, for example — for water contaminated through no fault of their own.  It would be unfair and unreasonable to charge people for water that is in any way tainted.  This is a very prudent and timely amendment that will allow for the waiver of such charges.

The purpose of the 1885 Act is to provide clarification on the basis for assessment of water rates under the Waterworks Clauses Act 1847.  As the 1847 Act is repealed in its entirety under the Water Services Bill, the 1885 Act is therefore superfluous.  Removal of the Water Rates Definition Act 1885 from the Statute Book complements the ongoing Government initiative to repeal outdated pre-1922 statutes.
#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-04-25 00:00:00	Prelude	706	The Government has been very negligent in the way it has handled this Bill, which concerns the transposition of the EU directives on water services.  Ireland has been in trouble with the European Commission regarding water services legislation.  It should not have taken over four years for this Bill to reach the stage of enactment.The Bill has been changed very substantially in the course of its passage through this House.  I made the point on Second Stage that it was providing a framework for the privatisation of water services in this country.  I still believe that was the intention and that in the course of Report Stage, and particularly Committee Stage, significant amendments were made which, at the very least, substantially reduce the possibility of the privatisation of water services.  The Bill now contains provisions that expressly prohibit the transfer of water assets and infrastructure to private companies and there are also provisions to prevent the reintroduction of water charges.  The record of the House contains repeated assurances from the Minister that this will not happen and therefore very significant progress has been made.I welcome the provision to put in place strategic water plans.  It is a great pity this regime was not in place heretofore as it might have prevented what happened in Galway.  I welcome the fact that the Bill has changed the initial objective that the development of strategic water plans would be an executive function of county managers and that it will now be a reserved function of the elected members.  This is significant given what has been learned in Galway and the extent to which the elected members of Galway City Council were apparently kept in the dark with regard to water services developments in the city.  If the function is to be reserved, the elected members of the local authority will have to be in the frame.I regret that the Minister did not accept the Labour Party's amendments to provide for a legal right to water.  We need a legislative basis for the management and development of water services.  There is an urgent need to upgrade and modernise water services, as we have seen, and I am therefore prepared to agree to the passage of the Bill.There is an area of outstanding concern, however, that I ask the Minister to address.  The staffs of local authorities, particularly those working in the area of water services and their trade unions, are concerned about the development of the design, build and operate, DBO, process and the implications for employment and security of employment in this area.  Under the social partnership process, a mechanism should be established that would involve the social partners in discussions on how water services are to be provided, particularly with a view to reviewing the use of public private partnerships and DBO methods in their provision.

I regret that the Bill does not emphasise water conservation adequately.  We could change the building regulations to make low-flow taps a reality and harvest rainwater for domestic use.  This could be done now but progress has not been made.  I note with a raised eyebrow the proposals made by Fianna Fáil in its environmental policy.  I wonder why so many of the measures have not been implemented.I urge a note of caution about the emphasis on end of pipe solutions.  Many other countries bend over backwards to protect their watersheds and to allow water to flow from the mountains to the cities with minimal treatment or no treatment.  How can the city of New York provide much of its water with no treatment whatsoever?  They have protected those watersheds from development for more than 100 years and provided national parks around the lakes upstate and allowed clean, clear water to flow through aqueducts straight to the city of New York.I make a plea to the Minister in his last few hours or days of office to examine planning, forestry, farming and industry if he is returned as Minister.  He should ensure our watersheds, watercourses, reservoirs, lakes and streams are better protected from pollution.  There is an onus on us as consumers, farmers, foresters, industrialists and custodians of the land and waters we live on to protect the water.  This does not mean banning development but ensuring that development does not take place in sensitive locations so that we do not end up with the appalling spectre of what happened in many counties, including Galway.  Water is an elemental need and strikes a chord deep within us.  There is so much we can do to protect our watercourses and I am concerned we are not doing enough to protect our water at source.
#ArthurMorganSF	unknown-#ArthurMorganSF-party	unknown-#ArthurMorganSF-dob	unknown-#ArthurMorganSF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-04-25 00:00:00	Prelude	708	I conclude in the same fashion I began my contribution on Report Stage.  There are many positive elements in this Bill.  I acknowledge that the Minister accepted many changes to the Bill.  He did so by making many of the amendments suggested on Committee Stage his own.  This is a change from most Ministers, who bury their heads in the sand and march on.  I agree with Deputy Gilmore that it is a better Bill because of these changes.Unfortunately, there are a number of worrying elements in the Bill.  Privatisation came close to being settled but I remain worried about the difference between the transfer of an asset, which cannot happen, and the transfer of the use of an asset.  The latter is not prohibited in the Bill.  Therefore, there is a significant get-out clause for privatising the delivery of water services to domestic users.  I hope that is not the case but it is still on the cards and the privatisation issue can be carried through this Bill.  I oppose the Bill.The other issue is charges for the domestic supply of water.  These are not called water charges but the effect is the same.  I am concerned that the Bill provides for this.  As with privatisation, it is implicit rather than explicit and is most unfortunate.  While other Acts ban water charges this Bill is a sleight of hand, facilitating charging for water by another name.  It damages the good parts of the Bill, which is unfortunate.  This will be one of the concluding Bills of the 29th Dáil, we had an interesting debate on it and so much for that.

There are many good aspects to this Bill and the debate has been full, open and without personal rancour.The security and integrity of our water supply, free from contamination, is a key issue.  This Government missed a major opportunity in respect of waste water treatment plants throughout the country.  Serious problems with our sewage treatment plants were identified in a publication in April 2004.  This Government has spent a decreasing amount of money on waste water treatment.Treatment of sludge and the issues debated in Donabate, regarding the regional waste sludge treatment, are serious and must be addressed.  Everything has changed because of the contamination of the water supply in Galway.  It has had a profound impact on how people feel.  The next Dáil must address these issues in a serious way.  I welcome and support the passage of this Bill.
#MichaelDHiggins	unknown-#MichaelDHiggins-party	unknown-#MichaelDHiggins-dob	unknown-#MichaelDHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-04-25 00:00:00	Prelude	710	Having spoken on this Bill on Report Stage and noted the solid contributions on Committee Stage and the concerned speeches on Second Stage it is good that the Bill, in its limited sense, is being passed.  From its introduction until this evening it has been improved by contributions made and will assist, in a narrow sense, better water management.I repeat my urgent message on the wider issues discussed on Report Stage.  Whatever Minister has responsibility for these matters must return to the assumptions that guided the defeat of so much on Report Stage.  I refer not only to the issue of right, which was decided against us, but particularly to matters of intergenerational responsibilities.  In so far as this is Fifth Stage I will confine myself to this point.  A constitutional debate will eventually take place and a future Dáil will not be able to avoid it.  If actions that cannot be reversed take place, by commission or omission, a new jurisprudence is emerging that suggests one has a responsibility to future generations.It is my belief that Lough Corrib is dying and the necessary actions are not being taken.  I also believe that if this term of Government is followed by another in which responsibility is not given to a body that can take action against the major sources of pollution, be they related to irresponsible tree felling, agriculture or local authority action, future generations will read the history of the Corrib as a once clean water body.It is not that now.  I went to Galway in 1961 when the lake and the river were in much better condition than now.  I repeat this with no sense of acrimony, only a sense of urgency.  Diffuse authority across several agencies, in terms of monitoring and taking action, and across different areas of responsibility, be they in agriculture, fisheries or local authorities, does not serve as a model that can protect something that is important not just to this generation but to future generations.I am not making a party political point.  Often I have gone to public meetings where we began with an expression of concern but the public did not follow it up by supporting the strong measures necessary to protect something that belongs to future generations as much as to the present generation.  It is quite hypocritical to affect concern and then to seek escape by pointing a finger at another polluter.What has happened in Galway means that we cannot go back to the way we were.  Our issues in Galway are not simply those of solving an immediate problem, they are matters on which we must take action now if we are to resurrect something that is dying in front of us.  Anyone who looks at the aerial photography can see the polluted parts of the lake and the build up at its edges.  They can also see what is happening with the Clay River.  We are still far from effective action in terms of a legally integrated capacity to impose penalties that will be monitored and will ensure compliance.  I say that with no spirit of rancour as we pass legislation that will make a contribution but that is insufficient.It would be wrong if I did not point to the action that is needed for something that is so terribly important, not just in itself but in terms of its social impact, its history and its symbolic importance to Galway city.  No selfish view will suffice, there are many people whose actions have put the lake at risk.  Something that transcends these interests is necessary if we are to move out of the perilous position we are in now.  I hope the resources will be made available to make this Bill effective within its own parameters but I hope that whatever Minister is responsible in future will quickly introduce mechanisms to address the situation I have described.
#DickRoche	unknown-#DickRoche-party	unknown-#DickRoche-dob	unknown-#DickRoche-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-04-25 00:00:00	Prelude	711	I thank Deputies for their constructive contributions.  This is a significantly better Bill than the one that was introduced because I have listened to each and every one of the points made.  It is radical because for the first time the Bill establishes the Minister as the national authority for regulating the water sector — incredibly there was no central authority until the enactment of this Bill.  It gives the Minister of the day specific powers to direct the local authority in management and operational practice.  Amazingly, there is a gulf in existing law that will be bridged by this Bill.On monitoring and effective enforcement and control, Deputy Michael D. Higgins is right.  Until this legislation, responsibility for monitoring fell within the remit of local authorities but there was no real enforcement.  The EPA could and did in many excellent reports draw attention to the monitoring and, in Galway, on several occasions drew the at risk notices to the local authority's attention but nothing was done.  Now the EPA has supervisory and enforcement powers over all public water supplies, including supervision and monitoring by local authorities.  It can monitor the monitors, which is an important step forward.  The recent drinking water regulations already gave these powers to the EPA by ministerial regulation but this emphasises those powers.The most radical change is that the Bill will introduce a reserve function to the elected members of the council to ensure they know about and take the necessary action when water is at risk.Deputy Higgins is right, and I was moved by the eloquence of this point, that no single self-interest should be allowed to be above the common good and the protection of the water course is an important public responsibility.  It has not been discharged in the way it should be.  Serious lessons have been learned and are being legislated for and I thank the House for that.Water is a resource.  It must be conserved and valued.  We have always thought that water is free, it is just there.  We will not appreciate it until it is not there anymore, a realisation which has dawned in recent weeks.  I decided to give this as a reserve function a year before the outbreak in Galway but it was a good decision and I was supported by all sides of the House.  We have made a difference by passing that power to democratically elected councils.Specifically the Bill prohibits the privatisation of water as an asset.  Deputy Gilmore asked a searching question about who owns not just the assets, such as pipes and equipment, but who owns the water.  It also belongs to the people.A range of issues was raised.  There has been a phenomenal increase in the resources put into water.  We are a rich country and we should not have a situation where a city of 90,000 people must buy bottled water.  It can happen, there is a danger to any surface water process, it happens all over the world.  Surface water is prone to cryptosporidium infection and other parasites so we must put the resources in place.  The Government committed €3.7 billion in the national development plan that has just finished and has earmarked €4.7 billion for the current programme.  The resources are there and thanks to the good work on all sides, the legislation is in place.I thank Deputy O'Dowd for his many positive contributions.  I listened to him and took on board the contributions I could and the Bill is better as a result.  I also thank Deputy Gilmore.  We had a long and interesting debate that also strengthened the Bill.  Deputy Morgan made some interesting propositions, as did Deputy Cuffe.This is radical legislation that was long overdue.  There was criticism of the length of time it took to come to the House.  It is not an excuse but there are finite resources for the drafting of important legislation.  Due to the fact that I had accepted so many proposals made by all sides of the House I put significant pressure on the staff of my Department and the staff in the parliamentary draftsman's office.  I thank them for the work they have done and thank the House for supporting this important legislation

#DonnieCassidyFF	unknown-#DonnieCassidyFF-party	unknown-#DonnieCassidyFF-dob	unknown-#DonnieCassidyFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-04-25 00:00:00	Prelude	713	Scoil Diarmada is situated in the rural community of Whitehall, approximately three miles from Castlepollard in north Westmeath.  The school, comprising two classrooms, was built in 1958 and 14 years ago saw the addition of a third classroom in the form of a prefab to accommodate increasing numbers.  The numbers continue to increase due to the very high standard of teaching and dedication to excellence, which has prevailed through the years.Scoil Dhiarmada is based in a vibrant, supportive community, which places the school at its heart.  Proof of this is visible in the incredible work done by the local GAA hurling club, Greentown, adjacent to the school.  Through sheer hard work and community unity, the club has built a state-of-the-art amenities centre.  This centre is used by all ages in the community, including the children of Scoil Dhiarmada, which does not have an indoor physical education or general purpose room.If we are to support this and other enthusiastic rural communities fighting for their survival, we cannot ignore the most basic needs of the children, which include education in safe, modern, well-equipped schools.  Conditions at Scoil Dhiarmada do not reflect the presence of the Celtic tiger.  Indeed, the complete lack of basic investment in the school is blatantly and shockingly evident to any visitor.  Some of the problems being experienced daily by pupils, staff and parents include the tiling in the hall and toilets, which have been in place since it was built more than 50 years ago.  It is unsightly, unhygienic and dangerous due to chipping and lifting.  The walls in the classrooms, halls and bathrooms are covered in black mould.  Various treatments and repeated painting have not addressed the problem and are a waste of money.  The walls are not insulated.The sanitary ware is aged and decrepit.  Some of it seems to have been in place since the school was built.  Parents and teachers tell of young children refusing to go to the toilets because of the smell and conditions of the walls and floors.  Many parents spoke to me of children coming home wet or with kidney infections caused by their fear of using facilities at the school.  The classrooms in the main buildings are too small for the numbers of children in attendance.  At present there are 26 children in a room which is less than 36 sq. m in area.  The children must remain seated at their desks all day, as it is not safe for them to move around the room without falling over chairs and other children.  On wet days, they must remain seated throughout their break times.  Storage space is totally non-existent and children must leave their schoolbags in the hall.  Vermin are a constant problem despite vigorous pest control efforts.  On occasion the children have found mice in their lunch boxes.The prefab is over 14 years old and is at the end of an already extended lifespan.  The windows are single glazed and condensation is a constant problem.  Water streams down the windows and onto the walls, destroying the children's work and educational displays.  External walls are beginning to rot.  During frosty weather the water pipes freeze and children and teachers are left without water to flush the toilets or wash their hands for the duration.Staff facilities are non-existent and one staff toilet, for male and female teachers, is located behind the broom cupboard.  There is no staff room and staff use the senior classroom at break times and sit on the children's chairs.  The boys' cloakroom, which was being used as an office, is currently the resource teacher's classroom.  There is no place to meet parents privately to discuss confidential matters relating to the children's education and their future.  The girls' cloakroom is currently the learning support teacher's classroom.  Coats and PE gear are left hanging on scarce hooks and lunches are often stored on the ground in the hall.Scoil Dhiarmada has submitted two applications for grant aid under the small schools scheme, in 2002 and 2007.  Despite the urgent and obvious problems both applications were unsuccessful.   No representative from the school planning section of the Department of Education and Science visited the school to address the applications.  I regretfully have to bring this situation to the notice of the Minister in the dying hours of the 29th Dáil.As one who came in here in 1962, with my predecessor, Deputy Joe Kennedy, the Leas-Cheann Comhairle is the only person here who was a Member of the House at the time.  I wish him well, because this will probably be my last address to the House during the 29th Dáil.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-04-25 00:00:00	Prelude	714	I thank Deputy Cassidy for raising the matter as it provides me with the opportunity to outline to the House the current position in relation to Whitehall national school, County Westmeath.  The school has just 66 pupils and  has experienced an overall increase of 14% in enrolments during the past five years.  As Deputy Cassidy said, the school management authority made an application to the Department for major capital investment for additional accommodation which included an additional mainstream classroom and associated ancillary accommodation.  The application has been afforded a band 2 rating under the published prioritisation criteria.In addition, an application was submitted by the school management under the devolved scheme for this year.  Due to the volume of applications under this scheme it was not possible to allocate funding to all projects on this occasion.  The school can, of course, reapply for next year's scheme.I note that the school authority has not applied for any capital funding under the Department's summer works scheme which has been advertised on an annual basis since 2004.  The scheme is designed to fund applications such as electrical, mechanical, window projects, roof replacement, structural repairs, etc., projects which can be delivered over a short period of time, in particular while the schools are on their summer break.  Some of the issues mentioned by the Deputy, for example toilets, are a specific category under the summer works scheme, and I am somewhat surprised the school did not apply under this heading.  Other issues raised by the Deputy such as windows could have been addressed in this way, too, as indeed could the roof replacement project.  The Department will be announcing details of the 2008 scheme in the coming months and I would urge the school to apply under this scheme.  This year about 1,000 schools will have summer works projects undertaken.Issues in relation to environmental health are matters for the environmental health officers in the local authority and it is critically important for the school to contact them immediately if it is experiencing the type of difficulties outlined by the Deputy.I thank Deputy Cassidy for raising this matter.  I hope the school will be able to take the advice and benefit from the summer works scheme, but of course, its application next year for the devolved grant will also be considered.

#MichaelRing	unknown-#MichaelRing-party	unknown-#MichaelRing-dob	unknown-#MichaelRing-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-04-25 00:00:00	Prelude	717	Midfield national school applied for a renovation extension in 1997-98.  The school had three teachers and 75 pupils.  In 1999 funding was sanctioned for Midfield, which was given to proceed.  A design team was appointed, architects viewed the building and agreed it was unsuitable, inadequate and outdated.  Funding of €25,831 was spent on professional and associated fees.  Then the project was shelved.  It was advised to apply under the small schools scheme in March 2007 and that application was refused.I recently visited the school.  The classroom, heating, sewerage, roof, windows, toilets and play area are all inadequate.  It is a disgrace.  All the facilities are sub-standard.  There is no staff room, principal's office, learning support room, physical education or general purpose room or storage area.  If it was any other business but education, the school would be closed down on health and safety grounds.This is a small school with three teachers and 75 pupils and this is what rural Ireland is all about.  The parents are outraged, as is the community.  There was never so much funding in the country and yet here is a school in which children are being educated in sub-standard conditions.  The time has come for this school to be sanctioned, the funding put in place and for the teachers and pupils to share a proper educational environment.  What is taking place is wrong and I ask the Minister for good news for the Midfield pupils and the school's principal and teachers.The time has come for the Minister to do something with this school.  If we want people to live in rural Ireland we must have the schools and facilities for them to be educated in proper conditions.  I am hoping the Minister will have good news for me tonight and for Midfield and the people of Mayo, in sanctioning funding this small school once and for all because the people concerned have worked in terrible conditions.
#BeverleyCooperFlynn	unknown-#BeverleyCooperFlynn-party	unknown-#BeverleyCooperFlynn-dob	unknown-#BeverleyCooperFlynn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-04-25 00:00:00	Prelude	718	I have already spoken to the Minister for Education and Science about this project.  I hope the school can be given a realistic assessment of its position as it has been led astray over the past several years.In 1999, the school was sanctioned for a schools building project and a design team was appointed.  It was instructed to proceed to stage 2 in June 2000.  In May 2002, the Department wrote to the board of management and advised that the design team had succeeded in bringing the project within the Department's guidelines but that the overall costs had increased from what had been originally anticipated.  The Department requested the design team to reassess the project with a view to significantly reducing the cost.The Minister may ask why the school did not apply for a grant under the summer works scheme.  It did not apply because it believed that it was only a matter of sanctioning the moneys to enable the extensions and alterations to go ahead.  Surprisingly, in 2006 the Department asked the school to apply through the devolved grant scheme.  In 2007, for the first time it applied for the scheme even when it had already been sanctioned in 1999.  The school has appealed the decision.  Does it have any realistic chance of succeeding this year?  If not, at least we can then inform the school to get its act in order and proceed in 2008 with a realistic objective.  If the Minister is clear on this, it would put the minds of parents, teachers and pupils at rest, as they are very anxious about this situation.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-04-25 00:00:00	Prelude	719	I thank Deputies Ring and Cooper-Flynn for raising this matter.  The Deputies will appreciate that despite €540 million being spent this year on school building projects, there are 4,000 schools in the State.  Ensuring that we modernise and provide schools in rapidly growing areas is a priority.  In the next several years, €4.5 billion will be invested in our schools.  This year, 1,500 schools will have building projects undertaken.The original application from Midfield national school applied for an extension and refurbishment to provide improved ancillary accommodation such as resource rooms and general purpose rooms.  Priority is always given to schools with increasing numbers seeking additional accommodation.  As the original application did not include an application for additional mainstream classrooms, it was given a lower priority rating.  Subsequently, the application was changed and submitted under the small schools scheme for additional mainstream accommodation.  Unfortunately, this year the volume of applications received meant it was not possible to allocate funding to all of the different projects.  Midfield national school was not successful on this occasion but it has appealed the decision.  That appeal is under active consideration by the planning and building section of the Department.  The school will be notified in due course as to the decision.

We were asked at the meeting to address this issue urgently and separate from the forthcoming general election.There is an urgent need for the Minister for Education and Science to take such measures as will immediately lead to meeting the needs of hearing impaired children in the Galway area.  Such measures must include the restoration of the service which has been suspended for five years and the appointment of two visiting teachers to be notified to schools and parents before the end of the current school year.There is a further need for the Minister of State with responsibility for children to secure the rights of hearing impaired children in the Galway area, through an instruction to the HSE to recruit an audiological scientist and, if necessary, to fill such a position by immediate, appropriate advertisements in Ireland, Britain and other countries.  If the rights of the child are to be vindicated, it will require the action of the Minister of State with responsibility for children to break through any cap that may exist on remuneration and conditions that would enable the post of research audiologist to be filled.At the recent meeting, it was very moving to hear of parents' experience in this area.  I found some aspects of what hearing impaired children must go through to be unsatisfactory and deeply distressing.  For a start, there is an excessively long wait for diagnosis.  People gave examples of individual cases of a diagnosis taking one year and then having to wait another year for hearing aids.  It is appalling that in 2007 the capacity to replace lost or damaged hearing aids does not exist.  In one case, there was no programming available for a digital hearing aid.  The full-time permanent audiologist who retired in 2002 was not replaced.  A visiting teacher for the deaf retired in 2004 and the service fell apart.Hundreds of children are being deprived of a service.  Three years ago it was agreed there was a need for six visiting teachers but there is still no service.  Two visiting teachers for hearing impaired children should be appointed and the post for the audiological scientist should be advertised with such conditions as to make it attractive to an applicant.Research on ensuring children's equality in education and opportunity states that the earlier the intervention, the better the result.  The current situation is depriving the children involved of a fundamental learning right and self-development.  I do not want a recitation of the work of additional resource teachers being applied in schools.  The resource teachers are not trained in this particular area and it is unfair to expect them to deliver a service they do not have the capacity to deliver.  Will the Minister discuss with the Minister of State, Deputy Brian Lenihan, the rights base of taking exceptional measures that will address the fundamental breach of the educational, social and developmental rights of these hearing impaired children?
#PaddyMcHughIND	unknown-#PaddyMcHughIND-party	unknown-#PaddyMcHughIND-dob	unknown-#PaddyMcHughIND-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-04-25 00:00:00	Prelude	722	Some 320 hearing impaired children in Galway have been neglected by the Government for the past five years.  That is some legacy for the Government after its five years in power during the Celtic tiger era when its coffers were full.  Up to 120 of these children have been assessed to a degree but are being deprived of services, while a further 300 children are waiting to be assessed.  Some of these children have been waiting for an assessment since 2002. I wish to set out clearly what is required in this situation so that the Government, particularly the Minister for Education and Science, and the Minister with responsibility for children know what is needed so that action can be taken immediately to right this wrong which has been perpetrated against 320 children in Galway, against many of them for the past five years.A full-time audiologist scientist is required immediately.  This position has been vacant for the past five years and the children of Galway have suffered as a result.  There is a hit and miss, piecemeal service where a person comes from Kilkenny four days per month.  That is totally unsatisfactory and inadequate.  The position was advertised twice in the past five years, which is absolutely unbelievable.  This is criminal and clearly indicates the HSE has no commitment to filling this post.  I understand the position advertised was for an audiologist and for a six-month contract.  This is a further indication of the lip service being paid to this problem.What is required in Galway is an audiologist scientist, not an audiologist, and the position is required to be filled on a full-time basis, not for a six-month period.  If one was to adopt the staffing levels employed in the UK, what is required in Galway are three audiologist scientists, not just one.  I ask the Minister for Health and Children to act immediately to direct the HSE to recruit one audiologist scientist now to begin a service of sorts and then let us begin planning for the recruitment of the further two audiologist scientists required for delivery of a comprehensive service to the children of Galway.Two visiting teachers are required.  The Minister for Education and Science has been neglectful in attending to her duties in this regard.  One full-time teacher who was in place retired from the position in 2004.  Effectively, that position has remained vacant since that time, except for a period of approximately six months.  The role of the visiting teacher is vital not only in visiting schools and offering advice to teachers but also in visiting pre-school children in their homes and offering support, advice and guidance to parents.  Geographically, Galway is a very large county and definitely needs at least two visiting teachers now.  The Minister has direct responsibility and she should act now, live up to her responsibilities and ensure the two teachers are appointed.In September 2006, an advertisement appeared in a national newspaper seeking applications for the visiting teacher service.  What happened after that?  Did the advertisement elicit applications?  If not, were further efforts made?  Were applications invited from outside the country?The ultimate question is why the Government is depriving 320 children of a basic service.  Parents are concerned that if this neglect continues, children with hearing problems may end up with serious personal and social issues in adulthood.  Will the Government allow that to happen or will it live up to its responsibilities and act immediately to ensure the audiologist scientist and the two visiting teachers are appointed now?
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-04-25 00:00:00	Prelude	723	I thank Deputies Michael D. Higgins and McHugh for raising this matter.An objective of the Department of Education and Science is to provide a national visiting teacher service for hearing impaired students.  This service is available from pre-school to third level.  The national caseload is monitored and managed by the Department on an annual basis and a best fit of resources to needs is achieved to the extent possible.  Since 2004 the Department has engaged in a recruitment campaign nationally to ensure that hearing impaired students in every county have access to a suitably qualified visiting teacher.  The visiting teacher service is managed within the directorate of regional services of the Department.  Currently, there are 27 visiting teachers for the hearing impaired in post, with two vacancies.I assure the Deputies that the visiting teacher service in the Galway area has never been suspended by the Department of Education and Science.  The post of visiting teacher for the hearing impaired for Galway city and county was filled in 2005.  The teacher appointed opted to transfer to Dublin in 2006.  In 2006, the Department offered the post in Galway to a candidate who subsequently declined to take it up.  The directorate of regional services is now in the process of preparing to recruit two visiting teachers for the wider Galway city and county area and adjacent counties, and advertisements to this effect are being prepared for the national and international press.In addition, for the first time, an advertisement will be placed with a source in the United Kingdom dedicated to recruitment of professionals in the education of hearing impaired children.  On foot of this competition, it is intended that successful candidates will take up post in September of this year and parents and the relevant schools will be duly notified.In the meantime, my Department, through its western regional office, has continued to provide priority cover at all times in Galway through the visiting teacher service in neighbouring counties.

Where a national of an EU State with a family is working in Ireland, the worker is entitled to payment of such benefits, even if the children are resident in the worker's home country.Applications for family benefits from EU migrant workers who come to live in Ireland with their families are dealt with under domestic legislation. Entitlement to Child Benefit is based on the applicant satisfying the habitual residence condition and the child being ordinarily resident in Ireland.Currently there are over 38,000 EU nationals in receipt of Child Benefit for 67,500 children who are resident with them in Ireland. Of these recipients, some 17,400 are UK nationals, with a further 13,800 recipients from the ten States that joined the EU in 2004 and 2,500 families from Romania or Bulgaria.EU nationals who come to work in Ireland but whose families remain in their home country may have an entitlement to family benefits in Ireland under EU Regulation 1408/71. Before payment of Child Benefit is made for non-resident children it is necessary to contact the authorities in the country of residence of the children to confirm details and establish what, if any, family benefits are payable there.This process can take a number of months to complete and, as a result, the number of claims that have been finalised to date is relatively small. There are approximately 17,000 claims at various stages of processing and awaiting finalisation. The number of claims to Child Benefit and potentially Early Child Supplement in respect of non-resident children of EU nationals has, since the start of 2006, averaged close to 300 per week. However, over the past 4 weeks, the figure dropped to around 200 per week.Child Benefit is in payment under EU regulations to 721 families, in respect of 1,663 children resident outside of the Republic of Ireland. Some 87% of these children are resident in the UK.The total child benefit expenditure for EU migrants with non-resident children in respect of 2007 is estimated at €85m or 3.9% of overall child benefit expenditure.The total cost in 2008 is difficult to estimate but on current trends, the potential accrued cost could be of the order of €130m.The corresponding figures for early childcare supplement are €17m in respect of 2007 and €30m in respect of 2008.

There are no backlogs on these schemes.In respect of the State Pension (Transition) and State Pension (Contributory) which my Department also administers, backlogs have arisen for a variety of reasons.Delays have been incurred in processing claims in recent months, as a result of:an increase in the numbers of new claims received since the start of the year,the implementation in September 2006 of a number of scheme enhancements introduced in Budget 2006,an unusually high level of staff turnover in the areas concerned, andthe implementation of the new Service Delivery Modernisation Programme.Currently some 2,700 claims where the person has passed the pension age are awaiting decision. There is a delay of 4 weeks approximately in respect of these cases. Some 3,600 claims in respect of foreign applications are awaiting decision. These claims are usually made after pension age has been reached and involve enquires regarding employment in other jurisdictions. A further 2,400 cases in the course of being processed are awaiting further information before a decision can be made. Finally, 2,800 cases have been received in respect of people who have not yet reached pension age.A number of actions have been taken to eliminate the delays in processing claims. Priority is given to cases where the person has reached or will shortly reach pension age. Additional temporary staff have been assigned to these pensions sections to speed up claim processing. Staff have been redeployed to the areas experiencing delays. Progress is being made in eliminating delays and it is expected that processing times for new claims will to improve.

In all other cases an application must be made at a local office of my Department. When applying for a PPSN, individuals are asked to complete an application form and to provide documentation to establish their identity and their address. They are usually informed of their PPSN by post within five days.In early January, following the accession of Romania to the EU, officials of my Department's Local Office at North Cumberland Street, Dublin, became suspicious about the unusually high proportion of citizens of Romania who stated in applications for PPSNs that their Irish address was one or other of a number of hostels in Dublin 1.When these applicants were interviewed it emerged that they had been given incorrect information and advice about the PPSN allocation system by another Irish-resident Romanian citizen, who also provided them with an interpretation service and who was charging for these services. It also emerged that people were being aided or persuaded to mislead the Department about their actual addresses in Ireland.The existence of this practice was reported to An Garda Síochána for investigation and any follow-up action they consider appropriate in the event that evidence of a breach or breaches of the law is brought to light.My Department issued a statement on 29 January in order to prevent further exploitation of citizens of Romania. The statement, which was specifically aimed at Romanian citizens, outlined the process involved in applying for a PPSN and informed them that my Department does not charge for the issue of these numbers. It also confirmed that, where necessary, translation and interpretation services are provided free of charge. A copy of this statement, in the Romanian language, was posted on my Department's website, which is the most conveniently accessible and trusted source of information on these matters. Copies of the statement, in English and in Romanian are displayed in Local Offices of the Department. Arrangements were also made with the Chaplain to the Romanian Community in Dublin to have this information announced at religious services in the city.
#SeamusBrennan	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-party	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-dob	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-04-25 00:00:00	Prelude	727	Information on poverty and deprivation levels is now derived from the annual EU Survey on Income and Living Conditions (EU–SILC). This survey commenced in Ireland in 2003 and is conducted by the Central Statistics Office (CSO). The most recent results, for the year 2005, record continuing positive trends in relation to poverty and social exclusion. The overall rate of consistent poverty in 2005 was 7.0 per cent, having reduced from 8.8 per cent in 2003. These results show the continuing impact being made by the greatly increased resources now devoted to social welfare and other social services.The consistent poverty measure was developed independently by the Economic and Social Research Institute (ESRI) in 1987 using indicators of deprivation based on standards of living at that time. This measure identifies the proportion of people, from those with less than 60 per cent of median income, who are deprived of one or more goods or services considered essential for a basic standard of living. The target set in 2002 was to reduce the numbers of those who are consistently poor to 2 per cent by 2007 and, if possible, to eliminate consistent poverty, as then defined.Progress in reducing consistent poverty was tracked by the Living in Ireland Survey (LIIS), which was showing steady progress towards meeting the target of reducing consistent poverty to 2 per cent by 2007. However, a major discontinuity occurred with the new EU Survey on Income and Living Conditions (EU-SILC), introduced from 2003. This survey yielded a substantially higher level of consistent poverty which was contrary to the trends under the Living in Ireland survey. There was no change in policy or in its implementation that could have explained this increase and it is acknowledged by the CSO and the ESRI that it resulted from certain changes in methodology between the surveys.As a result it is not possible to compare trends in consistent poverty over the periods covered by the two surveys. However, the continuing low levels of unemployment and the substantially increased resources devoted to social welfare and other social services support the view that the downward trend in consistent poverty over the 6 years period from 8.3 per cent in 1994 to 4.1 per cent in 2001, would have continued, and that over the following 6 years up to 2007 the 2 per cent target would have been reached, using the LIIS survey method. What is also clear is that some 250,000 people, including 100,000 children, have been lifted out of deprivation since 1997 as a result of concentrated and targeted measures and supports.The overall goal of the new National Action Plan for Social Inclusion 2007-2016 (NAPinclusion), launched last February, is to make a decisive impact on consistent poverty. This is underlined by the fact that a new target is being set using an updated set of indicators, which is more realistic and in keeping with living standards today. The new target is to reduce the number of those experiencing consistent poverty to between 2 per cent and 4 per cent by 2012, with the aim of eliminating consistent poverty by 2016, under the revised definition. Progress in achieving the target will also be measured by the EU SILC survey method conducted by the CSO which will facilitate the analysis of trends on an annual basis.The Government in setting the new poverty reduction target has accepted the advice of the ESRI to use an updated set of deprivation indicators, which focus to a greater degree on items reflecting social inclusion and participation in society. This will see the current measure, based on lacking one or more items from an 8-item index, changing to one based on lacking two or more items from an 11-item index. This revised set of indicators will be used to measure consistent poverty over the course of the new NAPinclusion. The current rate of consistent poverty using the new measure is 7.0 per cent.Continuing to reduce consistent poverty and eventually eliminating it is one of our primary goals. I am confident that the new NAPinclusion will build on the major achievements of the last decade by putting the measures and resources in place to realise that goal.

Overall the review concluded that the scheme has, over the years, met its objective of guaranteeing that every person in the State has a minimum level of income sufficient to meet their basic day to day needs.In the case of rent supplement, the report recommends that the implementation of the rental assistance arrangements announced by Government in July 2004 should be pursued. In addition to improving the housing situation for people on low incomes and delivering better value for money, full implementation of these arrangements would allow the rent supplement scheme return to its original objective of being a short-term income support scheme, with fewer than half of the current number of recipients.The review identified a number of issues relating to the incentives under the rent supplement scheme for those wishing to take up an employment opportunity.  In Budget 2007 I specifically addressed this issue when I announced improvements in the additional income disregards for those taking up employment or training, namely, that any person who is on a local authority waiting list for accommodation under the Rental Accommodation Scheme may now return to full-time employment and be considered for a rent supplement payment under the standard means test. This new system replaces the existing special retention arrangements, that where a person is aged 65 or over and his or her combined household income is greater than the rate of supplementary welfare allowance appropriate to his or her circumstances, this no longer leads to a reduction in the amount of rent or mortgage interest supplement payable.These are significant improvements to the rent supplement scheme. They both simplify the current assessment process and offer clear incentives to those returning to work.Under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme, an exceptional or urgent needs payment may be made to help meet an essential, once-off cost which the applicant is unable to meet out of his/her own resources. There is no automatic entitlement to this payment; each application is determined by the Executive based on the particular circumstances of the case.The review of the supplementary welfare allowance scheme carried out a detailed examination of expenditure and recipient trends for all elements of the scheme. The Group identified variations in the amount of expenditure per thousand of population in respect of exceptional needs payments but considered that such variations were likely to occur as these payments are made on the basis of a person's need and it was reasonable to expect that such needs would not occur uniformly across the country.The Working Group also examined the average value of exceptional needs payments throughout the country in relation to the various different types of exceptional and urgent needs payments and found variations in the levels of payments that could not be explained by geographical cost factors.  Decisions relating to the amount to be paid in respect of any exceptional need a person may have are a matter for the Health Service Executive which administers the scheme on my behalf.The Executive is obliged, in accordance with the guidelines published by my Department, to maintain up-to-date policies in relation to the implementation of these guidelines, including up-to-date prices for items that are likely to be the subject of applications for ENPs. The Working Group noted that the various areas of the Executive showed some variations in the type of policies, including the level of detail of guidance, the types of payments covered and amount to be paid.  While noting this, I am conscious that the discretionary nature of the payments, which is a positive aspect of the scheme, is in itself a contributing factor to the variation in the level of payments.  My Department will continue to monitor these payments.
#SeamusBrennan	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-party	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-dob	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-04-25 00:00:00	Prelude	729	My Department is currently undertaking an examination of the impact of the payment of Disability Allowance from age 16 on retention rates in second level education. Following the outcome of this review, consideration will be given to a further review of other aspects of the scheme.The current review is part of the implementation of the recommendations of the working group which examined the various State income maintenance payments for people who are ill and people with disabilities under the Government's Expenditure Review Initiative. This working group was chaired by my Department, with membership from the Department of Health and Children and the Department of Finance and the report was published in 2004. Disability Allowance was one of the schemes reviewed in this process and the recommendations arising from this report continue to be implemented.In this regard a number of significant changes have recently been made to the Disability Allowance scheme which has included extending the eligibility of the scheme, improving employment incentives for people with disabilities and improving the means test.As part of Budget 2007, people who had entered residential care without an entitlement to Disability Allowance became eligible for full Disability Allowance as a matter of right, subject only to the same conditions as apply to others.In order to improve the employment incentives for people of working age and, as part of the Social Welfare Budget package, 2006, I introduced a new lower withdrawal rate of Disability Allowance, effective from 1 June 2006.This change means that, for earnings above €120 and under €350 per week, Disability Allowance is now withdrawn at 50 cents for every euro earned, rather than the previous euro for euro withdrawal. In practice, this means that a single person can earn up to €420 per week before their Disability Allowance fully ceases, compared with the previous amount of €240 per week.The policy in relation to supporting employment incentives for people with disabilities will continue to be kept under review in my Department and developed in line with the commitments in my Department's disability sectoral plan.As with other social assistance payments, capital held by a client in receipt of Disability Allowance is assessable for the purpose of the means test. However, I recognise that persons in receipt of Disability Allowance may not have had the opportunity to accumulate savings or other income through participation in employment and that disability may, in some cases, hamper a person's ability to live independently.I am also aware that in such circumstances, families may wish to make future financial provision for a child or sibling but are concerned that such provision might adversely affect their entitlement to Disability Allowance. Similarly, in cases where a compensation award has been made to a client as a result of accident or injury, they may be concerned about a reduction or loss of payment of DA and secondary benefits.As part of Budget 2007, I therefore introduced a higher threshold of €50,000 as the capital disregard specifically for the Disability Allowance scheme. This means that a client with disability may hold this amount of capital or provision can be made for the client up to this amount while retaining full payment of Disability Allowance.Further policy development of the Disability Allowance scheme will be considered in light of the outcome of the current research project and other aspects of the scheme.

All carers in receipt of carer's allowance and carers of people in receipt of constant attendance or prescribed relative's allowance, regardless of their age, also receive a free travel pass. It is also available to people under age 66 who are in receipt of certain disability type welfare payments, such as disability allowance, invalidity pension and blind person's pension. People resident in the State who are in receipt of a social security invalidity or disability payment from a country covered by EU Regulations, or from a country with which Ireland has a bilateral social security agreement, and who have been in receipt of this payment for at least 12 months, are also eligible for free travel.There have been a number of requests and enquiries in relation to the extension of entitlement to free travel in Ireland to Irish born people living outside Ireland, or to those in receipt of pensions from my Department, particularly in the UK, when they return to Ireland for a visit.I have been advised that it would not be possible to extend entitlement to free travel simply to Irish born people living abroad as to do so would be contrary to European legislation which prohibits discrimination on the grounds of nationality. More recently, the European Commission has indicated that to extend the scheme to people in receipt of an Irish pension could also be considered discriminatory.I have raised the issue with Commissioner Špidla and officials from my Department met with European Commission officials on a number of occasions in an effort to clarify the legal issues involved. I am keeping this issue under review.
#SeamusBrennan	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-party	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-dob	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-04-25 00:00:00	Prelude	731	I propose to take Questions Nos. 47, 56, 65, 70, 75, 82, 83 and 90 together.The Money Advice and Budgeting Service (MABS) provides assistance to people who are over-indebted and need help and advice in coping with debt problems. There are 53 independent companies nationwide employing some 230 money advice staff including Money Advisors, Co-ordinators, and Administrators who deliver the service at a local level.The credit union movement has been a key partner in MABS since its inception and their involvement and support is central to the development and success of the service. Other voluntary and statutory bodies, such as the Society of St. Vincent de Paul, the Community Welfare Service, Citizens Information Centres, Centres for the Unemployed and local authorities work closely with the programme. The National Traveller MABS which employs 4 staff, has a specific remit to provide education and promote awareness about Traveller issues. It does not provide a direct money advice service to people. Instead it supports Travellers in linking into the local MABS network.Last year, MABS provided services to some 12,500 new clients throughout the country. The number of active cases at the end of the year was some 14,900. The demand for the service can be attributed to the increase in the availability of credit generally and to the quality of the service provided by MABS advisors.In 2006, €16.4 million was provided to fund the service and in 2007 I have further increased the annual allocation to €17.67 million to assist the MABS in dealing with its workload. The issues that give rise to problems of over-indebtedness are highly complex.The cost and availability of credit for people on low incomes and the barriers they face in accessing mainstream and cheap forms of credit add to the difficulties people on low incomes encounter in managing their finances. I am particularly concerned about the high level of interest rates currently being charged by some financial institutions, loan companies and by legal moneylenders in situations where people have no alternative sources of credit available to them. My concerns, in this regard, are borne out by the Financial Regulator's Report on the Licensed Moneylending Industry published last week. It shows that moneylenders may be charging interest rates of up to 188%. Most significantly, 71% of people surveyed did not know what interest they were paying on their loans.I have held discussions with a number of interests including the Irish League of Credit Unions, the Irish Bankers Federation and the Financial Regulator about these issues. The outcome of these consultations, the latest report of the Financial Regulator together with the Combat Poverty Study ‘Financial Exclusion in Ireland' and the statistical data now emerging from the new MABSIS information system will make a significant contribution to our knowledge about the problems of debt in Ireland. They provide a solid evidence base on which to develop the strategies that need to be put in place by both the Government and the providers of payment services such as the banks and credit unions to promote greater financial inclusion in Ireland.Proposals to establish the MABS on a statutory basis will be considered by the Government in the near future. My intention in this regard is to build on the best features of the MABS model of service to the public and to include measures to address concerns about excessive loan charges for people on low incomes. I want to combine a continuation of local voluntary involvement with strong national leadership and ensure a high quality, coordinated budgeting and advice service for the future, in particular for people on low incomes.I envisage a number of specific actions to address some of the issues that leave people on low incomes vulnerable to high cost credit charges. The regulation of moneylending comes under the Consumer Credit Act, 1995 and the licensing of moneylenders is a statutory responsibility of the Financial Regulator. My view is that the MABS has a key role to play in informing the licensing process in these circumstances. Officials of my Department have been working closely with the Financial Regulator and with the Department of Finance on the detailed arrangements which might be put in place to achieve this.The support structure put in place by my Department for the MABS in recent years has worked well for clients of the service, for local management and for the staff. The MABS is highly regarded and successful in meeting the needs of its clients.I also want to take account of best practice in corporate governance for a customer focused service that provides value for money for the taxpayers' investment and meets the challenges posed by the rapidly changing face of debt in 21st century Ireland.  I will arrange to have a schedule of the details of the 53 MABS services placed before the House.
#SeamusBrennan	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-party	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-dob	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-04-25 00:00:00	Prelude	732	My Department through its various social insurance and assistance schemes provides income supports to people to meet their basic living needs, including food, clothing, heat and light.Supplements are also payable in certain circumstances for specific needs, for example, fuel allowances, rent supplements, living alone allowance for older people or the household benefits package for pensioners, eligible disabled people and carers. Where people on low incomes have particular medical conditions or dietary requirements, diet supplements are available through the supplementary welfare allowance scheme which is administered on my behalf by the Community Welfare division of the Health Service Executive. It is expected that expenditure on diet supplements will amount to €6 million this year and benefit over 10,700 people.My Department also provides funding for school meals through two programmes, the urban school meals scheme and the local projects scheme. The urban school meals scheme operates in conjunction with certain local authorities and is co-funded by my Department. The local projects scheme provides funding to secondary, national, pre-schools and community groups in both urban and rural areas who provide school meals.For families with school-going children, school meals can make a real and important contribution to ensuring that children receive better nutrition. Such services can also contribute to improved school attendance and quality of learning. Expenditure on the schools meals programme for 2006 was €13.6 million and benefited some 125,000 pupils in some 1,400 schools. I have provided €16.6m for the school meals scheme in 2007 and my Department is actively promoting the scheme to schools that are not already participating.A report entitled "Food Poverty and Policy" published in 2004 by the Combat Poverty Agency, Crosscare and the Society of St Vincent de Paul defined food poverty as "the inability to access a nutritionally adequate diet and the related impacts on health, culture and social participation". The Healthy Food for All Initiative awareness campaign followed on from the Food Poverty and Policy report. My Department is currently involved with that initiative in plans to draw up a best practice code for school meals.Healthy eating is affected by dietary and nutritional awareness, household attitudes and access to good quality grocery shopping, as well as to the adequacy of social welfare income supports. In recent years, budgetary increases in social welfare payment rates have consistently exceeded increases in the cost of living. This key policy is the primary focus of Budget allocations to my Department each year, and it has helped ensure that those depending on social welfare experience real improvement in their ability to meet their basic needs, including provision of adequate food, heating, etc.In this regard, consumer price index information from the Central Statistics Office indicates that the cost of food and non-alcoholic beverages has increased by 0.8% over the past 12 months. From December 2001 to date, food and non-alcoholic beverages increased by just 4.1% in aggregate while increases in social welfare payment rates increased by between 61% and 77% in the same period. As overall total inflation amounted to less than 20% in that period there has been a very significant real increase in purchasing power for people on social welfare.I am satisfied that the policy of providing substantial real increases in primary social insurance and assistance payment rates has been effective in ensuring that those who depend on social welfare income have sufficient income for healthy food.
#SeamusBrennan	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-party	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-dob	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-04-25 00:00:00	Prelude	733	My Department provides a wide range of second chance education opportunities to facilitate people on certain social welfare payments to improve their skills and qualifications and, therefore, their prospects of returning to the active work force.The back to education allowance (BTEA) is one of these second chance education opportunities schemes. It is paid at a standard weekly rate equivalent to the maximum rate of the relevant social welfare payment that qualifies the applicant for participation in the scheme. It essentially replaces their existing social welfare income and in addition an annual €400 cost of education allowance is payable.To qualify for participation an applicant must,  inter alia, be in receipt of a relevant social welfare payment and at least 21 years of age prior to commencing an approved course of study. Persons in receipt of disability related payments may access the scheme at 18 years of age.Similarly, lone parents and persons in receipt of unemployment payments can qualify at 18 years of age provided they are out of formal education for at least 2 years.The current scheme is in place since January 1998 and has been subject to review and modification over the years to ensure it continues to support those people who are most distant from the labour market and whose need is greatest.In the 2005 Budget I reduced the qualifying period for access to the third level option of the scheme from 15 to 12 months and at that time I also increased the annual cost of education allowance, paid to people on BTEA, from €254 to €400.Following an undertaking to the Dáil and the Social Affairs Committee, I further reduced the qualifying period for access to the third level option to 9 months. This provision applies to persons who are participating in the National Employment Action Plan (NEAP) process where a FÁS Employment Services Officer recommends pursuance of a third level course of study as essential to the enhancement of the individual's employment prospects. This new provision also came into effect from 1 September 2005.In the 2006 Budget, I announced that time spent in receipt of supplementary welfare allowance from the Health Services Executive or the direct provision system operated by the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform can count towards the qualifying period for back to education allowance in circumstances where the person establishes an entitlement to a relevant social welfare payment prior to commencing an approved course of study. This provision came into effect from 1 September 2006.In the most recent Budget, I announced that people who are awarded statutory redundancy may access the BTEA scheme immediately provided an entitlement to a relevant social welfare payment is established prior to commencing an approved course of study. I also reduced the qualifying period for illness benefit recipients from three to two years. These further improvements to the BTEA scheme will come into effect from the beginning of the new academic year, that is, 1 September 2007.I will continue to monitor the scheme but I believe that, overall, the current arrangements provide that my Department's back to education allowance scheme continues to meet its objectives and ensures that limited resources are targeted at those who are most in need.

These two reports built on the earlier report of the Board on the National Pensions Policy Initiative (NPPI), published in 1998.This Green Paper will take account of these reports and examine the situation in a much broader way to deal with issues raised in the partnership talks, such as the operation of the funding standard for defined benefit schemes, together with a comprehensive look at issues in relation to social welfare pensions which arise from time to time, both here in the House and in representations which I receive. The Green Paper will not recommend any particular course of action but rather set out clearly the current situation and the implications, from an economic and social perspective, of various courses of action which have been suggested.  The Green Paper will be published when the Government has completed its consideration of the wide range of issues involved.The publication of the Green Paper will be the initial move in a series of measures which are to culminate in the Government publishing a framework for long-term pensions policy. A consultation process, which will be comprehensive and inclusive, will be decided on when the Green Paper is published.
#SeamusBrennan	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-party	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-dob	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-04-25 00:00:00	Prelude	735	I propose to take Questions Nos. 51, 57, 58, 86, 87, 93 and 185 together.Supporting and recognising carers in our society is and has been a priority of the Government since 1997. Over that period, weekly payment rates to carers have been greatly increased, qualifying conditions for carer's allowance have been significantly eased, coverage of the scheme has been extended and new schemes such as carer's benefit and the respite care grant have been introduced and extended.The Joint Oireachtas Committee on Social and Family Affairs "Report on the Position of Full Time Carers" which was published in 2003 makes fifteen recommendations. Some of these relate specifically to my Department and others relate specifically to the Department of Health and Children.  The report recommended abolition of the means test for carer's allowance. In line with other social assistance schemes, a means test is applied to the carer's allowance so as to ensure that limited resources are directed to those in greatest need. This means test has been eased significantly over the years, most notably with the disregard of spouse's earnings.Following Budget 2007, from this month the income disregard for a couple has been set at €640 per week. This ensures that a couple can earn in the region of €36,000 per annum and still receive the maximum rate of carer's allowance and the associated free travel and household benefits. This measure surpasses the "Towards 2016" commitment to ensure that those on average industrial earnings continue to qualify for a full carer's allowance. In addition, I have increased the rates of carer's allowance to €200 per week for those aged under 66 and to €218 per week for those aged over 66.Another of the recommendations was that where a person is in receipt of a widow or widower's pension and providing someone with full time care and attention, that person should be paid a half rate carer's allowance in addition to his or her pension. In Budget 2007 I was very pleased to introduce fundamental structural reforms in this area which go beyond this recommendation.  From September 2007, people in receipt of certain other social welfare payments, who are also providing full time care and attention to a person, will be able to retain t heir main welfare payment and receive another payment, depending on their means, the maximum of which will be the equivalent of a half rate carer's allowance. It is estimated that this measure will benefit approximately 18,000 carers by up to €100 per week at cost of €56.72 million in a full year.These new arrangements will apply to almost all weekly social welfare payments and to people in receipt of qualified adult allowances. Recipients of jobseeker's allowance or benefit or signing for credits will not be eligible for the new arrangements, given the nature of these payments. This is in line with the arrangements which currently apply to receipt of the respite care grant.  The recommended extension of the respite care grant to people in receipt of a social welfare payment other than carer's allowance or benefit and who are providing someone with full time care and attention was implemented in Budget 2005. That improvement went beyond the report's recommendation in that the respite care grant was extended to all full time carers, regardless of means.One of the fundamental qualifying conditions for carer's allowance, carer's benefit and the respite care grant is that the person be providing full time care and attention to a person who needs such care. However, a person may engage in employment, self employment, training or education outside the home for up to 15 hours per week and still be considered to be providing full time care and attention. Prior to June 2006 this threshold was 10 hours per week.  In Budget 2006 I extended the duration of carer's benefit from 15 to 24 months. This is in line with the Joint Committee's recommendation that the 15 month restriction be waived where the person continues to provide care.The report also recommended the development of a national strategy for carers. I am delighted that one of the key Government commitments in the national partnership agreement "Towards 2016" is the development of a national carer's strategy. This strategy, which will focus on supporting informal and family carers in the community, will be developed by the end of 2007. All relevant departments and agencies will be involved and there will be appropriate consultation with the social partners. Departments are currently in discussions regarding the best way to advance the process.I am well aware of the particular difficulties faced by young carers especially in trying to juggle school and caring. I know that the Combat Poverty Agency has funded a study of young carers in Cork under its poverty research initiative. I understand that the study involved interviews with five young carers and four former young carers. However, I have not yet seen the report of those interviews and I understand that it has not yet been published.The improvements for carers, which I announced in Budget 2007, are further evidence of my commitment to working for, and with, carers to deliver increased benefits, supports, and services for them and their families. In that regard and in line with commitments in "Towards 2016" I will continue to keep the supports for carers available from my Department under review.

The study found that Ireland is one of the better performing countries and is above the EU average when it comes to integrating poverty and social inclusion objectives into Government policy. It also noted the importance of structures to support social inclusion and found that Ireland is at the forefront by having a Cabinet Committee on Social Inclusion chaired by the Taoiseach and dedicated social inclusion units in a number of Government departments, agencies and local authorities.Building an inclusive society remains a key priority of Government. Ireland's strategic approach to tackling poverty was first introduced in 1997 with the publication of the ten-year National Anti-Poverty Strategy. Much has been achieved since then, including a substantial reduction in unemployment, major increases in the number of two income households and the ending of high emigration together with a major increase in return migration and immigration. These improvements have been assisted by increased resources for social welfare payments, public services and infrastructure such as health, housing, education and disadvantaged communities.However, not everyone in our society has benefited to the same extent from our recent success and tackling poverty and social exclusion remains a major challenge and a priority for Government. The strategic framework for the next ten years to meet that challenge is set out in the National Action Plan for Social Inclusion 2007-2016 (NAPinclusion), launched in February 2007, the social inclusion elements of Towards 2016 and the National Development Plan 2007-2013. The provision in these three strategies clearly show the priority being given to tackling poverty. Using the lifecycle approach, these strategies place the individual at the centre of policy development and delivery with a particular emphasis on the provision of services and activation as means of tackling social exclusion.The overall poverty reduction goal in the NAPinclusion is to reduce the number of those experiencing consistent poverty to between 2% and 4% by 2012, with the aim of eliminating consistent poverty by 2016. In addition, the NAPinclusion identifies 12 high level strategic goals supported by over 150 targets and actions aimed at addressing long-standing and serious social deficits to achieve the overall objective of reducing consistent poverty.The study noted that all countries could do more to involve people experiencing poverty in devising and supporting solutions. The Office for Social Inclusion (OSI) located in my Department is acknowledged in the study as undertaking ‘a very valuable co-ordinating and developmental role'. Production of the NAPinclusion, and the social inclusion elements of Towards 2016 and the NDP, was informed by an extensive consultation process involving people experiencing poverty and their representatives. The OSI received 81 written submissions as part of this process and conducted a series of regional and national seminars at which in excess of 500 people attended. The annual Social Inclusion Forum is another important vehicle for providing people experiencing poverty and social exclusion and their representatives with an opportunity to contribute their views and experiences. A priority for consultation in the coming years will be to reach more people experiencing poverty directly in order to obtain their views on what is required to improve and make more effective the supports they receive.The OSI has also produced new guidelines for Poverty Impact Assessment to enhance the current poverty proofing of policies. These will be an effective tool in ensuring the mainstreaming of poverty and social exclusion in all policy making, by requiring a rigorous assessment of the impact of policies on those who are most vulnerable.  Communicating the social inclusion message effectively to all stakeholders and the public generally is a continuing challenge. In addition to further developing meaningful consultation, OSI will, during the period of the NAPinclusion, develop and deliver a strong communications strategy to ensure that the public is kept informed of progress and that there is widespread knowledge and awareness of social inclusion initiatives and investment.

Customer telephone enquiries in relation to State Pension Transition/Contributory (SPT/C) entitlements are dealt with by a special contact centre in the Social Welfare Services Office, Sligo. A dedicated team of 10 staff has been assigned to deal with SPT/C enquiries only, and the contact centre is actively monitored to ensure that optimum customer service is maintained. Average call volumes received by the contact centre from SPT/C customers over the first quarter of 2007 have been 1,500 per day (approx.).There has been a disimprovement in the level of telephone services provided to people enquiring about SPT/C claims in recent months. There are a number of factors which have contributed to this disimprovement.  There have been delays in processing of claims as a result of the increase in the number of claims received, enhancements to the schemes in September 2006, high levels of staff turnover and the introduction of a major business reorganisation and the introduction of a new IT system. In addition my Department has engaged in a programme of information to customers regarding changes and enhancements to payments. Three mailshots issued to customers in the period January 2007 to March 2007. A total of 190,000 approx. letters issued. Each of these mailshots resulted in a percentage of customers contacting the Department regarding their pension payments.As a result the average number of calls per day has dropped from 1,500 in the first quarter of 2007 to 1,030 per day since beginning of April. My Department in its progress towards providing enhanced service to customers is developing a telephone strategy. The strategy aims to raise the profile and importance of telephone contact within the organisation, to enhance customer service through easier access and to improve organisational effectiveness and efficiency.In the meantime, the management of the SPT/C Contact Centre continues to progress the provision of a quality service to the customer. As part of this approach it is intended to enhance the Interactive Voice Response, which is currently in use on the Sligo LoCall No. 1890 500 000, to make it easier for customers to get through to the correct area. Progress has been made in addressing the issues which gave rise to the high level of calls.

A further 11 per cent of workers pay social insurance contributions at the Class S rate. These contributions which are subject to various thresholds, allowances and ceilings, accrue entitlement to a range of benefits and pensions under various social insurance schemes. The current employee PRSI ceiling stands at €48,800 per annum.A decrease in the employee PRSI rate from 4% to 2% for employments insured at PRSI Class A and Class H would, on its own, cost the Social Insurance Fund some €720 million in a full year.  A decrease in the self-employed PRSI rate (Class S) from 3% to 2% is estimated to cost approximately €220 million per annum.  Options for additional income to the Fund could include changes in the ceiling on contributions. In this regard, abolition of the ceiling for employees would yield some €295 million.Legislation provides that the Exchequer is the residual financier of the Fund and Exchequer contributions to cover any shortfall in contributions were the norm for over forty years. However no Exchequer contribution has been required since 1996 as the fund has been in surplus on foot of contributions from employers and workers. Any shortfall in the cost of benefits paid would in the normal way be addressed by exchequer subvention.
#SeamusBrennan	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-party	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-dob	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-04-25 00:00:00	Prelude	739	Since taking Office this Government has made the needs of older people a priority with the inclusion of several commitments in the Programme for Government aimed specifically at the group. I am very pleased to say that we have delivered on the commitment to increase the State pension to €200 per week by 2007. In addition, the state pension (contributory) has been increased in the last Budget by €16 per week to €209.30 per week. Pension increases have been well ahead of inflation thus ensuring that not only is the real value of pensions maintained but that they are significantly improved in real terms. For instance, since 1996, and including the budget increases, pensions have increased by almost 119% or about 57% in real terms.The enhanced state pension (non-contributory) for those over 66 years features significant improvements in the means test by increasing the basic means disregard to €30 per week and an incentive of €200 per week of earnings disregarded for pensioners who may wish to earn extra income in employment. Both of these disregards are doubled for pensioner couples. Other measures of benefit to older people include last year's increase in the over 80 allowance of €3.60 per week, bringing it to €10 per week and this year's increase in the fuel allowance of €4 per week, bringing the allowance to €18 per week, which represents a doubling of the fuel allowance in the last two years.The household benefits package is available to people living in the State aged 66 to 69 years subject to certain conditions, and to all ages over 70. The electricity/natural gas allowance is of immense benefit to older people who have, in general, greater heating requirements. The value of the natural gas allowance has been increased and the number of free units of electricity increased by 600 units a year to 2,400 units. The household benefits package for a pensioner is currently valued at some €985 per year. The free travel scheme, with time restrictions removed and an enhanced All-Ireland package, is also of considerable benefit to many pensioners.The 2005 SILC report, published by the CSO, estimates that the level of consistent poverty among older people in 2005 was 3.7% compared to 7% in the population generally. The overall poverty goal in the NAP inclusion is to reduce the number of those experiencing consistent poverty to 2% to 4% by 2012, with the aim of eliminating consistent poverty by 2016. Achievement of this goal is already well advanced in the case of older people.The forthcoming Green Paper on Pensions will include a discussion of all aspects of our pension system including the contribution that social welfare pensions makes to ensuring an adequate income for older people in retirement which is at the same time sustainable in the long-term. Following publication of the Green Paper, a consultation process will take place to which Government will respond by publishing a framework for future pensions policy.
#SeamusBrennan	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-party	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-dob	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-04-25 00:00:00	Prelude	740	I propose to take Questions Nos. 59 and 188 together.Under social welfare legislation, the social insurance status of spouses working in a family business can vary. Spouses and relatives who are engaged in a business partnership are treated as individual self-employed contributors who are liable to social insurance contributions. These contributions enable them to build up an insurance record in their own right and receive accruing benefits.  Alternatively, where a family business is incorporated as a limited company, spouses and assisting relatives involved in the business pay PRSI contributions either as employees or as self-employed contributors depending on whether a contract of service exists.Otherwise, a person employed directly by his/her spouse is not liable to pay PRSI, being "excepted" under social welfare. The exceptions apply to both men and women in family employments and recognise the practical difficulties in establishing the existence of a genuine employment relationship in such circumstances. Where formal employment relationships are intended between spouses or assisting relatives, the legislation provides the scope necessary, as outlined above, to allow parties enter into formal arrangements for a contract of employment or self-employment whereby PRSI contributions will be payable. Where a spouse has not built up personal entitlement to a contributory pension based on individual social insurance contributions, she or he may be entitled to an increase on their spouses pension as a qualified adult.With regard to the question of whether this approach is discriminatory, I am satisfied at this stage that this is not so. An EU report referring to the Directive 86/613/EEC on the application of equal treatment between men and women recognises that it is a matter for individual Member-States to decide on the appropriate level of cover for assisting spouses.The question of discrimination will be further considered in the context of a wide ranging review of the social welfare code. The review, which is currently underway, will seek to examine the compatibility of the code with the Equal Status Act, 2000 (as amended), and to identify any instances of direct or indirect discrimination on any of the nine grounds identified in that Act — including marital status. In instances where differences in treatment are identified, the review will examine whether they are justified by legitimate social policy objectives. The project is being carried out over two phases. Phase I, which involves a scoping exercise aimed at identifying appropriate approaches and methodologies to be undertaken, is now complete. The results from this exercise will form the basis of the Terms of Reference for the main review that is due to follow in Phase II. This is expected to commence in mid-2007.With regard to number of people who do not qualify for a state pension contributory on the grounds of insufficient self-employment contributions as a co-helping spouse, the Department does not maintain data of this nature.  In the meantime, I am satisfied that, under the existing social welfare provisions, where formal employment or partnership relationships are intended between spouses, the legislation provides the scope necessary to allow parties to enter into arrangements that will enable them to gain access to social insurance coverage and accrue entitlement to benefits and pensions accordingly.
#SeamusBrennan	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-party	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-dob	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-04-25 00:00:00	Prelude	741	The requirement to be habitually resident in Ireland was introduced as a qualifying condition for certain social assistance schemes and child benefit with effect from 1st of May 2004. It was introduced in the context of the Government's decision to open the Irish labour market to workers from the 10 new EU Member States without the transitional limitations which were imposed at that time by most of the other Member states. The question of what is a person's "habitual residence" is decided in accordance with European Court of Justice case law, which sets out the grounds for assessing individual claims.Decisions to the effect that applicants satisfy the habitual residence condition are made in the majority of cases at claim acceptance stage by Deciding Officers. Statistics are not maintained on cases where the decision is positive. Complex cases that require detailed consideration are examined in dedicated units established for that purpose. For the period from 1 May 2004 to 28 February 2007, the number of these complex cases decided was 48,578. The number of applications decided in respect of Irish citizens was 12,454, of which 1,288 (10%) were disallowed. The number of cases decided in respect of persons other than Irish nationals was 36,124 of which 10,459 (29%) were disallowed.Each case received for a determination on the Habitual Residence Condition is dealt with in its own right and a decision is based on application of the guidelines to the particular individual circumstances of each case. Any applicant who disagrees with the decision of a Deciding Officer has the right to appeal to the Social Welfare Appeals Office.A person who fails to satisfy the habitual residence condition and is suffering financial hardship may apply to the Health Service Executive for an Emergency Needs Payment under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme. Such payments are not subject to the habitual residence condition. In certain circumstances persons who do not have any means of support may also be assisted to travel back to their home country by the Reception and Integration Agency.Nationals of the European Economic Area (EEA) who take up employment in the State are protected under the EU Regulations governing social security for migrant workers. Migrant workers from outside the EEA qualify for social insurance benefits in respect of the unexpired part of their work permits if they satisfy the normal qualifying conditions. The habitual residence condition does not apply in these cases. Such workers may also satisfy the habitual residence condition for receipt of social assistance payments and child benefit.The reason for the introduction of the habitual residence condition in May 2004 was to ensure that persons who have not worked in Ireland or who have not established habitual residence should not avail of assistance schemes or child benefit. The operation of the condition was reviewed by my Department in 2006. Following the review the operational guidelines for the scheme are being revised to ensure consistency in the application of the condition and to take account of the variety of individual situations which can arise.The habitual residence condition is being operated in a careful manner to ensure that Ireland's social welfare system is protected, while at the same time ensuring that people whose cases are appropriate to the system have access to it when they need it. I have no plans to introduce any changes to the current policy at this time.Question No. 61 answered with QuestionNo.  50.
#SeamusBrennan	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-party	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-dob	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-04-25 00:00:00	Prelude	742	I propose to take Questions Nos. 62 and 63 together.In February 2006, as part of the health service reform programme, the Government decided to transfer certain functions and associated staff and other resources from the Health Service Executive to my Department. The functions to be transferred include the administration of the supplementary welfare allowance (SWA) scheme. The transfer of functions is a major project that has implications for important services and also affects, on a personal level, the staff delivering these services and the programme to implement the transfer is being managed in a careful and comprehensive manner. As part of that process the HSE and my Department are engaged in a comprehensive programme to collect information on all elements of the functions currently undertaken by the Community Welfare Service. This information is essential for the successful planning and implementation of the transfer process and to ensure that all aspects of the current service are fully taken into account.Throughout the implementation programme there is and will be direct and extensive consultation with the staff affected by the transfer of functions programme. A communications and consultation strategy has been devised that provides for ongoing dialogue with all stakeholders associated with the programme including all unions involved.In this regard the health sector National Joint Council (NJC) brings together the relevant trade unions, the HSE and the Department of Health and Children. The NJC meets regularly and it has discussed the transfer of functions. The transfer proposals have also been discussed at meetings with the unions representing staff in my Department. More specifically, a Joint Liaison Group involving the two trade unions who represent community welfare service staff, health sector management and my Department has been established. This group has met on two occasions. A document outlining items for discussion associated with the transfer from HSE was sent to all of the trade unions concerned, including trade unions representing community welfare service staff. Further meetings of the Group have been scheduled.The industrial relations framework provided for in Towards 2016 is the mechanism where ultimately any industrial relations considerations associated with the transfer will progress. I am satisfied that the considerable level of consultation and engagement by my Department as well as the HSE and Department of Health and Children with the unions concerned will allow for all the issues of concern to be progressed.The SWA scheme is currently administered by some 700 CWOs and 59 superintendents and supporting clerical and other staff within the Community Welfare Service of the HSE. They provide a service that is flexible, responsive and outcome driven. The transfer of functions will not change this. There will be no loss of flexibility, discretion or personal service on the part of CWOs. The same staff will be administering the schemes and providing the same personal service under the same legislation and guidelines as at present. The existing legislation governing the scheme will largely remain. All of the linkages to other services in the health sector and elsewhere will remain and indeed will be strengthened under the new arrangements. The CWOs will remain community based and will continue to provide key information, advice, advocacy and referral links between agencies following the transfer.While acknowledging the concerns that those delivering the service may have regarding the transfer programme generally, I am satisfied that this is the correct way forward. The SWA scheme is already funded by my Department and is part of the wider social welfare code. In recent years new types of payments, computer development and modernisation of services enable customers to confidently carry out their business with my Department. The transfer of functions will provide a platform from which to build on this and offers both a challenge and an opportunity for all staff within both the Community Welfare Service and my own Department in developing a model system for supporting those most disadvantaged in society.

The paper also proposed the abolition of the cohabitation rule as a condition for receipt of the proposed social assistance payment.The social partners agreed under Towards 2016 that extending the National Employment Action Plan referral process to other groups such as lone parents and persons with disabilities with due regard to the need of those groups will be considered as a priority over a three year period. The management of the National Employment Action Plan rests with a tripartite committee comprising the Departments of Social and Family Affairs, Enterprise, Trade and Employment and FAS and the implications of extending it to other groups is under consideration by this committee at present.The new social assistance payment, under development in my Department, will have the long-term aim of assisting people to achieve financial independence through supporting them to enter employment — the avenue that is widely agreed to offer the best route out of poverty.Any proposed new payment can only be introduced when the necessary co-ordinated supports and services are put in place by other Departments and Agencies.This is why the Government has instructed the Senior Officials Group on Social Inclusion to draw up an implementation plan to progress the non-income recommendations in tandem with the development of the legislation required in my Department to introduce a new payment scheme.Work on the development of this implementation plan is continuing. Issues including access to childcare support, education, training and activation measures continue to be discussed with the relevant Departments and Agencies.To develop the process further, my Department, with the co-operation of FAS, the Office of the Minister for Children and the Department of Education and Science, are to test the proposals in both an urban and rural setting. These tests will focus on identifying and resolving the practical and administrative issues that may arise in advance of the scheme being introduced. This will allow for operational and logistical co-ordination between the relevant departments and agencies to be considered and will facilitate the development of the new scheme.
#SeamusBrennan	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-party	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-dob	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-04-25 00:00:00	Prelude	744	I propose to take Questions Nos. 66 and 67 together.The Family Income Supplement (FIS) provides income support for employees on low earnings with families. This preserves the incentive to remain in employment in circumstances where the employee might only be marginally better off than if he or she were claiming other social welfare payments. There are currently 20,869 people in receipt of FIS. In Budget 2007, I have continued the re-focusing of income thresholds to include additional gains for larger families.With regard to the level of uptake, it is not possible to estimate from administrative sources the number of families who would be eligible but do not apply for their FIS entitlements. However, research undertaken by the Economic and Social Research Institute (ESRI) in 1997, which was based on the results of the Living in Ireland Survey 1994, suggested that fewer than one in three of potentially eligible claimants were actually in receipt of the payment at that time. Since those with a higher entitlement are more likely to avail of the scheme, the uptake in expenditure terms was estimated to be somewhat higher, at close to 40% of potential expenditure. Subsequent studies by the ESRI have arrived at similar estimates of uptake.The reasons for the perceived lack of uptake of FIS have been the subject of significant Parliamentary and other enquires. In response, my Department undertook a nationwide awareness campaign in March 2006 to promote and encourage increased uptake of the scheme for working families on low incomes. This extensive week-long campaign included advertising on TV, on national and local radio and in the national and regional press. A nation-wide poster campaign was also undertaken. As a result, the uptake of FIS was substantially improved.The second element to address FIS uptake issues is the proposed commissioning of a specific research project to examine factors behind the level of uptake for the scheme.Tenders to undertake this work have been received by my Department and these are being evaluated.  I expect this process to be concluded shortly and the project to commence in the next few weeks.
#SeamusBrennan	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-party	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-dob	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-04-25 00:00:00	Prelude	745	Last month, I presented the first Annual Output Statement for my Department to the Select Committee on Social and Family Affairs as part of its consideration of the 2007 Estimates. In brief, the Annual Output Statement is a top level report linking the Department's financial allocations with the high level goals of the strategy statement and specified business objectives for the year. It also identifies key impact or outcome indicators for each high level strategic goal. In this regard, consistent poverty rates for people of working age are identified as an impact indicator for the goal relating to people of working age.The relevant high-level goal is as follows:"To provide income supports and access to relevant services to people of working age who cannot secure an income (or an adequate income) from employment and facilitate them in taking up relevant employment, training, education or development opportunities as appropriate.A range of key programmes and policies are identified in the Annual Output Statement to achieve this goal. The new National Action Plan for Social Inclusion 2007–2016 (NAPinclusion) was launched in February with an overall goal to make a decisive impact on consistent poverty. This is underlined by the fact that a new target is being set, using an updated set of indicators, to reduce the number of persons experiencing consistent poverty in the population as a whole, including those of working age, to between 2 per cent and 4 per cent by 2012, with the aim of eliminating consistent poverty by 2016, under the revised definition of consistent poverty. Combating poverty and social inclusion has been a key priority for this Government. We will continue to face these challenges in the years ahead. Significant and visible progress has been made over the last 10 years, not least our success in tackling unemployment levels. I am confident that we can continue to achieve a similar scale of progress in the coming years towards achieving that decisive impact on poverty.

However, I am anxious that all avenues are explored to provide financial support for people on long-term rent supplementation who may be in a position to purchase their own home.In this regard a study overseen by my Department and the Department of the Environment Heritage and Local Government was commissioned from Goodbody Economic Consultants to examine the potential of supplementing home ownership specifically among the client base that comes within the rent supplementation arrangements. The study was aimed at identifying possible viable alternative approaches to meeting housing needs for long-term rent supplement recipients. These alternative approaches would be in addition or complementary to the range of social housing options currently provided for by the Department of Environment, Heritage and Local Government through local government initiatives. The consultants are finalising their report and their conclusions and recommendations will be considered by officials of both Departments. Since initiating the study, a number of significant developments in relation to the provision of housing for people on low incomes have been announced. These initiatives will be taken into account by officials when reviewing the report.Some of the initiatives taken include:allowing for the continuation of rent supplement to qualified persons moving into full-time employment while local authorities are sourcing accommodation under the Rental Accommodation Scheme (RAS), andan improvement in the disregards applying to additional income in the assessment of means for rent supplement purposes. At present up to €60 and 50% of additionalincome between €60 and €90 is disregarded in the assessment of means for rent supplement purposes. The 2007 Social Welfare and Pensions Act provides that the first €75 of additional household income is disregarded and that 25% of any additional household income, with no upper income limit, can also be disregarded.Another development includes proposals by the Minister for Environment, Heritage and Local Government to introduce an ‘incremental purchase' scheme for social housing tenants and prospective tenants based on the development of the ‘shared equity' concept whereby tenants would be allowed to use their rental payments to build up an equity stake in a local authority house in an incremental fashion in return for paying a premium on the rent and taking over responsibility for the maintenance of the dwelling. The objective is to make it possible for households with incomes substantially lower than for affordable housing to start on the path to home ownership. This scheme is outlined in the recent Statement on Housing Policy "Delivering Homes and Sustaining Communities".
#SeamusBrennan	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-party	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-dob	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-04-25 00:00:00	Prelude	747	The recommendation of the Public Accounts Committee to which the Deputy refers is that my Department should keep under close review those GPs who certify persons as incapable for work and who are later consistently found capable by the Department's medical assessors. Medical certifiers, who are in the main general practitioners or hospital doctors, enter into a contract with my Department that requires them to medically examine persons claiming illness or injury benefit and to certify as accurately as possible the specific disease or ailment that renders a person incapable of work. The contract requires them to refuse to issue medical certificates if the person's condition does not justify it. The terms of the GPs' contract with my Department specifies that if a medical certifier fails to abide by the terms of the agreement, penalties may be applied, including termination of contract.They are also issued with very detailed guidelines which require that the certifier must be satisfied that the patient is incapable of work and that they regularly review each case and ensure that a final certificate is issued, as appropriate, without delay. The guidelines also advise certifiers, in the patient's interest, to consider whether certification and advice to stay off work is the most appropriate way to manage a patient's care as prolonged absence from work may sometimes cause deterioration in a patient's condition. Medical evidence submitted in support of a claim, based on GP certification, is systematically reviewed by medical assessors within my Department. I think it is worth bearing in mind that, in all cases of incapacity, there is scope for individual medical interpretation based on the certifier's perception of the nature of the incapacity and the type of work involved. Thus, when a case is reviewed by the Department's medical assessors, who are independent and impartial in their assessments, the fact that they may express a different opinion to that of the certifier is not an implication that a claimant has been incorrectly certified.However, if it were to emerge that a disproportionate number of customers certified by any particular certifier were found capable of work by medical assessors, this should be investigated. While no such unusual pattern of certification has come to attention to date, it is accepted that the computer systems must be enhanced to enable a systematic approach to review and monitoring of such possible outcomes. To this end, as part of the recent review of the Medical Review and Assessment function, recommendations were made for the development of new systems include the functionality necessary to enable this to take place. This will underpin a more structured system of review and monitoring of certifiers' performance by my Department.

This preserves the incentive to remain in employment in circumstances where the employee might only be marginally better off than if he or she were claiming other social welfare payments.To ensure that families are made aware of these improvements, my Department undertook a nationwide awareness campaign in March 2006 to promote and encourage a greatly increased take up of the Family Income Supplement scheme for working families on low incomes. This extensive week-long campaign included advertising on TV, on national and local radio and in the national and regional press. A nation-wide poster campaign was also undertaken.  In addition, the scheme was promoted through my Department's network of Local  offices, Citizen Information Centres and Citizens Information Phone service and by the Citizens Information Board (formerly known as Comhairle), the national information support agency. Information was also made available through my Department's website.I am very pleased with the response so far to the campaign. For example from March to December 2006 my Department received 11,995 new FIS claims; this compares with 6,743 received in the same period in 2005. My Department has received 3,564 new claims so far this year compared with 1,749 for the corresponding period in 2005. The general trend for both new claims and renewals is for numbers to continue to rise. The advertising campaign has resulted in a higher than normal number of claims on hand (ie. 6,823 at end of March 2007) and I would expect a high percentage of these to translate into awards. The increase in the number of claims received regrettably has resulted in delays in claim processing. At present it is taking ten weeks to process a FIS claim.The increase in the numbers of persons receiving FIS is a positive development, reflecting the success of a range of Government measures which have improved net incomes for the low paid. Overall, the numbers claiming FIS has increased from 14,688 in 1999 to over 23,000 in 2006 during which time expenditure on the support scheme has increased from €31million to €107 million.

The review analyses the current social and economic position in the country under twelve different headings including income, taxation, work, public services, migration, social participation and sustainability. It sets out a wide range of recommendations under each of these headings to ensure economic development, social equity and sustainability in the medium to long term.Building an inclusive society continues to be the key priority of Government. This is evidenced in the National Partnership Agreement, Towards 2016, which was agreed last year by Government and the social partners, including CORI as a member of the Community and Voluntary pillar. The National Action Plan for Social Inclusion 2007-2016 (NAPinclusion) which was published earlier this year and the social inclusion elements of the National Development Plan, set out a detailed programme of action and demanding targets for achieving greater social inclusion during the period 2007 to 2016. The preparation of the NAPinclusion involved a wide ranging consultation process with key stakeholders.We will continue to face the challenges of tackling poverty and social inclusion. Significant and visible progress has been made over the last 10 years and I am confident that we can continue to achieve a similar scale of progress in the coming years towards achieving the fairer Ireland sought by CORI.

The first report an ‘Options Paper, presented by the Working Group on Domestic Partnership' to the Tánaiste and Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, focuses on different types of cohabiting relationships, both same and opposite sex, and presents a range of options with regard to giving legal recognition to these relationships. Officials from my Department contributed to the work of this Group. The second report — the ‘Report of the Law Reform Commission on the Rights and Duties of Cohabitants' —  makes substantial recommendations for reform of the law concerning cohabitants including both opposite sex or same sex couples who live together.  These reports come at a time of wide public debate on the question of according legal status to cohabitants generally, and same sex couples in particular, and will contribute to the informed debate on these important topics.My own Department is currently carrying out a technical review of the entire social welfare code to examine its compatibility with the Equal Status Act, 2000 (as amended). The review will examine the schemes and services provided for both in social welfare legislation and in the administrative schemes operated by the Department. It will identify any instances of direct or indirect discrimination, on any of the nine grounds under the Act, including: gender, sexual orientation, marital status and family status that are not justified by a legitimate social policy objective or where the means of achieving that objective are either unnecessary or inappropriate. This work, together with the reports I have referred to, will contribute to informed planning and policy making to ensure that the social welfare system reflects the needs and expectations of citizens and is equitable in meeting those needs.

The provision of information in a clear and accessible manner is an essential element in the achievement of this objective.  My Department takes a pro-active approach in advertising its schemes and services by using a mix of national and provincial media, information leaflets, factsheets, posters, direct mailshots, advertising on television screens in over 60 Credit Unions nationwide, and by distributing information booklets to health centres throughout the country.  National advertising campaigns are undertaken periodically to promote greater awareness of a specific scheme or to highlight changes in schemes and services. During 2006, my Department undertook campaigns on the Family Income Supplement, Back to School Clothing and Footwear Allowance, supports for Carers  (Carers Allowance, Carers Benefit, Respite Care Grant), the Department's PRSI information mailing service and budget information.The first targeted advertising campaign of 2007 has been conducted over the last two months regarding All Ireland Free Travel. The scheme enables citizens aged 66 or over to travel free within Northern Ireland with effect from the 2nd of April, 2007.LoCall numbers are provided for all campaigns from which the public can get further information or application forms. The campaigns also highlight other sources of information available to the public, including my Department's website (www.welfare.ie) and my Department’s network of Social Welfare Local Offices and the information services available through the network of Citizens Information Centres, including the Citizens Information Phone Service and website facility (www.citizensinformation.ie). The responses to the campaigns have been encouraging and resulted in increases in the number of applications received for the various schemes.In view of the range of services available from my Department it would not be possible to highlight all of them in a single advertising campaign. Therefore, nationwide targeted advertising campaigns, focusing on specific schemes and services, will continue to be a key priority for me in the drive to ensure that citizens are aware of and claim their social welfare entitlements.

The "fit out" of this building (which will accommodate up to 186 people) is nearing completion.Initially, some 130 posts will be relocated to this building with the first group of 47 staff expected to move in over the coming weeks.The Department is committed to completing the decentralisation programme to Carrick-on-Shannon and will review the position when the initial moves have taken place.

The scheme enables pensioners resident here and in Northern Ireland to travel free of charge on all eligible transport services on the island.The scheme extends the existing cross-border free travel arrangements by allowing pensioners over the age of 66 and resident here to travel free of charge on all bus and rail services in Northern Ireland. Likewise, pensioners in Northern Ireland can travel free of charge on transport services in this State.Implementation of a single travel pass for all-Ireland free travel, acceptable in both jurisdictions, requires the completion of the Integrated Ticketing project being developed under the auspices of the Department of Transport and subsequent integration with the ticketing systems in operation in Northern Ireland. My Department has on-going engagement with these bodies and projects.Pending development of the integrated ticket system, my Department engaged with the Department of Regional Development and Translink, the main transport authority in Northern Ireland, to put in place an interim scheme to permit senior residents of both jurisdictions to avail of free travel within the other jurisdiction.As part of this scheme residents of this jurisdiction wishing to travel in the North can use a travel card similar to the smart pass used by their Northern Ireland counterparts. Customers need to apply for the travel pass in person and supply photographs for authentication at a Social Welfare Local Office rather than a Branch Office such as Maynooth. Local Offices were chosen to administer the scheme as they are considered most suitable for applying the required levels of control. As this is a once-off transaction customers need make only one visit to their Local Office, the smart pass card is posted direct to the customer's home address.Since the scheme commenced in April there have been more than 11,000 applications received. My Department is still familiarising itself along with our Northern Ireland counterparts are monitoring the operation of the scheme to ensue that the most appropriate and efficient arrangements are in place to deal with applications.

In relation to the first, Government commitments for a target rate for pensions of €127 per week achieved in 2002 and, later, for a rate of €200 per week, achieved in the current year, have ensured that not only has the value of pensions been maintained, but they have been improved and enhanced on an ongoing basis.This system has served pensioners well over the last decade with increases in pensions which are ahead of both inflation and earnings. Over the last 10 years, pensions have increased by 119% or 57% in real terms. This improvement in incomes is very apparent in poverty statistics based on the nationally agreed measure of consistent poverty and more recently in poverty statistics based on relative incomes.I am aware that there is a view that we should have a formal method for increasing pensions linked to some index such as price movements, earnings or household income growth and this will be discussed in the forthcoming Green Paper on pensions.  While this would ensure a degree of certainty in relation to the setting of the pension rates in the future it could, depending on movements in the index chosen, limit the rate at which pensions increase. On balance, the current arrangements appear to best serve the needs of older people, while at the same time providing the flexibility to Government to react to changing economic and budgetary conditions.
#SeamusBrennan	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-party	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-dob	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-04-25 00:00:00	Prelude	755	The social welfare pension entitlements of those who take time out of the workforce for caring duties are protected by the homemaker's scheme, which was introduced in and took effect from 1994.  The scheme allows up to 20 years spent caring for children or incapacitated adults to be disregarded when a person's social insurance record is being averaged for pension purposes.  However, the scheme will not of itself qualify a person for a pension. The standard qualifying conditions, which require a person to enter insurance 10 years before pension age, pay a minimum of 260 contributions at the correct rate and achieve a yearly average of at least 10 contributions on their record from the time they enter insurance until they reach pension age, must also be satisfied.Women who left the workforce through the operation of the marriage bar were, in the main, public servants who were never insured for social welfare pension purposes. A person whose only contributions were at the modified rate paid by public servants up until 1995 will not benefit from the homemaker's scheme as such contributions did not include cover for contributory pensions.  Accordingly, any loss of pension rights in their case relates more to their occupational position rather than social welfare pension entitlements.It is estimated that there are some 47,000 people who are not receiving a social welfare pension payment in their own right, or as a qualified adult on the pension of their spouse or partner.  These include people affected by the marriage bar, public servants in general, self-employed people who were close to retirement or had retired before 1988, when the self-employed were brought within the social insurance system, together with their spouses.The issues in relation to this group will be discussed in the forthcoming Green Paper on pensions. Decisions regarding pension provision for them will be made in the context of the framework for long-term pensions policy which will be developed after the Green Paper has been published and a consultation process has been completed.

The funding provided by my Department to groups and organisations under the Family Services Project (FSP) and the Special Projects Fund is used to support projects run by third parties to assist welfare recipients and members of their families. The type of projects supported include family support programmes and personal development programmes, the majority of which incorporate a parenting element and projects aimed at improving employability through education and training and personal development.In 2006 over 400 projects or individuals were assisted through the Family Services Project (FSP) at a total cost of €2.2 million. The overall objective of the FSP is to provide a high quality information service on the range of supports available to families from state agencies and the community & voluntary sector with a particular emphasis on the agencies and services available locally.The Special Projects Fund is used to provide grants to projects run by third parties to assist welfare recipients as well as members of their families improve their employability through education, training and personal development. My Department sees the Special Projects Fund as a means of supporting innovative responses to increasing employability and tackling social inclusion. There was €2.8 million available under the Special Projects Fund in 2006 and over 160 projects were funded.The funds are administered by Facilitators based in my Department's Local Offices who work in conjunction with local Voluntary and Community groups and also with statutory organisations. They are operated in a manner that enables a quick response to identified customer needs.My Department's role in this area is to increase the capacity of those in the most difficult circumstances by improving their self-esteem and personal and family situations through the training, developmental and educational opportunities made available. In 2007 over €5.6 million is being made available in this area.The Family Support Agency, which comes under the remit of my Department, has statutory responsibility to promote and disseminate information about issues such as parenting and family responsibilities. In 2007, the Agency has been allocated €35.339 million of Government funding to support families and has a mission "to promote family and community well being through the provision of appropriate supports and services to families."A crucial element of this will be the investment of over €18 million in the Family Resource Centre programme which seeks to help combat disadvantage by improving the functioning of the family unit. The emphasis in the projects is on the involvement of local communities in developing approaches to tackle the problems they face and on creating successful partnerships between the voluntary and statutory agencies in the area concerned.The services provided and activities supported by the resource centres are designed to meet the needs of the local community. They include the provision of parenting courses, education and training opportunities for parents and active dissemination of information on a range of issues affecting families and local communities.All services provided by Family Resource Centres are designed to meet the requirements of those deemed as most in need by the voluntary boards of the FRCs themselves.

The ECS is intended to help families meet the costs of childcare. The supplement is paid every three months, in arrears, in respect of children under 6 years of age who qualify for child benefit.The ECS commenced in April 2006 and three payments issued to eligible parents in August, October and December 2006. In 2007, some 290,000 families received an ECS payment with total expenditure in the current year a mounting to €101.9m. Some 13,000 families qualified for the supplement for the first time since January 2007.The ECS is paid to the person with whom the child resides for the majority of the relevant quarter. As children may move between households it is necessary to establish a child's residency pattern in any quarter to identify to whom the ECS payment is due. Payment of the supplement is made to the person who received child benefit payment for the majority of the quarter. As these facts have to be established before payment issues it is necessary to pay ECS in arrears.The introduction of the ECS has been well received by customers. I am satisfied that the scheme is currently operating satisfactorily.
#SeamusBrennan	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-party	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-dob	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-04-25 00:00:00	Prelude	759	The supplementary welfare allowance scheme, which includes rent supplement, is administered on my behalf by the Community Welfare division of the Health Service Executive.Rent supplement under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme has, over the years, developed beyond the original objective of providing short-term assistance with accommodation. A significant number of people have now come to rely on rent supplement for extended periods, including people on local authority housing lists.  For this reason, the scheme has to be viewed in the context of overall housing policy, particularly in the case of long-term claimants.In response to this situation, the Government introduced new rental assistance arrangements which include the rental accommodation scheme (RAS). This gives local authorities specific responsibility for meeting the longer-term housing needs of people receiving rent supplement for 18 months or more. This new approach is being implemented on a phased basis.Local authorities will meet the housing needs of these individuals through a range of approaches including the traditional range of social housing options, the voluntary housing sector and, in particular, a new public/private partnership type rental accommodation scheme.Department of Environment, Heritage and Local Government have advised that the rental assistance arrangements are now being implemented in all local authority areas with some 20,000 cases reviewed.  That Department has also advised that at the end of March 2007 local authorities had accommodated a total of 6,119 rent supplement cases with a long-term housing need. This includes 2,249 transfers to accommodation provided by the voluntary sector, 1,200 transfers to accommodation rented by local authorities in the private rented sector and 2,670 transfers to local authority housing.At 13th April 2007, there were 59,012 tenants in receipt of a rent supplement payment of which approximately 32,000 have been in receipt of a payment for 18 months or more.When the new rental assistance arrangements have been fully implemented I expect that in excess of 30,000 individuals will have transferred from the rent supplement scheme to the local authorities under the rental accommodation scheme or other social housing schemes. This will enable the rent supplement scheme to revert to its original objective, namely that of a short term income support scheme.
#SeamusBrennan	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-party	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-dob	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-04-25 00:00:00	Prelude	760	It is estimated that the cost of applying an increase to €300 to contributory pensions, which are financed through the Social Insurance Fund, would be €1,495 million. Increasing the value of all social welfare pensions to €300 is estimated to cost €2,019 million in a full year, including the cost of increasing payments to qualified adults to maintain their current proportionate relationship to the personal weekly rates of payment. References to increasing welfare pensions to €300 per week indicated that any such increase would be achieved over a number of years and not in a single year.Traditionally social insurance spending has been funded on a tripartite basis through contributions from employers and employees and the exchequer, which, under legislation, is the residual financier of the Fund where annual shortfalls arise. However, no exchequer contribution to the SIF has been required since 1996 as the Fund has, since then, been in surplus each year on foot of contributions from employers and workers.In 2006 the annual surplus was some €670m and, based on provisional returns available at present, it is expected to be in excess of €600m at the end of 2007. The accumulated surplus at the end of 2006 was almost €3,100m and is projected to be €3,700m at end of 2007.  Therefore, at present the SIF has sufficient resources to provide for these increases.The Social Welfare (Consolidation) Act, 2005, requires that an actuarial review of the longer-term financial condition of the social insurance fund be undertaken at five-year intervals. The first actuarial review was published in October, 2002, and reflected the position of the Social Insurance Fund at the end of 2000. The second actuarial review will be considered by Government shortly prior to submission to the Oireachtas and publication.
#SeamusBrennan	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-party	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-dob	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-04-25 00:00:00	Prelude	761	The supplementary welfare allowance scheme, which includes rent supplement, is administered on my behalf by the Community Welfare division of the Health Service Executive (HSE).  The purpose of the scheme is to provide short-term income support to eligible people living in private rented accommodation whose means are insufficient to meet their accommodation costs and who do not have accommodation available to them from any other source. Eligibility is in general confined to those who are in receipt of a social welfare or HSE payment.  There are currently over 59,000 tenants benefiting from assistance under the rent supplement scheme.As the Deputy is aware, the current social partnership agreement, Towards 2016, contains a commitment that standards regulations in the private rented sector will be updated and effectively enforced.  While responsibility for enforcing housing standards regulation is a matter for the local authorities, I consider that the accommodation occupied by rent supplement tenants should at least meet these housing standards regulations.  In this regard, having consulted with the Department of Environment, Heritage and Local Government I introduced regulations in October 2006 and primary legislation in the Social Welfare and Pensions Act 2007 that allows the Health Service Executive to refuse rent supplement where it has been notified by a housing authority regarding the non-compliance with housing standards prescribed in regulations made under Section 18 of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions Act) 1992.I believe that these changes will support the Department of Environment, Heritage and Local Government's Action Programme on private rented standards which involves a range of measures to promote further improvement in private rented accommodation standards, including more effective enforcement.Where such a notification is received from a housing authority in respect of an existing tenant on rent supplement it is recommended that the Executive would discuss the situation with the tenant and take whatever action it decides is necessary in the best interests of the tenant.For example, the tenant may transfer to alternative accommodation either with the support of rent supplement or under the local authority's rental accommodation scheme.  Once the existing tenant has moved out of the sub-standard accommodation, rent supplement will not be paid in respect of that accommodation.  For example, the tenant may transfer to alternative accommodation either with the support of rent supplement or under the local authority's rental accommodation scheme.  Once the existing tenant has moved out of the sub-standard accommodation, rent supplement will not be paid in respect of that accommodation unless and until it has upgraded to fully comply with standard regulations.  I am satisfied that this approach addresses the issue of rent supplement being paid in respect of sub-standard accommodation in a manner that maximises the support provided to tenants in this situation.  The other main point made by the group to which the Deputy refers is that the maximum rent limits which apply in the scheme should be increased.Rent supplements are subject to a limit on the amount of rent that an applicant for rent supplement may incur.  The current limits were introduced in January 2007, for 18 month period, following an extensive review of limits.  The purpose of the review was to ensure that the new rent limits reflect realistic market conditions throughout the country, to enable the different categories of eligible tenant households to secure and retain basic suitable rented accommodation to meet their respective needs.The review entailed a broad consultation process, taking account of prevailing rent levels in the private rental sector generally, including an analysis of the "Private Rented Index" produced by the Central Statistics Office.  The Department consulted with Health Service Executive, the Department of Environment, Heritage and Local Government and the Private Residential Tenancies Board (PRTB) including an analysis of actual rents paid by over 90,000 tenants as notified to the PRTB.  In addition the Department contacted various voluntary bodies that have an interest in this area for their views on any changes, either upward or downward, of any individual rent level.This review resulted in upward adjustments in rent limits in 13 counties in respect of one adult households.  It also increased rent limits for other family sizes.  There was no reduction in rent limits.  I consider that the current limits are reasonable and that no useful purpose would be served by increasing them as it would only lead to a general increase in rents charged.

As the NEAP progressed, the programme was extended to include other groups crossing nominated thresholds of employment.  Currently persons aged 18 and under 64 years who are approaching three months on the Live Register are identified by the Department of Social and Family Affairs and referred to FÁS.Over the period September 1998 to December 2006, 287,000 recipients of unemployment payments have been referred under the NEAP.  While outcome data on the number of persons referred in 1998 and 1999 is not available the Department does have details of persons referred over the period 2000 to 2006.Of the total (255,680) referred during the period 2000 to 2006 171,111 or 67% were interviewed by FÁS.  Some people sign off prior to interview by FÁS.  Of the 171,111 interviewed by FÁS between 2000 and 2006 50,874 or 30% were placed in employment, training or education.  I do not have a breakdown of the number placed in employment for these years.  However over the last 4 year FÁS interviewed 117, 682, overall 31,401 or 27% of those interviewed were placed in employment, training or education and of that 14 % or 16,549 were placed in employment.People remain on the live register while engaged with FÁS under the NEAP until they take up offers of employment or training.  If they do not attend for interview with FÁS, or having engaged with FÁS decline offers of employment or training, their cases are referred back to the social welfare local office for review to determine if they continue to satisfy the conditions for receipt of unemployment payments.  I consider that National Employment Action Plan has played an important role in assisting unemployed persons enter or return to the labour force.

The principal support is child benefit, a universal payment which is neutral vis-a-vis the employment status of the child's parents and does not contribute to poverty traps.  A second support is the qualified child increase, paid with weekly social welfare payments.  In addition, weekly support is provided to families at work on low pay, through the family income supplement (FIS) scheme.In the context of an overall review of targeted child income support payments, the National Economic and Social Council was asked to examine the feasibility of merging the family income supplement with the qualified child increase and possibly including other child supports such as the back to school clothing and footwear allowance, resulting in a single second tier child income support.There have been a range of improvements introduced in respect of child income support in recent years, including increases in child benefit and increased income thresholds for family income supplement.  As research has shown that poverty is more likely to be concentrated in larger families, recent Budget measures, while significantly increasing all FIS payments, have concentrated additional resources on larger, low-income families.  As a result, the disincentives associated with losing the qualified child increases on moving from welfare to work are less relevant than in the past.Despite a significant increase in the number of FIS claims, there remains a perception that the level of FIS take up is low.  To address this issue, it is proposed to commission a specific research project to examine factors behind the level of take up for the scheme.  Tenders to undertake this work have been received by my Department and are being evaluated.  I expect this process to be concluded shortly and the project to commence in the near future.In addition, the three rates of qualified child increase, which had been maintained at the same levels for a number of years, were combined in Budget 2007 into a single high rate of €22 per week in respect of over 340,000 children of welfare families.  For those previously on the lower rates of €16.80 and €19.30 per child per week, this represents a substantial improvement, particularly when taken with child benefit and other increases, without significantly worsening the associated disincentive effects.  When received, the results of the FIS project and the final draft of the NESC report will contribute usefully to the further development of second-tier income support for children in low-income families.

The Act has as its primary purpose the amendment of the Comhairle Act, 2000, to assign additional and enhanced functions to the Citizens Information Board, formerly Comhairle, which operates under the aegis of my Department, to enable it to introduce a personal advocacy service to individuals, in particular those with a disability.  The service will assist the individuals concerned in identifying and understanding their needs and options and assist them in securing their entitlements to social services.  Social services are broadly defined and include health, social welfare, education, family support, housing, taxation, citizenship, consumer matters, employment and training, equality, asylum and immigration.The development of advocacy services remains a priority for my Department and in this regard additional funding of €1.9m has been provided for the Citizens Information Board in 2007 for the development of a personal advocacy service for people with disabilities and for the implementation of the Disability Sectoral Plan.The Personal Advocacy Service will be initially located in Dublin.  When the service is well established, it is anticipated that advocates will be located in a number of key highly populated areas around the country.  However, it is not possible at this stage to give estimates of the number of advocates to be employed.An organisational structure is currently been developed by the Board to meet the needs of the Personal Advocacy Service.  In addition, negotiations and discussions between my Department, the Department of Finance and the Board are ongoing in relation to these structures and the staffing resources required for the provision of the service.  It is envisaged that structures and staffing resources will be in place to enable the new service to be up and running in early 2008.

This compares with a total strength of 10,702 (all ranks) on 30 June, 1997 and represents an increase of 2,476 (or over 23%) in the personnel strength of the Force during that period.  The combined strength (all ranks), of both attested Gardaí and recruits in training on 14 March, 2007 was 14,258.  Furthermore, I should say that on 19 December, 2006, as part of a package of anti-crime measures, the Government approved the continuation of the existing Garda recruitment programme to achieve a total Garda strength of 15,000.  The accelerated intake of approximately 1,100 new recruits per annum into the Garda College will continue until this target is met.  The Garda Budget now stands at €1.4 billion, an 11% increase on 2006.Community Policing is a central feature of current policing policy and members of Community policing units are encouraged to engage with the local communities where they are assigned.  Current policing policy is predicated on the prevention of public order offences; the prevention of crime including crimes of violence against persons and property and the maintenance of an environment conducive to the improvement of quality of life of the residents.  This strategy is, and will continue to be, central to the delivery of a quality policing service.  All Gardaí have a responsibility, inter alia, to be involved in Community Policing issues as they arise.I am further informed by the Garda authorities that the total strength of dedicated community gardaí as at 31 March 2007 is set out in the table below.  The Deputy will appreciate that, as with any large organisation, on any given day, the overall strength of the organisation may fluctuate due, for example, to retirements, resignations etc.Division31/03/2007Carlow/Kildare3Cavan/Monaghan1Clare4Cork City26Cork North2Cork West1DMR East59DMR NC68DMR North57DMR SC38DMR South46DMR West80Donegal18Galway West17Kerry3Laois/Offaly2Limerick42Longford/Westmeath12Louth/Meath14Mayo—Roscommon/Galway East—Sligo/Leitrim5Tipperary10Waterford/Kilkenny21Wexford/Wicklow—It is the responsibility of the Divisional Officer to allocate personnel within their Division.

The Site Selection Committee were advised fully of the matter at their next meeting on 18 January 2005 and decided that the connection was so remote that it would not prejudice his continued involvement.  This is recorded in the minutes of the 7th meeting of the Committee which were published on the Department's website on 3 February 2005.  I am not in a position to inform the House on what steps were taken by the vendor or parties associated with the vendor.

These indicated no apparent significant issues under either heading.  The planning procedure for the proposed prison development will, when it commences, provide full details of comprehensive studies and analyses of the site's flora and fauna and archaeological features (including the methodologies employed) as well as the measures required, if any, to address any issues arising as a result of the development.I am glad to inform the Deputy that, in accordance with assurances I have previously given the House, there are no recorded national monuments on the site.  In addition, the comprehensive surveys undertaken to date have not revealed any archaeological/flora and fauna impediments to the proposed development.

This Scheme is designed to provide financial assistance to qualifying local organisations towards meeting the capital costs associated with the establishment of local community CCTV systems.  Pobal has been engaged to administer the Scheme on behalf of my Department.  Grant aid funding of up to €100,000 is available from my Department with the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs providing matching funding for successful applications from RAPID areas.  Pre-development grants up to €5,000 are also available.In the first round of the Scheme 24 successful groups, including Ballina CCTV Steering Committee-Ballina Chamber, received pre-development grants totalling €115,665 which were paid in 2006.  Pobal invited these groups to submit substantive proposals by 31 January 2007.  Twenty groups, including Ballina CCTV Steering Committee-Ballina Chamber, submitted proposals and to date 11 groups have been approved to receive grants totalling in excess of €1 million, again to be matched in RAPID areas by the funding from the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs.  The final amounts involved will be determined subject to the finalisation of contracts.I am informed by Pobal that the application received from Ballina CCTV Steering Committee-Ballina Chamber for development funding is currently being appraised and it expects to make a recommendation on this proposal to the Project Board (a Board composed of representatives from Department of Environment, Heritage & Local Government, Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, Chamber of Commerce Ireland, Gardaí, Pobal and my Department) in the coming weeks.

#MichaelMcDowellPD	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-party	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-04-25 00:00:00	Prelude	771	The Deputy will appreciate that I cannot comment on individual cases. The Courts are, subject only to the Constitution and the law, independent in the exercise of their judicial functions and members of the Executive are precluded from intervening.  The traditional approach to sentencing is for the Oireachtas to lay down the maximum penalty and for a court having considered all the circumstances of the case to impose an appropriate penalty up to that maximum. This approach reflects the doctrine of the separation of powers. The Executive lays down the possible punishment range but it is for the Courts to decide the punishment to be applied to the offender taking account of the seriousness of the crime and all the circumstances of the case and of the offender.As I have previously stated my preference, in regard to sentencing policy, lies in the development of an effective sentencing jurisprudence from the courts themselves and that collectively and individually the independence of the judiciary is an important value which is enhanced rather than damaged by collective measures taken by the judiciary to ensure consistency, rationality and coherence in sentencing.  A very significant step in the area of sentencing was the decision by the Board of the Courts Service to establish a Steering Committee to plan for and provide a sentencing information system. The Committee, which is composed of four members of the Judiciary and an academic expert, reviewed systems of this nature around the world and decided to establish a pilot project in the Circuit Court in Dublin. Two researchers have begun to collect and collate information on sentencing outcomes in cases on indictment in designated courts in accordance with criteria specified by the Committee.The Criminal Justice Act, 1993 provides that the Director of Public Prosecutions may, where it appears to him that a sentence imposed on indictment is unduly lenient, apply to the Court of Criminal Appeal to review the sentence. The Director of Public Prosecutions is, of course, totally independent in the carrying out of his functions.
#MichaelMcDowellPD	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-party	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-04-25 00:00:00	Prelude	772	The Sex Offenders Act, 2001 sets out the obligations on persons convicted of a range of sexual offences.  A convicted sex offender must notify his/her name(s), date of birth and current home address to the Garda Síochána within seven days of the conviction for the sexual offence concerned or, where the offender is sentenced to imprisonment, from the date of full release from prison.Thereafter, the offender must notify the Gardaí of any change of name or address within seven days of that change.  Notification of any address where the offender spends either as much as seven days or two or more periods amounting to seven days in any twelve month period must also be given to the Gardaí.  If the offender intends to leave the State for a period of seven days or more s/he must inform the Gardaí of this fact and the address at which s/he intends to stay and also notify the Gardaí of his/her return.  If s/he did not intend to stay away for more than seven days but did, s/he must inform the Gardaí within a further seven days.The provisions of the Act extend to any sex offenders entering this jurisdiction from abroad who have an obligation to register in their own countries.  Section 13 of the Act provides that a person convicted outside the State of an offence that would constitute an offence in this jurisdiction for which the person would be subject to the notification requirements of the Act and who enters the State, must comply with these requirements within seven days.  The Act makes it mandatory for a convicted sex offender to inform their employer or future employer of their conviction if their job entails having unsupervised access to children.  The Act also allows for a Chief Superintendent of An Garda Síochána to request the court to make a sex offender order, whereby a sex offender can be prohibited from behaving in a particular way, where such behaviour is perceived by the court as having a potential danger to the welfare of children.  It should be noted that Garda clearance is now required for potential employees in a number of occupations which entail access to, or authority over, children.The Domestic Violence and Sexual Assault Investigation Unit of An Garda Síochána monitor and manage the notification provisions. There are nominated Garda Inspectors in each Garda Division who have responsibility for the monitoring of persons subject to the requirements of the Act in their Division.  As soon as the Domestic Violence and Assault Investigation Unit is advised by a relevant authority, such as the Irish Prison Service, the Courts Service or a foreign law enforcement agency, of the impending release or movement of sex offenders into their area this information is immediately passed to the nominated Inspectors, who are advised of information relevant to their Division.  Any child protection issues arising are advised to the relevant health services authorities, as provided for under the Children First guidelines.There is a very good co-operation in the sharing of information between An Garda Síochána and other law enforcement agencies. Last November I signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) between Ireland and the UK to assist in the sharing of information on sex offenders.  The MoU is part of the work undertaken following the Intergovernmental Agreement on North/South Co-operation on Criminal Justice Matters signed on behalf of the Irish and British Governments in July 2005.  In addition, under the Agreement, a Registered Sex Offender Advisory Group has been established consisting of representatives of An Garda Síochána, the Police Service of Northern Ireland, my Department and the Northern Ireland Office.  As part of its work, this Group evaluates the potential for sharing information, examining the registration criteria in both jurisdictions for sex offenders and identifying areas for further co-operation.Based on five years experience in the operation of the Act, I am proposing a series of changes to the Act with the aim of strengthening the protection it offers to the community.  These will include raising the penalty for failure to register from 12 months to five years imprisonment, thus making it an arrestable offence, and giving probation officers power to prosecute offenders who fail to comply with the terms of a post release supervision order.

I would point out that I have been advised by the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner that it compiles statistics based on individual applications and not on a family basis.YearNo. of asylum applications granted at first instanceNo. of persons granted refugee status at appeal stage199240199310199420199521019962701997197419981284019991663512000211394200145948220028941,09920033458322004430708200545551120063972512007(31/03)10132Total3,8384,704*Cases after 20 November 2000 were processed by the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner and the Refugee Appeals Tribunal.In regard to Leave to Remain, the present statutory position is governed by section 3 (6) of the Immigration Act, 1999 as amended.  An application for leave to remain in the State in these circumstances arises where a non-national is served with a notice of intent to deport under section 3 (3) (a) of the Immigration Act, 1999. A person served with such a notice of intent to deport is afforded three options, viz. to leave the State voluntarily; to consent to the making of a Deportation Order; or to make representations in writing within 15 working days setting out reasons as to why a Deportation Order should not be made and why temporary Leave to Remain in the State be granted instead.In determining whether to make a deportation order or grant temporary leave to remain in the State, I must have regard to the eleven factors set out in Section 3 (6) of the Immigration Act, 1999, as amended, and Section 5 (Prohibition of Refoulement) of the Refugee Act, 1996, as amended.   The number of persons granted leave to remain in the context of the deportation process is set out in Table 2.YearNo. of Persons20001920017720021582003862004207200513720061622007 (31/03)398Total1,244Leave to remain is also granted for other reasons. For example, under the revised arrangements introduced in January 2005 for the processing of applications from the non-national parents of Irish born children, some 17,000 applicants were granted leave to remain.In relation to terms and conditions, applicants for asylum who obtain refugee status have rights and entitlements as set out in section 3 of the Refugee Act, 1996, which include the entitlement to reside in the state, to work, to carry on a business, trade or profession and to have access to education and training as well as access to medical care and social welfare benefits as those to which Irish citizens are entitled. Persons with refugee status are also entitled to apply for family reunification in accordance with section 18 of the Refugee Act 1996. Individuals granted refugee status are also informed of the circumstances under which a declaration as a refugee may be revoked as set out in section 21 of the Refugee Act, 1996.Persons who are granted leave to remain following consideration of their case under section 3 (6) of the Immigration Act, 1999 are required to: obey the laws of the State, not become involved in criminal activity, make every effort to become economically viable in the State by engaging in employment, business or a profession and take all steps (such as participation in training or language courses) to enable them to engage in employment, business or a profession.  The conditions under which permission to remain is granted under the IBC Scheme are the same as those for persons granted leave to remain with an additional condition which requires the applicant to accept that the granting of permission to remain does not confer any entitlement or legitimate expectation on any other person, whether related to the applicant or not, to enter the State.Since 2001 some 8 grants of refugee status have been revoked.  Figures are not available in relation to grants of permission to remain which have been withdrawn.  Under the IBC/05 Scheme, I am advised that less than 0.01% of those granted leave to remain subsequently had their grants revoked due to non-compliance with the criteria of the scheme.
#MichaelMcDowellPD	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-party	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-04-25 00:00:00	Prelude	778	The person concerned was granted a C visit visa to enter the State for a period of three months. It now appears that he is seeking an extension of his permission to remain in the State.  An examination of the papers in relation to the case indicates that the person concerned sought an extension of his C Visit Visa with the Immigration Division of my Department and was refused.  A wrap-around information sheet accompanies every visa application form. That sheet makes it clear to the applicant that, in general, persons granted visas for particular purposes are not permitted to remain in the State for any purpose other than that for which the visa was granted.Every visa applicant is required to state on the application form the dates on which he or she proposes to enter and leave Ireland. He or she is also required to declare that the information supplied is correct and complete.  A C Visa is granted for visits of less than 90 days. As a consequence it is not the general policy to extend permission to remain to persons who are admitted initially for a period of 90 days or less on a C visa, save in very exceptional and unforeseen circumstances.  The person concerned must leave and reapply from outside the State.  Should he wish to return, he should include in his new visa application the purpose and duration of his intended stay.

Where such a building is used or occupied for the purposes of a trade or profession any sums expended on the repair of the building can be claimed as a deduction for tax purposes in computing the profits or gains of the particular trade or profession. Section 81 of the Taxes Consolidation Act, 1997 provides the statutory basis for such deductions.  Where such a building is used as a rented residential property the cost of maintenance, repairs, insurance and management of the premises borne by the landlord may be deducted as an expense from the rental income received in respect of the building for tax purposes. Expenses under this heading must be of a non-capital nature. Section 97 of the Taxes Consolidation Act, 1997 sets out the rules for computing rental income and the deductions which may be made in arriving at that income. In addition, interest on borrowed money employed in the purchase, improvement or repair of the premises can also be set off against the rental income from the premises.Owners of listed buildings that are over 400 years old may be in a position to claim relief under Section 482 of the Taxes Consolidation Act, 1997. That section   provides relief  from income tax/corporation tax to the owner/occupier of an approved building/ in the State for expenditure incurred on the repair, maintenance or restoration of the building/garden.  An approved building is defined as a building within the State which is determined by the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government to be a building which is intrinsically of significant scientific, historical, architectural or aesthetic interest and by Revenue to be a building to which reasonable access is afforded to the public, or which is in use as a "tourist accommodation facility" (ie a guest house) for at least six months in any calendar year. On the issue of reasonable public access, Revenue must be satisfied that various minimum requirements are met. In the case of a guest house, it must be registered or listed by Fáilte Ireland and must be in use as a guest house for at least 6 months of the year, 4 months of which must be in the period 1 May-30 September.  There are no plans to extend the scope of the reliefs outlined above.

As the Deputy will be aware, the EOCP is co-funded by the European Union and timescales agreed with the Commission must be observed as financial penalties will accrue to the State if they are not.The Group in question submitted an EOCP staffing grant application to Pobal, which is engaged to assess EOCP and NCIP grants on behalf of my Office, in October 2006.  Final information required to complete the assessment was received by Pobal from the Group on 6 December 2006.  As it was not possible at that stage for the application to be brought through the assessment and appraisal process and to contract stage by 31 December 2006, it was recommended by the Programme Appraisal Committee that the Group's application under that Programme be declined and that the application be considered in the context of the forthcoming NCIP staffing grant scheme.As the Deputy will be aware, every effort is being made to facilitate a seamless transition between the EOCP and NCIP and, in this context, I agreed to review the position for Groups such as the one referred to by the Deputy who will be in a position to open later this year but are not eligible for staffing grant funding under the EOCP.  I am pleased to say that interim arrangements in respect of the period September-December 2007 have been put in place and the Group's application for staffing grant assistance can now be reconsidered.  I understand that officials in my Office were recently in contact with  the Group to this effect.

The Group is monitoring the operation of the agreement and will amend, if necessary, the provisions of the agreement to take account of service developments, including the new fleet replacement programme currently being put in place by the Air Corps.  The Air Corps introduced two new EC 135 helicopters into service in 2006 and intend to introduce a further six AB 139 helicopters into service (4 in 2007 and 2 in 2008).  Each of the new helicopters has a specific air ambulance capability.  The new fleet will also have a far greater flying capacity than was previously available.Currently, patients requiring transfer by air ambulance to St James's, Beaumont or the Mater Hospitals are flown to Casement Aerodrome (Baldonnell), the Phoenix Park or Dublin Airport.  They are then transported by a ground ambulance to the appropriate hospital.

#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-04-25 00:00:00	Prelude	812	Many EU States continue to operate some form of restriction on entry to the pharmacy profession, and under EU Directive 85/433/EEC they are within their rights to do so.  The initiative for the removal of these restrictions rests with the EU Commission and I would support any moves which the Commission may make in this regard.With respect to Ireland, the Pharmacy Act 2007 will remove the restriction on pharmacists educated in other EU or EEA countries from owning, managing or supervising a pharmacy in Ireland that is less than three years old — the derogation under Article 2.2 of Council Directive 85/433/EEC.  My motivation in removing this "derogation" was to facilitate the many Irish pharmacy graduates who, because of the shortage of pharmacy undergraduate places available in the State, went abroad to train.  On their return these graduates found that they were at a disadvantage to their Irish trained colleagues in not being able to establish a new pharmacy business, having instead to confine themselves to ones which had already been in operation for at least 3 years, a situation that was clearly unfair and unsustainable.

#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-04-25 00:00:00	Prelude	814	My Department and the HSE have been reviewing the pharmaceutical supply chain, with a view to seeking value for money in the State's drugs bill in order to better fund existing and innovative therapies without compromising continuity of supply or patient safety.  The review of the Irish Pharmaceutical Healthcare Association (IPHA) and the Association of Pharmaceutical Manufacturers of Ireland (APMI) Agreements, with the proprietary and generic supplier representative bodies, was completed in mid-2006 and the new agreements are in place.Following completion of the manufacturer agreements and in line with the process agreed by the Cabinet Committee on Health, the State entered talks with the wholesaler representative body, the Pharmaceutical Distributor's Federation (PDF).  As wholesale margins are not addressed in the new IPHA and APMI Agreements, the State intended to negotiate direct formal arrangements with the wholesale sector, to address the cost of wholesale supply to hospital and community through fair, transparent and accountable cost structures.  In particular, the State wished to examine the high margin, relative to the EU,  for wholesale supply to community pharmacy and the wholesalers' claim that they supply hospitals at a loss.Early in discussions, PDF refused to negotiate a new margin for community supply, based on its own legal advice.  Subsequent advice to the HSE, confirmed by the Attorney General's office and Senior Counsel engaged by the Attorney General, indicated that, under section 4 of the 2002 Competition Act, PDF as an association of undertakings may not collectively negotiate fees, prices or margins on behalf of its members.  Given this position, and the fact that the Irish Pharmaceutical Union is also an association of undertakings, it is not possible for the State to negotiate with PDF or the IPU on fees or margins and such negotiations place these bodies at risk of prosecution.The State had intended to address the review of community pharmacy, and in particular how to improve value for money and transparency and fairness in relation to service provision, through negotiation with the IPU, as it had in the past.  This is no longer possible for fees, although contractual matters other than fees may be negotiated.  Accordingly, the negotiating team re-examined, in light of the legal position arising from the wholesaler legal advice, how best to address the review of pharmacy contractor services.  Following consultation with the IPU, a procedure was agreed to examine available options for advancing contractual negotiations in compliance with Irish and EU competition law.  This process, chaired by Mr Bill Shipsey, SC, has commenced.The State continues to recognise the IPU as the representative body for its members, but negotiations with the Union must comply with the law.  The legal issues that emerged during the wholesale sector review were raised by the wholesaler representatives.  Once the State became aware of these issues, it was no longer possible to continue as intended.  There is, and will continue to be, ongoing dialogue with the IPU as the representative body for pharmacists, within the constraints of the competition legislation and the negotiating team will consider, in the context of competition law and in particular the relevant Competition Authority guidelines, all available options for advancing the process agreed by the Cabinet Committee on Health.  I am satisfied that the Cabinet Committee process for review of the supply of drugs to the State is progressing effectively, within the constraints of relevant legislation.

My understanding is that there has been no change in the staffing levels in the adoption area in Cork. However, my Department has requested the Parliamentary Affairs Division of the Executive to arrange to have this matter investigated and to have a reply issued directly to the Deputy.The Government has allocated additional funding to the HSE in recent years to assist in tackling intercountry adoption waiting times. The HSE has been assessing the provision of services in the context of moving from the health board system to a single executive. It has acknowledged that there is a divergence in the provision of services and is committed to addressing those differences.The Deputy will be aware that demands for assessment for intercountry adoption are continuously increasing. It should be noted that consequent on the increased number of children coming from abroad, there is also a new and increasing demand for post-adoption reports for sending countries. These are also being undertaken by HSE social work staff.In a number of areas, the HSE have increased capacity through contract arrangements with non-statutory agencies with appropriate expertise. I have asked my officials to meet with the HSE to explore these and other strategies to increase capacity across the country.

An appeal was lodged in February 2007 but there were problems in locating a record of the claim, and on 18 April 2007, the HSE Appeals Office advised the claimant that as so much time had passed since the refusal of the ENP, a new means and needs assessment would need to be carried out in respect of exceptional needs. The person concerned was advised to contact her local Community Welfare Office for assessment for an exceptional needs payment.

State Pension (Transition) is paid on a Thursday and State Pension (Contributory) is paid on Friday.  The change was implemented from January 2007 for customers receiving payment by electronic fund transfer.  Customers paid by personal payable order were transferred to State Pension Contributory from 30th March 2007.  An additional one day's payment was included in the first order in their new book.For customers who are unable to collect their payment on a Friday, arrangements can be made for collection on any day of the week thereafter excluding Sunday.

In Budget 2007: i. Contributory State pensions were increased by €16 per week, or 8.3%, with proportionate increases being given to those on reduced rates of payment; ii. The State Pension Non-Contributory was increased by €18 per week or 9.9%. This means that the Government has now achieved its commitment to bring the rate of the basic State pension to €200 per week; iii. The lowest rates of social welfare payments increased by €20 per week, or 12.1%. This increase brings the lowest rates of payment to €185.80 per week, thereby ensuring that the Government commitment on the lowest rates of payment is fully achieved.Recipients with children also benefited from the increase in the child dependant allowances to €22 per week (an increase of up to 23.6% for certain recipients) and the €10 per month increase in Child Benefit rates.  In addition, the fuel allowance was increased by €4 per week to €18. This means that this allowance has doubled over the last two Budgets.By any standards, the levels of increases and other improvements announced in the Budget were exceptional and a further demonstration of this Government's ongoing commitment to the most vulnerable in our society by delivering social welfare increases which are well in excess of inflation.

It is paid at a standard weekly rate equivalent to the maximum rate of the relevant social welfare payment that qualifies the applicant for participation in the scheme.  It essentially replaces their existing social welfare income and in addition an annual €400 cost of education allowance is payable.To qualify for participation an applicant must, inter alia, be in receipt of a relevant social welfare payment and must be at least 21 years of age prior to commencing an approved course of study.  People in receipt of disability related payments may access the scheme at 18 years of age.  Similarly, lone parents and people in receipt of unemployment payments can qualify at 18 years of age provided they are out of formal education for at least 2 years.The current scheme is in place since January 1998 and has been subject to review and modification over the years to ensure it continues to support those people who are most distant from the labour market and whose need is greatest.  In the 2005 Budget I reduced the qualifying period for access to the third level option of the scheme from 15 to 12 months and at that time, I also increased the annual cost of education allowance, paid to people on BTEA, from €254 to €400.Following an undertaking to the Dáil and the Social Affairs Committee, I further reduced the qualifying period for access to the third level option to 9 months.  This condition applies to persons who are participating in the National Employment Action Plan (NEAP) process and where a FÁS Employment Services Officer recommends pursuance of a third level course of study as essential to the enhancement of the individuals employment prospects.  This new condition also came into effect from 1 September 2005.In the 2006 Budget, I announced that time spent in receipt of supplementary welfare allowance from the Health Service Executive or the direct provision system operated by the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform can count towards the qualifying period for back to education allowance in circumstances where the person establishes an entitlement to a relevant social welfare payment prior to commencing an approved course of study.  This provision came into effect from 1 September 2006.In the most recent Budget, I announced that people who are awarded Statutory Redundancy may access the BTEA scheme immediately provided an entitlement to a relevant social welfare payment is established prior to commencing an approved course of study.  I also reduced the qualifying period for illness benefit recipients from three to two years.  These further improvements to the BTEA scheme will come into effect from the beginning of the new academic year, i.e. 1 September 2007.I will continue to monitor the scheme but I believe that, overall, the current arrangements ensure that my Department's back to education allowance scheme continues to support those people who are most distant from the labour market and whose need is greatest.

These included a commitment to raise the qualified adult increase for the spouses and partners (age 66 or over) of contributory pensioners to the level of the state pension (non-contributory).   Spouses and partners of non-contributory pensioners may receive a pension in their own right at age 66.To this end, Budget 2007 provided for an increase of €23.70 per week in the qualified adult payment where the qualified adult is aged 66 or over, bringing it up to a maximum rate of €173 per week. This measure benefited some 35,500 couples. It is my intention to complete the process of aligning the rates in question within three years. Based on current rates of payment, it will cost €47 million to fulfil this commitment.
#SeamusBrennan	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-party	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-dob	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-04-25 00:00:00	Prelude	833	I propose to take Questions Nos. 189 and 190 together.My Department operates two main types of pension scheme — contributory and non-contributory payments. Contributory payments are paid on the basis of social insurance contributions made over a person's working life. Missionaries who have made sufficient social insurance contributions can qualify for the state pension (contributory).  These pensions are payable abroad and so missionaries who qualify and who choose to settle overseas can receive a payment. Non-contributory pensions are only payable where a person is resident in this country.The question of paying pensions to missionaries who remain abroad was first raised in the context of a submission to the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Foreign Affairs by the Irish Missionary Union. Officials of my Department made a presentation to the Committee on the issue. Following that presentation, the Chairperson of the Committee decided to establish a working group to look at the issues raised in more detail.The Department prepared a report on the issues in question in consultation with the Department of Foreign Affairs and submitted this to the Committee on the 13th March 2007. The report includes information on social security arrangements made by a number of other countries in relation to volunteer development workers and missionaries.I look forward to receiving the views of the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Foreign Affairs when it has considered the report prepared by my Department and the Department of Foreign Affairs. Proposals can then be developed further in consultation with Irish Aid and the development agencies in Ireland.

The package is also available to carers and people with disabilities under the age of 66 who are in receipt of certain welfare type payments.  Widows and widowers aged from 60 to 65 whose late spouses had been in receipt of the household benefit package or free travel retain that entitlement. This measure is in place to ensure that households who have this entitlement do not lose it on the death of a spouse.People aged over 70 years of age can qualify for the household benefits package regardless of their income or household composition.  Those aged under 70 must live alone or only with certain excepted people in order to qualify.  Excepted people for the purposes of the scheme include qualified adults, dependent children under age 18 or under age 22 if in full time education, people who are so incapacitated as to require constant care and attention for at least 12 months, people who would qualify for the allowance in their own right, people who are providing constant care and attention to any member of the household who is so incapacitated as to require constant care and attention for at least 12 months.In recognition of recent increases in the price of natural gas and electricity, I have provided for significant increases to the gas and electricity allowances.  I provided for the number of units of electricity covered by the scheme to increase from 1,800 to 2,400 with effect from January 2007.  I also made provision for an equivalent increase in the natural gas allowance which came into effect in October 2006.  These allowances also cover increased standing charges and the associated VAT.The telephone allowance provides a payment towards telephone service costs.  It is applied as a cash credit on recipient's telephone bills. The value of the allowance is set at €20.41 per month (€24.70 including VAT) or €40.82 for those who are billed on a 2-monthly basis (€49.40 including VAT).In Budget 2007 I provided for the telephone allowance to be extended to cover mobile phones.  Under this new arrangement, which takes effect from this month, customers have the choice to opt either for a direct credit to a telephone company for their landline as at present or for a cash payment in respect of their mobile phone.A range of proposals have been made to extend the coverage of the household benefits package of free schemes. These proposals are kept under review in the context of the objectives of the scheme and budgetary resources.

The contributory widow(er)'s pension is available to those who satisfy the necessary PRSI contribution conditions, either on their own record or that of the deceased spouse.  Those qualifying for this benefit are not subject to a means test.Those without the necessary PRSI contributions can, if they have qualifying children, receive the one-parent family payment. This is a means tested payment which comprises an earnings disregard, which is designed to assist with the extra costs those with children face in trying to access training or employment. Up to €146.50 of earnings per week is completely disregarded, while earnings in excess of that and up to €375 per week are assessed at 50%.  In addition, people whose earnings have risen above €375 per week may be entitled to half of their payment for up to 26 weeks.  This upper threshold will increase to €400 per week next month.The widowed parent grant, introduced in 2000, also provides additional assistance following a bereavement to those with children and is paid in addition to the usual after death payments such as the bereavement grant, currently €850.  I was pleased to increase the grant by €1,300 to €4,000 in the last Budget in recognition of the particular difficulties faced by widows and widowers with children on the death of a spouse.One of the key objectives of the 2007 social welfare package was to protect and enhance the value of all weekly rates of payment, including the rate of widow's and widower's pensions, in relative terms by giving increases which are well in excess of projected inflation for this year.  Younger widows and widowers benefited from the €20 per week increase, or 12.1%, in the weekly rates of payment for persons of working age, including the widow/er's non-contributory pension (aged under 66) and the one parent family payment.  This increase brings the rates of payment for widows and widowers to €185.80 per week for non-contributory payments, and €191.30 for contributory payments.Increases in the rates of child benefit assist those widowed with children.  Since 1997, the monthly rates of child benefit have been increased significantly in accordance with Government commitments.  Following Budget 2007 the rates of child benefit were increased to €160.00 per month for each of the first and second children and €195.00 per month for the third and subsequent children.  Furthermore, children under 6 years of age also qualify for the annual €1,000 early child care supplement (ECS) announced in Budget 2006.  In addition, widows and widowers with children also benefited from the increase in the child dependant allowances to €22 per week.Widowed persons are also entitled to the fuel allowance, back to school clothing and footwear allowance and other secondary benefits on the same basis as other social welfare recipients.  The level of increases and other improvements announced in the Budget were exceptional and a further demonstration of this Government's ongoing commitment to the most vulnerable in our society.I will continue to keep the range and adequacy of the supports provided under review.  As the House will be aware, I launched a Government discussion paper "Proposals for Supporting Lone Parents" last year.  This discussion paper proposes replacing the one parent family payment with a new social assistance payment and puts forward a range of proposals for the expanded availability and range of education, training and employment supports for lone parents.  The new social assistance payment is being developed by my Department and the Government have asked the Senior Officials Group on Social Inclusion to progress the non-income recommendations in the report.

This new Programme builds on the success of the pilot Rural Transport Initiative (2000-2006) and puts it on a permanent mainstreamed basis with significantly increased funding. The provision of transport for older people and people with disabilities is a core feature of the new programme and all thirty-four of the currently funded groups provide these services.Pobal are co-ordinating a facilitated process to ensure national coverage for the RTP.  The aim of this process is to make recommendations with respect to the optimum formal structural arrangements to manage the RTP at local level into the future and to achieve national coverage. I understand that consultants have been contracted by Pobal to carry out work in that regard, which will be undertaken on a phased basis.Once the areas that currently have coverage within the RTP are agreed, the consultants will be examining areas where there are gaps in coverage. I am advised that it is likely that work in the Galway and Roscommon areas will be initiated in May. Pobal advise that all expressions of interest received with respect to this area, including that from the North Galway Transport Advisory Committee, are held on file and will be considered. Pobal also advise that some funding has been reserved within the Programme specifically for new areas.

It will be an offence for a body not on the register to claim that it is a charity or to operate or fund-raise in the State. In order to be registered, a body will have to supply key information about its existing and proposed activities with its application.In addition, it is proposed to have agreed codes of good practice in relation to actual fund-raising and collections generally. Work on these agreed codes has already advanced significantly, in cooperation with the charities sector.

These include the streamlining of administrative procedures for the approval of applications and the release to applicants of the newly revised Standard Costings used to assess the financial implications of proposed investments carried out under the Scheme.   As a result, the number of approvals issued to farmers to commence work under the Scheme has increased significantly in recent weeks.   The staffing levels in the local AES offices of my Department are also reviewed on an ongoing basis to ensure that the necessary staffing resources are in place to ensure delivery of the Scheme.The revised Standard Costings used to calculate the level of grants under the Farm Waste Management Scheme are now available on my Department's web-site.

A near 100 per cent increase in the volume of quota traded through the exchange demonstrates that the scheme is meeting the requirements of most milk producers in a time of change for the sector.  I am pleased that the volume of quota made available to priority categories such as young farmers and small farmers has increased by more than 30 per cent.A total of just over 177 million litres of milk quota was offered for sale, with almost 124 million litres traded.  Of this total, 86.2 million litres was sold on the exchange at prices ranging from 9 to 28 cent per litre, and 37.5 million litres was sold through the priority pool at the maximum price of 12 cent per litre, with the exception of two Co-ops where the priority pool quota was sold at exchange prices of 9 and 11 cent.My Department will now undertake a thorough analysis of the Milk Quota Trading Scheme's first year results, and a comprehensive review of the scheme will be carried out in consultation with the main farming organisations and ICOS before the detailed arrangements for quota trading in the 2008/2009 milk quota year are agreed.

#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-04-25 00:00:00	Prelude	854	The existing pre-service teacher training programmes in the Colleges of Education (primary teacher training) include specific elements aimed at enabling all student teachers to recognise and deal with children with special educational needs, including pupils with Autism.My Department holds ongoing discussions with the Colleges of Education to ensure that appropriate responses are made at pre-service level in relation to the continuing needs of all trainee teachers to acquire knowledge of, and familiarity with, the needs of pupils with special educational needs, including Autism.I would like to point out that my Department has developed a strategy to meet the continuing professional development of teachers working with pupils with special educational needs. This strategy has resulted in a major expansion in the range of post-graduate professional development programmes for teachers.  These programmes, which are available annually, include the "Masters in Special Educational Needs (MSEN)", "Combined Post-Graduate Diploma Programme of Continuous Professional Development for Teachers involved in Learning Support and Special Education" and the "Graduate Certificate Course in the Education of Pupils with Autism". It is a central feature of all these courses that teachers are given the necessary skills and expertise to recognise Autism as well as providing the training to meet the needs of students with autism and special educational needs in general.Ongoing support in the area of Special Educational Needs is provided by the Special Education Support Service (SESS). The SESS was established as part of the Department's overall strategy on continuing professional development of teachers working with pupils with special educational needs, and it undertakes a number of approaches to address the training needs with a view to enhancing the teaching and learning for children with special educational needs. The SESS provides a dedicated support team of expert teachers delivering a range of supports to schools through seminar delivery and individual school visits. In 2006, over 4,000 training places were funded by the SESS to enable teachers to access a range of autism training. The recognition of Autistic Spectrum Disorders forms an integral part of all supports provided by the SESS. This support and training in the recognition of Autism informs training across the educational spectrum, both in mainstream and special schools.

It was not possible to accede to this request due to the high level of existing commitments in the youth sector and the large number of new applications received this year, eighty three (83) in total.Having regard also to the finances available in 2007 and the year-on-year costs of sanctioning new projects it was decided to sanction a maximum of three (3) new one-worker projects. The projects selected were Remember Us Youth Project, Co. Dublin, Belvedere Youth Project, Dublin City and the Curragh Youth Project, Co. Kildare.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-04-25 00:00:00	Prelude	856	The school referred to by the Deputy originally applied for an extension and refurbishment to provide for improved ancillary accommodation. The project proposed initially did not include additional mainstream classrooms and having regard to competing demands on the building programme the application was at that time afforded a lower priority rating.The school submitted an application under the Small Schools Scheme 2007 for additional accommodation including mainstream classrooms. On 5 March 2007, I announced details of the schools to receive funding under this Scheme. Due to the volume of applications received in the Department it was not possible to allocate funding to all proposed projects and the school referred to by the Deputy was not successful in this instance.The Department recently received an appeal from the school in relation to the initial decision which will be considered further.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-04-25 00:00:00	Prelude	857	Distance learning programmes at undergraduate level are already provided in a range of higher-education institutions. In 2006, there were 1,696 students enrolled in these programmes, studying a wide range of disciplines, in the university sector.   Distance education programmes are also available in a number of institutes of technology. Decisions on course delivery methods are matters for individual higher education institutions and I support the continued development of varied and flexible programmes focused on the needs of learners.

The SENO is also a focal point of contact for parents and schools.I am informed that the local SENO has arranged to meet the school authorities and the child's parents within the coming days to discuss the child's needs.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-04-25 00:00:00	Prelude	859	The need for an autistic unit has been determined and an application for capital funding for additional accommodation, including an autistic unit, has been received from the school to which the Deputy refers. This application is being assessed with reference to factors such as current and projected enrolments at the school, the likely impact of ongoing and proposed housing developments and the existing provision in the general area.When this assessment is complete, a decision will be taken on how best to provide for the current and emerging accommodation needs at the school. I am pleased to advise the Deputy that applications from schools for additional accommodation for units for children with autism are being given priority within the building programme and I have arranged for one of my officials to contact the school in question to advise them of the position.In accordance with the prioritisation criteria for school building projects agreed with the Education Partners, projects involving the provision of specialist accommodation urgently required for children with special needs such as autism are afforded a Band 1 priority by the Department.
#SeanHaughey	unknown-#SeanHaughey-party	unknown-#SeanHaughey-dob	unknown-#SeanHaughey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-04-25 00:00:00	Prelude	860	The Youthreach Programme is an Inter-Departmental initiative launched in 1988, which provides two years integrated education, training and work experience to young people aged 15-20 years who are at least six months in the labour market and who have left school early without any qualifications or vocational training.  The programme is funded by my Department and delivered in out-of-school centres and is managed by Vocational Education Committees (VECs). There are a total of 90 Youthreach Centres managed by the VEC sector throughout the country.Overall, there are about 6,500 places available nationally at present, 3,250 of which are in the VEC sector and the remainder are in Community Training Centres under the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment.  The Social Partnership Agreement 2006-2015, "Towards 2016", provides a commitment to increase places on the Youthreach programme in my Department by 1,000 by the end of 2009. The Estimates for 2007 included funding for 400 of those new places to be provided this year and I have recently announced the allocation of those 400 new places. This brings the overall total number of places available in the VEC sector to over 3,600.Youthreach is not regarded as a pilot programme.  The continued operation of the programme in a particular area is based on the continued need for an alternative provision to mainstream schooling to cater for early school leavers.  Basic skills training, practical work training and general education are features of the programme. The application of new technology is integrated into all aspects of programme content. The programme lays a strong emphasis on personal development, and on the core skills of literacy/numeracy, communications and IT, along with a choice of vocational options, such as Catering, Hairdressing, Computers, Woodwork, Photography, Video, Sports, Art and Craft and a work experience programme.My Department is currently also in the process of rolling out an initiative on a pilot basis in twenty centres to meet the special educational needs of students attending Youthreach.  Expenditure on the programme in 2006 by my Department was close to €52 million.  In addition, the Department provides funding to VECs annually to assist towards the child care expenses of participants in Youthreach.

#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-04-25 00:00:00	Prelude	862	As the Deputy will be aware, my Department provides a range of teaching and care supports for children of school-going age with special educational needs, including children with Down Syndrome. The precise level of support is determined by the special educational needs of the particular child.Children with Down Syndrome are entitled to additional provision in school, either under the terms of the general allocation system of teaching supports if the educational psychological assessment places the child in the high incidence disability category or through an allocation of additional resources if the child is assessed as being within the low incidence category of special need, as defined by my Department's circular.In circumstances where a Down Syndrome child has other associated needs and would fall into the low incidence disability category, this would automatically attract additional resource teaching support. Such applications are made to the local special educational needs organiser by the school.  Special need assistant (SNA) support is provided specifically to address the care needs of pupils with special educational needs. The nature and level of support provided is based on the assessed needs of the individual child having regard to the criteria set out in my Department's circulars.  The provision of speech and language services is a matter for the Health Service Executive (HSE) and funding is provided to the HSE for such purposes.I am satisfied that the mechanisms are in place to provide appropriate resources for children with special needs in our schools, including those with Down Syndrome.

#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-04-25 00:00:00	Prelude	865	I understand the Deputy is referring to the payment of a home tuition grant as part of the 2006 July Education Programme.I wish to assure the Deputy that every effort is made to process all claims for payment as speedily as possible.With regard to the specific case referred to by the Deputy, I can confirm that 40 hours home based tuition for the month of July 2006 was sanctioned for the child in question on the 14th June, 2006.  A claim for payment was received from the family on 16th August, 2006.  My Department's records confirm that payment issued on 15th September, 2006.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-04-25 00:00:00	Prelude	866	The compulsory school starting age in a National School is 6 years of age.Enrolment in individual schools is the responsibility of the managerial authority of those schools and my Department does not seek to intervene in decisions made by schools in such matters. My Department's main responsibility is to ensure that schools in an area can, between them, cater for all pupils seeking places. This may result, however, in some pupils not obtaining a place in the school of their first choice.It is the responsibility of the managerial authorities of schools that are not in a position to admit all pupils seeking entry to implement an enrolment policy in accordance with the Education Act. In this regard a board of management may find it necessary to restrict enrolment to children from a particular area or a particular age group or, occasionally, on the basis of some other criterion. In formulating an admissions policy a school must, however, ensure it is lawful. In particular, it must act in accordance with section 7 of the Equal Status Act 2000.Where a Board of Management refuses to enrol a student in a school, the parent of the student or, where the student has reached 18 years of age, the student himself or herself, following the conclusion of any appeal procedures at school level, has a statutory entitlement under section 29 of the Education Act to appeal that decision to the Secretary General of the Department of Education and Science. A committee is established to hear the appeal with hearings conducted with a minimum of formality. In most cases appeals must be dealt with within 30 days. Where appropriate, the Secretary General may give whatever directions to the Board of Management that are considered necessary to remedy the matter complained of.Details on appealing decisions on enrolment under section 29 of the Education Act are available on my Department's website at www.education.ie.

Currently, VEC staff, including the Directors of these Centres, do not have access to the Labour Relations Commission or the Labour Court. However, the Department agreed to attend a Labour Relations Commission conciliation conference on the issue on an ad-hoc basis. Such a conference was held on 21 March 2007 at which no agreement could be reached.Steps are currently being taken to amend the Industrial Relations Act, 1990, which would allow VEC staff, including the Directors of these centres, access to the Labour Relations Commission and the Labour Court.
#DickRoche	unknown-#DickRoche-party	unknown-#DickRoche-dob	unknown-#DickRoche-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-04-25 00:00:00	Prelude	868	I am not clear what type of monitoring group is envisaged by the Deputy.  Section 48 of the Local Government Act 2001 provides that each city and county council must establish strategic policy committees (SPCs), comprising elected members and sectoral interests, to consider the formulation, development, monitoring and review of policy relating to local authority functions, including planning, and to advise the council on those matters.
#DickRoche	unknown-#DickRoche-party	unknown-#DickRoche-dob	unknown-#DickRoche-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-04-25 00:00:00	Prelude	869	Improvements to non-national roads, including the provision of traffic calming measures, are matters for the relevant local authority to be funded from its own resources supplemented by State grants provided by my Department.In 2007, the total grant allocation by my Department to Mayo County Council for non-national roads is €31,625,821. This includes a Discretionary Improvement grant allocation of €1,651,000. Local authorities may, at their discretion, fund various eligible works on non-national roads from this discretionary grant allocation, including traffic management and traffic calming measures.A Low Cost Safety Improvement Works scheme of grants for non-national roads was introduced by my Department in 2000 as an extension of the scheme operated on national roads under the auspices of the National Roads Authority (NRA).  The NRA assesses applications for grant assistance under the non-national roads scheme on behalf of my Department.  The criteria for grant approval are based on accident data, inspection of sites, locations showing demonstrable hazard and discussions between the local authority and the NRA. Applications were invited from local authorities in 2006 for consideration for grant assistance in 2007 under this scheme.  In 2007, my Department has allocated over €7.86 million to local authorities in respect of Low Cost Safety Improvement Works on non-national roads and Mayo County Council received a grant allocation of €233,000. The Council did not, however, include works at Glencastle National School. It is open to Mayo County Council to submit an application, for eligible works, for consideration for funding under this scheme in 2008 when my Department invites applications later in the year. The initial selection and prioritisation of works to be considered for funding under the scheme is a matter for the Council.Legislation governing the application of speed limits to public roads is contained in the Road Traffic Acts.  Roads authorities have responsibility, under the Road Traffic Acts, for the application of speed limits to, and the provision of speed limit signs on, roads. My Department has no function in the matter.
#DickRoche	unknown-#DickRoche-party	unknown-#DickRoche-dob	unknown-#DickRoche-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-04-25 00:00:00	Prelude	870	To address the issue of accumulated backlogs of farm plastic, designated facilities are being provided on a temporary, once-off basis by local authorities where farmers may deposit stockpiled farm film plastic and silage wrap.  These special arrangements operated on a pilot basis in the first instance in counties Clare, Galway, Mayo, Offaly and Waterford during June and July of last year.  The service was provided free to the farmer and funding to assist the local authorities is being made available from my Department through the Environment Fund.The collections were well supported by farmers in the counties participating in the pilot phase, leading to large quantities of plastic being deposited at designated sites.  A significant finding from the pilot scheme was that it is not possible to operate collections in a large number of counties at the same time due to capacity constraints on the part of recovery operators.  Accordingly, it was necessary to roll out the scheme to other areas on a staggered basis.  Arising from a comprehensive examination of the information available, I approved further collections of waste silage / bale wrap by Carlow, Leitrim, Longford, North Tipperary, Roscommon and Wicklow County Councils which concluded in January of this year.  It is estimated that in excess of 15,000 tonnes of plastics were recovered by the eleven local authorities that have operated collections to date.Following a review of the outcome of the second round of collections, I have recently announced that collections of waste silage / bale wrap will now be put in place in a further 18 county council areas over the next 6 months.  When the final phase is completed, collections will have taken place in all 29 county council areas. This arrangement allows for phased collections while at the same time creating certainty in the minds of farmers as to when their backlog will be cleared.  It also allows local authorities and local farming organisations sufficient notice to agree and put in place the necessary arrangements for collections in their areas.The collections are now being rolled out as follows:DatesCountiesPhase OneCurrently being implementedDonegal, Cork (West), Cavan, Sligo, Kilkenny, South Tipperary, MeathPhase TwoJune\July 2007Kerry, Limerick, Cork (East), Westmeath, Monaghan, Wexford, LaoisPhase ThreeSeptember\October 2007Fingal, South Dublin, Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown, Kildare, LouthThe dates and locations of collections in South Tipperary are a matter for the local authority but I understand that South Tipperary County Council is currently putting in place the necessary arrangements and that collections will take place in May.
