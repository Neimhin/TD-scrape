#RoryKiely	unknown-#RoryKiely-party	unknown-#RoryKiely-dob	unknown-#RoryKiely-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-11-22 00:00:00	Prelude	0	I have received notice from Senator Dooley that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:The need for the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government to examine the feasibility study for the construction of a river crossing at Killaloe, County Clare, and an associated bypass of Killaloe.I have also received notice from Senator Browne of the following matter:The need for the Minister for Education and Science to indicate the progress being made on two applications to her Department from Scoil Naoimh Molaise, Old Leighlin, County Carlow — the permanent accommodation scheme 2007 and an application for grant aid for major works.I have also received notice from Senator Kitt of the following matter:The need for the Minister for Health and Children to indicate if there are proposals to have generic drugs available in Ireland similar to other European countries.I have also received notice from Senator Wilson of the following matter:The need for the Minister for Education and Science to make a statement on the future of the Tanagh outdoor education centre, Dartrey, Rockcorry, County Monaghan.I have also received notice from Senator Bannon of the following matter:The need for the Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs to provide an up date on the current status of the application made by MacEoin Park residents' association, Longford, for funding under the programme of grants for locally-based community and voluntary organisations.I have also received notice from Senator Ulick Burke of the following matter:The need for the Minister for Education and Science to rescind her decision to withdraw the home school community liaison scheme at St. Brigid's vocational school, Loughrea, from September 2007 as this will cause serious concern to parents, teachers, the local education liaison committee and community representatives due to its positive impact since establishment.I regard the matters raised by the Senators as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment.  I have selected the matters raised by Senators Dooley, Browne and Kitt and they will be taken at the conclusion of business.   Senators Wilson, Bannon and Ulick Burke may give notice on another day of the matters they wish to raise.
#MaryORourke	unknown-#MaryORourke-party	unknown-#MaryORourke-dob	unknown-#MaryORourke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-11-22 00:00:00	Prelude	1	The Order of Business is No. 1, a referral motion to be taken without debate, whereby the subject matter of motion 17 on today's Order Paper is being referred for consideration to the Joint Committee on Arts, Sport, Tourism, Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs.  The Official Languages Act 2003 seeks to provide a framework and mechanism for planned improvements in the delivery of public services through Irish in order that the State's obligations can be met in a coherent way and with progress being achieved in the context of existing resources over time.  The Act provides for this to be achieved in three ways, through directly applicable provisions of the Act applicable to all public bodies, through the agreement of language schemes with individual public bodies and through regulations to be made by the Minister in accordance with the terms of the Act.  The proposed regulations will represent a key step in the implementation of the act on a phased basis.  The Department of Community Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs consulted the other Departments prior to the drafting of the regulations.  No. 2, the Prisons Bill 2006 — Order for Second Stage and Second Stage will be taken on the conclusion of the Order of Business until 5.00 p.m., with the contributions of spokespersons not to exceed 15 minutes and those of other Senators not to exceed ten minutes. No. 25, motion 25 will be taken from 5.00 p.m. until 7.00 p.m.
#BrianHayes	unknown-#BrianHayes-party	unknown-#BrianHayes-dob	unknown-#BrianHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-11-22 00:00:00	Prelude	2	There is no significant international or domestic evidence that the international trafficking Mafia regards Ireland as a lucrative market for the sex trade.  The Council of Europe produced a new convention on this issue as late as May 2005 and Ireland has not signed it.  The reason we cannot sign up to it is that the legal basis for protecting people and prosecuting those responsible for trafficking in degrading conditions has not yet been put in place by the Government.  The television programme  "Prime Time Investigates" raised this issue last year and the Leader took an initiative.  Why do we refuse to sign up to an international convention that would give protection and rights to the victims of those trafficked and place on a statutory footing new protection to ensure the perpetrators are imprisoned and their assets seized?We have a responsibility to raise this matter, given the excellent discussion on this elsewhere.  The Government knew of this problem internationally and domestically but we still have not seen the legislation.  Why can it not be published?  The Seanad is the perfect forum to make progress on the legislation.When the St. Andrews Agreement was published the Government stated that it would be guided by the advice of the Attorney General on the need for a referendum in the South to endorse the agreement.  I stated there was no need for a referendum because the changes were an internal matter in the North and as such were covered by the Northern Ireland Act 1998 passed by the House of Commons.  Sinn Féin and the DUP seek an election and what they want they get.  An election will be held.What is the advice of the Attorney General on the matter?  Why is his advice not published?  Now that an election is to be held, there is no need for a referendum and the advice will state that.  The Attorney General should publish the advice because the Government sought it.I welcome the Pauline conversion of the Tánaiste and Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to the Criminal Law (Home Defence) Bill that Fine Gael published some months ago.  At the time he rubbished it and voted it down, stating that it was not needed.  The Law Reform Commission wisely stated that the sensible proposal adopted by the Fine Gael Leader is the way to proceed.  I welcome the fact that the Tánaiste, a Walter Mitty figure in Irish politics, has come round to our way of thinking.

#JoeOToole	unknown-#JoeOToole-party	unknown-#JoeOToole-dob	unknown-#JoeOToole-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-11-22 00:00:00	Prelude	5	A petitions committee established by the House would be impressed by the level of consultation by the group of people who spoke to us on child trafficking.  I agree with the points made by Senator Brian Hayes in this respect.  It is an example of how engagement with the public can work when legislation is proposed.  I was sickened to hear how innocent young women from foreign countries are used, abused and drawn into the sex trade in our country and that we have no legislation to protect them.My understanding on this matter differs from Senator Hayes in that we have signed the protocol but have not yet ratified it.  In order to do so we must publish legislation or the heads of a Bill.  I understand the difficulty in the former but I do not see difficulty in publishing the latter.  If the Government was to do so it could ratify the protocol with the publication of the heads of the Bill.  Perhaps the Leader can verify this.  We cannot allow Ireland to be the destination of choice for those who seek to abuse, exploit and destroy young women's lives.  It is wrong that we facilitate this by not publishing legislation.Tá brón orm i gcónaí a bheith ag argóint agus ag cur i gcoinne na moltaí a thagann ón Aire Gnóthaí Pobail, Tuaithe agus Gaeltachta, ach tá deacracht agam le tairiscint Uimh. 1 inniu.  De ghnáth, táim go mór i bhfábhar aidhmeanna an Aire agus an méid a iarrann sé a dhéanamh.  An uair seo, tá sé ag brú rialacháin siar scornaí na daoine atá ina choinne.  It is not doing the Irish language any good.  I do not see any good in forcing bodies such as the Crisis Pregnancy Agency or the Refugee Appeals Tribunal to have their telephone answering systems in Irish as well as in English.  I am concerned about this because a considerable body of influential people in this country are agnostic about the Irish language and do not have strong views on it one way or the other, and we are driving them into the corner against us.I will support the Minister in trying to achieve the objectives of this set of regulations as long as we do it to mealladh as opposed to éigeantach.  I do not want to force people and I believe we should try to convince them to do it.  It is a good idea but putting pressure on organisations to change all their answering messages will simply mean that this issue will arise in board meetings in 500 different organisations and the boards will have to make a decision which will involve additional cost and inconvenience.  Someone will say something negative about the Irish language during every one of those meetings and we will lose out.We are very near the tipping point in terms of attitudes towards Gaeilge sa tír seo agus cuireann sé isteach go mór orm a bheith i gcoinne an Aire arís sa mhéid seo.  Ba chóir go mbeimis ar aon-taobh sa rud seo ach nílimid.  Ba mhaith liom díospóireacht ar an ábhar seo.  Tá sé ag dul go dtí the joint committee but is probably as relevant to the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Finance and the Public Service or the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Enterprise and Small Business as it is to the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Arts, Sport, Tourism, Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs.This is the kind of thing that gives Irish a bad name.  We passed legislation which required the same companies to bring forward their tuarascáil cheann bliana, their annual reports, as Gaeilge.  We had to pay a considerable amount of money to get this done.  Chuir mé glaoch ar an Government Publications Office ar an méid den aistriúchán den Budget Statement a ceannaíodh san office.  It had not sold one of them.  What are we doing?  We should ask ourselves some hard questions.

#BrendanRyan	unknown-#BrendanRyan-party	unknown-#BrendanRyan-dob	unknown-#BrendanRyan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-11-22 00:00:00	Prelude	15	In respect of the issue of people trafficking, which was raised by Senator Brian Hayes and Senator O'Toole, I do not understand why we are so slow with regard to this issue.  This country has a well-developed sensitivity about issues which arise in poor countries and affect poor people.  It is one of this country's great qualities. That 300 unaccompanied minors who came to this country seeking asylum have gone missing and that the number is increasing should have us exploding with anger.  Similarly, the fact that, according to organisations campaigning against trafficking, more women and children were enslaved by trafficking during the 1980s than were enslaved from Africa during the 400 years of the slave trade should concern us.I want the Government to introduce legislation quickly and I want us to be very clear that anyone involved in what is called the sex trade, including lap dancing clubs, who is found to employ illegal immigrants should be presumed to be a party to trafficking and should have to prove he or she was not involved.  Otherwise his or her assets should be confiscated.  There should be no room for ambiguity.  Anybody who employs people in dubious circumstances in any area related to sexual abuse ought to pay a penalty.  I appeal to the Government to do this.Will the Leader indicate if she could find time at least to initiate a debate on the Genealogy and Heraldry Bill 2006, which is on the Order Paper?  It is a complicated issue which will never grab headlines, and neither the Leader nor I will get votes out of it but it is worth pursuing.We have not yet had a debate on nursing homes and that issue will not go away.  It is getting more complicated and more difficult to understand what the Health Service Executive is doing in terms of its reporting, inspection and other procedures.  We have been promised a debate on this issue for some time and we should have it.The EU announced yesterday that it is seeking yet further massive cutbacks in fish catches.  The west and the south have relied on fishing to a considerable extent to keep people working in those regions.  If our fisheries are to be effectively wiped out, that will be yet another blow to those regions. The fish caught in our waters by other than Irish trawlers since we joined the EU is probably worth approximately €30 billion.  That is what we gave away.  If we made a decision to give that away, that is fair enough, but if we are to give away what is left or wipe it out, I ask the Leader to arrange for a debate on the issue in the immediate future.

During the debate on this case yesterday in the other House the Taoiseach conceded we have too many guns, criminals and murderers on our streets.  That is an incredible statement from a Taoiseach who has been in Government for the past ten years.  Admittedly, the Leader of the Progressive Democrats Party was not in the House when the Taoiseach made that statement.  He was putting up signs around the city which state, "The PDs get things done better".  If the Progressive Democrats want to do anything in regard to what the Tánaiste and Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform proposes, they should do more than make statements such as that made by the Taoiseach in the Dáil yesterday, which is a shocking indictment of the record of the coalition Government during the past ten years,

I wish to raise in particular the position of Irish people in Britain who should qualify for free travel when they return here for a holiday or other purpose.  These are Irish people aged 65 and over who would qualify for free travel if they lived here or if circumstances allowed them to do so.  Those in receipt of a pre-1953 pension have a strong case in this regard.  I welcome the decision by the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Dermot Ahern, and the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, Mr. Peter Hain, to extend free travel throughout the island of Ireland.  It is a major breakthrough and both Ministers deserve our thanks and praise.Along with other members of the British-Irish Interparliamentary Body I am working on the repatriation of Irish people in Britain who live in dire straits and bad housing conditions.  The Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government should provide facilities to process the claims——

#TerryLeyden	unknown-#TerryLeyden-party	unknown-#TerryLeyden-dob	unknown-#TerryLeyden-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-11-22 00:00:00	Prelude	35	——and direct local authorities to provide a certain percentage of relevant resources for people to be repatriated to the land, for which they provided funds during the hungry 1950s.  They are responsible for ensuring we have the economy we enjoy today and deserve a just return and response from the Government which will not be found wanting.  The pre-1953 allowance means approximately €145 million has been transferred to Irish people in Britain.  It returns what came in envelopes during the pre-war and post-war period.
#DavidNorris	unknown-#DavidNorris-party	unknown-#DavidNorris-dob	unknown-#DavidNorris-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-11-22 00:00:00	Prelude	36	I ask for a debate on the Corrib gas field and the Shell to Sea campaign.  On more than one occasion, I praised the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, Deputy Noel Dempsey, for his sterling qualities of decency and political courage.  However, he did not show them last week in the Dáil.  As parliamentarians, we are entitled to an explanation of the Government by smear which seemed to occur.  It is extraordinary that he stated an unnamed acquaintance overheard a conversation on a mobile telephone on Grafton Street which included words such as "Rossport" and "riot".  God bless his hearing.  He is obviously not an army deafness claimant.  It is an outrageous and disgraceful performance by the Minister.Also, we are told the provos are up to their ears in it.  So what?  I remember the provos used to lick the altar rails of churches throughout the country.  Did that mean no one else was allowed to believe in God?  Is it guilt by association?  The police force is enlisted on behalf of a widely discredited multi-national corporation.  We remember the inheritance it left to Nigeria.  It is speedily doing the same in the west of Ireland.  It successfully divided a country and families in its exploitation of our national resources which we gave away for nothing.  We do not even charge it tax.

#DavidNorris	unknown-#DavidNorris-party	unknown-#DavidNorris-dob	unknown-#DavidNorris-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-11-22 00:00:00	Prelude	38	The Cathaoirleach is kind.  Part of any debate should examine the guardianship of resources by a Government which landed us in a series of lousy contracts.  Not only did it hand away our resources to Shell Oil for some inexplicable reason, but we also have the M50, the link bridge which will be bought back for hundreds of millions of euro and PPARS.  Something is rotten and it ought to be examined.

It is ridiculous and I am prepared to be far more blunt that he is.  The Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, Deputy Ó Cuív, is single-minded.  His old grandfather made Irish hated through this land by its compulsory nature and the Minister now hammers the last nail in the coffin.  If someone in distress telephones a rape crisis centre, is it not heartless to present them with this garbage in Irish?

It would be a good and efficient way to support charities.  It might mean we would not have so much of what is termed "chugging" or charity mugging on the streets of Dublin.

It used to be stated tsarist Russia was an autocracy tempered by assassination.  It now seems several democracies, such as Russia, Lebanon and the Palestinian territories, are democracies tampered with by assassination.  It does no good to the reputation of a great country like Russia to have the impression created that its political opponents are eliminated.  Nonetheless, it would help greatly if the champions of democracy in the western world lived up to standards of democracy and the rule of law without scandals such as extraordinary rendition and abuses in prisons.

It is wrong that it is simply being debated out on the country roads of Mayo.In response to Senator Brian Hayes, he knows well that it is not the practice to publish the advice of Attorneys General, but Taoisigh and Ministers may make statements on that basis.

#SheilaTerry	unknown-#SheilaTerry-party	unknown-#SheilaTerry-dob	unknown-#SheilaTerry-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-11-22 00:00:00	Prelude	47	I share the concerns of other speakers concerning the trafficking of women, especially in light of the presentation that many of us attended at lunchtime.  That event helped to bring the matter to our attention once again.  Even at this late stage, legislation should be drafted by the Government so that it can be passed before the general election.  We know how long it can take to pass such legislation and I am concerned that it will not be passed before the election.  In the meantime, women and children are being trafficked into this country and abused while they are here.  We have an obligation to ensure that practice stops and that the people responsible for it pay the appropriate penalty.  We should not continue to allow young women and children to suffer at the hands of these criminals in many towns and cities throughout the country.We need to have a debate on people trafficking and, more importantly, the Minister should draw up the necessary legislation as quickly as possible.  We must face up to our obligations in Europe by signing the necessary conventions.  It is imperative to do so as soon as possible.

Sin ceann de na buanna a bhaineann leis an Aire céanna, go mbíonn sé i gcónaí ar fáil le teacht isteach sa Teach seo le héisteacht le agus páirt a ghlacadh i ndíospóireachtaí.I do not honestly accept that most Irish people are agnostic about the Irish language.  In fact, most of the surveys we have seen in the past decade have shown quite the opposite to be the case.  The Minister is endeavouring to fill a vacuum which has existed for many years.  Irish has been taught in schools since the inception of the State.  The lack of Irish in the environment has been always the difficulty.When Deputy Michael D. Higgins was Minister for the Gaeltacht, he took a most courageous step when he introduced TG4.

The very same thing happened when people argued over the cost of providing Gaelscoileanna, which now constitute one of the most successful educational outlets.I am always surprised, particularly in the context of human rights, that we never stop to think of the frustration and humiliation which was handed out to the people of the Gaeltacht when they sought the provision of health, education and other services through Irish but could not find it.  Today, the Gaeltacht is not confined to the same geographical areas.  Thousands of Irish-speaking families got hope when the new language legislation was introduced, so let us not think of everything in terms of euros. Let us also consider national pride, as this House did when supporting the new legislation.
#KathleenOMeara	unknown-#KathleenOMeara-party	unknown-#KathleenOMeara-dob	unknown-#KathleenOMeara-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-11-22 00:00:00	Prelude	51	I ask the Leader to inform us as to the whereabouts of the Privacy Bill.  I hope it has not been forgotten.  Senator Mansergh seeks a debate on press freedom, democracy and human rights.  This issue is closely linked to press freedom and the defamation Bill, which I understand will come before the House before Christmas.  Discussions were to take place with a number of groups that had expressed concern at elements of the Privacy Bill and I wish to know how those discussions are proceeding.Does the Leader know whether the constitutional referendum on children's rights will be held in March, along with the general election, or whether it will be held at all?  A discussion of the issues that have arisen would be a useful project for this House to take on, if only in the context of the recent Supreme Court judgments.I previously asked the Leader to organise a debate on youth mental health, an issue to which she referred last week, and I request her to arrange for this to be held before Christmas.

#TimDooley	unknown-#TimDooley-party	unknown-#TimDooley-dob	unknown-#TimDooley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-11-22 00:00:00	Prelude	54	I ask the Leader to consider holding a debate on the association between drug abuse and mental health.  A debate on drug abuse was held here recently and I believe a crossover exists in many cases involving people with psychiatric problems.  A gap occurs in how the issue is dealt with whereby people who have made an effort to recover find themselves in a vulnerable situation on coming back into the community.  This is evident in the sheltered housing available through psychiatric services and the manner in which former drug users are preyed upon by drug dealers to fall into their old habits.  This causes particular anxiety to the families of people trying to work their way through very difficult problems.A more joined up approach is required on drug strategy from the Health Service Executive and the psychiatric services area of the Department of Health and Children.  It would be useful if the person with responsibility in this area, the Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children, Deputy Tim O'Malley, could continue on from the debate on drug abuse.
#UlickBurke	unknown-#UlickBurke-party	unknown-#UlickBurke-dob	unknown-#UlickBurke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-11-22 00:00:00	Prelude	55	The Comhairle na nOspidéal report on neurosurgical services in Ireland was released yesterday under the Freedom of Information Act 1997 and its contents will be viewed with alarm throughout the country.  Professor Ciaran Bolger described such services as a mess and said people were dying unnecessarily as a result.Worse than this, for the people of the west, the report states it is not necessary to have a third neurosurgical unit, in addition to the units at Beaumont Hospital and Cork University Hospital, at University College Hospital, Galway.  When one considers the composition of the group that came to this conclusion, it is no wonder such a finding was reached.  Very few representatives on it come from the west and there is a strong bias against the provision of services to the region.As a former member of the Western Health Board, I am aware that every service and appointment won for the west in the area of health came as a result of a battle, as though they were things to which the west were not entitled.

The report should be published and a debate held on it immediately.  We have a two-tier service, best described as "the west versus the rest".  It is time Senators stood up and were counted.  I ask the Leader to arrange an immediate debate on the issue.
#FergalQuinn	unknown-#FergalQuinn-party	unknown-#FergalQuinn-dob	unknown-#FergalQuinn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-11-22 00:00:00	Prelude	58	Senator O'Meara referred to the Privacy Bill.  It is vital that we learn more about various matters.  The European Union is attempting to force every member state to publish the names of all recipients of farm subsidies and the amount of subsidy in each case.  This is a fascinating proposal because I gather that if the measure is adopted, we will learn how much taxpayers pay towards farm subsidies.  I was stunned to discover this week that 94% of farmers' income derives from subsidies, with the remaining 6% derived from goods produced.  If these figures are correct——

I am reminded of the campaign to buy Irish goods which ceased some time ago.  With the recent arrival of the Celtic tiger and increased wealth, we took our eyes off the ball and failed to consider the importance of buying Irish goods.  Perhaps we need to change our approach.  While the State is prevented from engaging in this type of campaign, the House may debate the issue.Senator Ryan referred to an explosion of anger.  There should be an explosion of concern about the death of a young Latvian mother in Swords.  Her murder was compounded by news that the lawyer who represented her has been forced to leave the country under threat of death.  I am concerned these types of incidents, which are a recent development, should occur.  We hear of similar cases almost every day but they receive scant attention in the newspapers after one day.  Perhaps we are becoming complacent because the incidents to which I refer were barely mentioned on the Order of Business.  Ireland is becoming lawless and the onus is on the State to address the problem.

#MichaelKitt	unknown-#MichaelKitt-party	unknown-#MichaelKitt-dob	unknown-#MichaelKitt-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-11-22 00:00:00	Prelude	66	I concur with Senator Ulick Burke on neurosurgery services.  He and I were members of the Western Health Board at the same time.  The expert view always has been that regional neurosurgery services are required in the west.  It was even suggested that a special helicopter service be established to serve centres in Dublin and Cork.  Given how urgent it is to transport people with serious injuries to medical centres, I hope the west will have a neurosurgery centre.  While progress has been made in the provision of cardiac surgery and cancer treatment services in the west, neurosurgery services have not been provided.  I call for a debate on the issue and ask Senators to support efforts to secure such services for the western region.
#FeargalBrowne	unknown-#FeargalBrowne-party	unknown-#FeargalBrowne-dob	unknown-#FeargalBrowne-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-11-22 00:00:00	Prelude	67	I reiterate my call for a debate on No. 20 on the Order Paper concerning MRSA and blood infections in hospitals.  Last week was significant because on Friday last, for the first time, a coroner's court listed MRSA as a cause of death.  A coroner's court in Belfast reached the same verdict yesterday regarding a 43 year old man who, unfortunately, did not recover from an accident at work because he contracted MRSA.  It is shocking to consider what is happening in hospitals and an urgent debate on the matter is required.I welcome the blueprint unveiled by Greencore for a major development in Carlow.  I repeat a call on the company made by Deputies in the other House that it honour a commitment laid down by the Labour Court regarding a small number of workers from the Carlow plant who are still owed money.  With a judicial review of the European Union sugar beet compensation scheme due in December, I urge Greencore to settle the case quickly, pay growers and workers and allow us to proceed to the next phase.  It is not necessary to wait any longer and, unfortunately, no action can be taken on the Carlow site until the company settles the case.  If it refuses to do so, everybody will lose out.
#JamesBannon	unknown-#JamesBannon-party	unknown-#JamesBannon-dob	unknown-#JamesBannon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-11-22 00:00:00	Prelude	68	I ask the Leader to invite the Minister for Transport to the House for a debate on the quality of our public transport, which is the worst in Europe, particularly the rail network.  I know people in the midlands who leave home at 6 a.m. but still miss midday flights to Britain and elsewhere.  This shameful situation exists because of the ridiculous regulation that drivers must change at Maynooth, which causes serious delays.  We have been also told by the chairman of Iarnród Éireann that rolling stock on the Sligo to Dublin line that was promised for 2007 will not be delivered until 2009.  This must be addressed.I welcome the U-turn by the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government on the deadline for the completion of the electoral register.  Councils will still be under pressure to meet the new deadline.  Will the Seanad sit on Friday to introduce the emergency legislation that the Attorney General says is necessary to achieve this?  This proves this is a bad Administration because the right hand does not know what the left hand is doing.
#MauriceCummins	unknown-#MauriceCummins-party	unknown-#MauriceCummins-dob	unknown-#MauriceCummins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-11-22 00:00:00	Prelude	69	There are too many murders, there are too many guns and there are too many hardened criminals at large.  These were the words of the Taoiseach in the Dáil yesterday.  What a judgment on his own Government that, after ten years in office, he tells us that there are too many murders, guns and criminals.  There is organised crime, beatings, rape and murder in many areas practically every day but this is the response we get from the Government.  There is plenty of law but very little order so I call for a debate on law and order.  It is long overdue and we should address it as a matter of urgency.
#JohnPaulPhelan	unknown-#JohnPaulPhelan-party	unknown-#JohnPaulPhelan-dob	unknown-#JohnPaulPhelan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-11-22 00:00:00	Prelude	70	I agree with Senator Leyden's call for the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government to examine repatriation for emigrants from Ireland, particularly those who went to England.  When looking at that, perhaps he could also look at housing those elderly and middle-aged men who still lives in prefabs here, often in deplorable conditions with no washing facilities.  It is an indictment that such conditions still exist.I agree with those Senators who mentioned the conversion of the Tánaiste and Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform on the issue of home defence.  Will the Leader arrange for a debate on the report of the Law Reform Commission, with particular emphasis on its recommendation on rebalancing the law in favour of the home owner as opposed to the intruder?  It is a remarkable about-turn by the Tánaiste and his Government colleagues but we must debate it as soon as possible.I join my colleague Senator Bannon in welcoming the other U-turn announced last night by the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, that there would be an extension for the deadline for people to be included on the electoral register.  Many local authorities are having serious problems compiling the register and many of those who have been knocked off it have not been informed by their local authority.  Will the Leader find out if the deadline includes those looking for special voting entitlements, such as postal votes for people who are ill or who are working or studying?  I telephoned two county councils and neither could answer that question.I reiterate Senator John Paul Phelan's remarks seeking clarification on whether people with disabilities, students and others seeking a postal vote are included in the two-week extension of the deadline.The extension means officials are losing two weeks in the compilation of the draft register, as the 1 February deadline has not been moved.  The electoral register will be published on that date, and the register existing on 15 February 2007 will be in operation for the next general election.  Is this reluctance by the Government to move the deadline two weeks from 1 February an indirect announcement of an upcoming general election in February or March?

Slavery has again reared its very ugly head in society, and I share the view that those involved in the clubs where illegal immigrants work have a particular responsibility in this matter.  That point was well made by Senator Ryan and it should be pursued, as those people should feel the brunt of justice.I ask for a debate on the general issue of slavery in the world.  It was ostensibly eliminated in England in 1808, and seven years before in Denmark, but the reality is the numbers involved throughout the world are now higher than ever, with children and adults working to pay off impossible debts.  These people are effectively slaves, and there would be a benefit in this House debating the matter.

#MaryORourke	unknown-#MaryORourke-party	unknown-#MaryORourke-dob	unknown-#MaryORourke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-11-22 00:00:00	Prelude	76	In 1991, I dealt with these people in their setting up of Ruhama, and there was then great opposition to that organisation and what was perceived as nefarious work being done.  It was not at all, and the work was much needed.  They were pioneers in endeavouring to save young women.  In the short three-month period I was responsible for the health portfolio, I remember being able to give them a small grant to buy a van.  They set up their counselling service not to castigate, but to try to make friends with the women on the streets of Dublin.  They have done powerful work in a modern sense and I commend them greatly.The Senator's main point was why we are not bringing forward legislation to tackle the sex trade industry globally.  As I understand it, the Minister has issued heads of a Bill.  I have a well thought out and advised Bill which was fully approved by our parliamentary party, but out of deference to the Minister I put it to one side when the heads of his Bill were published.  I believed the legislation would follow, but I will now produce the Bill I have.  I hope we can take it here.Senator Hayes also asked about the advice of the Attorney General on the St. Andrews Agreement being published.  The Senator knows as well as I that the advice of Attorneys General is not published, but Government moves in accordance with such advice.  I was in London yesterday on the occasion of Peter Hain, the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, bringing forward the Bill on the St. Andrews Agreement.  It received all-party support and passed through all Stages in the House of Commons.The Senator also asked about the Criminal Law (Home Defence) Bill.  Senator Brennan has pointed out that he and others have brought forward the Defence of Life and Property Bill 2006.

He was very critical of the attitude of compulsion requiring semi-State bodies and State organisations to have everything as Gaeilge agus as Béarla.  I am in two minds on this question.  He stated that the Government Publications Office had no customers requesting an Irish version of the Budget Statement, which is telling in itself.Senator Ryan asked the reason for the delay in bringing forward the trafficking Bill.  He stated that more women are currently enslaved than was the case in more than 400 years of the slave trade.  We will try to debate the Genealogy and Heraldry Bill next week, if time is available.  Assuming the Prisons Bill passes Second Stage, the House will deal with Committee Stage of that Bill next Tuesday when the Minister will be free to begin working on it.  We might have time then for the Senator's Bill.A debate on the nursing homes issue is scheduled for next week.  Senator Ryan also referred to the massive cutbacks in fish catches and asked for a debate on the matter.  He stated that the fish caught in our waters by other than Irish trawlers since we joined the EU is probably worth €30 billion.I will be very pleased to address the Bill referred to by Senator Brennan.  I am glad he is in the House because his colleague had brought it to my attention.Senator Finucane referred to the case of the Latvian woman who was murdered.  I agree that it was a shocking event.  It was so clinical and awful that she was murdered as she stood in her hall talking to somebody.Senator Leyden welcomed the decision by the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Dermot Ahern, and the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, Mr. Peter Hain, to extend free travel throughout the island of Ireland.  He stated that along with other members of the British-Irish Inter-Parliamentary Body, he is working on the repatriation of Irish people in Britain who live in dire straits and bad housing conditions.  Many single elderly men find it very difficult to access local authority housing.Senator Norris asked for a debate on the Corrib gas field and the Shell to Sea campaign.  He supported Senator O'Toole's point about the Irish language and asked for a debate on charities.Senator Mansergh asked for a debate on democracy, press freedom and human rights throughout the world which are now threatened by the use of assassination.  He seconded the call for a debate on the Rossport situation.  In response to Senator Brian Hayes, Senator Mansergh stated that it is not the practice to publish the advice of Attorneys General, but Taoisigh and Ministers may make statements on that basis.Senator Terry also raised the matter of the trafficking of women.  These women think they are going to the promised land.  They are told they are going to a job with big money and when they get here, they find it is slavery.Senator Ó Murchú referred to TG4 which we all like to watch.  There is a difference between watching a good television programme and reading a turgid report because the tempo is slightly different.  His case about the gaelscoileanna was well made.  The effort needs to continue to be made and this is the point.In response to Senator O'Meara, there is no doubt that the Privacy Bill will not be taken before Christmas——
#BrendanRyan	unknown-#BrendanRyan-party	unknown-#BrendanRyan-dob	unknown-#BrendanRyan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-11-22 00:00:00	Prelude	103	It will not be before the House.

We hope to have statements on the subject of privacy.  This is the procedure followed previously when the House had statements on a subject and a Bill was then formulated.  We hope to have statements before Christmas.Senator O'Meara also asked when the referendum on children's rights would be held.  This is a matter of discussion.  It is hoped it will be held.  She also asked for a debate on youth mental health.Senator Dooley spoke about the association between mental health and drugs.  He also finds that many people are stigmatised by virtue of their mental disability prior to taking up new housing.  Senator Ulick Burke gave a rousing endorsement of the west — the west against the rest.  He raised the issue of the neurological unit for Galway hospital.  It has been said that this unit is not necessary in Galway and it would infringe on an earlier catchment area.  That is ridiculous, and I take the Senator's point.Senator Quinn raised the issue of farm subsidies.  I have been told that what has been put forward is inaccurate, but I do not know this for certain.  The Senator also mentioned the campaign to buy Irish products, but that was deemed to be the wrong way to do business.   However, it is a timely reminder.  In his business life, the Senator has always been proactive in that regard and he is fully entitled to talk about it.  The Senator referred to the murder of the Latvian woman in Swords, which shows the lawlessness of this society.Senator Kitt agreed with Senator Ulick Burke's comments on the neurosurgery unit.  Senator Browne raised the issue of MRSA.  He also mentioned the small remaining number of Greencore workers who are still owed money and asked that this be cleared.  Senator Bannon called for a debate on public transport.  The House will not sit on Friday to deal with the Electoral (Amendment) Bill.  An amendment will be moved in the other House, and the Bill will then have to return to this House.Senator Cummins spoke about there being too many criminals and too many guns.  It is very sad.  At least the Taoiseach was open and honest about it.  He said it as he saw it and his statement was quite clear.Senator John Paul Phelan agrees with Senator Leyden's points on the elderly requiring houses.  He also sought a debate on the Law Reform Commission and mentioned the speciality of postal votes.  The latter is an important issue as they were supposed to have been submitted by Monday next.  I hope the benefit of the extended deadline will apply to them too.The Minister is to be commended for providing more time to update the electoral register.  If he did not do so the Opposition would be roaring about it, but now that he has done it they are saying it is an about-turn.  It is simply good sense and good politics.Senator McHugh also raised the issue of postal votes.  Officials are now losing weeks that are — correctly — being given over to ensuring the register is more correct.  Senator Hanafin raised the issues of slavery and human trafficking and is seeking a general debate on the issue.  Sin é an méid.

#DerekMcDowell	unknown-#DerekMcDowell-party	unknown-#DerekMcDowell-dob	unknown-#DerekMcDowell-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-11-22 00:00:00	Prelude	107	I am pleased to be before the House today to present the Prisons Bill 2006.  This Bill deals with a number of issues relating to prisons and prisoners and its purpose is manifold.  The Bill provides primarily for the following matters: video conferencing of certain non-trial court hearings; the placing of the Office of the Inspector of Prisons on a statutory footing; planning provisions for major prison developments and the closure of Mountjoy Prison; the issues to be included in prison rules which include mandatory drug testing; a basis in primary legislation for revised disciplinary procedures, including appeals; the possibility of outsourcing prisoner escort services; a statutory basis for charging prisoners for certain optional services; and the exclusion of non-commercial work from the National Minimum Wage Act 2000.In May of last year I published the Prisons Bill 2005 which completed Second Stage in this House.  The aims of the Prisons Bill 2005 were much more limited.  They were to outsource prisoner escort services, to provide for the video conferencing of certain pre-trial court hearings, and to provide for the closure of Mountjoy Prison.  However, as time progressed it became increasingly obvious that the other prison-related issues I have mentioned needed to be addressed and that a prisons Bill would be the best place to do so.  However, as the inclusion of such measures would have necessitated significant amendments being brought forward on Committee Stage, I felt it might be more proper in terms of parliamentary procedure and more straightforward for all parties to the process if the Bill were to be republished.  I have thus withdrawn the Prisons Bill 2005 and republished it with the additional necessary provisions, resulting in a much more comprehensive piece of legislation.As I have stated on many occasions previously since becoming Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform in June 2002, I have been committed to introducing measures to reform and modernise the prison system.  A number of significant changes to the prison system have been introduced or are in the process of being introduced.  A comprehensive proposal for organisational change in the Irish Prison Service was accepted in a second ballot of members of the Prison Officers' Association in August 2005.  The arrangements agreed in the revised proposal represent one of the most significant change programmes undertaken in the public service in recent years.  They open the way for greater flexibility, efficiency and cost effectiveness in every operational area of the State's prisons.  The new additional hours system replaced the existing overtime system and effectively caps the level of extra attendance costs in the Prison Service.  Successful implementation of these measures is delivering savings to the Exchequer of up to €25 million per annum.I also published a drugs policy and strategy for the Prison Service in May of this year.  This strategy provides for the first time a co-ordinated, consistent national approach to eliminating the supply of drugs into prison as well as ensuring that appropriate treatment is available to prisoners to enable them conquer their addiction.A major prisons building and refurbishment programme to improve facilities for prisoners, including the elimination of the practice of slopping out, the reduction of overcrowding and the use of padded cells and to facilitate a more cost-effective operation of the Prison Service has been ongoing.  An extensive site at Thornton, County Dublin, has been purchased for the provision of a new prison complex to replace the existing prisons on the Mountjoy campus and planning is well under way for development of a new prison to replace Cork Prison.  These are major undertakings involving replacement of approximately 40% of the entire prison estate.  The replacement prisons for Mountjoy Prison and Cork Prison will provide decent, hygienic conditions for prisoners in line with modern-day standards.  The new facilities will allow for the provision of a full range of work, training, educational, psychological and medical services for inmates, as well as predominantly single-cell accommodation with proper in-cell sanitation facilities.New additional prison accommodation is also being provided at Loughan House, Shelton Abbey, Castlerea, Wheatfield and Portlaoise.  In addition, the programme of work to install safety observation cells and closed supervision cells was undertaken in 2005 and completed in 2006 following my commitment to abolish the use of old-style padded cells in our prisons.  These measures all represent further steps along the road of improving and modernising our prison system.Part 1 of the Bill, encompassing sections 1 to 3, contains standard provisions, including the Short Title, commencement, an expenses provision and the definitions of key terms used throughout the Bill.  Part 2, which covers sections 4 to 10, deals with prisoner escort services.  As Senators may recall, when the 2005 Bill was published it appeared that proposals for organisational change within our prisons would be rejected by prison officers.  In those circumstances, I would have had no choice but to contract out prisoner escort service in the interests of providing a cost effective service.  Since then, an organisational change programme has been agreed with the Prison Officers' Association.  One of the elements in that agreement was the establishment of a co-ordinated prisoner escort system operated by prison officers within the Prison Service.  The escort corps was set up towards the end of 2005.  There is a staffing complement of 143 and we currently have a fleet of 35 specialised cellular vehicles.While the main business of the service is providing escorts to and from the courts, it also covers inter-prison and hospital escorts.  I am glad to tell the House that the level of coverage provided by the PSEC for court escorts now stands at 94%.  In staffing terms, the escort corps operates, on average, more than 33% more efficiently on court escorts than the previous overtime based operating system.I believe the House will agree that great progress has been made in building this service from scratch in just under a year.  As long as the service continues to operate efficiently and in cost effective terms, there is no need, nor do I have the desire, to contract out the service.  However, to ensure I am not left in a difficult position should there be future glitches in the provision of this service, it is important there is legislative provision for the possibility of contracting out of a prison escort service and I am making such provision here.  It is my intention not to commence this Part unless I have to do so and I hope such provisions will never have to be brought into force but it is, nonetheless, essential that they exist.To summarise Part 2, section 4 provides definitions of terms used in this Part.  Section 5 provides that the Minister may, with Government approval and the consent of the Minister for Finance, enter into an agreement for the provision of prisoner escort services.  The section further provides for the termination of such an agreement if the contractor fails to comply with any of the provisions of an agreement and outlines the role of a prisoner escort service.  Section 6 provides for the certification of prisoner custody officers who will provide the service.  Any person may apply for a certificate that he or she is, in the Minister's view, a suitable person to perform the functions of a prisoner custody officer.  Any application must include the relevant fee and any requested documentation.  The section goes on to outline the criteria to be met before the Minister may issue a certificate and the conditions under which the person holds such a certificate.  There is also provision for refusal of a certificate and penalties for people who forge or possess a forged certificate.Section 7 goes on to deal with the revocation of a certificate and section 8 outlines the functions of a prisoner custody officer.  Section 9 prohibits unauthorised disclosure of information relating to a prisoner by a prisoner custody officer and section 10 provides for the Minister to appoint a person to monitor the performance of a contractor under this Part.Part 3, which covers sections 11 to 16, inclusive, relates to prison discipline.  The provisions in this Part are new to the 2006 Bill and include the establishment of an appeals mechanism against disciplinary sanctions imposed within a prison.  Section 11 defines terms and section 12 provides for an inquiry to be held by a prison governor if a prisoner is alleged to have committed a breach of discipline.  The prisoner must be informed of the date and time of the inquiry and the procedure to be followed at an inquiry is to be laid down in prison rules.  The section goes on to provide that, following such an inquiry, the governor may impose a sanction and record the finding and the sanction or record a finding that the allegation was not substantiated.Section 13 lists the sanctions that may be imposed and provides that a sanction may be suspended subject to conditions, in whole or in part, for a period not exceeding three months.  Following that period, the sanction may then take effect or be abated or, if the relevant condition has been complied with, the sanction may be lifted.  The section goes on to provide that the governor may restore any remission for good behaviour forfeited by a prisoner if such restoration is justified by subsequent good behaviour.  Sanctions which may not be imposed are also listed and they include corporal punishment, collective punishment, sensory deprivation or deprivation of food, drink or sleep or any sanction that would constitute cruel, inhumane or degrading treatment.  Under section 14, a prisoner on whom a sanction is imposed may make a petition to the Minister on the finding or the sanction and the Minister, following consultation with the governor, may affirm, alter, suspend or revoke the sanction imposed.Section 15 provides, for the first time, for an independent appeals mechanism of a quasi-judicial nature to review loss of remission for prisoners.  It provides that a prisoner who has had remission of a portion of his or her sentence forfeited may appeal the finding or sanction via the governor to an appeal tribunal.  The tribunal may take submissions from the prisoner and governor and shall notify the prisoner of the date and time of the hearing.  The prisoner may attend the hearing and have legal advice or representation for its purposes.  The section further provides that the tribunal may uphold or quash the original finding.  Decisions of an appeal tribunal shall be published in accordance with arrangements specified in the prison rules.Section 16 goes on to lay down the powers of an appeal tribunal.  An appeal tribunal shall consist of a member who shall be a practising barrister or solicitor of at least seven years' standing appointed by the Minister.  The terms and conditions of a member's appointment, including remuneration, are determined by the Minister with the consent of the Minister for Finance.  A member may resign at any time or be removed by the Minister for stated reasons.  A tribunal may determine its own procedure subject to the terms of the Bill and directions given by the Minister in the interests of securing consistency of procedures in relation to appeals.  A tribunal shall be independent in its functions.Part 4, which covers sections 17 to 29, inclusive, deals with planning procedures in regard to the construction of new prisons and the extension of existing prisons.  These provisions are new and did not feature in the 2005 Bill.  Section 17 provides definitions of terms and section 18 provides that this Part shall apply only if the Minister so directs.  I am conscious that large prison developments can be a cause of controversy.  For that reason I do not wish, as a general rule where large scale prison developments are involved, to take advantage of the planning arrangements provided for in Part 9 of the Planning and Development Regulations 2001, which permit the exemption of prisons and places of detention from the normal planning regime.  On the other hand, the development of a major prison facility is a matter of national importance and not appropriate to local or regional orientated planning systems.  There is a need for the issue to be addressed at national level and, therefore, in the interests of democracy I am providing the opportunity for both Houses of the Oireachtas to have an input into the process.Section 19 deals with what is called an "environmental impact assessment".  An EIA shall be prepared before a development is commenced but shall contain a description of the proposed development as well as any significant effects it might have on the environment, including natural resources, architectural and archaeological heritage and expected emissions.  The assessment must also contain an outline of the main alternatives that were considered as well as the main reasons for choosing the development.  It will estimate possible residues and emissions during and after construction and will also describe any measures used to reduce, avoid or offset significant adverse affects.  The section also provides that a visual representation of the exterior of the completed development shall be prepared but obviously plans of every cell, etc., cannot be published.Section 20 provides that on receipt of the environmental impact assessment and the visual representation of the development, the Minister shall give notice of the proposed development to the planning authorities in the relevant area.  Members of the public shall be informed of the development by means of the placing of a notice on the site and in a national and local newspaper.  Furthermore, the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government shall be informed as shall the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, if the development is adjacent to the foreshore, and the relevant authority in another country, if the development is likely to have significant adverse effects on that country's environment.  Section 21 lays out what must be contained in the notices to which I have referred and section 22 provides that the EIA and the visual representation must be made available to any interested party in written form or electronically.Under section 23, the Minister shall appoint a rapporteur to receive submissions relating to the proposed development and the rapporteur is required to prepare a report which summarises the submissions received and identifies the main issues raised.  This report shall be published.  Section 24 deals with a situation where the Minister, on foot of the rapporteur's report, decides to alter the proposed development.  In this case the Minister shall cause an amended description of the development to be prepared as well as a supplementary EIA and an amended visual representation of the exterior, if material alterations are made to the exterior.  The persons and bodies specified in section 20 shall be notified of any proposed alteration.  Again, submissions may be made in relation to the revised proposal and submitted to the rapporteur who shall prepare a supplementary report on the basis of the submissions received and this report shall be also published.Section 25 provides that the Minister, having considered the EIA, the rapporteur's report and any supplementary EIA and report, may make further alterations to the development and may proceed or decide not to do so.  Under section 26, if the Minister decides to proceed with the development, he shall move a draft resolution approving the development in both Houses of the Oireachtas.  This resolution must contain a description of the development, a statement that an EIA — and supplementary EIA, where applicable — has been prepared, the measures taken to invite observations from the public, the main measures taken to avoid, reduce or offset any significant adverse effects and a drawing or visual representation of the exterior.  The resolution must also specify any conditions with which the developer must comply.Before moving the resolution, documents must be laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas, including a statement of the location, purpose and size of the proposed development, its land use requirements during construction and operation and any estimated residues or emissions.  The EIA, and any supplementary EIA, a visual representation of the exterior and the rapporteur's report and supplementary report, if applicable, must also be laid before the Houses.  If the draft resolution is approved and confirmed by an Act of the Oireachtas, the Minister may then proceed with the development.  In this respect it will resemble the restrictive practices code that existed before the Competition Authority and by which there was an enabling Act, an examiners' inquiry and an examiners' report.  If the Minister wanted the report to have the force of law, he or she had to confirm the report and move a confirmatory, one-line Act before the Oireachtas to give the development legislative approval.Section 27 provides that any questioning of an act done under this Part must be by way of an application to the High Court.  Section 28 deals with exemptions relating to the development in terms of planning permission and requirements set out in other legislation.  This section also provides that if a national monument is found on the site, no further work may be undertaken, except to preserve the monument, without direction from the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government in consultation with the director of the National Museum.  Section 29 prohibits the disclosure of any information concerning design or construction which is likely to prejudice the security of a new or extended prison.Part 5, encompassing sections 30 to 32, inclusive, providing for the establishment of an office of inspector of prisons on a statutory basis, is also new.  Section 30 provides that the Minister may appoint an inspector of prisons, who shall hold office on terms determined by the Minister in consultation with the Minister for Finance.  The inspector may at any time resign from office or be removed by the Minister for stated reasons.  An appointment shall be for a term of not longer than five years and the inspector is independent in the performance of his or her functions.Section 31 lays out the duties of the inspector of prisons.  He or she shall carry out regular inspections of prisons, may enter any part of a prison at any time, obtain copies of any records kept there and report to the director general of the Prison Service or the Minister as appropriate on any issues of concern.  The inspector may, and shall if requested by the Minister, investigate any matter relating to the management or operation of a prison and shall submit a report to the Minister on such an investigation, which shall be laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas.  The section further provides that the Minister may omit matters from the report if disclosure would be prejudicial to the security of the prison or the State.  The Minister may also omit matters from the report, after consultation with the Secretary General to the Government, if disclosure of such matters would be contrary to the public interest or would infringe the constitutional rights of any person.  The section goes on to clarify that it is not the inspector's role to investigate complaints from individual prisoners and that any request from the inspector for information must be complied with by prison staff in so far as is reasonably practicable.Section 32 provides for the inspector of prisons to submit an annual report to the Minister on any prison inspected in the year in question.  The report shall deal with the general management of the prison, health and welfare of the prisoners, general conduct of staff, compliance with set standards, facilities available, security and discipline.  Each report shall be laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas and shall be published.Part 6 of the Bill contains a range of miscellaneous provisions.  Section 33 deals with the hearing of applications to court by video link.  Previous provisions featured in section 11 of the 2005 Bill.  However, following receipt of the final report of the committee on videoconferencing chaired by Ms Justice Susan Denham, the range of circumstances in which videoconferencing might best be used without the accused being physically present in the court has been significantly expanded from the limit of pre-trial hearings provided for in the 2005 Bill to the range of non-trial hearings specified in section 33(11).This section applies to the applications to court where the accused or person convicted is in prison, where the application is being made by either the Director of Public Prosecutions or a prisoner and where the prisoner is legally represented or has obtained or been given the opportunity to obtain legal advice.  In these circumstances, the application may be heard without the prisoner being physically present, that is, by video link, if the court is satisfied that it would not be unfair to the prisoner, if the interests of justice do not require the prisoner's presence at the hearing and if the video link facilities allow the prisoner to participate in the hearing, the court to see and hear the prisoner and the prisoner to consult privately with his or her legal representative during the hearing.When the judge is making the decision whether the application to court may be heard by way of video link, he or she must have regard to the nature of the application, how complex the hearing is likely to be and the prisoner's age and mental and physical capacity.  An application for the hearing to be heard by means of video link may be made either by or on behalf of the prisoner or the DPP, and if the application is refused, the court must state its reasons for that decision.  A direction under this section may be revoked at any time, whether on application or not.  Section 34 applies the provisions of section 33 to children in remand centres or children detention schools.Section 35 deals with the making of prison rules by the Minister.  It builds on the power to make such rules provided for in section 19 of the Criminal Justice (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1997.  In addition to the range of issues provided for in the 1997 Act, provision is also made for testing prisoners for intoxicants, including alcohol and drugs, and for the publication of decisions of an appeal tribunal on the forfeiture of remission of a portion of a sentence.The existing prison rules date back to 1947.  I published comprehensive new draft prison rules in June 2005, which are on my Department's website.  The intention in publishing draft prison rules was to give people an opportunity to submit observations on them.  One issue that has been raised is that the rules relating to prison discipline in particular should have a strong grounding in primary legislation.  As the House can see, I have taken that view on board.  As soon as this Bill is enacted, it is my intention to sign the draft rules, with some amendments, into law.Section 36 amends the National Minimum Wage Act 2000 to ensure that payment of the minimum wage is not applicable to prisoners undertaking non-commercial work within a prison, including cleaning, training or work experience and charity work.  To date, payment of the minimum wage has not applied to prisoners performing these tasks, but for the sake of legal certainty it has been decided that a specific exemption should be included in legislation.Section 37 deals with payment by prisoners for requested services and provides that provision may be made for payment for special goods and services, including telephone calls, private medical treatment and escorts outside the prisons for matters that are not generally available without charge to prisoners.  Any charges levied may not, however, exceed the cost of the provision of the goods or services to the prison authorities.Section 38 provides for absences from prison on certain grounds.  Under this section, the Minister may order that a prisoner be taken to a specified person or place for a specified purpose and time and be returned to the prison thereafter.  Such leave may be granted on compassionate grounds, to assess or facilitate a prisoner's re-integration into society or for the purpose of assistance in the investigation of an offence.  If during that period the prisoner is not of good behaviour, causes a breach of the peace or attempts to escape, he or she shall be returned to prison immediately.  Section 39 provides that a prisoner in the custody of a garda, a prison officer or a prisoner custody officer is thereby in lawful custody.  Section 40 contains technical provisions and amends references to the Prisons Acts in various enactments to also include this Act.  The definition of prison officer is also amended in certain legislation to ensure it encompasses prisoner custody officers.Section 41 repeals certain provisions in other legislation, including a provision relating to visiting committees, as some functions of visiting committees will now be encompassed by the appeal tribunals.  The repeal of section 1(2) of the Prisons Act 1933, previously provided for in section 8 of the 2005 Bill, has the effect of providing a statutory power to enable Mountjoy Prison to be closed.  Section 19 of the Criminal Justice (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1997 is also being repealed.  This section dealt with the making of prison rules, which is now being restated, with additions, in the current Bill.  Section 42 is a standard regulation-making provision.This Bill continues the programme of prison reform which I have commenced.  We are changing how prisons are run, work practices in prisons, where prisons are located and, very importantly, we hope to change what is achieved by sending people to prison.  Although I have stated before that imprisonment should be seen as a last option, it remains a necessary one.  A prison which is not drug free is not rehabilitative and therefore fails in one of its primary objectives.  That is why I make no apology for the drug-free policy we have enunciated and for giving it a firm foundation in primary legislation lest it be challenged or somebody say it was not contemplated by the Oireachtas that a prisoner should be obliged to participate on a mandatory basis in submitting samples and other measures to ensure that prisons are drug free.There is no reason prisons and prison practices in Ireland should not be of the highest standard.  We must move from what is, in some respects, a bad place to what I hope will be a better place.  The public wants our prisons to be rehabilitative.  Although people do not want prisons to be holiday camps, they do not want them to be places of which we are nationally ashamed, or which are counterproductive or fail to be rehabilitative.  Prisons should be secure.  I am committed to the provision of modern and humane conditions for prisoners in this country.  I am committed to providing educational and rehabilitative facilities in our prisons to give people a chance to rebuild their lives while in prison by laying foundations for a useful role in society as a constructive citizen.  The building of a new prison at the Thornton Hall site will be a major step in this regard.I look forward to hearing the comments of Senators on this Bill and to a more detailed debate on Committee Stage.  I apologise that I withdrew the first Bill and returned with this Bill.  I had been subjected to criticism on other occasions for introducing radically different amendments on Committee Stage.  I decided this Bill deserved a Second Stage debate rather than introducing new material by unexpected amendments on Committee Stage.
#MauriceCummins	unknown-#MauriceCummins-party	unknown-#MauriceCummins-dob	unknown-#MauriceCummins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-11-22 00:00:00	Prelude	108	As I stated on Second Stage of the Prisons Bill 2005, there will be no objection from this side of the House to the provision of a modern and humane prison service.  I restate my reservations about the privatisation of certain prison services.  In July 2002 the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform and the Irish Prison Service published the report of the prison service staffing and operations review team.  This report argued that privatisation of these services will not save money.  This section of the Bill is a response to the Minister's commitment to take on the Prison Officers' Association and I welcome his initiative to reduce the unsustainable level of overtime paid to that group.  However, the taxpayer should not have to pay for high-priced solutions to problems that do not exist.In other jurisdictions the experience of prison services that have been privatised has not been positive.  In Britain a private security firm, Group 4, took over the running of an asylum detention centre.  Shortly afterwards, there were numerous cases of detainees escaping or rioting within the complex.  This was due to the inexperience of Group 4 staff.  The Minister is not proposing that we privatise the running of prisons in Ireland but private operators will necessarily have to compromise on quality of service and experience of staff.  In matters of prisoner transfer, the shortfall in the quality of service and professionalism provided by a private firm, compared to a state operator, will result in decreased security, staff who may not have the requisite training and private prison escorts who may commit human rights violations for which the State would be vicariously liable.Furthermore, the involvement of the Garda Síochána and the Defence Forces will still be required for the transfer of high security prisoners, unless the Minister is planning to sanction the arming of private prison escorts.  There will not be a net saving to the Exchequer and we should seriously consider these provisions before taking such an important step towards privatised prison services.Fine Gael supports Part 3, which will allow the governor of a prison "to hold an inquiry into the alleged breach" of prison discipline by prisoners.  Perhaps this should be extended to all persons in a prison including staff.  More importantly, it gives the governor the power to impose punitive sanctions to deal with problems that arise.I would be grateful if the Minister could clarify some aspects of this part of the Bill.  As matters stand, decisions on prison discipline are made by the prison visiting committee.  Is the new scheme outlined in the Bill designed to marginalise the prison visiting committee and further centralise decision making in this area?  How will this improve the system?I welcome the safeguards, such as the potential to petition the Minister against a finding or sanction, and the provision for an appeal to an independent appeal tribunal where a sanction involves forfeiture of remission of portion of sentence.  However, the qualifications required for a person to sit on that appeals board are unnecessarily restrictive.  Under section 16(3), only persons who have been practising as solicitors or barristers for at least seven years may sit on the tribunal.  This may be modelled on other tribunals but it overlooks the pool of experience of former prison governors or people who have worked as chaplains, doctors, teachers or a range of other positions in prisons.  A person who worked as a prison chaplain for 20 years is sufficiently qualified to deal with the kind of questions that would be addressed by an appeals tribunal.On reading the Bill, I was struck by the arrogance of the Minister in respect of Part 4.  He has removed the construction and modification of prisons from any planning scrutiny or independence.  As recently as last July the Houses passed the Planning and Development (Strategic Infrastructure) Act.  The development of prisons was not included in the extensive list of projects that can now be fast-tracked in the interests of national strategic infrastructure development.  Why is the Minister so afraid that An Bord Pleanála be allowed to consider prison development?  This provision removes any accountability, independence or transparency to the process of prison building and modification.There may be security concerns in releasing designs or plans of the internal layout of a prison but it is not necessary to divulge any secure data to bring a prison building programme into line with normal planning procedures, or even strategic infrastructure development.  Does the Minister not accept that this amounts to a further extension of a dictatorial regime?There is no reason another section could not be added to the Planning and Development (Strategic Infrastructure) Act to include prisons.  They may be even included without further amendment since prisons can be regarded as being of social importance, one of the criteria used in the Act to determine whether the Act is relevant to a project.  The Minister has excluded any independent oversight of his decisions by An Bord Pleanála in respect of new prison development or developments on sites of old prisons.The Minister should explain why he should be treated differently from other Ministers with major infrastructural projects.  Independent oversight by An Bord Pleanála is an essential ingredient in the checks and balances of good planning and development.  Nobody, not even the Tánaiste, should be above this oversight.  The Minister is setting himself up as judge and jury on planning and building prisons.  He is behaving in an arrogant and self-serving way.  The Bill flies in the face of policy decisions of recent years that maintained a critical independent role for An Bord Pleanála regarding our built environment.I welcome the provision that puts the inspector of prisons on a statutory footing, something for which Fine Gael has been calling for some time.  The current inspector, the Mr. Justice Dermot Kinlen, has been rightly critical of the Minister and the current prison regime.  I admire him for highlighting some serious issues in our prisons.  The manner in which his important reports have been treated by the Minister is deplorable.  For the past three years the Minister has held off publishing the inspector's reports until the end of the Dáil session, stifling any debate on them by the Oireachtas.  It is cowardly and petty and I hope the change in the status of the inspector's office will cause the Minister to revise his attitude.Under section 32(3), the Minister will be obliged to publish and lay before the Houses of the Oireachtas, the annual report of the inspector on the performance of his or her functions.  Unfortunately, section 32 does not indicate a timeframe within which that requirement must be fulfilled, and I will table an amendment on Committee Stage to ensure it is not delayed as has been the case in recent years.  Section 35(1) allows the Minister to "make rules for the regulation and good government of prisons".  I was not aware the Minister had to put this in legislation; I thought he already had the power to do this.As stated on Second Stage of the previous Bill, I share the Minister's views on drug-free prisons, with the proviso that proper rehabilitation and modern medical facilities are set up in prisons.  In this regard I am pleased to see the measures in section 35(2)(i) that allows for the testing of prisoners for drugs.  However, I have doubts about the effectiveness of mandatory drug testing as it has been unsuccessful in solving prison drug use in other jurisdictions.  For example, Scotland recently terminated a mandatory drugs testing programme after ten years because it found it simply had little or no effect on the number of prisoners taking drugs, was costing a substantial amount of money and was proving to be very bad value for money.  I am interested in hearing the Minister’s response to remarks by the governor of Mountjoy Prison, John Lonergan, that a drug-free prison cannot exist without denying prisoners fundamental rights of access to and physical contact with family members, children and spouses.  Is it the Minister’s opinion that we should restrict physical contact between prisoners and visitors?Given that drugs are routinely passed to prisoners in children's nappies, gifts and food and inter-orally, and accepting that there is no foolproof way of non-invasively searching all visitors, what is the Minister's view on balancing prisoners' rights to see their families in person rather than over a telephone line through a Perspex screen with the rights of prison authorities to put in place strict measures to prevent drug infiltration for the good of prisoners and that of the wider community and society as a whole?  How does he perceive a scheme to eradicate drug use in prisons operating.  Drugs in prisons are a major problem.  Leaving aside the apparently tolerated illegality involved, the scope of this problem means non-drug users who are sent to prison are in enormous peril of becoming drug addicts, thereby further exacerbating the significant drug problem. For example, I know of a drug-free wing in Mountjoy Prison where the non-use of drugs is strictly enforced.  If a prisoner is found using drugs in that wing, he is transferred to another wing that is not necessarily drug-free.  Does the Minister believe this kind of double standard is tolerable and is he convinced the introduction of mandatory drug testing would solve the problem?I do not have a difficulty with the provisions of section 36.  The most important words in the amendments to the 2000 Act are "non-commercial".  I would be opposed to any other scheme.  However, as long as it pertains to non-commercial work, such as the activities outlined by the Minister in his press release of 14 November 2006, namely, cleaning or kitchen work; educational, training or work experience activities; and the production of goods or services which are for the purposes of raising funds for charitable purposes or are provided without charge or with nominal charge, I am happy for the amendment to the 2000 Act to be passed.With regard to the provisions in section 37 which allow the Minister to provide for charges to be made to prisoners for goods or services that are not generally available to prisoners, the section as drafted is unduly broad and unspecific.  For example, section 37 currently includes telephone calls, access to electronic devices, private medical treatment or escorts provided outside the prison for matters not related to their imprisonment, but there are many other undefined services for which a prisoner could be charged.  Furthermore, it is not clear what is meant by some of the specified services.  Paragraph (b) refers to access to electronic devices.  I or another person might immediately think of the Internet, a computer or even a personal stereo, but someone else might decide paragraph (b) refers to a toaster, a television, a radio or a kettle.  Surely the devices included in this section should be clearly specified to remove any doubt.  Will it be the case that prisons, notwithstanding the last part of the section, will forbid prisoners from owning their own electronic devices in order that they will have to rent them from the prison?  I pose this question for the Minister.Paragraph (c) is particularly worrying because it covers medical treatment.  Does it mean prisons will no longer provide access to a doctor?  For the purposes of the section, what does requesting a service mean?  What does the Bill mean by “private” medical treatment?  Are we talking about an optional visit to a doctor for a check-up or some unspecified reason or are we talking about a prisoner who is experiencing chest pain?  At the risk of sounding facetious, if someone collapses and is unconscious, can he or she be deemed to have requested the private medical treatment?  I am worried about the precedent that would be created by a legislative proposal that effectively suggests prisoners should not have access to medical treatment unless they are willing to pay for it.Paragraph (d) allows prisons to charge prisoners for escorts provided outside the prison for matters not related to the imprisonment of those prisoners.  I understand the logic behind this and am aware it can be costly for prisoners to be gallivanting around under the supervision of highly trained prison officers.  However, I cannot think of many examples where a prisoner who requires a security escort would seek and obtain permission to be out and about.  The examples I can think of include attendance at weddings, funerals and other exceptional events.  Does the Minister propose a prisoner should have to pay a potentially substantial sum in order to attend his or her father’s funeral or his daughter’s wedding?  There is a substantial lack of clarity in this provision which must be resolved.Finally, I assure the Minister that Fine Gael supports, in broad stokes, this Bill.  However, I have many reservations about its specifics and, as I previously stated, will table amendments to effect changes in this regard on Committee Stage.  I hope the Minister will take time to consider them carefully and seriously.

I have not seen him since his appointment and wish him well in both posts.I welcome the Bill.  Its explanatory memorandum states, and the Minister has told us, that it will add a number of additional elements to the entire prison structure.  The Minister mentioned that the office of an inspector of prisons would be put on a statutory footing, which is a very good idea.  I am aware such an office is already in place but is not on a statutory basis.  Senator Cummins accused the Minister of running away from change but given that he structured this in such a way that an individual must report to him on an annual basis and present an independent report informing him about what is right and wrong within the prison service is a testament to the fact that he is not afraid to hear bad news if it exists.

#TonyKett	unknown-#TonyKett-party	unknown-#TonyKett-dob	unknown-#TonyKett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-11-22 00:00:00	Prelude	113	I do not know what more Senator Cummins could ask for.  His own party will have the option to object to or discuss matters relating to decisions the Minister might make in respect of the building and development of prisons from now on, which is admirable.The Minister has had a few calls to make in the past 18 months to two years, particularly in respect of the Garda reserve force and prison officers' overtime.  I applauded him for his stance on both issues.  He was not for turning on either of them and I thought of the expression, "You can love him, you can hate him but you don't ignore him".  This was the case in respect of his stance on prison officers' overtime.  That his changes have now been accepted is a vindication of his determination in the first instance and the Government's support for him.  The immoral and unsustainable levels of overtime paid to prison officers at that time, in excess of their gross pay, could not be sustained.  Something that was costing us €60 million per annum now saves us in the region of €30 million and, as far as I am aware, there has been no effect on the efficiency or effectiveness of the service.The Minister said that he has changed his mind on privatising the prisoner escort service and that he will leave it within the existing framework, albeit in a different guise.  I would have no difficulty with the privatisation of that service.  A number of prison officers are tied up in it, as are a number of gardaí who could be otherwise engaged in the frontline activity of tackling crime.  However, I am pleased the Minister is satisfied that the way he has dealt with this service will result in continuing efficiency and financial saving.I can also understand the reason the Minister might have been slow to privatise the service in the first instance.  He might have had concerns about the passing of the operation of the service, traditionally run by the State, to an outside agency, whose aim is to make a profit and that the individuals who would be involved in it would want to make a profit.  If there was corner cutting or anything like that, the safety of the public would have to be primary in the Minister's consideration in making such a change.  While I can understand why he might be slow to make the change I can also understand why he might do it at a future date if circumstances change.  Having read the explanatory memorandum, I am satisfied the Minister has included sufficient safeguards in the Bill to ensure that in the event of such a change, provision for the certification of individuals who would operate this process ensures the necessary safety mechanisms are in place.The introduction of video conferencing is a great idea.  I said that on the last occasion we spoke about this issue in 2005.  It seems such an excellent and cost-saving method one wonders why it was not introduced long ago.  If it is operated to its optimum level, it will provide great savings and the avoidance of hardship.  As the Minister stated, it is not possible to have video conferencing on all occasions because there are times, for obvious reasons, when people must go to court.  Apart from the financial saving that would be offered by its introduction, it would result in a reduction in security requirements with people not having to be brought to court.The crime that probably exasperates most people, as it does me, is that committed by 15 to 18 year olds.  These young people are too old to stay at home with their parents and watch television.  They are too young to be served alcohol in a pub and, as consequence of that, they go to the local off-licence to buy alcohol.  They then go to the local park and fill themselves up with alcohol and on the way home create havoc.  If one knocks on the door of a house in any housing estate on the north side or south side of this city, people will say, including myself, that the greatest curse are these young lads going home at 12.30 a.m. or 1 a.m.  Wing mirrors of cars have been broken on countless occasions.I have spoken about this problem to Garda sergeants and inspectors in my local area.  I will cite an incident involving an individual that would drive people crazy, as it did my neighbour.  This young fellow walked down the road at 9 a.m. and threw a bin on top of my neighbour's brand new car.  The neighbour telephoned the gardaí who came down and brought the young man to the Garda station but three hours later he was back sitting on my neighbour's wall waiting for him to come out to give him the old gesture.  He then proceeded to throw a rock through my neighbour's front window, gave him the two fingers, called him a scab and ran away.Such vandalism drives people crazy.  There is nothing one can do about it as it is a feature of society.  A number of these individuals are to be found hanging around.

#TonyKett	unknown-#TonyKett-party	unknown-#TonyKett-dob	unknown-#TonyKett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-11-22 00:00:00	Prelude	115	I appreciate that many of them have had a poor upbringing, have suffered abuse and violence in the home and have been seriously neglected.  Such abuse was probably never adequately addressed in some instances or recognised in other instances.  The parents cannot crawl out from under the rock in this regard.  While education has a major role to play in such cases, a fog seems to drift over other young boys who attend secondary school after consuming alcohol at night and then become hooligans.The majority of the young people engaged in such crime probably left school with no qualification and some of them may be illiterate.  We must rescue them at the earliest possible time from engaging in such behaviour.  We need to get them off the streets into an educational environment, in a prison if necessay.  In most cases it probably would be the place to provide for them.  It is not good enough simply to log their crimes and let them back on the street.  The courts are a major player in regard to such cases.  Something must be done to alleviate the stress and anxiety caused to people by such criminal behaviour.  It may be minor, and to a large extent it is, but it is major to the individual who suffers it.Many of these young people have a low level of education.  I would say that many of the young people in St. Patrick's Institution are categorised universally as such.  The system has failed them and, consequently, they have failed to achieve.  Given the importance of education for the future of these young people, under rehabilitation programmes priority must be given to make up to them for what they have lost by giving them training and educational opportunities that will help them present better for jobs.

If one is illiterate, one cannot avail of the other educational advantages that might be available.  Many of these young people have low self-esteem and if one has low self-esteem, one does not respect oneself or society.  These are all issues the Minister has tackled at different levels in his time in office.  I have no doubt we are tackling them by degrees.I strongly support the view, one the Minister has echoed at different times, that we must regard imprisonment as a last resort.  Those in prison, in the main, have been marginalised.  It was said at one time that one only had to look at someone's postal address to realise how they would end up.  Unfortunately, that is still the case because disadvantage breeds disadvantage.  It is why these young people have ended up where they are.  It is incumbent on all of us to ensure that we do what we can to change the position to bring about a change for them.We are also dealing with an expanding population.  I heard Opposition Members say that we should not consider increasing our current prison spaces.  In 30 years' time we probably will have a population of 8 million as distinct from a current population of more than 4 million.  It is naive in the extreme to think that we will not require more prison spaces.The Judiciary must also play its part.  If the Judiciary, in dealing with cases, determines that young people can be kept out of prison rather than put into it, there is an onus on us to fund alternatives such as probation, supervision and restorative justice services, which the Minister is doing.  We have seen the level of financial commitment the Minister has given to a range of areas in the system since his time in office.  I have no doubt that will continue,I applaud what the Minister is doing in the Bill.  It will substantially improve, in a practical way, the existing elements of the justice system.  I wish it well in its passage through the House.

I also welcome the Bill.  We debated the matter earlier in the year and I will not repeat what we covered on that occasion.In 1993, on one of my first occasions to speak in the Seanad, I spoke on a prisons Bill.  I asked rhetorically what was the purpose of prison.  Reasons for prisons are punishment, to act as a deterrent, and to protect society from those who commit crime and rehabilitation.Whatever our mixture of reasons for putting people in jail, if we are honest we must admit the prison service is bad at fulfilling any of these, even acting as a deterrent or keeping society safe.  Meanwhile, it succeeds in far less attractive and desirable matters.  Our prisons provide an excellent education and training system for the life of crime.  Someone told me in Dublin we have four universities and asked me to name the fourth.  He meant we had UCD, Trinity and DCU but that we also had the university of Mountjoy.  He argued that of the four, Mountjoy had the most predictable results for its graduates.

#FergalQuinn	unknown-#FergalQuinn-party	unknown-#FergalQuinn-dob	unknown-#FergalQuinn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-11-22 00:00:00	Prelude	123	I had not thought of that.  Let us do that if the university seats will get the benefit.  I am not sure who would do well out of them.I am influenced by a meeting I had last week.  I like name dropping, and this meeting was with someone who perhaps might be a future president of the United States, Rudi Giuliani.  We spoke at a conference and during the question and answer session, he listed his achievements from when he was mayor of New York.  He claimed one of his major achievements was that he solved the major crime problem.  New York was known as the crime centre of the world.  It was a dangerous place to be.  After he had spent five years in office, it was cleaned up.In my experience, New York is a different city now than it was 20 years ago when I first knew it.  Mr. Giuliani takes credit for that.  He stated when someone gets a ten-year sentence, it means ten years.  When he spoke about the various aspects of jail, no word of rehabilitation was mentioned.  I did not hear it from him.  That is dangerous.  He may have solved the problem in central New York.  I was told afterwards that the problem went elsewhere.When I spoke on this subject years ago, I realised we have ways to solve it.  Having listened to the news during recent days, especially about the young Latvian mother killed in Swords and her lawyer who had to leave the country because he was threatened, I am frightened to think about what is happening in the country.  We could have an outcry to lock up people and throw away the keys.  We must take serious steps to ensure we use our prisons not only for rehabilitation but also to protect society.  We must keep both those balls in the air.Senator Cummins queried electronic devices and other details of the Bill.  We should not include too much detail in a Bill such as this.  Management is about getting results through other people.  The wording the Minister included in the Bill is correct.  It gives the person in charge, whether it is the Minister of the day with responsibility for justice or the governor of a prison, an opportunity to decide what is right in particular circumstances.A major problem in Irish prisons is the level of inactivity.  People are locked away for 16, 17 or 18 hours with nothing to do.  If that is not solved, we will not be able to release people having rehabilitated them in some form.  Recently, I read of 1,000 new prison places by 2010.  I do not know whether it is in the Minister's speech.  One's first thought is that it is a shame we need them.  However, it looks as if we do.Will the Minister comment on how well we fight against drugs?  Drugs in prisons seem to be a serious and not easily solvable problem.  We have alcohol counsellors.  Do we have drugs counsellors and if so, how many?  The link to inactivity and drugs is serious.  I understand we can control the amount of alcohol entering prison and that it is far less easy to control the amount of drugs.Mr. Giuliani spoke about ensuring the length of prison sentences mean what they say.  If someone is sentenced to ten years, can we ensure he or she serve ten years, perhaps with remission for good behaviour?  This Bill attempts to do so.  The so-called revolving door was discussed on the radio today.Technology such as video conferencing and electronic tagging was referred to.  We do not use technology to the extent we could and should.  I assume the Minister suggests new prisons and new prison places will be geared to enable us to use technology and the Bill will ensure we can do so.Outsourcing is correct in general business terms and is regarded as a sensible means of completing what is not part of core business.  Is escorting part of the core business of the Prison Service?  As somebody with business experience, I am frightened at the amount of overtime being paid.  If a better way exists, we should use it.  I understand the Minister has arranged courthouses in prisons in order that those on remand do not need to go to the other end of the country to appear in court, accompanied by a couple of gardaí or prison officers each time.  It makes good economic sense to achieve that.Overall, I support the Bill and what the Minister wants to achieve.  The Bill is clearly designed.  However, it has not received the same attention I thought it would.  It seems if I stop speaking, the Bill will have gone through its Second Stage.  Senator Cummins is wondering whether anyone else will come in to speak.  However, I will not continue to speak on that basis.I applaud what the Minister wishes to do.  I also applaud the new prisons, and not only Thornton Hall.  The objectives of what the Minister wishes to achieve have a better chance of being reached with the steps being put in place.  I am concerned if we are not careful, we will have an outcry against crimes, especially the vicious crimes committed in recent days and controlled and planned crimes which people order to be committed because they can.  They did not happen in the past.  It now appears the crimes that are taking place are not only well planned but are ordered by mafia-style gangs or other types of gangs.  They are also influenced very much by the amount of illegal drugs involved and the money accruing from their sale.  I support the Minister in his efforts and I hope the Bill is passed so that its objectives can be achieved.
#JimWalsh	unknown-#JimWalsh-party	unknown-#JimWalsh-dob	unknown-#JimWalsh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-11-22 00:00:00	Prelude	124	I join in welcoming the Minister to the House to introduce this important legislation on prisons.  Some time ago, we had a similar debate on this issue.  Apart from this legislation, other practical steps have been taken by the Minister to improve prison capacity.  In addition, prison conditions are quite commendable.  Members of the House who serve on the Joint Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women's Rights visited Mountjoy Prison some time back.  It must be said that one could not stand over the Victorian or Dickensian conditions and inadequate facilities which persist there.  Both Mountjoy and St. Patrick's Institution are entirely inadequate for young people in particular.  There is a stark contrast between Mountjoy Prison and the Dóchas facility for female prisoners.  Those of us on that visit came away with the strong view that Dóchas was much more conducive to the rehabilitation of prisoners, which is what we should be seeking.In a previous debate in the House, the Minister acknowledged the view of many Members that prison should be a last resort.  We have seen people being imprisoned for what are serious crimes but which are far from the organised crimes which frequently grab newspaper headlines.  As a consequence of networking and the contacts they make in prison, those imprisoned for less serious crimes emerge much more equipped and inclined to become involved in a range of far more serious crimes than those for which they were initially incarcerated.  It is essential, therefore, to have a justice system which will enable such people to make restitution to society for their crimes without having to serve time in jail.We have discussed a range of alternatives in this regard.  These include community service which is now part of our justice system, although it may not be well organised or used as frequently as we might like.  We should avoid imprisoning people for less serious crimes while ensuring that they pay a price to society for their offences.  In its own way, that can be rehabilitative so it is the right way to go.  Such a system needs to be organised, however, so that the work undertaken is of real benefit to communities rather than forcing offenders to go through the motions by doing so many hours of community service.  There should be a real benefit from such work.  I do not know whether we could organise something through local government or an arm of Government whereby works undertaken in that regard would be of demonstrable benefit to society.Some Members of the Opposition in the Lower House have mentioned the possibility of offenders doing service in the Defence Forces.  The idea was ridiculed during a debate on RTE's  "Questions and Answers" programme but it struck me that there may be some merit in it as an alternative to serving time in prison.  Historically, the French foreign legion was known for its legendary feats of courage, training, commitment and dedication.  Many recruits to the legion came from outside France but had committed offences there.  Their participation in the foreign legion helped them to expunge their debt to society.  I am not suggesting that we should establish an Irish foreign legion but there is some merit in the idea of military service for offenders.  It is too easy to dismiss these alternative ideas.On a number of occasions, the Joint Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women's Rights has discussed these matters.  We have been frequently reminded by Deputies O'Connor and Hoctor that restorative justice functions well in Tallaght and north Tipperary.  There is scope for extending that system throughout the country because it forces offenders to confront the effects of their crimes on victims.  In doing so, they may well follow a better route in future.Almost invariably, when sentences are suspended and the people involved later reoffend, the suspended sentences run concurrently with the subsequent sentences.  That strikes me as a major anomaly.  A suspended sentence is a tremendous facility afforded to one who commits a crime.  If one reoffends during the term of a suspended sentence, however, I cannot see why both the suspended and subsequent sentences should not run consecutively.  In that way, a person would clearly know that if he or she commits a crime subsequently, he or she will serve the suspended sentence in addition to any other sentence imposed.  Consecutive sentencing should also apply to serious crimes committed by people on bail.  Where crimes of a less serious nature are concerned, we should look to other ways whereby people can make restitution, including court orders restricting movement.Some people spend time in jail for failing to meet their financial commitments.  I would like to see a legal mechanism whereby, when courts determine that someone has not paid his or her debts to another person or institution, an attachment order could be made to the wages or social welfare payments of debtors.  In that way, money can be recovered by those to whom it is owed, rather than sending the debtor to jail.  Some debtors may consider a short jail term as a concessionary alternative to having to meet their financial commitments.  We could be more innovative in our approach to such matters.We have already debated the drugs issue on numerous occasions and it has re-emerged during this debate.  A good friend of mine, who is a sensible businessman, has argued strongly that we should legalise certain drugs.  I am not an expert in this area but I know the argument against doing so is that people who use soft, so-called gateway drugs can gravitate to much harder drugs, such as heroin.  Across Europe, we are failing to deal effectively with the drugs issue.  This applies to many crimes from organised crime, where paid assassins carry out murders, to drugs gangs involved in serious offences aside from the importation and sale of drugs.  At the other end of the scale are the drug addicts involved in petty crime, which can be serious to victims, to fund their addiction.  The EU should review its stance on these issues to deal with them in a more effective way.  A whole new approach is required.  I am gradually moving towards my friend's opinion on the issue and it should be evaluated in a thorough, professional way, although it is easy to dismiss such suggestions.This Bill relates to the issue of prisons and I welcome it almost entirely.  It is a major step forward in prison reform and the resourcing and facilities behind it will bring significant improvements.  However, in conjunction with this, we must remove from the prison population all but serious criminal offenders who should be locked up for long periods.  Early release should not rest solely on good behaviour.  The offender should satisfy the authorities that the probability of re-offence is very low because society should be protected from hardened criminals.

I had not expected to speak on this debate, but there was a misunderstanding over the number of speakers and I was called upon at short notice.I have read the Bill and the Minister's script and there is a great deal in them with which no sensible person could disagree.  I know many people who have been in prison, although I have never been a prisoner.  On two successive weeks I had the extraordinary experience of lecturing in Portlaoise Prison to those calling themselves political prisoners, although I do not recognise them as such.  I am notoriously prickly about things and I am not sure it is appropriate to have a Member of the Oireachtas searched and have everything of significance taken from his pockets.  The typical argument is that such measures are taken to protect me from the prison population but I am not persuaded of that.  I think it is deemed simpler to carry out such actions than to make exceptions for certain people with a role in the legislative process.I went through four sets of double doors to reach the platform from which I addressed IRA prisoners one week and Irish Republican Socialist Party, IRSP, or Irish National Liberation Army, INLA, prisoners the next.

It felt surreal to discuss the nature of the Voluntary Health Insurance, VHI, system with a person serving the fifth year of a 40-year sentence for the murder of a garda.  The experience lived with me.I can understand the occasional, headline grabbing statement on the luxury of living in prison but anyone who makes such comments has even less experience of the prison system than I do.  The prospect that such enclosure will be one's life for six months, not to mention 40 years, is quite overwhelming.

#BrendanRyan	unknown-#BrendanRyan-party	unknown-#BrendanRyan-dob	unknown-#BrendanRyan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-11-22 00:00:00	Prelude	129	Senator Walsh misunderstands me.  My point is that the deprivation of liberty is the penalty.  We take liberty for granted to such an extent that it is impossible to appreciate the effect of losing it.  Crime cannot be separated from deprivation.The other type of prisoner I knew related to the time I spent with the Simon Community.  Having spoken to paramilitary prisoners in Portlaoise and homeless, mostly alcoholic, former prisoners who used the Simon Community,  I am not persuaded that prison works in any way as a deterrent.  Prison serves one purpose successfully and that is keeping dangerous people away from the general population.  Of all the petty criminals I have known, those in prison for shoplifting, minor assault, drunk and disorderly behaviour, vagrancy, and so on, whether the penalty was imprisonment for six months or ten years was a matter of total indifference.  This is true of a large section of the criminal class.  We should not lock up serious drug pushers because the penalties will deter them but because it keeps us safe from them.  This does not render us as safe as we would wish but prison is the safest place for such offenders.Protecting society from specific people is one reason for having prisons, but it protects us from only a certain number of them.  I am profoundly sceptical of the logic behind the philosophy that sees prison acting as a deterrent.  The Minister is a very able man, regardless of my views on his opinions, and he may have access to serious, intellectually sustainable evidence that shows prison to work as a deterrent or to have a rehabilitative function.  If this is the case, I would like to see it.  I feel there may be a good deal of evidence that prison has the opposite effect.There is a romantic notion that some people wish to go to prison to escape the winter, which may be true of two or three people in desperate circumstances, but it does not apply to the many homeless alcoholics I have met nor does it apply to the overwhelming bulk of minor criminals who spend a week here and there in prison.  I recall a young man, now in his 40s and living permanently on the streets, who spent seven of the eight years between 13 and 21 either in juvenile detention or prison and it made no difference to his often obnoxious behaviour.  A few people tried to help him along the way, not that it would be of any consolation to a person assaulted by him.We must ask what prisons work towards.  Many felt they worked for the Prison Officers' Association and I am glad the Minister achieved what he did in this regard because the practices tolerated were an embarrassment to the trade union movement.

I do not think the trade union movement had anything to gain from what was going on.  I am not sure of the purpose behind the enabling parts of this Bill relating to private security firms carrying out prisoner transportation.  Perhaps it is a stick to wave at prison officers to ensure they keep their side of the bargain.  I am not sure what stick they need to wave at the Minister to ensure he keeps his side of the bargain.
#FergalQuinn	unknown-#FergalQuinn-party	unknown-#FergalQuinn-dob	unknown-#FergalQuinn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-11-22 00:00:00	Prelude	132	I move:That Seanad Éireann, mindful of the crucial impact of inflation on the nation's competitiveness and the recent figures which show that our inflation rate continues to run well above the EU average, calls on the Minister of Finance to make the containment of inflation during 2007 the top priority in his forthcoming budget.I welcome the Minister of State at the Department of Finance, Deputy Parlon, to this important debate.  I had no problem composing the motion which I worded in a manner that would not invite an amendment.  I gave considerable thought to the use of the term "top priority" given that the Government will have other priorities.  The reason the motion calls for the containment of inflation to be made the top priority is that our objectives in health, education or on law and order will not otherwise be achieved.  For this reason, I was interested to note comments by the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Dermot Ahern, reported in a newspaper today.  He stated:Prosperity is a prerequisite for all our ambitions — in health, enterprise, welfare and education.  To that end, Fianna Fáil in Government will defend prosperity with unequalled determination.Given that this statement precisely reflects the sentiments expressed in the motion, I assumed the Government parties would not table an amendment to the motion.It is with some trepidation that I propose the motion to the House two weeks before the Budget Statement by the Minister for Finance.  My reluctance arises from the fact that the subject of inflation has become something of a bore.  Few Members and practically no one in Government appear to care about it.  It is regrettable that this probably reflects the views of members of the public who also appear to be largely indifferent to the danger of inflation.  The same factors that give rise to my trepidation also encourage me to persevere with the business of raising this matter in the House again.  Notwithstanding the widespread public and political indifference to the dangers of inflation, I strongly believe it is the greatest challenge we face as we prepare the economy to meet the challenges that lie ahead.The irony of the current position is that the threat of inflation is widely recognised internationally.  For example, a recent issue of  The Economist gave banner headlines to it and the issue was also a high priority for the G20 group of Finance ministers which met in Melbourne at the weekend.  It is also high on the priority list of central bankers around the world, particularly those in Europe.  Across the developed world the growing danger of inflation and the need to control it by pre-emptive means is recognised as a major challenge but it is one that many are determined to face.The irony arises because we face a much greater danger than anywhere else in the world if we allow the current trend in our inflation rate to continue.  Throughout the period of the Celtic tiger, domestic inflation has run far ahead of inflation in the outside world.  Not once has it fallen below the European average and it has been considerably above average for most of the period.  For this reason, the complacency apparent in the amendment tabled by the Fianna Fáil Party is a matter of concern.In the past week I had the opportunity to visit Brazil and Argentina.  I remember my experience of inflation in Brazil during my only other visit to the country, which was in 1976.  As one drove around one could see three or four Volkswagen cars in the front gardens of homes.  Inflation had reached such a level that using hard currency to buy goods which would hold their value for several months was the only way to protect oneself from the problem.I visited Argentina in 1991 shortly after the country tied its currency to the dollar.  That position continued for ten years until late 2001, when the Argentinian Government lost control of the currency and its value collapsed.  Having experienced the danger of inflation in these two countries 30 years and five years ago, respectively, I am worried by the level of complacency evident here.An article in yesterday's edition of The Irish Times noted: “Exports fell in September, reversing gains made in August, according to trade figures released yesterday by the Central Statistics Office (CSO)”.  Despite the threat posed by inflation, the Government is complacent, as the amendment illustrates.The difference between the Irish inflation rate and that of our European partners over several years has had a cumulative effect in that Ireland's starting point vis-à-vis its EU counterparts worsens every year.  The result, as everyone is aware, is that Ireland has moved from being a low cost to a high cost country in the past decade.  In many respects, this is the most expensive country in Europe.  This is not a controversial statement — everyone knows it is true — but, astonishingly, no one appears to care.  While there is, as one would expect, some griping about high prices, nowhere is there a full awareness of the implications of creeping inflation for the future of the economy and the economic well-being of every person who lives and works here.  Inflation is the elephant in the room, the subject about which no one wants to talk.Why is this?  People are not stupid so our inability to face up to the consequences of inflation is due a national complacency economic success has created.  We have fooled ourselves into believing that because things have gone so well in the past decade, they will continue to go well in the future and there will be no end to the prosperity we currently enjoy.This blind complacency has prevented us from doing the sums on inflation, and the sums involved are simple.  For every year that passes when our inflation is higher than the outside world, we lose a corresponding degree of national competitiveness.  This impact has a cumulative effect because we do not start afresh each year, we inherit the playing field from the previous year and it is frightening how quickly things can go wrong, even when the figures involved are modest.  If our inflation is 2% above the norm internationally, that does not appear much but if we continue like that year on year, as we have done for a decade, it rapidly amounts to a major difference and that is what has happened.Yesterday I attended the board meeting of an international organisation where we were planning the fees for next year.  The chairman, who is not Irish, said that we would increase the fees by 2% because people would readily accept that.  Two Japanese colleagues on the board howled that it would be dishonest and that Japan had experienced deflation for a number of years and expected prices to fall.  We are so complacent that we assume a 2% increase is acceptable.Without realising, we have become highly uncompetitive.  The goods we produce for export markets have become less competitive than they once were and, more importantly, when we try to attract foreign direct investment, the lifeblood of the economy, we have made ourselves much less attractive than many of the countries competing with us for that investment.In The Irish Times yesterday, there was an article headed “Moody’s stresses importance of foreign investment here” and it reported:In its 2006 credit analysis, Moody's described the Irish economy as resilient, flexible and characterised by high growth rates.  However, despite the State's considerable strengths, foreign direct investment levels declined over the past two years, Moody's noted."One point of concern for international cost competitiveness is the Irish inflation differential with the euro zone," Mr. Kockerbeck said.In the past two years we have seen many businesses close down and leave Ireland for less costly locations in eastern Europe and Asia.  Ominously we have lost not only manufacturing concerns but some of the service industries we have started to emphasise.Those closures have generated publicity but they are not the most serious part of the picture — the greater number of companies that are not choosing to locate in Ireland.  They do not even bother to visit IDA Ireland because they know the sums do not add up.  There are many other elements in competitiveness than costs but they are the crucial hurdle we must overcome to attract and retain investment.  If we cannot compete on costs, we often do not get the chance to compete on other factors where we might not be at such a disadvantage.  This is the elephant in the room that is sending out messages we seem determined to ignore.Can we do anything or must we stand helpless while the realities of a global economy slowly come down to bear on us?  We cannot wave a magic wand and make this problem disappear, we can never make Ireland a low cost location again, and we do not want to.  We can, however, hold back the tide and that should be a national priority.  We should run the economy on the basis that the important task we face is to contain inflation.  We should identify inflationary trends and threats in advance and focus on those we can control to some extent.  We cannot control the price of oil but we can control our dependence on it.  We cannot control euro or dollar exchange rates, although we can act to mitigate the negative impact of currency movements that go against us.  In the matters where we have control, it should be a priority to contain inflation.The way we have handled the impending increases in the prices of electricity and gas is a perfect example of what we should not do.  In August, the regulator approved massive increases in gas and electricity prices based on the level of oil prices at the time on the assumption those levels would continue for the year ahead.  Circumstances have shown these price increases were based on a totally false assumption.  After peaking in August, oil prices have fallen to their lowest level in more than a year.  Incredibly, however, the regulator, supported by the Government, has stubbornly refused to revisit the price increases.  If this situation is allowed to continue, we will shoot ourselves in the foot and we will deserve everything that happens to us.The overall situation with inflation is so serious it calls for urgent and dramatic Government action.  Measures can be introduced to the forthcoming budget that will alleviate this threat.  My purpose in tabling this motion is to encourage the Government to take those measures and to recognise the elephant in the room.I discovered an example today.  The Competition Authority is investigating complaints that some taxi companies have formed cartels and are telling their drivers not to charge the full cost of fares introduced by the taxi regulator in September.  Drivers for some companies have been told they will not be allowed to work if they impose the full fares.  The new fare structure aims to create one rate for the entire State, including a €2 charge when drivers are called out to collect passengers.  Some taxi companies, however, have decided not to charge the call out fee and have told their drivers not to impose it.  We are saying that they must charge the extra fee but by doing so we are encouraging cartels, the very thing the Competition Authority acted to prevent when a group of oil suppliers in the west tried to achieve a similar outcome.We must keep our eye on the ball to ensure nothing we do encourages the growth of inflation.
#JoeOToole	unknown-#JoeOToole-party	unknown-#JoeOToole-dob	unknown-#JoeOToole-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-11-22 00:00:00	Prelude	133	I thank Senator Quinn for tabling this motion.  I agree with him about the importance of dealing with inflation.  In 2001 and2002, there were worries that inflation was about to take off again.  In the partnership talks, all sides raised the importance of the issue, so much so that we established a group to deal with inflation.  Whether we were successful or lucky, it dropped for a period following that but it is now growing again.I was asked by someone else today if inflation should be the top priority.  Economic indicators are crucial to the development of the economy so, yes, it should be.  It is one of the crucial first blocks on which we must build as economic indicators and fundamentals are crucial to the development of the economy and in terms of looking after people who are dependent on the economy and the State.What issues would we have spoken about 15 years ago?  They would include unemployment and interest rates, productivity and inflation.  It is significant that we have managed, over the past number of years, to deal with many of these other issues.  There is always an argument about productivity, but the productivity figures for the Irish economy in the past 15 years show only approximately three years when the rate did not rise faster than any other European country.  This is not economic growth but the productive output per worker per hour or day, and we should remember that.  We hardly speak about unemployment any more because it is at approximately 4%.  Interest rates are definitely coming back on to our radar.The problem with these issues is we do not see underlying trends.  I would not completely agree with some of the nuances of Senator Quinn's arguments, although I agree with the thrust of his points, and crucial among these is that there is no point arguing about the distribution of wealth unless wealth and prosperity is created.  I always made this argument when I was a representative in the trade union movement.  I agree that inflation is a crucial element in that regard.As a trade union official at national negotiations I had a simple bottom line of subtracting the inflation rate from the growth rate in the economy, and this was the figure people needed to get.  Inflation immediately becomes a bedrock part of negotiation, and it is the same for employers, who consider its cost impact.  Everybody considers it fully in all negotiations.  Ignoring it, or as Senator Quinn stated, to see it as the elephant in the room to which we would not refer, would be ridiculous.  We must deal with it.We should consider it in a way that people will understand its importance.  In the 1970s and 1980s, when inflation was completely out of control, our money was worth nothing, and it did not mean anything to us as time went on.  Where are we now on the inflation issue?  Both the Government and the Opposition do many people a disservice in this country with the type of discussion taking place on prices.  Senator Quinn's point on this is interesting, and that is the type of focus we must have.  The regulator made a mistake on fuel and electricity costs.  It sounds as if he was listening to the chairman of BP, who is consistently telling us the price of oil will increase year on year.I hope I am not shot down from any direction after my next comment.  I do not subscribe to the general idea of the rip-off republic or that this is the most expensive country in Europe.  I travel a lot but I never do so without checking prices.  All last weekend I heard people correctly stating that it was disgraceful that CIE was increasing prices.  It is good people would object for the reasons we have already stated, but it is ridiculous for people to say we are the most expensive in Europe.

It is similar in France.  It is interesting that Senator Quinn considered taxis, as people in Ireland always tell us how expensive taxis are.  I was delighted to see taxi fares being increased, as Irish taxis are far cheaper than those in London or Paris, again to take our two closest neighbours as examples, with which we are in competition.  Everywhere I go to shop I look at the price of a margherita pizza, Mach 3 razor blades and a litre of fuel.  Irish prices of such products have stabilised in the past five or six years.The Government, with the support of all parties, has considered the question of insurance premia and the high cost of insurance in the past ten years.  The issue was tackled by Deputy Rabbitte of the Labour Party when he was in Government, Fine Gael's Deputy Bruton, Deputy Harney when she was Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Martin, currently in the same job, and the Government as a whole.  All of us, including the trade union movement and employers, got together on this issue.  I declare an interest as I am deputy chairperson of the Personal Injuries Assessment Board, but we have managed to reduce insurance costs by almost 60%.  It shows what can be done if we take the advice of Senator Quinn in looking at issues such as inflation.I am sure the Minister of State did not bother to read the amendment to be proposed by his colleagues, which is appalling.

I welcome the Minister and his officials.  The price of prosperity is of course eternal vigilance, like the price of freedom.  There is no complacency whatever in the Government with regard to inflation.  As has been already pointed out by Senator O'Toole, when it looked as if inflation was in danger of getting out of hand in 2000 and 2001, the Government and social partners moved firmly and effectively to keep it down.  I pay tribute to them for this.  In a smaller way that has happened in the past two years.When I saw the first draft of this motion, I wondered if it was the Independent Senators' tribute to the late Milton Friedman.
#JoeOToole	unknown-#JoeOToole-party	unknown-#JoeOToole-dob	unknown-#JoeOToole-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-11-22 00:00:00	Prelude	142	Yes.

In a very interesting article billed on the front page as "Milton versus Keynes", the Financial Times points out that economic policy is actually a synthesis between the two.  A sentence of the article, written by Martin Wolf, states: “Over the past two decades, a world of flat money has supplied modest inflation and supported stable growth”.There is an ongoing debate in Europe, and Mr. de Villepin, the French Prime Minister, has quite sharply attacked the European Central Bank for placing too much emphasis on the exclusive combating of inflation at the expense of jobs and investment.  We have learned the hard way that those objectives must be balanced.  Our Minister for Finance, billed in the Financial Times as the most effective finance minister in the euro zone, is very conscious of his responsibilities in combating inflation, and he does not take the view that if one has it, spend it.In a sense, the motion is a little like what Germans call a Sonntags Rede, or a Sunday address or sermon.  One of the Independent Senators has many opportunities as the business editor of a Sunday newspaper to make Sunday addresses to the populace, rather than saying what he might in the privacy of this House.  The Sunday Independent  suggests that stamp duty should be abolished, that all taxpayers should be put on a rate of 20%, more or less in one go, and that the top rate should be cut.  Is there any inflation-proofing of those policies?  I think not.In an article in the  Irish Independent of Thursday, 16 November 2006, Brendan Keenan stated that if the Government were foolish enough to cut stamp duty without a countervailing tax on property itself, another bidding frenzy would be the likely result.  I reject the notion that inflation is the elephant in the room.  Listening to that sort of rhetoric, one would presume the inflation rate is 15%, 20% or 25%, but we have no such thing.  I worked out the average rate of inflation since 1987.  I accept the rainbow coalition was also in Government for two and a half years since then.  The average rate is 2.9% which, by all historical standards, is a great achievement.I refer to the Department of Finance statistics on the European comparisons.  The comparison is HICP, the standardised rate of inflation.  In 2004, Ireland's rate was 2.3% and the euro area average was 2.1%; Ireland's rate in 2005 was 2.2% and the euro area average was 2.2%.  The Minister for Finance in his pre-budget outlook admits that the rate this year will be slightly higher, at approximately half a per cent more.  The Central Bank suggests that having come in line with the euro area average in the past two years, on the figures I have quoted, Irish inflation will exceed the average this year before coming back broadly in line with the average in 2007.  The notion that we are way out of line has no basis.I will anticipate other contributions by Independent Senators.  When Senator Ross is in the House he usually vigorously attacks the public sector, and social partnership and benchmarking in particular.  It is healthy to note that in a National Competitiveness Council overview of Ireland's productivity performance in the period 1980 to 2005, it notes there is a good productivity performance in the public sector and international evidence suggests the Irish public sector performs well compared with public sectors in other countries.  Senator O'Toole will be familiar with the productivity of teachers in respect of the resources with which they are provided.  I am sure this bears any international comparison.The reason for the Government's amendment to the motion is clear.  Key objectives are to maintain employment and investment.  One would form the impression from the opening speech that we were ceasing to attract foreign direct investment.  In the constituency of Tipperary South, we have had four projects in as many months.  I admit one of them was a domestic expansion project.

We continue to have full employment.  I will readily concede we must be vigilant.  I am very glad the energy regulator is re-examining the price rises he approved earlier in the summer.  I note the Minister for Finance did not raise excise duties in either of the last two budgets.  However, attention must be paid and is being paid to what agencies at arm's length from the Government are doing.  A simple example of this is the CIE price increases which were screwed down from 9% to 4%.

I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Parlon, and his officials to the House.  The subject of inflation was debated in the House three years ago.  I share the sentiments expressed by Senator O'Toole with regard to the Government's amendment.  I disagree with Senator Mansergh who tries to paint a rosy picture.  At a time when inflation is in or around 4% — it was 3.9% for last month — it is important the House debates the issue.The Government amendment is lily-livered.  It notes that Irish inflation in EU terms is now not far off 2%.  I have never seen an amendment or a motion worded quite like it in my four and a half years in Seanad Éireann.  The Irish inflation rate for last month, as measured by the consumer price index, was 3.9%, a minor decrease from 4% the previous month and 4.5% the month before that.  This debate is therefore timely and important on what is a disproportionately high inflation rate compared to our European neighbours.For the purposes of its amendment, the Government decided to use the harmonised index of consumer prices and that rate, rather than what is acknowledged by everyone to be the actual true rate of inflation in the country——

The rate of inflation was 4.5% in the month of August and has been hovering around the 4% mark for most of this year.The Government's amendment also fails to acknowledge that the Government has had a distinct role to play in increasing inflation in the past couple of years.  This debate was held three years ago when inflation was running at approximately 3% annually and was slightly more for a period of time.  This followed on from the Government's decision, in the aftermath of the splurge at the general election of 2002, to increase VAT in the budget that took place immediately following that election.  There was also a substantial increase in excise duty on diesel which was enacted by the previous Minister for Finance, Charlie McCreevy, before he left office.  The Government has played a significant role in ensuring there are problems with regard to inflation in the economy.  It is high time the House heard some explanations.  I am interested to hear the Minister of State's response to the debate.The House should have debates on such subjects more frequently.  The rate of inflation is the clearest indication of the overall increase in the cost of living.  There have been significant increases in the cost of living in the past few years.  I disagree with Senator O'Toole in regard to Ireland not being the most expensive country although he gave some examples of where this is not the case.  It is acknowledged by most people that we have become a very expensive country.  Studies of prices from across the European Union would indicate that Ireland is——

It is also worth pointing out that the inflationary rate in terms of goods has remained flat, around 0%, for a considerable period of time.  However, there is significant inflationary pressure in the supply of services; last month's rate was 7.8%.  I am anxious to hear what proposals the Minister of State might have to take this in hand.  Contrary to the comments of the Minister for Foreign Affairs quoted earlier by Senator Quinn, the Government's actions do not often add up to or equal what they claim.A 2006 UBS report on prices and earnings stated that Dublin has become the eighth most expensive city in the world, ahead of Paris, Vienna, and the heavily taxed city of Helsinki.  There has been significant deterioration in people's purchasing power in the past few years.  We have not seen a commensurate level of debate or interest from most quarters.  A few Members occasionally raise the issue of inflation increases, but like the public, most Members do not seem to be as interested in this issue as they should be.  It has a direct bearing on the euro in everyone's pocket.I am not convinced by the Government's amendment to the motion, or by its actions.  I am not convinced that the Government is interested in bringing the rate of inflation closer to, or even below, the European average.  Senator Quinn mentioned that Ireland's inflation has consistently been above the European average for the past five or six years.  The Government has patted itself on the back on its financial and fiscal management.  As Senator Mansergh said, the Minister for Finance has been awarded an accolade by a newspaper.  However, we need to take this issue in hand before it becomes a more burning problem in the future.

The Government cares about inflation.  If the Government did not care about inflation it would not have published such a Book of Estimates as it recently did.  If we have growth of 5%, inflation of 3% and the Government increases spending by 8%, then that is neutral.  The Government does not contribute to inflation through public spending when it does that.  This is why the Minister was correct to say that what he did with the Estimates was prudent.  It is neutral.  Let us talk about facts not anecdote.The key is competitiveness.  Is the economy competitive?  I am aware of some of the things that have been said by American companies investing in Ireland.  However, we are also a stable democracy with an English speaking and highly educated workforce.  Notwithstanding the deficiencies in infrastructure, there are still companies that are prepared to invest here and create jobs.  Even if we had a planning system that could give a decision in the morning, a road cannot be built overnight.  It takes time.

#JohnDardis	unknown-#JohnDardis-party	unknown-#JohnDardis-dob	unknown-#JohnDardis-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-11-22 00:00:00	Prelude	162	I would like to know the roads the Opposition built when it was in power.This is an expensive economy, but it is also an economy with high incomes.  That is why people are coming to live and work here.  They will have a standard of living here that they could not dream of in countries with high inflation.  If I were asked to choose between an economy that is growing at a rate of up to 5.5%, which is the ESRI projection for next year, and inflation of 3%, and a European economy that will grow by 1%-2% but with an inflation rate of 2%, I would prefer to be here.  At more than 5%, our growth is higher than the level of inflation and our economy is not standing still or atrophying as is happening in some mainland European countries.We must appreciate what we have.  We seem to be continually whingeing about these matters.  That is not to say they are not important.  Senator Quinn is correct when he says they are highly important.  The Government is conscious of how important they are and that is why we are pursuing our policies.  These will ensure that the Government fulfils its responsibilities vis-à-vis the degree to which it can control inflation.We keep hearing that Ireland has the most open economy in the world.  If we have such an open economy, we will be vulnerable to what happens on international markets in energy and other imported goods.  I accept much of what has been said about the regulator and the increases that take place.  People think that oil is bought on an on-the-spot basis where energy suppliers go out every week and buy another few drums.  It is bought months in advance.  Therefore, these things take time to feed in.  There are swings and roundabouts.  If the price goes up the regulator is wrong, but he is also wrong if the price goes down.  There must be a benchmark that allows people to plan ahead.  No business can plan on the basis of a day-to-day price on the international oil markets.  If an agri-company is buying feedstuffs, it will do so on a forward market.  It will factor in currencies to ensure it knows the price the product will be and will not be vulnerable to the huge variations that can take place.  I am sure Senator Quinn is aware of that from his own business.What can the Government do?  It can make sure that the economy is competitive.  I believe the economy is competitive.  Senator O'Toole made a point about productivity, but productivity has increased.  I met a senior executive from one of the big American technology companies that has an Irish base.  I asked him why it did not go to the Far East where the labour is cheaper.  He replied that the labour content of the unit produced in Ireland is cheaper than the labour content to produce a unit in the Far East, even though the rates of pay are much less.  We produce a better unit.Some things are imported and we must accept that.  Our currency is part of a pan-European one and we are therefore circumscribed to a certain extent.  This is where the difficulty arises with European growth being at a lower rate than ours.  We must have a sense of proportion about this.  I do not see that sense of proportion in the columns of The Irish Times and other eminent newspapers.I return to the point that economic climate in the 1970s and 1980s was appalling.  It was appalling.  The best way we can combat poverty is to provide jobs.  One should look at the forecasts for job creation next year.  If this country were not competitive, if there were inflation, as seems to be suggested by those opposite, and if that were so catastrophic, jobs would not be created and we would go back to the bad old days when there was 14% unemployment, inflation was going through the roof and we paid 20% for our money.

I especially welcome the opportunity to outline the Government's achievements in terms of managing the economy and the public finances.  I will outline the real story which is quite different from Senator John Paul Phelan's flight of fancy when he described some of our inflation rates.  I am not sure from which publication he read but clearly he missed out on——
#JohnPaulPhelan	unknown-#JohnPaulPhelan-party	unknown-#JohnPaulPhelan-dob	unknown-#JohnPaulPhelan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-11-22 00:00:00	Prelude	164	I got them from the Central Statistics Office.

He made fair comments on value for money in Ireland.  I was going to comment on his jacket but he is not in the House.  Clearly, he threw caution to the wind when he purchased it but it is certainly very becoming.The real story of this Government is lower taxes, more jobs and better public services.  This Government has a strong record of economic achievement and we intend to continue to implement the prudent policies that have proven so successful in recent years.Before turning to the specifics of the motion before the House, I want to set the issues in context.  This Government's track record on the public finances is second to none.  The performance of the Irish economy over the past decade or so has been excellent in both international and historical terms.  Since the mid-1990s, gross domestic product, GDP, growth has averaged 7.5% per annum resulting in a convergence of Irish per capita incomes towards and subsequently beyond the old EU 15.In addition, the labour market has been transformed beyond all recognition.  It is not so long ago that the defining features of the Irish labour market were poor job creation, low participation rates, high unemployment and involuntary emigration.  Now the labour market is effectively at full employment with 2 million people in work, more than 500,000 jobs created since 1997 and an unemployment rate which, at 4.5%, is among the lowest in the developed world.  Emigration, the curse of Ireland for so long, has been replaced by substantial net immigration.Thanks to the policies we have pursued in the past decade, we have been able to more than halve our general Government debt burden.  As a consequence, debt servicing takes up a much lower share of overall public spending than it used to do.  To put this in perspective, debt servicing now accounts for only €1 in every €25 of tax revenues whereas ten years ago, it accounted for €1 in every €5.  The combination of our taxation reform and our success in reducing debt servicing has given us more than €40 billion more in resources than we had ten years ago.  This has been allocated to priority areas such as investment in infrastructure, education, maintaining the low tax burden and providing for future pension commitments.While justifiably proud of its achievements to date, the Government cannot and will not become complacent.  A firm and disciplined approach to national budgetary policy has been the keystone of our recent economic prosperity.  We will continue to maintain our commitment to sound public finances and improving the economy's competitiveness so that our economic and social objectives can be met.  Central to this is ensuring that public expenditure grows broadly in line with available resources.  Appropriate management of public expenditure reduces the pressure for increased tax levels and keeping tax levels low generates the economic growth that in turn generates the tax revenues to fund public expenditure.With this in mind, last week the Government published its pre-budget spending plan for 2007.  This plan allows for more than €14 billion to be spent on health, almost €8 billion on education services, and almost €14 billion on social welfare.  The strong economy we have built since 1997 makes such expenditure possible.  These Estimates will lead to improved public services and better infrastructure not only in 2007 but in the years ahead.  They are sustainable, targeted and appropriate as we work to build a stronger and fairer Ireland.I refer to competitiveness which was raised by a number of Senators.  Over the short to medium term, the prospects for the economy are favourable, as was recently set out in the Department's pre-budget outlook.  Growth rates of 5% per annum are in prospect, more than twice the EU average.  However, we recognise that clear challenges remain which must be addressed if living standards are to continue to improve as they have done over the past ten years.  As a small and very open economy, many of the main risks facing the economy are external in origin.  For example, it is generally accepted that the large current account deficit in the US will have to unwind at some stage.  Given our strong trade and investment links with the US, Ireland is potentially more vulnerable than most other EU member states to any correction of this position.  In addition, there is growing concern regarding developments in the US housing market and potential spillover effects to the wider US and global economies.To ensure our economy continues to evolve favourably, a key priority for this Government is enhancing national competitiveness.  The Government is keenly aware of the importance of Ireland's exporting sectors to investment and jobs and, in turn, of the importance of competitiveness for these sectors.  Inflation is just one of the factors impacting on competitiveness.  Competitiveness is also influenced by exchange rates, wage inflation, public spending growth and capital spending on infrastructure.  Therefore, the Government has developed a broad approach to deal with the factors it can influence.The annual rate of consumer price index, CPI, inflation was 3.9% in October, down marginally from the September increase.  A better measure of underlying inflation is the EU comparable measure of inflation, that is, the harmonised index of consumer prices, HICP, to which Senator Mansergh referred.  The HICP differs from the CPI in terms of coverage.  The most notable difference relates to the exclusion of mortgage interest repayments from the HICP.  Annual HICP inflation in Ireland was 2.2% in both September and October.  Last year CPI inflation measured 2.5% and HICP inflation was 2.2%, the same rate as for the euro area as a whole.When discussing inflation, it is first important to point out that the pick-up in inflation in 2006 has been largely due to external developments over which the Government has no control, namely, higher oil prices and increased interest rates by the European Central Bank.  The impact of these factors cannot be overstated.  For example, when the CPI is calculated excluding mortgage interest payments, it stood at 2% in the year to October.  There have been some positive developments recently with oil prices falling and this has reduced the retail price of petrol.  I am confident that over the course of next year, inflation will moderate as the impact of higher oil prices falls out of the annual comparison.As the bulk of the recent increase in inflation has been due to external factors which are outside our control, we must concentrate on areas which can be influenced domestically.  It must be recognised that tackling the problem requires a response from all sections of society and not only the Government as many of the domestic driving forces of inflation are outside the control of Government.  Annual services sector inflation is running at 7.8%, and this is a cause for concern.  This highlights the need for more competition in the economy as well as pay and profit restraint in all sectors to keep down our cost base.Where it can, the Government is taking action to contain inflation by implementing responsible fiscal policies.  For example, excise duties have not been increased in the past two years and the Government has removed the groceries order which should in time lead to greater price competition.  I also understand the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government specifically requested that to support competitiveness in the economy and to protect the interests of communities, local authorities should exercise restraint in setting any increases in commercial rates and local charges in 2006 and he intends reiterating this request to them in the context of their budgets for 2007.The Government is also investing in public infrastructure which will enhance our ability to produce more goods and services more efficiently and, therefore, help keep down inflation on a continuing basis.  To the extent that the prices of Government services reflect increased wage cost factors, the effort must be to make the provision of the services more efficient.  This is what we are seeking to do in modernising the public service.  Such Government action should assist in keeping down inflation but, as I have already mentioned, Ireland's competitive position is influenced by much more than inflation.One crucial factor in ensuring our competitiveness is how we respond to the opportunities and challenges posed by globalisation.  Ireland has been a substantial beneficiary of globalisation and we are now one of the most globally integrated economies in the world.  This integration into the world economy takes a number of forms, including deep trade linkages as well as through flows of capital and labour.  The emergence of large, labour-abundant countries such as China, India and Brazil, where labour costs are much lower than those in Ireland and the rest of the EU, means labour-intensive activity will increasingly relocate to these regions.  To maintain and enhance competitiveness in the context of a higher-cost economy, a greater focus on productivity across all sectors of the economy is essential because in the long term in a small economy like Ireland, economic prosperity ultimately depends on our ability to sell goods and services abroad.  Productivity means the effective use of innovation and resources to increase the value-added content of products and services.  It enables both domestically and internationally trading firms to sustain their competitiveness in a relatively high-cost environment by using inputs more efficiently and this in turn supports long-term economic growth and a higher standard of living for all.Realising that we cannot compete on the same basis as in the past and that we increasingly face competition from emerging economies for mobile foreign direct investment and for export markets, we need to protect our current strengths and develop new bases for competitive advantage.  Recognising this challenge, the Government has developed policies which are designed to help Ireland's competitiveness.  Important policy issues in the medium term include developing our innovation potential, improving the regulatory environment, enhancing the human capital of our country and developing our economic and technological infrastructure.  These should raise living standards, improve the quality of life and lay the foundations for future growth.In this context, it is expected that the next national development plan for the period 2007 to 2013, due to be launched next January, will further enhance our economic and social infrastructure, notably in the key areas of transport, environmental services, social and affordable housing, health, education, broadband and energy.  Investment in support of the strategy for science technology and innovation and in education at all levels, with a particular emphasis on the third and fourth — PhD — levels, in tandem with continued investment in labour force training and lifelong learning will ensure we are well prepared to face the challenges ahead.The Government is keen to enhance our competitiveness as a location for new, internationally mobile, research related investment.  Recognising that research and development is the key to a more knowledge intensive economy aimed at providing a sustainable long-term basis for growth in employment and incomes, the Government introduced a tax credit for research and development.  The aim of the tax credit scheme is to encourage existing overseas and indigenous firms to add research functions to their operations in Ireland or to increase their levels of research activity.  This, combined with our single 12.5% corporation tax rate on trading profits in all sectors, will continue to support the necessary stable enterprise environment which Ireland has so carefully nurtured through the years and help to underpin our economic and social development.From a public finances perspective two main challenges face us, an infrastructural deficit and an ageing population.  To close our infrastructural deficit we are investing approximately 5% of gross national product, GNP, per annum on improving the public capital stock, roughly twice the EU rate of investment.  The already mentioned national development plan, NDP, will go a long way to putting in place a first class infrastructure that will improve the quality of life of ordinary people and create the conditions for the economy to continue to grow.  On the ageing population, we are prudently planning for the future.  While Ireland enjoys a considerably longer lead-in time than the EU as a whole before shifting demographics begin to impact, we are using our demographic window of opportunity to prepare for this.  For example, we are maintaining budgetary discipline and investing 1% of gross national product, GNP, annually in the National Pensions Reserve Fund.These fiscal policies mean that Ireland remains an attractive place to do business.  Keeping taxes on work and business down has been a key factor in helping competitiveness and employment growth.  The income tax reductions which have been one of this Government's key policies since 1997 have helped to alleviate the pressures for wage increases.  In an international context, OECD data show that Ireland has the lowest tax wedge in the EU and one of the lowest in the OECD.  Our low rate of corporation tax has been a strong contributor towards our ongoing economic success.  This Government remains strongly committed to continuing this policy.I am grateful for this opportunity to outline how we are putting in place the framework conditions upon which we will consolidate the significant economic and social gains made since 1997 and upon which future gains can be made.  We believe the stable macroeconomic environment we have created through the pursuit of sound public finances and supporting the economy's competitiveness is the basis for achieving further economic and social policy objectives in the long term.On average we are growing at three times the rate of the eurozone but have more or less the same inflation rate.  That is not a bad inflation score for such a dynamic economy.  I therefore commend the counter motion to the House:That Seanad Éireann notes that Irish inflation in EU terms is now not far off 2% per annum and supports the Government's prudent approach to fiscal policy as the best guarantee of continuing to meet such low inflation targets.

#BrendanRyan	unknown-#BrendanRyan-party	unknown-#BrendanRyan-dob	unknown-#BrendanRyan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-11-22 00:00:00	Prelude	179	I apologise.  During Deputy Quinn's time as Minister for Finance inflation was lower and growth was higher than during the tenure of the former Deputy and Minister for Finance, Charlie McCreevy.  I am concerned about the wording of the motion.  While I do not dispute the importance of inflation, one of Ireland's problems is the tendency to confuse inflation with competitiveness.  The Minister of State attempted to address it in his speech but did not.  Inflation is not the only major concern in competitiveness.  The most recent report of the National Competitiveness Council reiterates the point that there is some price inflation.  I am not sure how it benefits the public for us to be involved in a confusion of three different definitions of inflation.  Every study done by every political party shows that ordinary citizens feel prices are rising unfairly and that they are being ripped off.For example, when the price of oil rose from $55 to almost $80 a barrel, the price of petrol shot up with it.  I would love to see the time lag between price increases on the global market and the increase in petrol prices here, and the time lag when the situation reversed and global oil prices fell.  That is not about somebody in the economy but about Government regulation and ensuring that genuine competition takes place.  The decreasing number of petrol stations throughout the country will mean that most small towns in rural Ireland will be wide open to local rip offs.  Before long many parts of Ireland will have only one petrol station and once people have to travel 15 or 20 miles to fill up the tanks of their cars, there will be an incentive for a small adjustment in the margins.  It will not be enormous; it could rise from €1 to €1.01 or from 99 cent to €1.01.  I am concerned about the impact of the divestment of investment by multinational oil companies which is resulting in large numbers of petrol stations closing.  The Government should be more vigilant on that.Three matters concern me about competitiveness, which is more important than inflation.  That is not to diminish inflation, which is a major concern.  I have read three reports recently.  One is the national report on competitiveness, showing that we are at the bottom of the heap on a range of indices, including e-Government.  In respect of the range of services the citizen can access electronically, Ireland is towards the bottom and is slipping further.We know the story in respect of broadband access.  In spite of much wind from the Government, we are in a poor position.  This is due to the inept, bungled transfer of a public monopoly to a private monopoly without proper regulation to ensure the latter was not abused.  It has been and continues to be abused.  It is not even accountable on the Stock Exchange and we know less about how it uses its resources.  That is the Government's fault, not for the principle of privatisation — a matter we can discuss another time — but because of the ineptitude of the regulatory regime.  On every major dispute, Eircom wins and the regulator loses.  That has made a mess of broadband.Let us consider transport.  The present parties in Government inherited a booming economy in 1997.

I have no problem with this but we are told that agriculture is in terminal decline.  Nevertheless, we are paying more for agricultural land to build roads than anywhere else in Europe.  I would love to know why.  No one will tell me why because it was a cosy deal between the Government and the IFA.  Everyone was bought off.

It states that many companies' US executives do not wish to hold meetings here because it is so difficult to travel around Ireland.  They prefer anywhere else in Europe.  A significant number of US companies in Ireland claim that Ireland will not be the location of the next phase of investment.

US investment is critical to this country.  It is an illusion that our rate of corporation tax, 12.5%, will keep companies in this country if people get stuck in traffic jams as soon as they leave the airports.  The Government's infrastructure plan does not include what the American Chamber of Commerce Ireland considers critical, namely, good roads between Waterford, Cork, Limerick, Galway and Sligo.  This is critical to balance investment and draw it from Dublin towards other provinces.  If the Senators will not listen to the American Chamber of Commerce in Ireland, they will not listen to me.
#MarcMacSharry	unknown-#MarcMacSharry-party	unknown-#MarcMacSharry-dob	unknown-#MarcMacSharry-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-11-22 00:00:00	Prelude	200	I thank Senator Quinn and the Independent Senators for raising this issue.  The amendment could have been penned in a slightly different way.  A figure of 2.2% is not far off2%.  No matter who wishes to kick the football around or claim credit for the goals, this Administration or the larger party in it has been in Government pretty much since 1987.  It took difficult decisions in 1987 when I recall effigies of certain individuals being burned.With the great success we have experienced over recent years comes new challenges.  These are different because we are victims of our success.  We see chronic carnage on the roads.  We no longer ask if we can get a telephone connection or pay the ESB bill but if we can get reception for Sky Digital for the Celtic and Manchester United game or if we can get a BMW.  Ireland is very different.Senator John Paul Phelan cautioned others that he was not born in a particular period.  Those who are young no longer wish to hear how bad things were in the dark days.  It is time to plan for the future and keep our competitive position under scrutiny.  Since Senator Quinn spoke I have not heard much debate on the motion.  It is a plea to the Government to keep the inflationary position under surveillance.  That has been done.Other issues, besides inflation, affect our competitiveness.  I was chief executive officer in Sligo Chamber of Commerce and learned much about competitiveness.  The decision-making process of those attracted to the country by Mr. Seán Dorgan includes matters of corporate governance, a favourable regulatory system and tolerance of ethnic mixes and sexual or religious persuasions.  Tolerance is a significant issue for multinationals or people looking to invest in other countries.  In many ways, Ireland is living up to the expectations of many.  Senator Mansergh mentioned Cisco Systems, which recently announced plans to create 200 jobs in Galway.Senator Ryan has great concerns about the American Chamber of Commerce in Ireland report on this country which pointed out something about which this Government is very aware in respect of its level of investment in infrastructure along the Atlantic corridor, which the Senator mentioned and which is prioritised in terms of Transport 21.  Much of the work is already completed, although work is continuing on certain parts along the route.There are two particularly significant developments in respect of the type of competition Ireland faces going forward.  One of these which we have not fully grasped and on which we possibly need to focus is the impact of China and India.  When China entered the World Trade Organisation, one quarter of the world's population entered the multilateral trading system.  This changes its entire structure dramatically, especially in the area of manufactured goods.  Inflation for goods has been quite low but we will see substantial competition in the area of services when the services directive comes into play.  When this happens, which might be in the not too distant future, it will, in many people's opinion, be as significant for competition in services as the lifting of tariffs.  We must be very conscious of this.A number of comments were made in respect of the report by the National Competitiveness Council.  I share the view of the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment on this report.  He recently said that in our broadest competitiveness position, he was confident it would remain robust, particularly in those sectors of the economy which drive economic growth and employment.  One of the areas where I would like to see us focus heavily is research and development and innovation.  Ultimately, the most valuable currency going forward is our intellectual property.  If we can breed and attract more intellectual property and plan our strategy for the future in an innovative way, we will have matched many of the challenges of competitiveness as we look to the future.Developing an innovation strategy is not an exact science but it helps companies to focus on the fundamentals of their business and where improvements can be made.  Having a strategy also reduces the haphazard nature of business development.  Businesses will have more hits than misses because they will be taking into consideration issues like return on investment and market potential.  If we can approach our competitive situation in this way on a cross-departmental level, we will have equipped ourselves well in meeting the challenges as they arise.Nobody could possibly have envisaged how well we have performed in the past 15 years and how ideally placed we are to take this a step further and push the boat out more.  While I obviously support the amendment, I commend Senator Quinn, who, in the context of his other career, is a great example to us in the matter of competitiveness through placing his business in a very competitive position in the marketplace.  I thank him and we are grateful to him for putting this issue on the agenda.  Much has been done but there is much more to do.  We must be vigilant and be prepared to be flexible in the context of our corporate governance and a favourable regulatory system as we plan and prepare for the future.
#PaulBradford	unknown-#PaulBradford-party	unknown-#PaulBradford-dob	unknown-#PaulBradford-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-11-22 00:00:00	Prelude	201	I support the motion moved by Senator Quinn and my political colleagues.  This discussion is very worthwhile and if we are all available, we should have a number of economic debates in advance of the budget where broad economic issues can be debated in detail.  I hope Ministers would listen and even be willing to learn.Inflation, which is the topic before us, is not simply some vague economic term.  We are all aware of the significant impact of inflation, from which this country has suffered down through the years.  We welcome the fact that inflation is at a relatively low level.  However, inflation, regardless of whether it is 3%, 4%, 5% or slightly more than 2%, still continues to be an attack on wages, living standards and economic progress.  Classical economists will say that some level of inflation is needed, possibly 1% or 1.5% in an economy performing properly.  However, once inflation goes beyond these levels, it is an economic problem with which we must deal.I read the speech of the Minister of State at the Department of Finance, Deputy Parlon, which I understand contains one or two references to 1997.  The term "since 1997" appears in almost every Government speech at the moment.  We have heard of George Orwell's novel 1984 but a new novel entitled 1997 could be written.  The successful attack on inflation did not begin in 1997 or even 1987.  Even Senator Mansergh, who was working with the Opposition Leader at the time, will concede that the major economic success story of the second coalition Government of Garret FitzGerald between 1982 and 1987 was dealing very successfully with the horrific inflation of the early 1980s, which was present for various reasons.  There was political acceptance that the inflation rates of 20% and 21% could not continue.  Notwithstanding the fact that the Minister of State, Deputy Treacy, is shaking his head, he knows that by 1987, there was success in dealing with inflation which laid the foundations that allowed the Government to be able at least to continue with this policy.We must ask how we ensure that inflation is kept under control and minimised to the highest degree.   If one looks at the issues from a layman's perspective, one can see that there are three or four areas where we must battle costs or inflation, whatever one wishes to call it.  From both cost and environmental perspectives, there is a serious energy crisis facing the country which needs urgent attention.  We had a very interesting discussion in the House with the European Union Ambassador to the United States, John Bruton, two or three weeks ago and this was one of the topics in which he majored.  We have frequently spoken about renewable energy and taking charge of our energy costs but have not truly acted upon them.  An energy crisis is certainly facing this country and is almost certainly facing the EU.  There is a considerable body of evidence to show that we can make significant progress on renewable energy.I hope the next Government, regardless of its political hue, will at least respond to the energy issue by having a dedicated Minister with responsibility for energy.  Notwithstanding the efforts of the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, his responsibilities go beyond energy and encompass other fields, including marine affairs and communications.  One of the major issues facing the next Government is the energy crisis.  I hope a renewable energy solution will be found but it will require a full-time Minister for energy.  If we examine and invest in renewable energy, we can at least ensure that energy costs into the future will be contained.  If we rely on oil and imported energy, we will be victims of the significant increases that lie ahead.  I recollect some of the issues we debated in the House two or three weeks ago.  The future energy demands of Asia, including those of China and India, mean that unless we have a European solution to European energy needs which is based on renewable energy, we will be in considerable trouble.Although I did not hear the entire debate, I am sure a number of speakers referred to insurance costs.  Progress has been made in this regard, mainly owing to the establishment of the personal accident insurance scheme by the Minister for Health and Children and former Tánaiste, Deputy Harney.  More progress is needed in that area because our insurance costs compared with other European countries are still relatively high.  We must not view the battle as being over but rather as having been well fought in recent years with more progress to be made.We need to examine the level of administration and form filling required because we are becoming something of a red tape republic.  A great deal of red tape and bureaucracy is involved in applying for the simplest grant, completing a tax form, submitting an application to a health board or processing a form at local government level.  Every form required to be completed involves a cost.  Such red tape not only slows down the process, it also creates a momentum for further pay for further waste, and not only in environmental terms.  It slows down the processing of every scheme.Those of us who were members of local authorities will recall assisting people to complete simple forms to apply for a disabled person's grant or a water scheme.  The grant awarded under such schemes is a percentage of the cost of the project.  By the time the forms under such schemes are processed, so much time has elapsed owing to the bureaucracy involved that costs have increased and additional grant aid must be paid.  The high level of administration in Departments and local authorities in particular must be tackled as it is excessive and is causing problems.From a business and household perspective, the level of telephone charges is far from satisfactory.  I welcome that there is competition in this market, notwithstanding the difficulties with the Smart Telecom debacle some weeks ago.  We have become too accepting of astronomical telephone charges, in particular mobile phone charges.  In comparison with our European neighbours, we are being ripped off.  These charges add to the cost of business, to the cost of living for the private householder and to the rate of inflation.  As a result of our economic success, people have more money in their pockets than five, ten, 15 or 20 years ago.  They pay these high telephone bills, not with great satisfaction but without the level of complaint that should exist.  The Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources and the regulator must examine the cost of telephone charges.  The cost of people talking to each other by telephone is much too high.We have welcomed the steady fall in mortgage interest rates in the past ten to 15 years.  While there has been a slight reversal in that trend, which is worrying to a degree but one hopes the rates will come under control again, we need to ensure there will be additional competition in the mortgage market.  Although competition in the telecoms sector has not worked as successfully as we would have wished, competition is still a good barrier against inflation.  Commissioner McCreevy has spoken about mortgage competition and opening up the mortgage market, an area on which we must reflect.  In the areas of energy, insurance, administration, telephone charges and mortgages there is room for major improvement which would be beneficial.I wish to make a comment that strays slightly from the motion.  When we discuss issues related to inflation, we speak of the economy, society and the progress we have made, which we welcome.  We examine economic figures, GDP, GNP and economic growth, which has been significant and marvellous for the country.  However, we may need to have a new debate on redefining what we mean by wealth and the wealth of society.  Major problems exist, whether they be in hospital wards or school yards.  We have failed to address major quality of life issues, to which we have shut our eyes.  While the economy may be booming, and we all welcome that, and while we may be a wealthy country in money terms, there are issues on which we need to reflect if we want to have a wealthy society as opposed to a well-off economy.  This may be a matter for another day but it is something we cannot ignore.I welcome the motion and the opportunity to speak on it.  We cannot ignore the inflation warnings and figures because inflation is an attack on our standard of living and economic progress.
#DavidNorris	unknown-#DavidNorris-party	unknown-#DavidNorris-dob	unknown-#DavidNorris-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-11-22 00:00:00	Prelude	202	I did not anticipate being called so soon.  I thought I would have another ten minutes.  I compliment my colleague, Senator Quinn, on tabling this important motion on inflation.  I am glad I have this time to speak on it because it would be a great pity if a subject as significant as this were not supported by the Members representing the University of Dublin and it was left to all our separated brethren from either the Labour Party or from the other great national institute of education.I notice an amendment was tabled to the motion.  I deplore the habit of tabling these rather flatulent amendments.  The motion is perfectly clear.  It does not seem to be critical of the Government in any significant way.  It simply states the fact that we know there is a difficulty in terms of inflation as it affects the competitiveness of the country and the fact, which is established, that we are running above the EU average and we ask the Minister to do something about it.  That seems a perfectly rational position to take and it is not one that could be construed as any kind of carping criticism of the Government.  Nonetheless, the Government considers it necessary, as usual, to delete all words in the motion after "Seanad Éireann" and replace the wording with words that simply note the situation with regard to inflation and support the Government's prudent approach.  I take exception to the word "prudent" in terms of the Government.Before I get into that and before my good friend and colleague, Senator Mansergh, leaves the House, I must take him up on one point.

I noted he took on a certain national newspaper, of which I must say I have rather mixed views, as I have of its proprietor, that well known rugby player, Tony O'Reilly, who now effects a title.When Senator Mansergh spoke about Senator Ross, I did not think that what he said was quite the highest standards of the public school.  I thought rather than being the hero of the fifth, the Senator was in danger of turning into the rotter of the remove because poor Senator Ross was not here to defend himself.

I must agree with great reluctance that nothing which happens here at this hour will be reflected and this debate should be taken seriously and reflected in the media.I support the motion.  However, I have concerns about the term "prudent" when used in terms of the stewardship of the Government.  I pay tribute to the Taoiseach, Deputy Bertie Ahern, who is a good negotiator.  He is able to persuade two apparently irreconcilable sides to find a common meeting ground, not to pursue their aims entirely selfishly and to put a degree of national interest into the equation.  However, that prudence is very limited.  A series of disastrous situations were entered into by the Government which can only contribute in various ways to the inflationary process.I will give one example which is close to my heart at present, namely, the situation regarding the Corrib gas field.  Our natural resources were handed away by the Government.  The Minister of State can shake his head all he likes but they were given away for nothing.  We do not even receive a tax yield on it.

It sold out and let property builders and speculators weasel their way around it.  It contributes to house inflation which is significant.  It is a terrible situation that so few young people are able to buy a house.  The Minister of State knows this is true because we know the Government has not lived up to its affordable housing commitments.Regarding wastage in road contracts, one contractor expended €50,000 on machinery and manpower during the construction of a small section of a road but charged the Government €3 million for it. It had to do with a steamroller.  I put it on the record of the House some time ago.  Where was the prudent stewardship there?  Where do they look after and guard the interest of the taxpayer?A number of years ago, I raised the issue of the confusion and mess at the West Link toll bridge on the M50.  Everybody, even the Minister of State must agree that was a lousy contract.

Senator Quinn, as a businessman, isolated an important matter in terms of competitiveness.  The strength of our economy depends on maintaining competitive status in the world.  We have the advantage of a low corporation tax regime for US companies.  I hope we manage to retain that in the face of potential European opposition.  Whatever our criticisms of aspects of Government policy, all sides unite in defending this regime because it attracts people, as does the literacy and intellectual skills of our educated workforce.

The House is in debt to Senator Quinn for having raised it because he signals a warning that our present remarkable position may not last if we are not prudent and do not ensure we do not price ourselves out of the market.  It is a competitive world.  Competition comes not from the United States and Europe but from developing areas such as China and other places where wage levels are tiny compared with what we have here.  I thank the Leas-Chathaoirleach for his indulgence and I compliment Senator Quinn on his important motion.

I commend the Minister for State on his excellent work on Europe.  He has worked hard on behalf of the State and covered a large number of meetings.Regarding the point made by Senator Norris about my colleague, Senator Mansergh, who was reluctant to defend himself——

#TerryLeyden	unknown-#TerryLeyden-party	unknown-#TerryLeyden-dob	unknown-#TerryLeyden-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-11-22 00:00:00	Prelude	227	Even Senator Leyden.  I was never a nurse.  In the words of Senator Norris's friend, Oscar Wilde, what is worse than being talked about is not being talked about.  Senator Mansergh carved an important monument to himself.  He was evenhanded in his approach to Unionists, Nationalists and republicans.  Everyone would commend him on his work on the Good Friday Agreement and the peace initiative.  Senator Norris's comments were taken lightheartedly.  Senator Mansergh would not rise to it.When we came to power in 1982 after the disastrous short-term Government under Garret FitzGerald, I was Minister of State at the Department of Posts and Telegraphs and Transport.  I represented the Government in negotiations with the Heineken organisation in the Netherlands for the sale of Murphy's Brewery in Cork.  Inflation ran at more than 18% and it was very difficult to persuade the Heineken corporation to buy Murphy's.  The IDA sold the package and it worked out well.  Inflation was the major item on the agenda.  We decreased inflation to the 2% or so it is at present and the Government can be very proud of that.This motion associates the Independent Senators with other parties.  The motion would have more sincerity if the Senators were on their own.  It does not have much credibility being linked with Fine Gael.  As far as I can see, it is not linked with the Labour Party.  Senator Quinn and his colleagues would have more credibility in their own right rather than being linked to a party which was responsible for the highest inflation ever in this country.  Fine Gael cannot deny that.  We had to pick up the pieces in 1982, 1987 and 1997.
#DavidNorris	unknown-#DavidNorris-party	unknown-#DavidNorris-dob	unknown-#DavidNorris-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-11-22 00:00:00	Prelude	228	Senator Leyden's party picked up a lot more than the pieces along the way.
#TerryLeyden	unknown-#TerryLeyden-party	unknown-#TerryLeyden-dob	unknown-#TerryLeyden-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-11-22 00:00:00	Prelude	229	We also had to ensure a steady line was followed.  We decreased inflation.  A major priority for the Minister for Finance, Deputy Cowen, is to ensure inflation does not rise.  Certain factors add to inflation, such as the cost of drink and tobacco.  Sales of those items are very difficult.  Speaking in the Dáil in October, the Minister welcomed a reduction in inflation and undertook to retain his commitment to restraining it further.  Undoubtedly, the promise will be reflected in next month's budget.Many causes of inflation are outside the remit of Government control, such as high oil prices and the European Central Bank increasing rates.  The Commission for Energy Regulation will review the proposed increase of 19% in electricity prices from next January because the cost of oil has dropped dramatically.  The 19% increase would greatly add to inflation and a review should be done now.I agree with the Minister for Finance, Deputy Cowen, that tackling the problem of inflation requires a response from all sectors of society, not only the Government, as many of the domestic driving forces of inflation are outside the direct control of the Government.  The Government has responsibility for many actions to contain inflation.  For example, excise duties have not been increased in the past two years and, as the Minister for Finance pointed out, the groceries order was removed.  I debated that particular issue, as did Senator Quinn.  It is alleged that it will lead to greater price competition, but that has not yet been proven.  In addition, the major players have not responded to the situation.  In responding to the debate, Senator Quinn may indicate, given his experience in that field, what has happened since the groceries order was lifted.  Members of the Joint Committee on Enterprise and Small Business argued against that decision.  In fairness to the Government, however, it made a decision which it felt was in the best interests of consumers.The Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government specifically requested that to support competitiveness in the economy and protect the interests of communities, local authorities should exercise restraint in setting any increase in commercial rates and local charges for the following years.  There is a certain lack of restraint as regards the increase in rates and the Minister knows the large burden that is placing on small businesses.  Councils must raise money but they are now raising planning charges and increasing rates.  Individual commercial rate payers not only have to pay rates but must also pay water rates on top of other service charges, which places a major cost burden upon them.  The big supermarket chains have enormous rates and service charges, which constitute a burden.  They must recoup such costs, so eventually the consumer pays all.  That is the reality.The Government has continually invested in public infrastructure, which will enhance our ability to produce more goods and services more effectively and, therefore, help keep down inflation.  The eurozone's annual inflation was 1.6% in October 2006, down from 1.7% in September.  A year earlier, the rate was 2.5%.  It is noteworthy that alcohol and tobacco were among the items with the highest rates of inflation.  Coming up to Christmas, there probably will not be much restraint in that regard.I welcome the motion but we have had to table an amendment.  Senator Norris would like everyone to love each other so that no amendment would be tabled.  If the Independents had tabled this motion, we may have been agreeable to some sort of compromise.  However, when the motion is linked to a party that has been responsible for more inflation in this country than any other party, we certainly could not be associated with the motion.

The reason for tabling the motion was to make inflation a top priority for the Government in the forthcoming budget.  I thank Senator Leyden for his kind words, apart from when he referred to inflation as the Government's major priority.  If the amendment had said "major priority", rather than "top priority" there would have been no need for it.Some speakers on the Government side seemed to give the impression that there was a criticism of our economic success, but there is no such criticism.

Recently, I was fortunate to be involved in a number of international meetings.  People from around the world collared me and asked how we did it, how we succeeded, what caused the success and if there were any threats to it.  I was happy to talk about that success but I was also willing to say that there was a threat.  There is, as I call it, an elephant in the room which we are not discussing in this country.  I have a problem when we change figures to suit ourselves.  I recently suggested removing tobacco from the consumer price index because it discourages the Government from putting more tax on tobacco.  I was, therefore, willing to fiddle with the figures but that is exactly what has happened.In his speech, the Minister of State, Deputy Parlon, said "The annual rate of consumer price index, CPI, inflation was 3.9% in October".  Where did we get the lower figure?  It comes from the HICP.

#FergalQuinn	unknown-#FergalQuinn-party	unknown-#FergalQuinn-dob	unknown-#FergalQuinn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-11-22 00:00:00	Prelude	240	I am concerned about the 3.9% figure because it is what concerns the citizens of this country.  It also concerns those who set up businesses here and hope to expand.  Earlier, I expressed my concern about complacency.  I have heard sounds of complacency coming from the Government side, with Senators saying not to worry because everything was all right.  The Government amendment is the funniest one I have seen.  It "notes that Irish inflation in EU terms is now not far off 2% per annum".  It is comical to hear something being referred to in such terms.The debate has been interesting and contained much good information.  Senator Mansergh referred to a report by the National Competitiveness Council which provided a list of "key business input costs that weaken Ireland's overall cost competitiveness".  Later on, the council stated that inflation creates uncertainty for businesses in their investment and operational decisions, thus diminishing prospects for growth in the future.  We really must do something about concerns such as those expressed by the National Competitiveness Council.We cannot control certain factors that influence our inflation, including interest rates and fuel costs.  However, we can control the influence we have on people such as the energy regulator, the taxi regulator and others.  We allowed the energy regulator to put price increases on gas and electricity but we did not put any limit on that.  What will we do when the price of fuel comes down?  Will we struggle to get it changed again?The other issue concerns the taxi regulator.  I was stunned by the fact that the Competition Authority is taking action because taxi prices are too low.  It is insisting that those people who are competing by lowering prices are breaking the regulations.  That seems outrageous and I cannot understand why it has happened.If we are above the EU's HICP inflation rate every year——

#FergalQuinn	unknown-#FergalQuinn-party	unknown-#FergalQuinn-dob	unknown-#FergalQuinn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-11-22 00:00:00	Prelude	246	The cumulative effect of that is that we will make ourselves uncompetitive if we are not careful.  The purpose of this motion is to ensure that we are careful.  It reminds us that there is an elephant in the room and, although we may not wish to acknowledge it, this debate may enable us to acknowledge the challenge to some degree.  I hope that will be taken into account.One or two younger Senators said they did not want to be reminded what it was like back in 1987, that they wanted to consider the future.  I want to remind them of what it was like in 1987, however, because it was not good.  I was around in the 1950s when it certainly was not good either.  Things were not good in the 1980s and I congratulate those who got together in social partnership, which was one of the prime factors in solving this problem.  Those who do not remember what it was like and do not give credit for what has happened in the past 20 years, run the risk of becoming not only complacent but also cocky. There is a danger that might happen tous.The purpose of this debate was to state that we have an inflation problem which we have allowed year after year to be above the European level.  It allows our consumer price index to be up at 3.9%, which is way beyond that obtaining elsewhere.  Let us ensure we do not allow that to fall from our gaze.  It should be a top priority for the Government and I believe this debate will enable Ministers to rate inflation as a higher priority than they might otherwise have done.  I have confidence that the Minister for Finance will take that into account and, in that respect, I hope this debate will help in some small way.
#TimDooley	unknown-#TimDooley-party	unknown-#TimDooley-dob	unknown-#TimDooley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-11-22 00:00:00	Prelude	247	I thank the Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Batt O'Keeffe, for coming to the House to respond to the issue I raise.  As he is aware, a river crossing in a well-known scenic area of County Clare, Killaloe, connects the county with County Tipperary.  We, in County Clare, try to avoid connecting with County Tipperary around Munster final time.  The crossing is also one of the major gateways to east Clare from the east coast.  The greater east Clare area is one of the most beautiful areas in the county and is popular with tourists.  The outdated bridge at the crossing effectively causes a blockade.  As the bridge has certain characteristics which prevent it from being widened, it is necessary to construct a new river crossing at Killaloe.I am aware the Department and Clare and Tipperary county councils have engaged in discussions to find an optimum route for a new river crossing.  I understand agreement has been reached and a route identified as a result of this consultation process.  I ask the Department to expedite approval for the river crossing project to allow it to go to tender.I understand Clare County Council, Tipperary North County Council and the Department have been involved in discussions to ensure the river crossing links into the new bypass which will connect Limerick to Nenagh and that a bypass will be provided for Killaloe.  As it is set on the river bank, the streets of the town are narrow, giving rise to traffic congestion.  It is important the construction of a new river crossing will include provision for a bypass to ensure the bottleneck is not moved from one point to another.  I hope the Minister of State will seriously consider expediting the process.I compliment the engineers in Clare County Council and Tipperary North County Council on the work they have done to get the project to its current stage.  I impress on the Minister of State the great necessity to have this project delivered without delay.  The current river crossing creates an encumbrance on the economic life of east Clare.  Killaloe has been connected by road with Ennis due to improvements in the road network from Ogonelloe through to Scarriff.  The upgrade of this road has resulted in a greater volume of traffic avoiding Limerick city.  While it may not have created a rat run, it has opened up a new corridor for drivers seeking to avoid Limerick as they travel to other parts of County Clare.  I cannot over-emphasise the importance of delivering this project without delay.
#BattOKeeffe	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-party	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-11-22 00:00:00	Prelude	248	I thank the Senator for raising this important issue in the Clare area.  It is also a matter of concern within the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government.  I also welcome the opportunity to outline the progress being made in the significant resourcing of non-national roads in general and to outline the position on these schemes.In January this year the Minister announced a record allocation of almost €558 million for non-national roads in 2006.  This is more than double the 1997 allocation and well over four times the 1994 allocation.  The 2006 allocation for regional and local roads is the highest ever State grant provision for such roads and represents a 13% increase over the record 2005 level.  In making this provision, the Government was again delivering, as it had in previous years, on its commitment to ensure an adequate financial base for the non-national roads programme.In accordance with Section 13 of the Roads Act 1993, the construction of non-national roads, including bridges, in its area is a function of the relevant road authority.  Work on developing a proposal for a new Shannon crossing has been undertaken by Clare, Limerick and North Tipperary County Councils.  From 2004 to the end of 2005, grants totalling approximately €282,000 have been provided to these authorities to develop proposals for the provision of a Shannon crossing.Clare County Council is the lead local authority for the Shannon crossing and in 2006, a grant allocation of €50,000 was provided to the council for the project under the new strategic non-national roads grant category, which was introduced this year.  Under this scheme, grants are provided for schemes which make a significant contribution to the implementation of the national spatial strategy.To date, a constraints study and route selection study on a Shannon bridge crossing and associated roads have been completed.  I understand from inquiries made of Clare County Council that the preliminary design of the preferred option for the Shannon crossing has been also recently completed.  Both Clare and North Tipperary County Councils are currently preparing a brief for the appointment of consulting engineers to undertake a constraints study, a route selection study and preliminary design for a bypass of Killaloe and for an upgrade of the R494 regional road between Birdhill and Ballina.  The councils are also proposing that the consultants will prepare an environmental impact statement and compulsory purchase order for all three schemes, the Killaloe bypass, the R494 upgrade and the Shannon bridge crossing.Further progression of these schemes is a matter for the relevant local authorities and further details of the proposals are awaited in the Department.  Given the Senator's interest in the matter and its urgency, I will make inquiries of Clare County Council to ascertain the exact position.  The question of further grant aid to facilitate the development of the proposals will be considered early in the new year in the context of the 2007 non-national road grant allocations.
#TimDooley	unknown-#TimDooley-party	unknown-#TimDooley-dob	unknown-#TimDooley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-11-22 00:00:00	Prelude	249	I thank the Minister of State for that detailed response to this straightforward question and for the efforts he is making in co-operation with the council.  We have been critical in the past that the Department and the council have not worked closely together but it is clear they have a clear focus on what is needed in this instance.
#FeargalBrowne	unknown-#FeargalBrowne-party	unknown-#FeargalBrowne-dob	unknown-#FeargalBrowne-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-11-22 00:00:00	Prelude	250	I welcome the Minister of State to the House.  Perhaps he has not been to the promised land of Carlow as often as he should but if he goes to Old Leighlin, he will see a fantastic community hall based in a magnificent old cathedral in the middle of a small, rural parish.  It is one of the best examples of a community hall in the entire country and it was built by local people.  It has excellent basketball courts and other facilities and demonstrates the positive outlook of the local community.Old Leighlin national school has submitted applications to the Department of Education and Science under the permanent accommodation scheme 2007 and for grant aid for major works.  In 2002 the school was granted funding for a new classroom under the devolved scheme the Department was piloting at the time.  Thankfully the school now needs another teacher and will require accommodation for the new class in September 2007, hence the application under the permanent accommodation scheme.The second application is the most pressing in terms of addressing the current needs of the school.  It has grown from an enrolment of 73 pupils in 2001 to 116 this year and current projections suggest this figure will increase.  The school is situated a mile from the village of Old Leighlin on an isolated site and it is vital it be given accommodation to implement the physical education curriculum and to organise whole school activities.  Staff and students are at a disadvantage when implementing the music, drama and PE curricula.I referred to the spectacular community hall but it is too far away to take the children on a regular basis.  The school community is supportive and progressive and I hope the Minister of State can give me some good news tonight about this application.
#BattOKeeffe	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-party	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-11-22 00:00:00	Prelude	251	I thank the Senator for raising this matter as it provides me with the opportunity to outline to the Seanad the progress being made by the Department of Education and Science under the school building and modernisation programme and to outline the position on capital funding applications from scoil náisiúnta Molaise, Old Leighlin, County Carlow.Modernising facilities in our 3,200 primary and 750 post primary schools is not an easy task given the legacy of decades of under-investment in this area and the need to respond to emerging needs in areas of rapid population growth.  Nonetheless, since taking office, this Government has shown a sincere determination to improve the condition of our school buildings and to ensure the appropriate facilities are in place to enable the implementation of a broad and balanced curriculum.This Government has invested in the largest school building programme in the history of the State.  Between 1998 and the end of 2004, almost €2 billion was invested in school buildings, which represents a fivefold increase in capital allocations.  In the region of 7,500 large and small projects were completed in schools in this period, including 130 brand new schools and 510 large scale refurbishments and extensions.  To build on this extensive progress, in 2006 more than €491 million will be spent on school building projects, compared to just €92 million in 1997.  The 2006 allocation in its own right is an increase of more than 9% in real terms on the 2005 allocation.At the end of last year, the Department outlined its spending plans for primary and post-primary schools for 2006.  With €491 million to be spent on school buildings, more than 1,300 projects are active in schools all over the country.  This significant investment will allow the Department to continue to progress its major programme of school building and modernisation which includes improving equipment needed for new technologies and ICT.With regard to scoil náisiúnta Molaise, Old Leighlin, the Department is in receipt of two applications for capital funding, one under the permanent accommodation scheme for 2007 and one under the small schools scheme for 2007.  The closing date for receipt of applications for both of these devolved funding schemes was 27 October 2006.  The Department is now in the process of assessing the applications of all schools that applied under these schemes according to the published prioritisation criteria.  A list of successful schools will be published when the assessment process has been completed.I thank the Senator once again for raising this issue and affording me the opportunity to outline to the Seanad the position for the school's applications to the Department of Education and Science for capital funding and where all applications under the schemes concerned stand.
#MichaelKitt	unknown-#MichaelKitt-party	unknown-#MichaelKitt-dob	unknown-#MichaelKitt-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-11-22 00:00:00	Prelude	252	I thank the Cathaoirleach for allowing me to raise this matter and the Minister of State, Deputy Batt O'Keeffe, for coming before the House.  I wish to raise the issue of better awareness, use and sale of generic drugs, as it is a particular cause of frustration among many people, including many of my constituents.The Minister of State would agree it is ludicrous that drugs on sale in the North or mainland Europe can be much cheaper than the equivalent on sale here.  Many people, including many of my constituents, rely on such drugs but they are paying more than their counterparts in other European countries.  That can be very frustrating.  For example, medication for treatment of cholesterol and blood pressure conditions can be 50% more expensive in Ireland than other countries.  The most expensive drug of all seems to be that which treats prostate cancer, which can be up to 100% more expensive here.The issue was very much in the media during the summer, particularly on "Liveline", where people spoke of going on holidays to places such as France, Spain and Italy and telling stories on their return of how they could get such drugs much cheaper abroad.  Many brought home medication as well as cigarettes and duty free.Both patients and the Government would benefit if there was a reduction in the price of these drugs.  The patient would have a smaller health-care bill, and the Government would have to pay less in the drugs repayment scheme.  I hope the Minister will consider the issue, which does not concern substitute or inferior drugs.  There is room to campaign for generic and less expensive medication in this country.
#BattOKeeffe	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-party	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-11-22 00:00:00	Prelude	253	I am pleased to have the opportunity to answer this question on behalf of my colleague, Deputy Harney, the Minister for Health and Children.  I welcome the opportunity to set out the Government's position and thank Senator Kitt for raising the matter.In 2005, the Cabinet committee on health agreed a range of options for containing growth in the State drugs bill.  These options were based on proposals jointly made by the Department of Health and Children and the Department of Finance.  The first issue addressed was the renegotiation of the agreements with IPHA, representing the research-based industry, and the Association of Pharmaceutical Manufacturers of Ireland, representing the generics manufacturers.  These two agreements set out State pricing and supply arrangements for branded and generic drugs.  Other issues to be addressed separately include drug schemes reform and the renegotiation of the pharmacy contract.The new IPHA agreement means the prices of new off-patent proprietary and generic drugs will be much more closely aligned with other EU member states.  That will be welcomed by the Senator.  The APMI agreement will align generic prices accordingly.The new 2006 agreements came into force in September and their main points include the following.  The agreements are between the HSE as the purchasing and reimbursement authority and IPHA and APMI.  The agreements are for four years and the pricing basket for new medicines is extended from five to nine member states, including lower-priced states such as Spain and Austria.There is a price cut of 35% for substitutable off-patent medicines, including hospital buying, in two steps.  For existing off-patent items, this will be 20% in March 2007 and 15% in January 2009.  As products come off patent, they will be reduced accordingly, on introduction of a generic equivalent.  There will be two price reviews for new medicines, at two and four years.  The first will allow a price review against a full price basket, as not all prices may be available at introduction of a new medicine, and the second will capture other member states' price reviews.The State may use pharmacoeconomic assessment in deciding on reimbursement of drugs and medicines under the State drugs schemes.  Assessments include value for money and analyses of the benefits for patients.  Reimbursement can be approved, refused or conditions applied, based on the analyses.There will be innovative pricing structures, such as flat pricing across a dosage range.  This may be used to keep older or commercially unviable products on the market where there is no alternative therapy.  Generic manufacturers will have to compete with the lower off-patent prices.  Generic prices will be reduced at the same time as off-patent products, through notification by the company or, failing notification, by the HSE.Generic drugs are already widely available in the Irish market.  Use of a proprietary or a generic equivalent is a matter for the prescriber, in consultation with the patient.  The Department of Health and Children and the HSE have addressed the issue of generic supply in the State drug schemes through the IPHA and APMI agreements.We have a 35% price cut for substitutable patent-expired drugs, with a similar reduction for generics.  The reduction in the rate of increase in the State drugs bill will be approximately €320 million over the next four years.  This will release significant resources for new and innovative therapies.  This return is much greater than potential savings from formal structures, such as patient or pharmacist-led generic substitution or reference pricing.  Therefore, neither the Department nor the HSE intends to pursue these formal generic options for the foreseeable future.The Government is confident it can influence generic use through ongoing education of patients and prescribers.  Of course, private patients will also benefit from the proposed price cuts under the new agreements, and they will be able to discuss, with their prescriber, the most appropriate cost-effective drug therapy for their needs.
