I express the hope that you will find your visit enjoyable, successful and to our mutual benefit. I understand that the President intends stepping down at the next election, due in October of this year, after two terms in office. I wish you many years of happiness in your retirement and also many years of good health. You are very welcome.
#SeanFleming	unknown-#SeanFleming-party	unknown-#SeanFleming-dob	unknown-#SeanFleming-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-04 00:00:00	Visit of Mozambiquan Delegation	1	Arising from the recent revelation, which made clear that while the Oireachtas had passed legislation, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform had failed to bring it into operation, as a result of which the former Minister for Justice, Equality and Defence, Deputy Shatter, was able to claim his severance payment when he stood down, will the Minister tell me what other legislative provisions in respect of his Department have been passed by the Oireachtas but have not yet come into effect?
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-04 00:00:00	Visit of Mozambiquan Delegation	2	The following are the legislative provisions under my remit that have been passed by the Oireachtas and have yet to come into effect. The first is the Construction Contracts Act 2013, the aim of which is to have a new system which will both reduce the non-payment exposure of subcontractors and provide an effective remedy for them should non-payment occur. The Bill passed all Stages in the Houses of the Oireachtas in July 2013 and was signed into law on 29 July 2013.  Two further steps are necessary for the operation of the legislation prior to its commencement. The first, a comprehensive code of practice for the conduct of adjudication, has been the subject of consultation with the key stakeholders. The final draft of the code of practice was circulated to stakeholders in March. The second element requires the establishment of a panel of adjudicators and that will be done as soon as the discussions are concluded with key stakeholders. The other legislative measure is the Oireachtas (Ministerial and Parliamentary Offices) (Amendment) Act 2014, the main purpose of which, as the Deputy knows because we went through it in some detail here, is to make certain changes to what had become known as the party leader's allowance.  The allowance has been payable to leaders of qualifying parties since 1938, to Independent Deputies since 1996, and to Independent Senators since 2001. Sections 1 and 5 of the Act have come into effect. The remaining sections come into effect on 1 July next, as per the Oireachtas (Ministerial and Parliamentary Offices) (Amendment) Act 2014 (Commencement) Order 2014, SI 210 of 2014, and the Ministerial and Parliamentary Offices Act 1938 (Sections 10A, 10B, 10C and 10D) (Fixed Day) Order 2014, SI 211 of 2014. Section 6 provides that commencement of the Act would be subject to a ministerial order, or orders, as necessary. As the Act, for the first time, imposes a significant obligation on Independent Members of the Oireachtas to provide substantial information to the Standards in Public Office Commission, I decided to afford the appropriate lead-in time to 1 July for that to happen, and that is why the commencement date for that provision is 1 July.
#SeanFleming	unknown-#SeanFleming-party	unknown-#SeanFleming-dob	unknown-#SeanFleming-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-04 00:00:00	Visit of Mozambiquan Delegation	3	I know the Minister was very keen to pass the Oireachtas (Ministerial and Parliamentary Offices) (Amendment) Act 2014. He might explain why he chose not to commence it until such time as he was embarrassed publicly to so do when the Minister, Deputy Shatter, announced his resignation and why he has now chosen to bring the remainder of it into operation in a month's time or so and not on the same date as applied to the ministerial severance payments. The Construction Contracts Act 2013 has been around for years on end. Senator Feargal Quinn laboured extensively to get it through the Houses of the Oireachtas and many people have been in touch with me in recent times complaining that it has not yet taken effect. As the Minister knows, this is having a detrimental impact on the construction industry because it affects the rules in regard to how contractors and subcontractors will be paid for work. As long as the Minister keeps that legislation in suspension, uncertainty prevails in the industry.
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-04 00:00:00	Visit of Mozambiquan Delegation	4	The Deputy asked me two questions. Regarding his first one as to why I did not commence the Oireachtas (Ministerial and Parliamentary Offices) (Amendment) Act immediately, I engaged in consultation with the affected people. Deputy Catherine Murphy, who is present in the Chamber, will confirm that there is a requirement to have a lead-in time for people to make necessary arrangements. I notified everybody in writing of that fact on 17 April, five days after the President signed the Bill. I wrote to the Deputy's leader on 17 April confirming that legislation would come into effect on 1 July and I never heard a word about it objecting to, or demurring, that. In regard to the Construction Contracts Act, which is important legislation, credit is due, as the Deputy rightly said, to Senator Feargal Quinn for the Trojan work he did. I decided to take that work on. It required very substantial amendment and Senator Quinn worked with us in doing that. We have enacted it but there are real issues to be agreed by all the stakeholders and it is the stakeholders who have been engaged in that process. I want to commence this Act as soon as is practicable.
#SeanFleming	unknown-#SeanFleming-party	unknown-#SeanFleming-dob	unknown-#SeanFleming-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-04 00:00:00	Visit of Mozambiquan Delegation	5	I had a quick look through the various items of legislation that have been passed by the Minister's Department since he came into office. He might tell us - if he does not have the answer to hand today, he might send it on to me - when he commenced the operation of the legislation providing for a national lottery regulator. If he does not have the answer to that on file with him he might forward it to me. The lottery has now been privatised and the legislation in that respect provides for the regulator. The Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest Act 2013 was to threaten public servants to pass the Haddington Road agreement.Now that the agreement is in place, has the Minister implemented all the measures within that Act, or are they in abeyance, ready to be implemented at a later date if, as the Minister or perhaps some of his colleagues might predict, public servants do not adhere to the agreement? Will the Minister comment on the status of the Houses of the Oireachtas (Inquiries, Privileges and Procedures) Act 2013 in the context of the failure thus far to initiate a banking inquiry?
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-04 00:00:00	Visit of Mozambiquan Delegation	6	I have indicated the two Acts that have not commenced and the reasons for that delay. In regard to the National Lottery Act 2013, my recollection is that it was brought fully into effect on the day the national lottery contract was signed. The establishment of a banking inquiry is nothing to do with me. Under the terms of the relevant Act, it is a matter solely for the Houses of the Oireachtas, and it would be quite improper of me to impose my view on the Oireachtas in this matter.
#MaryLouMcDonald	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-party	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-dob	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-04 00:00:00	Visit of Mozambiquan Delegation	7	My question has two parts. The first refers to the financing arrangements for the phase 4 infrastructure stimulus projects the Minister announced on 13 May. The second part relates to public private partnership, PPP, contracts and the use or otherwise of value for money auditing in making decisions to go that route as against the traditional route.
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-04 00:00:00	Visit of Mozambiquan Delegation	8	On Tuesday, 13 May, I announced phase 4 of the infrastructure stimulus projects. This phase involves €200 million of Exchequer investment to fund projects in a range of sectors, including road schemes, social housing to meet acute needs arising in that area, and a range of tourism-related works that will help to support long-term jobs in that sector.  This investment will also help to fund a range of projects commemorating the foundation of our State.  As with previous investment packages, the projects are spread around the country and will create economic activity and employment on a regional basis. The investment will be funded through the Exchequer from the proceeds of the sale of State assets. The phase 4 stimulus announcement does not involve any PPP projects. The initial stimulus announcement I made in July 2012 included €1.5  billion of PPP investment, and work on the delivery of those projects is under way by the relevant Departments and agencies. Value for money testing is part of the standard project appraisal process for PPPs that is carried out by the National Development Finance Agency, NDFA, and the relevant sanctioning authority in each case.
#MaryLouMcDonald	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-party	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-dob	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-04 00:00:00	Visit of Mozambiquan Delegation	9	Of the €200 million investment to which the Minister referred, all of which will be directly funded by the Exchequer, how much will come from the sale of State assets? The Minister indicated that the value for money audit is a standard part of the project appraisal process. According to the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government, €6.2 billion was invested in the water services sector between 2000 and 2010. This involved 66 very large projects, many of them in the wastewater sector. The astonishing thing is that when one questions that Department about value for money auditing of these projects, it claims to have no role in the matter and bounces the ball back to the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform. However, a parliamentary question I put to the Minister, Deputy Howlin, for answer today in respect of the wastewater sector and the value for money auditing which apparently has not been carried out in respect of these projects, my question was disallowed. I am asking why, where the PPP route was chosen for wastewater projects that formed part of that investment €6.2 billion, value for money audits either have not been carried out, or if they have, it is almost impossible to obtain the detail from the system as to what those audits reflected?
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-04 00:00:00	Visit of Mozambiquan Delegation	10	All of the €200 million stimulus I recently announced is coming from the dividend paid to the State by ESB and Bord Gáis Éireann from the sale of assets. On the Deputy's second question, I have no notice in regard to water investment. I would have sought a briefing on the issue if I had known the Deputy was going to inquire about it.However, what I will say, in general terms, is that a PPP project is automatically evaluated by law by the National Development Finance Agency which independently certifies whether it is value for money.
#MaryLouMcDonald	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-party	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-dob	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-04 00:00:00	Visit of Mozambiquan Delegation	11	I thank the Minister for his answer. It seems almost impossible to get at the information required. I think the Minister will agree that €6.2 billion of investment in the wastewater sector is very significant. I think he will also agree that given the fact the public is now bracing itself for the imposition of water charges, concerns are now heightened as to that scale of investment, where that liability will lie and, most crucially, an assurance that the choice of public private partnership for investment of that scale was the correct choice. A number of years ago a committee of this House recommended that the Comptroller and Auditor General should be able to report on these schemes in the wastewater treatment facilities but, unfortunately, the Comptroller and Auditor General is precluded from carrying out that investigation by law. We then had a situation where the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government and the Minister's Department were before the Committee of Public Accounts some months ago and, when questioned about value for money audits on this issue, they could not answer the questions and they passed the ball from one Department to the other. While the Minister might not have the specifics on the wastewater treatment facilities with him today, I would like him to respond to me, perhaps in writing, on that issue. More specifically, will the Minister tell me with whom the buck stops in terms of carrying out these value for money audits? In which Department is it vested?
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-04 00:00:00	Visit of Mozambiquan Delegation	12	I have already answered that question inasmuch as it is each line Department which is responsible for the oversight and maintenance of projects within its own area. The Deputy told us her question was out of order but then asked a series of supplementary questions on the question on which I am not briefed, so it is not reasonable that I would be asked to answer them. However, in general terms, the questions the Deputy asked would be appropriate for the Joint Committee on the Environment, Community and Local Government to get detailed information from the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government and Irish Water and, if they are projects which have been processed through the NDFA, from the NDFA directly.
#RichardBoydBarrett	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-party	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-dob	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-04 00:00:00	Visit of Mozambiquan Delegation	13	The public sector recruitment embargo started by the last Government and continued by the Minister's has led to an enormous reduction in staff numbers in key areas of public service, in particular in the health service and in local authorities. The Minister's slogan originally was, "We'll get more for less". I put it to him that when one looks at the chronic staff shortages in the health service, leading to serious risks to patient safety in our hospitals and to tens of thousands of children on waiting lists for speech and language assessments, and when one looks at the disastrous housing crisis with which local authorities are unable to deal, we have to now consider lifting the public sector recruitment embargo and getting staff into key areas like housing departments, housing maintenance sections and hospitals.
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-04 00:00:00	Visit of Mozambiquan Delegation	14	As I have previously stated, there is no embargo on recruitment to the public service.  To safeguard front line and priority services, the Government has allowed for critical posts to be filled throughout the period of consolidation of our public finances, as the Deputy well knows. In addition to this ongoing recruitment, special provision was made in last October's budget for the recruitment of, for example, more than 900 extra resource teachers for the school system and 150 new social care workers for Tusla, the new Child and Family Agency.  The Government recognises areas of most need and it is responding to them where it can.      There are restrictions and limits on recruitment and promotion in the public service and these need to be understood on two fronts. First, the Government has a responsibility to control the cost of public services, given the incredibly difficult fiscal targets under which it is labouring. Second, the Government is committed to public service reform and is focused on driving efficiency and improving how public services are delivered. Ongoing and meaningful reform is critical. Together with the Haddington Road agreement, the second public service reform plan which I launched in January provides the template for a better platform for public service delivery. The Government blueprint for reform demands that public service managers critically examine current business practices and processes with the goal of improving services and the service experience for citizens and get better value for taxpayers. Shared services, external service delivery, better use of technology and procurement reform are the building blocks that form part of every administration across the world for better, citizen-focused services. In looking at these options, public service managers are required to engage with and consult employees and their representatives. Where public service bodies are considering external service delivery, for example, they must evaluate each function under consideration on a case-by-case basis. If a business case has not been made and there are not clear and compelling reasons for external service delivery, then it will not happen. The Deputy is fully aware that we need to reduce the cost of public service delivery but maintain as best we can an efficient, appropriate service for the 21st century.

The INMO says that in hospitals we need one staff member for four patients, whereas currently we have one per eight during the day and one per 12 during the night. We have three times less staff than we need to keep patients safe.

As the Deputy is aware - I accept it is not politically acceptable to him - the whole focus of what we have to do is balance our budget in order that we can afford to maintain public services into the future. The Deputy is against a reduction in numbers in any sector, even in the case of rebalancing, where we are putting people on the front line and taking away back office and support staff through the use of shared services, better procurement, the reduction of quangos and all the other measures we are taking. Deputy Boyd Barrett is against a reduction in numbers or a reduction in pay but he wants us to spend more. However, he is against all charges and taxes as well. It is a wonderful fairyland he lives in.
#RichardBoydBarrett	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-party	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-dob	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-04 00:00:00	Visit of Mozambiquan Delegation	21	I am fully in favour of cutting the pay of people at the top of the public service and politicians, and reducing the number of bureaucrats at the top of the system, but I am absolutely against having levels of staff shortages among nurses that endanger patient safety, that we do not have enough people to carry out assessments on vulnerable children with special needs or that we do not have maintenance people in local authorities who can put in grab rails or carry out renovations on houses of elderly, sick and vulnerable people. That is not acceptable. Cutting the numbers to the level that has taken place means public services are grinding to a halt and vulnerable people depending on those services are being made suffer cruelly.

A total of 287,000 public servants are working very hard to provide a very fine public service to people. Of course there are pressures, because we are in a situation where we have downsized and where we have to reduce expenditure as we do not have the capacity to spend. We cannot spend money we do not have. The whole focus of the reform agenda is to reprioritise to the front line, to the very services Deputy Boyd Barrett talked about, by making the rational decisions about shared services, reducing administration, doing things much more efficiently and providing for front-line services such as the additional social care workers and resource teachers to which I referred. The aim is to put those into the front line of delivery in order that people can have a good experience. The Deputy's view is that in an ideal world the answer to everything is to provide whatever is demanded by anybody and to be popular. In the real world, where there are finite resources, we are making rational decisions to ensure we optimise the value for the money we have in terms of the quality of the services we deliver for the people who depend upon them.

On the same day, the Minister announced measures to discontinue the telephone allowance for elderly people. He also announced measures to discontinue mortgage interest supplement and to cut illness benefit. Is he still determined to ensure all of these public service cuts will continue to happen during this year?
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-04 00:00:00	Visit of Mozambiquan Delegation	26	The Government decided on departmental allocations for 2014 in the budget which I announced on 15 October 2013. The full details of these allocations were set out in the Revised Estimates for public services published on 18 December 2013 and approved by the Dáil on Thursday, 30 January 2014. Ministers and their Departments are responsible for ensuring that their Vote-level allocations are adhered to while at the same time managing the delivery of services. All Departments are required to report to my Department on a monthly basis on their actual current and capital expenditure compared with their published expenditure profiles and to explain where variations arise. My Department is in regular contact with Departments and offices to ensure that expenditure is being controlled, and where necessary my Department meets regularly with line Departments to review financial management in order to minimise any risk of expenditure overruns. The Deputy is very critical if there are overruns every time I answer questions here. The Comprehensive Expenditure Report 2012-2014 introduced a new model of multi-annual budgeting for current expenditure, as the Deputy is aware, called a medium-term expenditure framework, MTEF. The MTEF was initiated on an administrative basis and following enactment of the Ministers and Secretaries Amendment Act 2013, the arrangements for fixed spending ceilings for each ministerial Vote group for a rolling three year period have a statutory basis. The details of the operation of the ministerial expenditure ceilings are set out in an administrative circular issued by my Department last Autumn. As the Deputy is aware, we have been going through very challenging economic and fiscal conditions which have necessitated significant adjustments to voted expenditure. The efforts made by Ministers and Departments to ensure adherence to allocations, along with the regular monitoring by my Department and regular reporting to Government, have ensured that the required fiscal targets have been consistently met each year since the Government was elected.

They also approved cuts to maternity and adoptive benefits, as announced by the Minister, Deputy Howlin, and implemented by the Minister, Deputy Burton, who obviously agreed to it before the announcement. The Ministers also cut illness benefit and jobseeker's allowance for young people, and the Minister, Deputy Burton, single-handedly ensured the discontinuance of mortgage interest supplement for new applicants in mortgage difficulty. In addition to this, and it appears without the agreement of the Minister for Health, the Minister announced a reduction of €113 million in the medical card budget which has led to a series of U-turns. I cannot begin to list how many U-turns have been done on this issue in recent weeks.

One day he accuses us of following the Fianna Fáil programme to the letter and states we should not get any credit for it because it is all Fianna Fáil's doing while the next he is saying it is a programme Fianna Fáil wants to completely disown and it has nothing to do with it. In truth, it is neither. We renegotiated the programme with the troika. We are on a trajectory to get our deficit below 3%. We will still borrow €8 billion this year to pay for our services and this is a huge burden because we are piling up further debt. We want to minimise this by having a balanced budget as quickly as we can, consistent with making rational decisions. It is as though one could make the level of budgetary adjustments the people have been obliged to endure and have endured without affecting any social welfare, health or education services. As the Deputy knows full well, the four Departments of Health, Social Protection, Education and Skills and Justice and Equality between them account for 87% of all current expenditure and it would be impossible to make those adjustments.

It begs the question as to the reason the Minister has been in government supporting Fine Gael policy all along. I refer to something I cannot understand. The Minister announced cuts of €113 million in respect of medical cards in his budget here, which has led to the fiasco all Members have experienced and about which the Minister has learned at first hand. However, Members had spoken in this Chamber on this issue every single week for the past six months, but when the Government went knocking on the doors, the people told it the same thing. The Taoiseach announced the setting up of a committee and was going to deal with it. There is a new committee, he carried out a U-turn, he was going to give back the cards but then was not going to give them back and does not know whether he can do so or whether people must reapply. It is an absolute shambles and it all goes back to the Minister's announcement that €113 million was to be cut out of the medical card budget.

One can work out what that would mean for pensioners, for those dependent on social welfare provision and for the unemployed. I note that in the budgetary projects Fianna Fáil set out, it sought to crucify the unemployed. Consequently, I will take no lessons with regard to what the Government has done. The Government has done what it needed to do to balance the budget but did so in the most fair and humane way possible. It has protected basic social welfare payments. I would have liked to have admitted no cuts at all and certainly from my perspective, as I have stated in every budget speech, I take no pleasure in reducing public expenditure in areas on which I would like to spend more. However, I cannot spend money I do not have. While Members can continue to fight the election, it is over and they should now talk reality because the people want a future. They wish to know that the hard and difficult decisions they have endured will bring them a brighter future and not to have the illusion that all can be washed or wiped away in a return to phoney economics, as implemented in the dying days of the previous Administration.

One such group of workers are low paid public and civil servants who have endured cuts to their take home pay of anything between 18% and 20% since 2009. A commitment has been made to the lowest paid within the public service and Civil Service that their pay levels will be restored and my question asks the Minister whether he has had discussions with his colleagues in government to that effect.
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-04 00:00:00	Visit of Mozambiquan Delegation	38	To achieve the general Government deficit target of below 3% of GDP by 2015, all components of the public finances must make a contribution. I have acknowledged repeatedly that public servants have made a significant contribution to the fiscal recovery of the State through a number of measures which have helped to reduce the public service gross pay bill from its peak of €17.5 billion in 2009 to an estimated €13.63 billion, net of the pension related deduction, in 2014. In this context, reducing the Exchequer pay bill has been an important element in reducing public expenditure. While unprecedented efforts have been made to reduce the cost of the public service pay bill since 2009 through the operation of the financial emergency legislation and other measures, pay costs still amount to 29% of all current expenditure. The Haddington Road agreement, which came into force on 1 July 2013, included a number of measures, including pay reductions for those public servants on annual salaries in excess of €65,000 under the financial emergency measures in the public interest, FEMPI, legislation. These measures provided for a reduction of the public service pay and pensions bill by an additional €1 billion by 2016. It is a three-year agreement covering the period to the end of June 2016 and forms the basis for current public service pay policy over that period. Through its provisions, the agreement is also delivering an unprecedented structural increase of almost 15 million additional working hours annually to be deployed for the benefit of the people of the State. The productivity is contributing to the maintenance of our public services at a time of significant restraint. Under section 12 of the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest Act 2013, I must review the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest Acts 2009-2013 annually and cause a written report of my findings to be laid before each House of the Oireachtas. As part of that review I am required to consider whether the measures continue to be necessary, having regard to the purposes of the legislation. My next such report will be laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas on 30 June 2014.

The Minister referred to the fiscal ruination of the State; many low-paid public and civil servants are facing fiscal ruination in their own homes. A woman from Dublin who is a clerical officer wrote to me recently. Her weekly wage, before tax and deductions, is €445.71. She is being crippled. A number of the additional work requirements such as additional hours to be worked under the Haddington Road agreement have placed an additional burden of child care costs on this woman. She finds herself in an unsustainable position. Along with many other low-paid workers in the public service and the Civil Service, she finds herself figuring that she would be better off to stay at home and not to work. I ask the Minister to answer the question whether he plans to reinstate the wage levels of these low-paid workers in the public service and Civil Service. Has the Government discussed this matter? Does the Minister intend to honour the commitment made to these workers?
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-04 00:00:00	Visit of Mozambiquan Delegation	40	The Deputy has quoted from the Haddington Road agreement. It is my intention as I faithfully negotiated it with all trade unions. It was the first time that every public service trade union voted for an agreement because people were seized of the necessity to save the country at that stage. The structure of the Haddington Road agreement is to require pay reductions from those who best are able to afford it. The only cash reductions were for those earning in excess of €65,000. That was the measure we negotiated as a Government in order to protect those on low pay. However, we asked for additional working from them, for example, if working less than 37 hours a week to work for 37 hours and if working more than 37 hours to work up to 39 hours per week. This has been largely done. This allows us to deploy that 15 million additional hours to reduce agency pay and overtime rates and to make the savings. In some instances, those savings have been rolled into what I have called the Haddington Road dividend, to allow for additional front-line people to be employed at a time of very scarce resources. I can assure the Deputy that the provisions of Haddington Road will be fully adhered to by the Government.
#MaryLouMcDonald	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-party	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-dob	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-04 00:00:00	Visit of Mozambiquan Delegation	41	I presume, then, that in accordance with paragraph 2.3 of the Haddington Road agreement, that those moneys will be reinstated to those workers. The Minister should bear in mind that whatever about workers having been seized of the necessity to balance the books, to save the day and to save the State, as he asserts, if I recall correctly they were certainly seized by the prospect of the Minister waving a big stick and telling those very workers that if they were not agreeable to cuts to their wages that he would legislate for them anyhow. Does the Minister remember saying that? Does he remember that debacle because the workers have not forgotten it? The reality of life for large numbers of low-paid workers in the public service and Civil Service is that they are struggling and struggling badly and along with everyone else they now face the prospect of additional taxes, not least a water tax to which the Minister is committed.  Can the Minister say - not in coded language but in very straightforward language - that he will honour the commitment made to those on pay rates of €35,000 and less, that they will have their proper salary reinstated and will he tell us when that might happen?
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-04 00:00:00	Visit of Mozambiquan Delegation	42	I have a good memory and I recall. Unlike some members of the Deputy's party opposite, I have a very good memory of everything in which I was involved in the past. I remember the day of the Haddington Road agreement. I remember the Deputy opposite standing on the plinth decrying the agreement, sight unseen.It had not yet been published and the Deputy was against it because that is the default position of her party. It did not matter what was in the agreement. The Deputy was against it before the text became available or any worker had been asked to cast a vote on it. The Haddington Road agreement remains an important part of the painful and difficult adjustment that will give a future to all workers and ensure we have affordable public services. We could have embarked on a different path. The Deputy's party wanted to send the troika packing and keep their money. We would not have any public services or an economy if that course of action had been followed. People will remember that.

The Office of Public Works has properties in every town and village and has one of the largest property portfolios in the State. What initiatives has the OPW taken to make State properties available to local authorities to address the current housing crisis?
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2014-06-04 00:00:00	Visit of Mozambiquan Delegation	44	I propose to take Questions Nos. 6 and 15 together. The Office of Public Works, OPW, on behalf of the State, manages a large and diverse property portfolio which ranges from office accommodation to heritage properties, visitor centres and Garda stations, among others. There are a number of vacant properties within this portfolio. The majority of vacant properties are recently closed Garda stations, with the remainder consisting of properties such as customs posts, former Coast Guard stations and sundry other properties located nationwide.  The Office of Public Works has a clearly defined policy relating to vacant properties that are identified as surplus to its requirements. In the first instance, it engages with other public service bodies, including relevant local authorities, to establish the potential for alternative use in advance of deciding on disposal. Such alternative use includes the potential for these properties to be made available to meet social housing needs.  The Office of Public Works has been actively involved with the relevant authorities to identify potential properties within the portfolio which could be considered suitable to address the current housing issues. For example, it agreed to make a number of properties available to the Housing Agency and the office is engaged with the agency on the issue of leasing arrangements. In addition, the OPW recently made a property available to the Dublin Region Homeless Executive. It is intended that this property will be used as a residential centre to support vulnerable women affected by long-term homelessness. Deputies will be aware that on 20 May last, my colleague, the Minister of State with responsibility for housing and planning, Deputy Jan O'Sullivan, published the implementation plan on the State's response to homelessness, which outlines the Government's approach to delivering its objective of ending involuntary long-term homelessness by the end of 2016. The plan sets out a range of measures to secure a ring-fenced supply of accommodation to house homeless households within the next three years and mobilise the necessary supports. Progress on implementing the plan will be reported quarterly by the Minister of State with responsibility for housing and planning through the Cabinet committee on social policy. The Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government will chair a working group of key stakeholders which will identify potential suitable and available properties, with a view to putting in place the necessary arrangements to facilitate their use as housing units.  With regard to determining the criteria by which a property is adjudged to be suitable for social housing, this is primarily a matter for the relevant housing authorities. I am advised, however, that the following criteria generally apply: the suitability of the property given that many of them are purpose built Garda stations; the location of the properties and level of demand in the relevant area; and the current condition of the property and cost of refurbishment. As stated, the vacant State portfolio will form part of the option appraisal to deliver residential units being completed by the relevant housing authorities. 
#ClareDaly	unknown-#ClareDaly-party	unknown-#ClareDaly-dob	unknown-#ClareDaly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-04 00:00:00	Visit of Mozambiquan Delegation	45	Given the scale of the current housing crisis, the Minister's reply failed to provide sufficient detail. I note that one property has been available for homeless accommodation. I put it to the Minister that many more properties must be provided. It is ironic that the State is paying tens of millions of euro to subsidise private hoteliers who are providing short-term accommodation to meet current needs and address homelessness while a number of State properties are lying idle. While I am aware that a number of these properties do not fall fully within the jurisdiction of the Minister, I presume the Cabinet could do more than that which the Minister outlined. Some form of interdepartmental task force is required. The issue came up particularly regarding Defence Forces property of which there is a considerable amount, including several dwelling houses which could be remediated for a relatively small amount of money. Yet, we have people evicted from those premises to be added to the growing local authority homeless lists. There is a wide portfolio of properties, many of which would not be suitable in their current state. Will the Minister, however, consider the idea of convening a task force to see what alternative uses could be made of State properties? There are many unemployed builders who could be used to remediate these properties and make them suitable for housing purposes which would be a far more sensible approach than subsidising the private sector.
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-04 00:00:00	Visit of Mozambiquan Delegation	46	I largely agree with what the Deputy has said. There is not a huge array of available properties or properties suitable for housing in the Office of Public Works, OPW, however. I will send the Deputy a detailed letter on this because I will not be able to give her all the information now. There are 440 properties in the OPW property portfolio deemed habitable, the majority of which are occupied by members of An Garda Síochána and are, therefore, not available for letting. There are others in the heritage portfolio such as caretaker lodges which are assigned to particular tasks. Again, they are not available. Several properties were identified by the OPW as being available. One is in Kildonan Park, Finglas, which has been made available as a residential centre to support vulnerable women. It has a two storey residential school including classrooms, indoor swimming pool, gymnasium, canteen and fully equipped kitchen and several outbuildings. The Minister of State with responsibility for housing is dealing with the overall co-ordination of this. I will give her full support across all Departments to identify any property that might be brought expeditiously into use.
#MickWallace	unknown-#MickWallace-party	unknown-#MickWallace-dob	unknown-#MickWallace-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-04 00:00:00	Visit of Mozambiquan Delegation	47	We are all aware that there are serious problems not just with the lack of supply of social housing, but also in the supply of private housing, how the construction industry operates and how developers operate through land banking. For all practical purposes, this sector has gone unregulated. I am not saying it started with this Government but it has been unregulated for years. It makes more sense if the Government started to regulate this area properly. House prices in Dublin have gone up by 16% over the past year, with rents going up by 11%, but wages have not. There is no control of this sector. The Minister may have noted that large blocks of private sector houses and apartments have gone for sale over the past two years by investors. Up to 500 housing units in Tallaght, built by Liam Carroll, will soon be sold for €50,000 each. If they were sold individually to members of the public, they would be paying a minimum of €160,000 for a unit. I accept the Minister cannot make social housing out of all of them. While it might not come under the Minister’s remit, does he consider it a good idea for the State to buy between 20% and 30% of these units and selling the others to individuals looking for houses rather than allowing investors, usually from foreign lands, to buy the whole block for a fraction of what they are worth?
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-04 00:00:00	Visit of Mozambiquan Delegation	48	Again, I strongly agree with the Deputy that we have a real supply issue which is manifested by increasing rents in Dublin which are pushing people, including those dependent on rent subsidy, out of the market in Dublin and surrounding areas. There is a lesser impact in our own county, Wexford, as of yet. It is an issue we have to address. How do we address the supply issue? I have not made this public yet but I met the National Treasury Management Agency some weeks ago and asked it to engage with the NTMA family, such as the National Asset Management Agency, to see if we can provide a mechanism to fund initiatives exactly of the sort about which the Deputy spoke. I am due to have a report on that in the next several weeks and I hope to be able to report progress to the House when that is done.
#MickWallace	unknown-#MickWallace-party	unknown-#MickWallace-dob	unknown-#MickWallace-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-04 00:00:00	Visit of Mozambiquan Delegation	49	That sounds positive and I am glad to hear it. No doubt the principle of Part V was a good idea, but it was not implemented. Unfortunately, the previous Government reneged on it and allowed developers to create ghettos with these units in other areas. Often they stated that it did not suit because of the type of houses that were built. The Government should take on the issue. If it must encourage the building of houses, it should not abandon the idea of Part V. If builders are building 20 mansions on a site, I accept one does not need mansions for social housing. However, if 20% of the land is to be used for social purposes, one should put sensible units on 20% of it beside the mansions and should not let the builders build them in other areas instead. That way ghettos will be created because we sow significant social problems for the years ahead when that is allowed to happen.
#ClareDaly	unknown-#ClareDaly-party	unknown-#ClareDaly-dob	unknown-#ClareDaly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-04 00:00:00	Visit of Mozambiquan Delegation	50	The point here is that the State has to lead in this regard and subsidising the private sector is not the way forward. I would be interested in the detail that the Minister stated he would furnish in terms of the State's portfolio. I repeat that it is fine if it is the remit of the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government, but somebody has to take stock of all of the properties in State ownership and prioritise those that can be converted and retrofitted for housing purposes because it is a cheaper, more efficient and quicker way of delivering badly needed housing stock rather than wasting funding on the private sector.
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-04 00:00:00	Visit of Mozambiquan Delegation	51	There are two discrete and separate issues. One is dealing with homelessness, and we have a strategy to do that over the next three years. Then there is the normal housing situation, which is also now an acute problem that we need to address separately. They overlap but they are two separate issues. I agree with what has been said about Part V. I have heard first-hand testimony from many of my colleagues where a developer was allowed build up-market houses in one location and social housing in a completely separate location, and separated those who would populate each of those houses. That was not an effective or socially desirably way of dealing with Part V and it is something we have to address, but it is not in my area of responsibility. I fully accept that we need to have a joined-up Government approach to the housing issue. Where it falls to me, this is a confined question on public sector property and we will look at that. However, that will not be a solution. Retrofitting a Garda station for accommodation is a tokenistic response, although it will be important to the individual families. To really solve the problem, we need to tackle the supply issue that has been identified by Deputy Wallace.
#CatherineMurphy	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-party	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-dob	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-04 00:00:00	Visit of Mozambiquan Delegation	52	The question relates to workforce planning and the public service reform plan. On a number of occasions, I have raised with the Minister the fact that an embargo or the number of staff who left the public service on early retirement has left gaps. An embargo can be a crude instrument. It is a matter of how we rebuild the public service where there are gaps and what mechanism is being used to do that.
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-04 00:00:00	Visit of Mozambiquan Delegation	53	This Government has had to address a challenging fiscal situation. Since its peak in 2009, gross voted expenditure has been reduced by 13.5%, from €63.1 billion in 2009 to €54.6 billion last year, with a further reduction budgeted for this year. As part of this consolidation, the public service Exchequer pay bill has been reduced by approximately 22%, from €17.5 billion in 2009 to a targeted €13.6 billion this year. In order to achieve these savings, it has been necessary to reduce staff numbers, which are down by approximately 10% from the 2008 peak. We also worked to achieve our expenditure targets and endeavoured to do that, as I have stated repeatedly, in a balanced way, with a strategic view on current and future needs. We have reduced budgets and staff numbers. We have asked organisations and sectors to improve the utilisation of their scarce resources to become more efficient and better focused on the needs of citizens.  In addition, where savings have been made, the resulting reform dividend will allow for some recruitment to front-line services, particularly in the education and health sectors. In January this year, I published the Government's new public service reform plan for 2014 to 2016. The actions set out in the reform plan are largely cross-cutting in nature.  These include, for example, greater use of shared services and innovative approaches to service delivery; increased use of technology and improved engagement with service users; more efficient and effective public procurement and property management; and enhanced leadership and performance management. The reform programme adopts a whole-of-government approach to reforming our public services across all sectors, including health, education, justice and local government, as well as the Civil Service.  For this reason, the reform plan also references at a high level some of the key priorities and objectives of the main sectors of the public service.  As set out in the reform plan, the reforms at sectoral level are led by the relevant Ministers and their Departments.   Overall, the reform programme is about ensuring that services, whether centrally or locally delivered, are as efficient and effective as possible.
#CatherineMurphy	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-party	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-dob	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-04 00:00:00	Visit of Mozambiquan Delegation	54	I have raised this issue on a number of previous occasions. On some occasions when the Minister has talked about reform, it is actually a reduction in staff numbers and budgets. In fact, it can be costly. For example, if one has under-provided for local authority staffing and planning sections in some parts of the country where the building industry is starting to ramp up again, there will be inadequate oversight. It will only cause problems later on through an inability to call in bonds. Such matters are labour intensive and do have a benefit. The Minister said there is a whole-of-government approach and I know that workforce planning is being done in the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government. There would be a big imbalance in staff ratios, however, because Meath has 620 staff while the combined Limerick local authorities' staff totals 1,075, yet there are 20,000 fewer people there. One cannot deliver some of the services that are planned without having people to do so. Those examples come to mind but there are many other sectors. In the health sector, for example, there is no point in having a consultant if there is not a porter to wheel a patient to the operating theatre.

We have had this discussion with regard to regional disparity and it is a fact, but it is not possible to resolve that overnight. If, for historic reasons, there are different structural bases for local authorities and the way they approach staff development has been quite different over the decades, it will not be undone overnight. One of the key issues is flexibility at local level and key managers need to be able to deploy staff where they are needed. During the down times, obviously we did not need to have huge planning departments, but as they increase we need to be able to redeploy people back into them. That flexibility is required at ground level. We have all gone into workplaces - be they hospitals, health centres or local government sections - where some areas are run ragged while others are under no pressure at all. Therefore, we need to have the flexibility and management skills to ensure that staff are always deployed to the greatest pressure points.
#CatherineMurphy	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-party	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-dob	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-04 00:00:00	Visit of Mozambiquan Delegation	57	Do local authorities or the HSE make an application for a relaxation of an embargo for certain staff cohorts or people with particular skills? If so, how is that managed? Is there a framework against which these requirements are matched? Is it done at departmental level? How is the whole-of-government approach applied to that?
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-04 00:00:00	Visit of Mozambiquan Delegation	58	Each Department has what we call an ECF or employment control framework. They can deploy or make an application to my Department for sanction for how that overall framework meets the demands as they perceive them at service delivery level. Therefore, local authorities would make representations to the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government, which would look at how the ECF is to be managed. We obviously cannot grant additional staff for every request. That is not possible because we have to live within our financial constraints, but I am certainly preaching for as much flexibility as we can. For example, people may want to suppress a very expensive post and have more than one person employed for the same resource. If that is determined as being a more efficient way of delivering services, I have no difficulty with a pure numbers policy in that regard.I have eased off on the strictness of the numbers policy to achieve that objective with more flexibility and better judgment, management and, I hope, outcomes at delivery.

There are many substantial allowances. Some people agree some of them are outdated while most people agree a number of them are essential and should be retained, although possibly streamlined and incorporated into core pay where necessary. Where is the Minister on this and could he update us on progress?
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-04 00:00:00	Visit of Mozambiquan Delegation	66	I thank the Deputy for the question. More than 1,100 allowances were notified to my Department under the review of public service allowances and premium pay. Departments were notified in September 2012 of details of the Government decision regarding the outcome of the review. Approval for payment of an allowance to a new beneficiary pending the outcome of the review was withdrawn from 31 January 2012 and was not restored where the review found there was no business case for its payment to new beneficiaries. Following the review, sectoral management were instructed to engage with staff interests with a view to securing their early agreement to the elimination of those departmental allowances payable to current beneficiaries where no business case exists to pay those allowances to new beneficiaries, with a list identified for consideration among the allowances they should prioritise for early elimination. In addition, Departments have been asked to identify other allowances, including legacy allowances, for elimination. Departments are directly engaging with staff representatives on the allowances specific to their areas. Labour Court Recommendation No. LCR20448 has implications for the decision. In particular, the court recommended that "the parties should enter into central negotiations with a view to reaching a generally applicable agreement on measures by which loss arising from the elimination of pensionable allowances can be ameliorated". My Department is working on proposals on this to put to the staff side. The Haddington Road agreement provides, and the unions have agreed, that there will be full co-operation with the allowances review, taking account of the recommendations contained in Labour Court Recommendation No. LCR20448, and the outcome of the review will, therefore, require agreement at sectoral level. In cases where no agreement can be reached, the time-bound mechanism for dispute resolution through existing industrial relations systems, the Labour Court, conciliation and arbitration schemes or the Public Service Stability Agreement 2013-2016, the Haddington Road agreement, is available. Given that many allowances have been discontinued for new appointees to posts, the precise number of allowances discontinued and, consequently, the number in place, is dependent on rates of staff turnover across the public service, and I do not have that figure.

Perhaps when he has the figure of the allowances that have been discontinued for new entrants he might send it to us. Could he give us the list of the allowances? It might not affect the number because with the recent recruitment situation an allowance might have been discontinued but there might have been no new entrant in that area yet. I am concerned that it seems to be going around the house a little. The Labour Court wants a central agreement while the essence of the Haddington Road agreement was sectoral agreements.

The Minister caused a brouhaha with his unrealistic announcement of €75 million in savings that was to be achieved by this. Once he drilled into it, he saw that some of the allowances were excellent value for money, were part of core pay in effect but were given through a variety of mechanisms. It would be good for the public service to rationalise them so there is not an impression that old, outdated allowances are being paid. It would be good to tidy this up.
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-04 00:00:00	Visit of Mozambiquan Delegation	70	I agree with the Deputy. My first budget announcement was that we could realistically target 5%, and that is where the figure of €75 million came from. The Deputy was on the committee which examined allowances and he knows that when we drill down to see what are allowances, this is a completely different issue. I do not have time to go into detail with the Deputy but within the different classes of allowances, some could only be described as core pay, some are formally agreed with binding decisions of the Labour Court and pay agreements to be integrated as part of pay, while others are outdated or no longer of value. That is what we are working on. The allowances issue was subsumed into the Haddington Road agreement. The €75 million becomes small beer when we speak in terms of the €1 billion agreement I managed to achieve with unions to change the system fundamentally and allow for real and meaningful Exchequer savings to be made, with flexibility to be agreed with unions to restructure the public service within the reform plan laid out.

If some of them have to be bought out, long-established mechanisms in the public service can be used and we should do that and get it over with. Perhaps there is a cashflow issue that must be dealt with. I was particularly impressed by one allowance when I heard of it at the Committee of Public Accounts. It is an allowance of €5,000 per annum paid to Garda inspectors who process all the prosecutions in District Courts around the country. A senior counsel could not be engaged for a day and a half for that fee but these people would be on their feet at District Courts every week of the year, processing thousands of cases. Some allowances are very well earned and amount to outstanding value for money, so it would be good to see some of them incorporated into core pay.

It is neither practical nor reasonable to take away unilaterally a big chunk of somebody's income. That is the long and short of it. These are by far the biggest volume of allowances in money terms. The second category is made up of payments which do not form a significant element of remuneration but are important to people on call or where they work unsocial hours. It also applies in the Deputy's example. We need to examine each sector separately, and there is now a review of An Garda Síochána. Maybe the particular role mentioned should be a defined office with a pay grade appropriate which is above the normal office. It is a matter for each sector to consider. As I believe the Deputy discovered in the Committee of Public Accounts debate, these are quite complex issues.

#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2014-06-04 00:00:00	Visit of Mozambiquan Delegation	74	I propose to take Questions Nos. 9 and 11 together. Public procurement is governed by EU and national rules, the aim of which is to promote an open, competitive and non-discriminatory public procurement regime which delivers best value for money. It would be a breach of the EU rules for a public body to favour or discriminate against particular candidates on grounds such as nationality, organisational size or any other matter, and there are legal remedies which may be used against any public body infringing these rules. The Government acknowledges the significant role SMEs play in the Irish economy and is committed to ensuring SMEs are fully engaged with public sector procurement and the opportunities which public sector procurement presents to them. To encourage greater SME participation, the Office of Government Procurement has conducted a targeted programme of education for suppliers who wish to learn more about doing business with the Irish public service.  This programme consists of seminars, workshops and large-scale so-called meet the buyer events throughout the country.  These meet the buyer events are run in conjunction with Enterprise Ireland and InterTradeIreland. To date, the Office of Government Procurement has facilitated workshops and presented at seminars to more than 4,500 SMEs nationwide.  These events afforded suppliers an opportunity to meet and discuss the issues with public service buyers and provide networking opportunities for suppliers to build consortia and synergies between suppliers to facilitate joint bids. My Department has also recently finished reviewing and updating existing guidelines and procedures aimed at promoting SME participation in public procurement. Circular 10 of 2014, launched on 17 April, sets out new initiatives aimed at opening up opportunities for small businesses to bid for State business. These new guidelines are aimed at reducing the administrative burden and costs on businesses that want to tender for public contracts. The SME working group, established under the Government's Action Plan for Jobs, was consulted on the new guidelines. The SME working group is chaired by the Office of Government Procurement and includes representatives from the Irish Small and Medium Enterprises Association, ISME, the Irish Business Employers Confederation, IBEC, InterTradeIreland, Enterprise Ireland, the Competition Authority, the Small Firms Association, Chambers Ireland and the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation. The new circular has been broadly welcomed by industry representative associations. The reform of public procurement across the public service is ongoing and will continue to provide opportunities to the SME sector to win business here and to shape them to win business abroad as well. The Office of Government Procurement will continue to work with SMEs to ensure that winning Government business is done in a fair, transparent and accessible way and to ensure that Government procurement policies are business friendly.

SMEs are the lifeblood of our country. It has been said before that if every SME were to hire one person it would put a huge dent in our dole queues. Is the Minister happy that the office is functioning to the best of its ability? There is concern that saving money on procurement may inadvertently cost jobs in the SMEs which lose out. I welcome circular 10/14 which contains many welcome initiatives, including sub-division into lots, the use of consortia and the use of e-tenders for contracts of under €25,000. Does the office report on the savings in each Department? Are annual reports published to show the savings as the office tries to meet the target of the €500 million savings between now and 2016?

This will probably be the first time we have a comprehensive picture so that different State agencies do not buy goods and services from the same supplier at different rates. Less than 5% of the overall public procurement spend is now won by foreign companies. In excess of 95% of public procurement in Ireland is won by Irish companies, 75% of which are SMEs. That was the figure for last year, up from 60% in 2012. Whatever we are doing, we are moving in the right direction.  It is equally important to open the vista and enable Irish SMEs tender for the enormous EU public tendering market, which is valued at €2.4 trillion. A small slice of that would work wonders for the Irish economy.

A significant number of small local businesses are not registered on the e-tenders website and are not competing. While the bulk of the value of overall contracts is won in Ireland, a considerable amount is won by foreign companies. I welcome circular 10/14, which is a significant development. If we do not get our act together here it will be very difficult for us to tender for European contracts. If we can get 0.5% more of that, it will be worth twice as much as the public procurement contracts for the whole State.  It is vitally important to apply that circular consistently. What measures are being taken to do that? The Minister said these issues cannot be targeted locally. Kilkenny County Council has introduced a public contract for the maintenance of its water and waste waterworks and set a condition of response within two hours. That allowed local contractors to tender and it was won by local contractors. A bit of ingenuity would help ensure that there is a level playing field and that local companies get a fair crack of the whip.

Not only will it save money for the State and the taxpayer, something that Deputy Naughten always espouses, but it is more efficient. It will make SMEs more efficient. It has already done so. Between 2012 and 2013 we have increased the participation rate of SMEs overall. We have more than maintained the level of Irish companies winning public procurement contracts. This is an ongoing process. We have only started. We need to see how we can work with industry and its representatives to build those synergies to get a slice of the €2.4 trillion EU procurement contracts market. I am determined that the Office of Public Procurement will be a professional body that will help small companies to tender, either individually or collectively.

Will the Minister facilitate engagement with that company? It is a high-potential start up supported by Enterprise Ireland and could help many more SMEs get into this sector.

It would be useful for that committee to invite Mr. Quinn, the chief procurement officer, to explain what he is doing. I think the Deputy would be excited by it. This is a very important initiative in the reform agenda to do things more efficiently and well. The Deputy asked the profound question of how we get those who are not motivated to motivate themselves. I have run meetings around the country where there are plenty of people complaining about not being able to avail of tenders. They will not avail of them. Companies have to be proactive. We will work through the industry representatives to make them as proactive as possible. I do not know the company Deputy Naughten mentioned but if he sends me the details, I will consider it.

"You are going to be the proud owner of 25 million people," he reportedly told George W Bush. "You will own all their hopes, aspirations and problems." But while many of these military interventions have left nations shattered, western governments have resembled the customer who walks away whistling, hoping no one has noticed the mess left behind. 
#PaschalDonohoe	unknown-#PaschalDonohoe-party	unknown-#PaschalDonohoe-dob	unknown-#PaschalDonohoe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-04 00:00:00	Visit of Mozambiquan Delegation	84	I thank the Deputy for raising this issue. The current political and security situation in Libya, as the Deputy has outlined, is both highly complex and precarious and remains a matter of deep concern, both for Ireland and for the international community generally. Since the fall of Colonel Gadaffi in 2011, serious difficulties, including a weak and divided central government, impotent defence institutions and a proliferation of militias vying for influence, have undermined cohesion in the country. Overall, two broad political camps have emerged, representing Islamist factions of varied stripes on the one hand and a loose alliance of anti-Islamist nationalists, federalists and tribal militias on the other. This ongoing instability has understandably led to rising popular discontent and frustration with the political process. Recent months have been particularly worrying. Blockades of oil ports by militias in the east of the country have starved the government of vital revenue. The government's perceived poor handling of attempts by militias to illegally export this oil resulted in the General National Congress, GNC, sacking former Prime Minister Ali Zeidan in March, while his replacement, interim Prime Minister Abdullah al-Thinni, resigned following an attack on his family home in the middle of April. Somewhat controversially, due to doubts over the circumstances of his election, Ahmed Maiteeq, a prominent businessman with links to the Muslim Brotherhood, has now been nominated as Prime Minister-designate, the third Prime Minister so far this year and the fifth in the past two and a half years.  Recent weeks have seen a further deterioration. On 16 and 17 May, forces loyal to the renegade, anti-Islamist, General Khalifa Haftar launched an extensive air and ground operation in Benghazi against Islamist militias, reportedly killing some 70 people. Two days later, General Haftar sent his paramilitary force, the Libyan National Army, to attack the parliament building in Tripoli, precipitating heavy clashes which resulted in two dead and 60 wounded.  Both Ireland and the EU are extremely concerned at the repeated use of violence in Libya, and this latest deterioration in particular. As was stated in reply to a parliamentary question last week, Ireland strongly condemns the actions of all militias in Libya and calls on all sides to refrain from further use of force and urgently to return to dialogue and reconciliation as a means of restoring stability. The EU has also voiced its strong concerns over the current situation through a declaration on behalf of all 28 member states, which issued on 24 May. The declaration called on all sides to refrain from the use of force and to address differences by political means. It also emphasised the importance of an inclusive Libyan political dialogue and encouraged all parties to actively co-operate with the UN Special Mission in Libya in reaching agreement on a political roadmap for the transition period.  High Representative Ashton last month appointed a special envoy for Libya, Mr. Bernardino Leon, to further co-ordinate and enhance the EU's actions in support of the Libyan people. The special envoy visited Tripoli on 24 and 25 May and is actively engaged in efforts to promote urgent dialogue within Libya and a political way forward out of the current crisis. The EU is also supporting the process of transition and post-conflict reconstruction within Libya through the EU Border Assistance Mission aimed at improving and developing the security of the country's borders.  There is no doubting the desire of the Libyan people to fashion a new democratic dispensation within their country. Fresh elections may be held in late June, and if these can proceed with broad agreement, it may provide an opportunity to promote that greater internal dialogue within Libya which is so urgently needed. Similarly, work on preparation of a new constitution should proceed, following the election of a constitutional drafting assembly in April. Ireland and the European Union will continue to offer all possible political support and assistance that they can to support the transition to democratic rule in Libya.
#MickWallace	unknown-#MickWallace-party	unknown-#MickWallace-dob	unknown-#MickWallace-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-04 00:00:00	Visit of Mozambiquan Delegation	85	Three years ago when Prime Minister Cameron, former President Sarkozy and President Obama joined forces to bomb Libya, the Government here thought they were doing the right thing. Will the Minister of State not admit at this stage that it was a serious mistake to intervene in the affairs of Libya because it has caused many more problems than it has solved? With regard to the notion of humanitarian intervention, unfortunately, world powers are pretty selective when they choose to act and not to act and, more often than not, they are guided by self-interest rather than out of concern for the local people. When Serbia was bombed at the end of the 1990s, shortly afterwards the South Summit of 133 states convened in April 2000 and rejected "the so-called 'right' of humanitarian intervention, which has no legal basis in the United Nations Charter or in the general principles of international law", yet we see it being used time and again, in particular, by the US and Britain.When NATO bombed Serbia, it argued that it was within its area of jurisdiction. It tried to disown what was going on in south-eastern Turkey in the 1990s, however, where Kurds were being slaughtered thanks to the military support of the Clinton Administration with the aid of other NATO powers. The selective application of the responsibility to protect principle is stomach-churning. There was, of course, no thought of applying that principle to the Iraq sanctions administered by the Security Council, which were condemned as "genocidal" by two directors of the oil for food programme, Denis Halliday and Hans von Sponeck, both of whom resigned in protest. Mr. von Sponeck's detailed study of the horrendous impact of the sanctions has been under a virtual ban in the United States and United Kingdom, the primary agents of the programme. Similarly, there is no thought today of protecting the people of Gaza - also a UN responsibility - who are being denied fundamental human rights. In another domain, there is no thought of invoking even the most innocuous prescriptions of responsibility to protect in response to massive levels of starvation in poor countries. While the UN estimates that the number facing hunger has passed 1 billion, its World Food Programme has just announced major cutbacks in aid as a result of rich countries reducing their meagre contributions and giving priority to their continued support for the arms industry and the bailing out of banks. Ireland must take a different position on all of these matters, instead of aligning ourselves with these people.

It is important to consider the events which led to the UN making the intervention it did. At the time, the then ruler of Libya, Colonel Gadaffi, was threatening attack and assault against the people of Benghazi. He was, in effect, threatening genocide against people inside his own borders. If the international community had not taken action in that period, it is likely that some voices would be criticising it now for not doing so. Deputy Wallace referred to the number of times the veto has been used at the UN Security Council. In recognition of the gigantic threat of violence that was posed by the Libyan ruler against his own people at the time, the Security Council passed a resolution authorising the action that was taken. It is a regular feature of our engagement in this House that the Deputy will point to an awful difficulty that is occurring and I will ask what he would have the international community do about it. What would he do in a situation where a ruler is threatening genocide against his own people?

I emphasise again that the action that was taken was to prevent the slaughter of people in Libya. The current situation, as the Deputy pointed out, is one of grave difficulty within the borders of that country. The European Union has appointed a special envoy to co-ordinate the efforts of the different countries working to deal with the difficulties. The sole European Union agency presence in the country is the EU Border Assistance Mission, EUBAM, which is doing the very work to improve the governance in regard to the country's borders for which the Deputy has called. That work is ongoing. If the elections take place in the coming weeks, as I hope they will, and when the country's rulers begin drafting a constitution which might lead to the type of reconciliation we all want to see, I assure the Deputy that Ireland, the EU and the various international bodies will do all they can to make the situation more peaceful and ordered.
#PatrickODonovan	unknown-#PatrickODonovan-party	unknown-#PatrickODonovan-dob	unknown-#PatrickODonovan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-04 00:00:00	Visit of Mozambiquan Delegation	89	I thank the Ceann Comhairle for allowing me to raise this issue and the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Ruairí Quinn, for taking it. It is an issue of health and safety relating to one of the most vulnerable groups in our society, namely, children. I raise it following the discussions and dialogue I had with parents and teachers in the aftermath of the storm last February that wreaked so much havoc in different parts of the country. I take this opportunity to compliment all of those working in local authority emergency services and elsewhere who came to people's aid at that time. In the intervening period, we have all had a chance to consider what exactly happened on 12 February. My specific concern relates to the process of planning for emergencies, particularly in respect of vulnerable cohorts such as children attending school. My understanding is that the national meteorological service would have known 24 hours in advance that Storm Darwin, a full-blown hurricane, was due to hit the west coast. For some reason, however, a decision was either taken or not taken which led to schools opening that morning, thereby putting children, parents and staff at an absolutely inordinate risk. In some cases, at the height of the storm, text messages were being sent out by schools to parents asking them to collect their children. There clearly was no joined-up plan for how vulnerable groups like children would be protected in these types of circumstances. On 27 May, in response to a question from me, the Minister, Deputy Quinn, pointed to the Department's circular PBU04/04 as providing guidance to schools on this issue. Unfortunately, that circular offers no level of comfort to school managers, teachers or principals, offering little advice other than that schools should provide their details to the local authority. That is not really much good in the situation we saw on 12 February, where debris of every description was flying through the air, third level colleges were sending text messages to their students and staff to say that they were going into lock-down, and staff and principals of schools, particularly primary schools, were left to their own devices to figure out what they should do. What is required is a single protocol for all schools. One of the first issues to be established is whether schools should open at all when a status red weather warning is issued and, if not, how that message can be communicated in a timely and effective manner. Leaving schools to their own devices in this type of situation is not good enough. There is anecdotal evidence of gates being taken off their piers and sent hurling through the air in the direction of parents collecting their children from school and of trees falling on cars. How much of this was avoidable? Although a man did lose his life while clearing up in the immediate aftermath of the storm, it was very fortunate that nobody died on the day itself. Indeed, based on what we saw unfolding on our television screens, it is a miracle there was not widespread loss of life and injury. Leaving it to the devices of individual schools, managers, teachers and parents to decide whether or not it is safe to go out on an open road in the height of a hurricane to collect children is simply not good enough. We must have stricter protocols in place and the Department should take the lead in their introduction.

The Government task force on emergency planning, in which my Department participates, co-ordinates the overall response to such events. Departmental officials are currently engaging with the task force on this specific issue with a view to informing future practice. Officials from the Department are also in consultation with the office of emergency planning of the Department of Defence to enable such protocols to be developed. They are due to meet shortly with the management bodies for the primary and post-primary sector to review the issues and identify which measures should be put in place. The Department is aware that different weather events which warrant a red alert may have different implications for schools.In particular, a weather event caused by severe wind, as experienced in January and February this year, presents particular issues in the potential damage it may cause and in the sudden and localised nature of such an event. The red alert arising from a wind event will be taken into account in any protocols which may be devised. Currently, the lead agencies in regard to determining the appropriate emergency response in any region where there is an extreme weather event or other critical incident are the local authorities and blue light services. In that context, the Department of Education and Skills has brought to the attention of all schools departmental circular PBU 04/04, entitled contingency planning in the context of a national emergency. In particular, this circular requires schools to ensure up-to-date contact details are provided to the local authority. The Department, as a member of the national co-ordinating committee, acts a conduit for information between the national authorities and the wider education sector at the time of such events. The Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government has the responsibility for leading the response to weather related emergencies. The Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport plays a major supporting role as transport is one of the main sectors affected by severe weather.
#PatrickODonovan	unknown-#PatrickODonovan-party	unknown-#PatrickODonovan-dob	unknown-#PatrickODonovan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-04 00:00:00	Visit of Mozambiquan Delegation	91	I thank the Minister for his reply. The Department of Education and Skills has a very important role in emergency planning. Some 24 hours before this hurricane hit the country, we had information at our disposal and yet we allowed schools to open the following morning and children from as young as five years of age were put into a lethal environment, which was totally unnecessary. Who in the meteorological service decided not to relay this information so that schools could be told to close? What have we learned from that to ensure it will not happen again? That is the crux of the issue. I appreciate there is a circular but no county manager will send out a notification to close a school. There needs to be very clear protocols in place in the Department which can be given to school managers and principals telling them exactly what they should do. For instance, is it safe to ask parents by text message to collect their child in the middle of a hurricane, putting them at risk by asking them to travel on roads on which they do not know what kind of debris they will find? The child may well be safer left at school. Luckily we are not in the throes of winter but this issue needs to be taken much more seriously. The Minister knows as well as I do that teaching principals in rural areas, which were the areas worst affected by this, have a million other things on their minds, but if they got a text message from a centralised service the night before telling them to close their schools the next day due to a red warning alert, it would be much more effective than a circular asking them to forward their details to the county manager who probably has been moved and has not taken down their names in the first place. This is a very serious issue. We put children, their parents, their teachers and their minders at unnecessary risk when we knew 24 hours beforehand that there was a red alert and that a hurricane was going to hit the west coast. As a State, we did nothing about it. Luckily nobody was killed but will we be able to say that in the future? We need proper and robust protocols in place to ensure we are not putting vulnerable people at unnecessary risk.
#RuairiQuinn	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-party	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-dob	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-04 00:00:00	Visit of Mozambiquan Delegation	92	I thank the Deputy for raising this matter because I recall very acutely the events which took place. Our information systems are out of balance with each other and the Deputy's timely raising of this matter is helpful. We have much better long-term weather forecasts and the red alert system, which is relatively new, is certainly much more advanced than anything we had in the past ten to 15 years. However, we have not upgraded the system in terms of school decision-making and I will give the Deputy a particular example. I spoke to a principal in Kerry whose small school, although not that small, was severely damaged in that the roof came off part of it. In fairness to her, whose name I will not mention, she telephoned her diocesan education secretary to find out who was to make the decision or what was the decision, but quite frankly, people did not necessarily know. We have a public private division in our education system in that the public side of it, controlled from this House, raises the money, sets the curriculum and so on, while the private side is the patron side. The main patron is the Roman Catholic Church which is responsible for 93% of all the primary schools in the country. Perhaps what the Deputy has alerted me to is to have a proper discussion with the Catholic Primary Schools Management Association to put protocols in place because it is not the function of the Department to instruct a school to close for whatever reason, although in this instance it was adverse weather. Principals do not necessarily want to take that unilateral decision and they certainly need guidance. That is something which could be constructively raised with the new general secretary of the Catholic Primary Schools Management Association, Monsignor Tom Deenihan, to see what should happen. If the weather is bad, the CPSMA should make a decision and contact the principals and the boards of management to give principals the authority to notify parents in sufficient time that it is not safe to bring their children to school.
#SimonHarris	unknown-#SimonHarris-party	unknown-#SimonHarris-dob	unknown-#SimonHarris-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-04 00:00:00	Visit of Mozambiquan Delegation	93	I am very grateful to the Ceann Comhairle for the opportunity to raise with the Minister for Education and Skills the need for him to provide an update on and to outline the provisions which have been put in place to provide additional school places in Greystones, Kilcoole and Delgany in County Wicklow. We have a recurring problem in Greystones and in the wider Greystones area where in the run-up to September, there is a scramble for school places. Parents who have been very dutiful and have put their child's name on a list in accordance with the right protocols and timeframes find themselves not knowing whether their child will have a school place in the school of their choice and in the school with the ethos of their choice as is their right as parents. In some cases, they do not know whether their child will have a place in any school. As the Minister can imagine, this is causing huge worry and stress. I have dealt with this issue each September during my time in this House and before that. It is a recurring issue that needs to be addressed. In fairness to the Minister and his Department, extra classrooms were provided for St. Laurence's national school, St. Patrick's national school and St. Kevin's national school. However what is happening is that we are falling into the sticking plaster solution where every year the Department meets the eight representatives of the eight schools in that catchment area. The principals and the boards of management will acknowledge that the Department has been very helpful in trying to provide temporary solutions but they are only solutions to get them to the following September. We need to engage in more long-term planning and my colleagues at local level - members of Wicklow County Council and members of the former Greystones Town Council - have expressed this concern to the Minister and to his Department. We need a longer-term solution. This is not a reflection on the Minister, who I have always found to be very helpful and forthcoming with information, but the answers to parliamentary questions I have submitted and which have been answered in the Minister's name have been less than forthcoming and have been mealy-mouthed. I submitted a parliamentary question on this issue on 7 May 2014, Question No. 96, but I was not satisfied with the answer which provided me with no information. I submitted another question three weeks later, Question No. 236 on 27 May 2014, asking a series of specific questions. The words matter and I do not just include them to make the question look long. Most of the elements of the question were ignored. My office was told by civil servants in the Minister's Department to stop contacting them as it would not help resolve the matter. As a public representative, Member of Dáil Éireann and a supporter of this Government, I have been inundated with requests from worried parents - neighbours and friends in our community - wanting to know if their child will have a school place. There should be a better system in place to engage with parents and provide information. No parent should have to go to his or her Deputy to find out what the situation is in regard to a school place, but if he or she does, the Deputy should be able to find that information quite easily. Will the Department look at some sort of collaborative role in regard to making information publicly available on websites in terms of the number of places provided within a catchment area vis-à-vis the number of children expected to need to a school place this year? When I ask questions about what action is being taken and when the review will be complete, it would be helpful if that information could be provided because some of the questions I am asking are also being asked by the local schools. We have to do better. Ultimately, we need another school in Greystones, and I have written to the Minister about this.The reason for that is because the existing schools simply do not have the space to expand adequately. Based on population figures, the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government has advised the area is to grow in population and we will have a population bulge in the future. We need a new school in the area of Greystones known as Charlesland. Will the Minister provide details on the situation that will arise in September and also take a longer term look to ensure we do not have the same problem again next year that has arisen in the past two to three years?
#RuairiQuinn	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-party	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-dob	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-04 00:00:00	Visit of Mozambiquan Delegation	94	I will respond directly to what Deputy Harris said, which might be a bit more constructive. We have a growth in population that will not peak until 2026. The problem is aggravated in many areas, including the area to which Deputy Harris referred, for all the normal reasons, but it will take time to put a response in place to my satisfaction and that will require support and confidence from the educational partners. What is required is some form of co-ordinated regional planning at local authority level or education and training board level to see what resources exist and what can be utilised. While we have a system of forward planning, there has been a significant population increase in the area to which Deputy Harris referred and the growth is happening at a faster speed. Deputy Harris might talk to the local authorities on the matter, to his party’s councillors and, following the local elections, the new education and training boards. The second issue relates to admissions policy and enrolment which is currently unsatisfactory. A total of 80% of schools have the accommodation to offer a place to parents who apply to the 3,200 primary schools and approximately 800 post-primary schools, but 20% are oversubscribed in terms of their capacity to offer a place. Added to that, there is no proper system of waiting list or regulations. I have a document on admissions policy in draft form which I hope to get finalised and to bring before the House. It was a consultative document which has already gone to the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Education and Social Protection. The suggestion is that people who move within the country or come to the country for the first time are excluded from local schools because they are not in the know and they do not realise that in some cases when a child is born one must have his or her name put down on a waiting list for school X or Y. The policy of first come, first served seems like an objective and reasonable one without favouritism for parents seeking education for their children, but it does provide a very strong advantage to parents who live in a particular area who know that they have to register their child for primary school education in virtually the week the child is born, and even then there is no guarantee of a place. We have not even begun to tackle the issue of getting a child into a school whose ethos is one parents want. That is another issue that requires discussion. I suggest to Deputy Harris that the Department is more than happy to liaise, and does liaise, with local authorities, but the way forward is to get the education and training boards, in conjunction with the Department and local authorities, to work together. In the coming weeks 12 members of the Kildare and Wicklow Education and Training Board will be nominated by the local councillors and there will be two staff members and five other representative members. That is the way forward in terms of planning and making sure that we are making the best use of the existing space in the educational infrastructure. I do not wish to sound as if the Department has a grand plan to take over the private patronage role of the schools. It does not, but we must ensure co-ordinated planning that provides and ensures space is available. We are not in a position to do that as satisfactorily as we would like.
#SimonHarris	unknown-#SimonHarris-party	unknown-#SimonHarris-dob	unknown-#SimonHarris-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-04 00:00:00	Visit of Mozambiquan Delegation	95	I thank the Minister for his response and for responding directly to the issues I raised. I have a problem with the official response that the Minister did not read in that the Department gave me a history lesson in terms of the places it did provide. The class spaces the Minister provided are very much appreciated but they have been taken. The schools have provided the Department with as much flexibility as they can within the existing campus sites in terms of accommodating additional students. I still do not know, but much more importantly, the parents of children in Greystones, Delgany and Kilcoole who do not have a place today still do not know whether they will have a place. The line from the Department which has been frustrating me for some time is that the schools in the area are engaging with each other in the context of addressing enrolment demand for September 2014. Could we try to put some meat on what exactly that means? I would be extremely grateful if in the coming days somebody in the Department could liaise with me and the other Deputies for the Wicklow constituency to explain exactly where we are at, because this is a very time-sensitive situation as schools will shortly shut down for the summer and we must resolve the issue. I also wish to refer to the need for an additional school or for an existing school to move to a larger site in the Charlesland area. That is something the Minister might ask his officials to examine. The Minister is bang on the money in terms of what we need to do at a local level. As part of local government reform, those whom we elect at local level must accept the responsibilities they have, but they must also be given more responsibilities in terms of ensuring there are adequate school places and sites and that there is a waiting list structure. It is not adequate to be told that the schools are still working on the issue because September 2014 is very nearly here and we need to be able to give clarity to parents as to whether their child will have a place in any school, in particular a place in a school of their choice. The Minister shares my view that plurality and a choice of ethos is important to parents as the primary educators of children in this country.
#RuairiQuinn	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-party	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-dob	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-04 00:00:00	Visit of Mozambiquan Delegation	96	I will not comment specifically on Deputy Harris’s area because I am not as well informed as he is, but in some areas there is close co-operation between the various primary schools in order that people know who has applied and there is a certain amount of sharing of information. However, that is not always the case. In fact, at the other end of the spectrum one has schools beating the bushes trying to find children that they can bring into a smaller school to maintain their teacher numbers. Somewhere between those two extremes we must find a way forward that can take the stress away from parents. I refer primarily to primary school places. In some cases parents will not know for some time whether their four year old will get a place this September. The situation is due in the first instance to massive growth in population numbers. A White Paper was published by the Department of Education and Skills in 1998 which said that the big task facing the primary school system in Ireland was managing the decline in population. We had fewer than 480,000 schoolchildren and all the projections were that the population would decline. We now have 525,000 and growing. That means we must find extra space. It also means building bigger schools. There is a certain reluctance among some to contemplate that. One can provide far more accommodation in a much more effective and economic way with a two stream or three stream school, which is 24 classes or more. Some people do not want to have their child in such a school or say that it was not the kind of school they attended. My primary function, and that of the Department, is to make sure that no parent is deprived of a school place in the first instance and preferably a school place of their choice. Providing the accommodation in the first instance must be a priority.

The challenges, in terms of resources and the apparent poor level of modern technology to keep up with changes, has led to a significant backlog. It is reported that there is a backlog of 1,000 cases. I hope the Minister can comment on the matter. A court case was referenced in the article in The Sunday Times by the journalist, John Mooney. He referred to a case in Tipperary that was of a level 5 category, which is the most heinous type of child pornography. The case fell through because of the delays in coming to prosecution.There is significant concern in child protection sectors that anybody allegedly looking at level 5 child pornography would get off because of resource issues. Based on current resources, the reported backlog of more than 1,000 cases would take three years to clear. We need urgent assurance from the Minister that the technology, which apparently is antiquated, will be brought up to spec as soon as possible and that the necessary personnel resources will be deployed. The Minister, as a former Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, will appreciate we need to send a clear signal immediately that when we get intelligence, and apparently we receive intelligence on an ongoing basis from our international policing partners and the states with which we work on these matters, we have the ability to move quickly and act on this intelligence. We cannot have a situation where persons inclined to view the most heinous type of child pornography would have a sense they may get off due to resource or technology issues. Will we immediately address this? I call on the Minister to make a statement on the reports. I appreciate the Minister is new in the position and as such I will give her a fair wind. As these matters have been brought to her attention will she move to address them as soon as possible? Apparently two offenders were convicted in 2012, but in 2003 there were 38. I do not think anybody believes there has been a dramatic decline in these types of offences and due to the reports the concern is that there are resources issues in the computer crime investigation unit and the antiquated type of equipment with which it works. This is backed up by assertions of the Association of Garda Sergeants and Inspectors, AGSI, that we are losing the battle against these people who are serious threat to our society. I ask for urgent reassurance from the Minister.
#FrancesFitzgerald	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-party	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-dob	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-04 00:00:00	Visit of Mozambiquan Delegation	98	I thank the Deputy for raising this important matter and I am of course aware of the recent reports regarding the investigation of child pornography cases. At the outset let me assure the Deputy I am determined that we do all we possibly can to counteract the sexual exploitation of children. Very properly, we already have significant penalties for child pornography offences under the Child Trafficking and Pornography Act 1998. When this matter came to my attention, I immediately sought a report from the Acting Garda Commissioner on the question of any backlogs in this area, including with respect to proposals to address any difficulties which have arisen. As Deputies will appreciate, specific investigative strategies are a matter for An Garda Síochána but I consider it essential, as does the Deputy, that gardaí are in a position to investigate these crimes effectively. I have now received a preliminary report on the matter from the Acting Commissioner which addresses the role of the Garda computer crime investigation unit, CCIU, and its central input in the investigation of these kinds of crimes. A review of processes at the CCIU has been conducted with a view to reducing the time taken to conduct the forensic examination of suspect computer media in the context of seeking to identify evidence of child pornography images. Arising from this, and in the light of consultations with the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions and senior counsel, new standard operating guidelines were put in place in October 2013. The guidelines seek to ensure that relevant procedures are as efficient as possible, consistent with what is required to support effective prosecutions. I am further advised that all examinations of suspect media are now conducted according to these guidelines. The aim of the guidelines is to ensure effective action is taken in a timely way to deal with this issue. The phenomenon of Internet and computer crime, with its transnational dimension, presents enormous challenges to police forces. I am informed that approximately 70% of crime in this area is transnational. It is also challenging with respect to the deployment of resources to tackle this issue. It is complex, complicated and a continuously emerging area for An Garda Síochána to deal with and cuts across a number of other areas as well as child pornography. The Acting Garda Commissioner has directed an immediate comprehensive review and a strategic realignment of capacity to deal with crimes of this nature, including in the area of child pornography. This will involve liaison with international partners because so much of it is transnational and a key part is linking with partners in Europe and worldwide so national experts can come together to figure out the best collaborative approaches to deal with this type of crime. I welcome the important review done in this area by the Acting Garda Commissioner and following examination of the report which I received today, I intend to meet her to discuss the issues raised by the Deputy and, in particular, to ensure that child pornography cases are pursued rigorously and quickly. I will raise with the Acting Commissioner the points made by Deputy Mac Lochlainn in his contribution today. The challenges faced in detecting and prosecuting this type of computer crime are very real and are faced by law enforcement throughout the world. In more than any other area, however, when it comes to the shocking abuse of children that child pornography represents, I will be insistent that we come up with strategies to ensure these cases are dealt with in a timely way and that the various obstacles mentioned by the Deputy are overcome. I thank the Deputy for raising this issue. As I stated, I will meet the Acting Garda Commissioner shortly to discuss the detail of the report and see what are the implications for dealing with these cases quickly and effectively.

As I stated, what will be of profound concern to the public are reports that there is a possibility a person responsible for level 5 child pornography, which is the most heinous category, would not face the full rigours of the law due to an inordinate delay over a number of years in taking the case to prosecution. If there is a backlog of 1,000 cases my concern and that of the public is that there are more persons, who should face the full rigours of the law, who may get off through an alleged loophole. Will the Minister seek a summary of the cases and give assurance today with regard to timeframes? If there is a backlog, as reported, of 1,000 cases how quickly can we be assured it will be dealt with? When will the new technology be put in place? With regard to modern anti-encryption software, we know the technology deployed by the very important unit of An Garda Síochána is not up to spec in dealing with the issue. It is antiquated. When will the new equipment be in place? How many new personnel resources will be required? Will there be more people who may, if they go to court, get off because of inordinate time delays? What assurances can the Minister gave? Is she willing to give an update to the Houses in a few weeks regarding progress in this area?

There is no doubt the scale of the policing challenge is enormous when one considers all of the electronic storage devices which are seized by gardaí in contemporary investigations. They complete an average of 450 cases per year. If one looks at what is selling in the world of technology and computers, the fact that storage potential is getting much larger and the amount of work emerging in the area, it becomes clear that there are resource implications. While I am not in a position today to discuss any specific cases, I take the points raised by the Deputy. I will meet the assistant Garda commissioner who is looking at the strategic realignment of resources. I am happy to update the Deputy on the outcome of this. I will examine a number of cases and ascertain precisely what is happening on them at present.

I put into the Minister that Ireland is in the midst of a crisis in the health insurance market. It is undoubtedly experiencing a downward death spiral and an approximate average of 4,000 customers left the market each month in the year up to March 2014. Moreover, 21,000 people have left since the beginning of this year alone, that is, approximately 1,600 per week have quit during the first three months of this year. There has been a haemorrhaging of young and healthy customers from the market, which threatens the very sustainability of the health insurance market into the future, leading to much higher premiums for those who remain in the health insurance market, as well as creating huge pressures for the public health system as Members are aware and as is being experienced. In response to this, Government policy is incoherent. Insured patients are now subject to dramatically increased charges for public hospital beds - up to approximately €852 per night - which constitutes a dramatic increase. If one adds to this the significant curtailment of tax relief that was announced in this year's budget, overall one gets a Government charge of approximately €300 million. The Government has dipped into the pockets of private health insured people to the tune of approximately €300 million in recent times. All of this has had a dramatic impact and has accelerated further the exodus from the health insurance market itself. Meanwhile, the Minister, Deputy Reilly, peddles the mandatory universal health model, which is vague and uncosted. Incidentally, I note the Taoiseach failed to voice confidence in the Minister for Health yesterday, having been asked to so do.

From the point of view of the Minister for Health, his clear objective is to reform the current health system and to deliver a single-tier health service in which access to health care is based on need and not on the ability to pay. The Government is committed to the ongoing sustainability of the health insurance market as part of the transition to a market-based universal health insurance system. At the end of March 2014, some 2.3031 million people were insured with inpatient health insurance plans. While the number of people covered has fallen from a peak in 2008, Ireland continues to retain a high level of population holding voluntary private health insurance at 44.2%. The Minister for Health desires the best possible environment within which more people, particularly young people, will wish to obtain and retain private health insurance cover that is affordable, competitive and meets consumer needs. He intends to introduce shortly a series of measures to help to support the sustainability and competitiveness of the private health insurance market. This includes lifetime community rating to encourage people to join health insurance schemes at a young age and to retain their private health insurance cover. In addition, the Minister will announce shortly an initiative on mandatory discounts for young adults. The Government is committed to keeping affordable health insurance for as many people as possible. To this end, the Minister has made clear to the health insurers his belief that significant savings from within the industry can still be made, the effect of which can be to minimise the need for increases in premiums. The recently-published McLoughlin interim report on health insurance costs made recommendations in a number of different areas, including the important role of clinical audit in identifying unnecessary claims. Moreover, the need to address the age structure of the private health insurance market is also important. As I already mentioned, the Minister, Deputy Reilly, will provide further details on his plans in this regard shortly.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-04 00:00:00	Visit of Mozambiquan Delegation	112	I put it to the Minister that the market is no longer affordable for many people, particularly younger people, who are leaving the system in their droves. The situation was already critical enough but the Government added to the crisis by the measures it took in the budget. I do not simply refer to the restriction of tax relief but also to the increase in the cost and price of a public bed in a public hospital. This concerns people who were also paying their taxes but the bottom line is there is no confidence that the Minister has the capacity to sort this out. There is no confidence among Government backbenchers in the Minister or in his capacity to resolve this crisis. Indeed, members of the Labour Party have been saying openly for quite some time, over the past year and a half, that they did not think he was up to it. Although they did nothing about it-----

On the one hand, the Government seeks universal mandatory health insurance but, on the other, it is implementing policies that are driving people out of the market, such is the incoherence of the policy approach. Very few people on the Government side appear to have confidence in the Minister's capacity to resolve this. I do not know why the Government should believe that anybody else outside of Government or the realm of Government backbenchers should have some confidence.

When hundreds of thousands of people lose their jobs, they look at their expenditure patterns and one thing they inevitably give up is voluntary health insurance. The unemployed, as a result of the crisis Deputy Martin's Government caused, were the people who gave up health insurance. This happened in two ways, namely, through individuals making voluntary decisions and through people no longer at work losing out in the group schemes for health insurance that they enjoyed at work.

Táimid buíoch dó agus tá súil agam go mbeidh beatha agus sláinte aige. Last week in the Seanad the Minister for Health, Deputy James Reilly, stated that an issue had arisen concerning the commissioning of a report on maternity services in the west and in the north west. This report was carried out by a private consultancy firm called The Health Partnership, also known as DNF Health Partnership, a company with a long record of promoting privatisation of health services. There are very great concerns in the west and in the north west that this report, if implemented, could result in the closure of maternity services in that region. Is the Minister aware that the founder and 50% shareholder of this private consultancy firm was appointed by the Minister for Health, Deputy James Reilly, as chairperson of the west-north west hospitals group, a major State public health body? Does the Minister accept that this is a significant conflict of interest? Surely it is not appropriate that a major player in a private health consultancy firm that promotes privatisation of health services is appointed as the chair of a major public health body. The Minister for Health has admitted that the commissioning of the report by this health partnership was not in accordance with HSE national financial regulations. Will the Minister for Health be called fully to account for making this appointment? Will the chair of the west-north west hospitals group be asked to stand down?

On the issue raised by the Deputy, this is a rather small country and people have different roles to play at different times in their careers and sometimes there can be an appearance of conflict. As I understand, no conflict occurred in this case but I do not have an extensive brief on it so the best I can offer the Deputy is to get back to him on the issue in due course when I request a further brief from the Department of Health.

How can he decide that no conflict occurred in this case when he has said that he has not been briefed on this matter? These revelations are very serious and they expose once again, in my opinion, the unsuitability of the Minister for Health and also they expose the Government's gross mismanagement of the public health service. It does not matter what is the size of the State. We have just witnessed the shameful removal of discretionary medical cards from citizens who need them - one shameful act following another shameful act. I ask for the Minister's opinion on whether the report into the reconfiguration of maternity services in the west and the north west can be relied upon as an independent and fully accountable report, given that it was brought about by this private consultancy firm which promotes the privatisation of health services. Perhaps he could tell me whether the Government will ask for this report to be withdrawn immediately. Does he agree that the chairperson of this west-north west hospitals group should review his position? Should the Minister for Health consider his position? What is the nature of the relationship between the Minister for Health and the chairperson of the west-north west hospitals group? After all, the Minister for Health appointed this person. Does the Government retain confidence in the Minister for Health?

I am hoping that the Minister may have had a chance to send someone along to the picket lines at Shannon to talk to the workers there and to understand why, for the first time in many years, over 1,000 workers believed they had no alternative but to engage in industrial action last week, an action which saw the virtual grounding of the Aer Lingus fleet with 200 flights cancelled. I put it to the Minister last week in the House that how he would deal with this dispute would be one of the first measures of the post-election tests of this Government to determine whether it had listened to people. I do not think he has done a great job of it. Last week the company initially announced it would meet the workers, the first time after refusing to do so for three years, but no date was set and the strike went ahead. Last night insult was added to injury when on the eve of the so-called bilateral talks supposedly to resolve the issues, letters were sent to workers' homes intimidating them and withdrawing their staff privileges. This is hardly the antics of a company that wanted to resolve anything. It is like a husband agreeing to go to relationship counselling and then kicking his wife around the kitchen the night before. It is outrageous, bully-boy tactics by management and the Minister has stood by in silence and done nothing about it. In my opinion, lack of action condones such antics. These actions by management were outrageous, particularly in the context of the weekend's goading and clamouring for such action by Michael O'Leary, the poster boy of anti-trade unionism-----

Does the Minister wish his Government to be synonymous with this type of employment, the type of employment in Ryanair where nobody is directly employed, people are hired and fired at will, with no promotions, no pensions and no progression because nobody stays long enough? The Minister and the staff are the biggest shareholders in Aer Lingus. Sitting on the fence is not good enough any longer. What is he going to do to preserve workers' legitimate and laudable expectation to be able to do their work in a manner which respects their work-life balance?

The action taken by the workers on this occasion was disproportionate. I defend the rights of workers to take industrial action but I think it was disproportionate at the bank holiday weekend to discommode 30,000 ordinary people who had plans to have a break at the weekend by flying out of the country. The action was disproportionate. I said that to the Deputy last week and I repeat it this week. I also said that the way forward is to use the industrial relations machinery of the State, if it can be helpful to bring the two sides together. This dispute should be resolved, as industrial disputes are resolved, by talking and by compromise and by coming to a solution. I do not think it achieves anything to have a tirade against one side when there are two sides to every industrial dispute. At the end of the day, management and the representatives of the workers will have to sit down and resolve this dispute and they should do so sooner rather than later without discommoding the Irish public further.

The combined shares held by Aer Lingus staff and the Government account for a majority shareholding in the company. As such, the Government is not an idle bystander in the current dispute. In stating that it would be useful for the parties involved to use the industrial relations machinery of the State, the Minister did not pass comment on the consistent refusal of management to do so. I will put to the Minister two issues that have been put to me by workers. The first is from a cabin crew member, Una, a woman with 16 years' service who addresses the Minister's point about the dispute. She states that she is proud to be standing up for what she knows is right and that she needs her job and therefore needs conditions to be sustainable. She states the company makes staff feel like it does not want them but this, she adds, is hard to explain in an e-mail. She also states that staff are nervous about the action and do not want to ruin people's holidays. It is heartbreaking for everybody, she adds, but having been told to stand up to bullies, that is what staff must do. The Government is not on the sidelines in this dispute, which is difficult for the workers involved.

Is it unreasonable for people to ask to work in a more family friendly way? If that is not an unreasonable request, what is the Minister doing about it?

However, I am also very sorry for 40,000 ordinary Irish people who had planned an inexpensive holiday abroad in early June and were prevented from travelling by an industrial dispute which was, on the face of it, disproportionate given that there is industrial machinery in place that could assist in resolving this dispute. That is my position. I appeal again to both sides to talk out their differences and come to a satisfactory resolution. Many people take holidays in June because their children are not doing examinations. While the families of children who are doing examinations cannot travel, other children in secondary school are on holidays in June when it is less expensive to travel than it is in July or August. Many of them take the opportunity to do so. Individual cases are always sad and I am not criticising the Deputy for raising an individual case. However, there are 30,000 other individual cases involving people who were not able to take what was probably a well deserved holiday as a result of the industrial dispute.

The Order of Business went a bit quicker than I expected. The amendment relates to amendments of Part 3 of the Bill where a narrow definition of human rights is used, in terms of enforcement issues but also on a wide range of other functions of the human rights commission. The narrow definition would overly restrict the commission in carrying out its role. The amendment seeks to retain the narrow definition for sections 36 to 39, inclusive, and section 41 which relate to the enforcement role of the commission and to allow the broader definition of human rights, as contained in the Bill, to apply to such roles and functions as the providing of information to the public, the development of codes of practice, equality reviews, action plans and carrying out inquiries. This would be a better interpretation to use within the Bill and would allow the commission to work to its full capacity.
#FrancesFitzgerald	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-party	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-dob	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-04 00:00:00	Visit of Mozambiquan Delegation	229	These two proposed amendments relate to the definitions of human rights in the Bill and were discussed at length on Committee Stage. The definition in section 2 gives the commission a mandate to promote human rights in the widest sense, not limited to Irish law or to conventions that we have ratified, or, indeed, to any existing international convention. The commission can seek to develop and promote new human rights standards and its discretion in that regard is unfettered. The definition in section 29 deals with legal or enforcement powers and, accordingly, it is appropriate that it refers exclusively to human rights that are recognised in Irish law. I should mention again that the Department met the Office of the Deputy High Commissioner for Human Rights, ODHCHR, in October 2012 as part of the consultative process with that office following publication of the general scheme of the Bill. At that meeting, the Department explained that the rationale of having two separate definitions was to give the new body every possible freedom to work towards the enhancement of the human rights environment in Ireland. There have also been calls for one unified definition of human rights in the Bill. Of course, human rights are indivisible and inviolable but the technical device of having two definitions does not challenge that principle in any way. If we had to have just one definition, it would have to be a narrow definition and be confined to Irish law because we cannot give the commission or any other State agency legal or enforcement powers in respect of matters that are not part of Irish law. I believe one narrow definition would be a retrograde step because the commission would lose much of its ability to be creative in the promotion of human rights. However, what we can do, as set out in the Bill, is give the commission the freedom to promote human rights on as broad a basis as possible, and reflect new normative developments at an international level in its work. In doing so, we have to be clear that its mandate in monitoring compliance with specific human rights standards is limited, as it must be, to those enshrined in Ireland's legislative framework in accordance with the rule of law. The intention is to allow the commission to be creative in its promotion of human rights principles as broadly understood, but to observe the rule of law in the area of enforcement of standards. The ODHCHR noted that this approach seemed very close to how the High Commissioner for Human Rights sought to describe her own role, relating to the protection of clearly defined rights and the promotion of broader human rights principles. The ODHCHR stated that the two definitions approach is a new best practice model which it will encourage other member states to adopt. The effect of the Deputy's amendment would be to take sections 29 to 35, inclusive, and section 40 out of the enforcement and compliance definition - the narrower definition - of human rights we have in section 29 and into the broader definition in section 2 that relates to wider promotion of which spoke. I will take a number of the sections, if the Deputy will bear with me, and state what the impact would be of doing that. For example, section 29 contains the enforcement and compliance definition. Acceptance of the amendment would create a logical problem because we would be saying that the phrase "human rights" in section 29 means both. This would make for legal uncertainty and some confusion about what the Bill actually means. Section 30 relates to provision of information about and keeping under review of Irish legislation on human rights and equality. Legislation on human rights falls logically within the narrower definition in section 29, but there is no restriction on the commission in how it keeps legislation under review or what recommendations it may make. Subsection (2) states that the commission may make such recommendations as it sees fit. Clearly, information to the public is information about what our domestic legislation contains, but there is nothing to stop the commission providing also an individual person or the public generally with information about relevant international instruments that are not part of our law or expressing the view that our legislation needs to be updated. The commission can provide information on the detail of legislation but, equally, is in a position to make the broader reference to what the international situation might be or where the law might go in the future. Indeed, subsection (2) makes it explicit that the commission has an entirely free hand in making recommendations for changes in the law. On the impact of Deputy Pringle's amendment on section 31, when signed into law by the Minister a code of practice can be relied on in court proceedings and used in evidence. It would be ultra vires for me or any other Minister to sign into law a statutory instrument that goes beyond what Irish law allows or requires. To do so would destroy the credibility of the idea of having statutory codes of practice that can be relied upon by both parties to a potential dispute.We have one code of practice, for example, on sexual harassment, and I think there is room to use this mechanism more in the future. This only works, however, if we all understand that the commission is giving advice on best practice within our legal framework as it exists and the Minister is signing that advice into law. This is not a device that can be used to legislate by the back door for international legal instruments that have not been ratified by the national parliament. I think the Deputy will appreciate that. Taking sections 32 to 34, inclusive, the words "human rights" are not found in any of these sections. The sections are in Part 3, because they relate to enforcement and compliance matters. They are covered by the narrower definition in section 29 simply as a matter of legal neatness. By that I mean, it is easier for anyone following the Bill if one definition applies to Part 3 and another applies to the rest of the Bill. However, in fact, the two definitions of human rights are not actually relevant to these particular sections. Section 35 deals with inquiries. The power of inquiry set out in this section is a serious power, including the power to demand the attendance of witnesses and production of documents. It is based on the understanding that it could never be permissible to conduct an inquiry where there is no allegation or reasonable belief that a breach of statutory duty has occurred. That is why the narrower of the two definitions of human rights in the Bill applies here. It could not be permissible in law for the commission to conduct an inquiry without it having expressed any reasonable belief or made any credible accusation that standards demanded by Irish law had been breached. The Irish Human Rights Commission has confirmed to my Department that the three inquiries undertaken by the commission were undertaken with the tacit agreement of the parties, probably could not have been undertaken without that tacit agreement and were in each case grounded, inter alia, on the European Convention on Human Rights which comes within the narrower definition. In the course of the inquiry, however, and in its conclusions and recommendations, the commission may consider best practice and international standards, and in that regard is free, in this instance, as well, to draw from wider definitions of human rights and of equal treatment than are currently set out in domestic legislation. What it cannot do is launch an inquiry into something that it, as the commission, does not consider or allege is a breach of applicable Irish law. Section 41, which would be impacted by the amendment, relates to the provision of legal assistance to a person who wishes to institute legal proceedings in a matter involving human rights law. I think the amendment would not really change this or achieve anything useful. The commission is free to offer such assistance if it thinks, and, of course, if the would-be plaintiff thinks, there is an arguable case involving law or practice relating to human rights. Neither has to prove the case. That is what the court hearing is for. The courts will not entertain a case which seeks to rely on something that is not part of Irish law and does not make any effort to ground the action in the Irish Constitution or the European Convention on Human Rights, to which we are a party and which is part of the narrower definition, or in our domestic legislation. Changing the definitions here will not change that reality. There is, of course, nothing to stop the commission, once the threshold of having an arguable case has been crossed, from supporting an applicant in referring to other international standards and in drawing the court's attention to the State's wider international obligations, including in respect of international conventions we have signed but not ratified. However, the commission cannot legislate or take any action to enforce rights for which the Oireachtas has not legislated. By dealing with each of those sections, I hope I have clarified why I am not accepting the proposed amendment. In places it could create possible legal uncertainty with the text and in others it would create substantial problems about the constitutionality of the Bill. I am opposing the amendment, therefore, and I hope the Deputy will understand the reasons I am doing so.

Pursuant to the Good Friday Agreement, an international agreement of which this Government is a co-guarantor, the Irish Government will take steps to further strengthen the protection of human rights in its jurisdiction. The Government will bring forward measures to strengthen and underpin the constitutional protection of human rights. These proposals will draw on the European Convention on Human Rights and other international legal instruments in the field of human rights and the question of the incorporation of the ECHR will be further examined in this context. The measures brought forward would ensure at least an equivalent level of protection of human rights as will pertain in Northern Ireland. In addition, the Irish Government will—(a) maintain and promote a Human Rights Commission with a mandate and remit equivalent to that within the North of Ireland, and(b) continue to take further active steps to demonstrate its respect for the different traditions in the island of Ireland.".Sinn Féin has a fundamental difficulty with this Bill. As the Minister will be aware, our concerns are that it undermines the Good Friday Agreement. When we from this State would ask those within unionism to support the Good Friday Agreement and implement it in full, particularly the human rights dimensions and to have a Human Rights Act in the North, the fact that we have amalgamated our Human Rights Commission with the Equality Authority does not put us on a very strong platform to lecture them about their responsibilities. This amendment is aimed essentially at respecting the Good Friday Agreement and it is a challenge to the Bill. It lays out our fundamental and most serious concerns about this legislation. Rather than strengthening the State's human rights and equality framework, this is just about saving money. It is about describing or labelling important institutions that protect the human rights and equality of citizens of this State as quangos. We are told they have to be amalgamated because there are too many quangos, but that is deeply unfortunate. A number of years ago, the Equality Authority's budget was slashed by 34%. That led to the resignation of the authority's widely respected chairman. There is a fear and concern that the protection of citizens' human rights has been undermined and that this Bill is unfortunately another step in that direction. Primarily, this amendment is about our concerns over the Good Friday Agreement. The Bill will undermine the Government when it seeks unionism to implement and meet its responsibilities.

The position remains that the text in amendment No. 2 is technically inappropriate for legislation. If the Government were to take forward actions on the lines suggested, these would either be matters for policy and allocation of resources or otherwise issues that would need to be addressed in legislation. However, one does not put into legislation that the Government should bring forward proposals that may require legislation. Instead, we just get on with implementing the policy programme of the Government of the day and where this requires legislation, such legislation is brought forward. In this case, as the Deputy said, we are merging the Equality Authority and the Irish Human Rights Commission. My predecessor consulted the then Northern Ireland Secretary of State around the time this proposal was announced. I can assure the House that there are no adverse implications for our commitments under the Good Friday Agreement or for our relationship with Northern Ireland. Equivalence of protection relates to substantive human rights law and not to questions of institutional structures, which will always operate differently in different jurisdictions. Our body of human rights law under our Constitution is at least equivalent to that which exists in Northern Ireland. In that regard, the proposed amendment is devoid of substance. I do not agree with the basic points the Deputy is making in the amendment. The merger will create a body that is greater than the sum of its parts. It will be better equipped by this Bill, once enacted, and by the additional staff and financial resources that have been put in place for 2014, to protect both human rights and equality rights in a cohesive way. The extra funding of €2 million for staff in 2014 shows that the extra support is there for the new commission.While I acknowledge there is a change and there are different points of view on the changes being enacted, the goal is to have a very strong regime for the protection of human rights. The merger will create a body that is greater than the sum of its parts and that will be very well equipped to deal with the issue the Deputy rightly raised, namely, the importance of human rights both North and South.

The amendment separates the two phrases "to work towards the elimination of human rights abuses, discrimination and prohibited conduct" and respecting diversity and "the freedom and dignity of each person" to avoid giving the mistaken impression that one is subservient to the other, a concern that was raised on Committee Stage. The amendment clarifies the issue. There was concern that there could be confusion and a hierarchy of rights. The reference to respecting diversity and the freedom and dignity of each person is important in that it recognises that we exist in an increasingly diverse society where acceptance of difference and the rights and freedoms of other people is a cornerstone of the liberties and democracy we all enjoy. I hope the Deputy will accept this approach and will not press his amendment. The words remain but are separated to make it clear that they apply equally.

On Committee Stage I was concerned about whether the wording allowed freedom to discriminate as part of respecting the diversity and dignity of an individual. I am not 100% sure the wording deals with the issue. Can a person's "freedom and dignity" allow him or her to act in a prohibited way?

There is a concern that somebody who was involved in a human rights protest could be caught up under the wording "criminal offence". I ask that it be reconsidered. With this amendment, such a person would not automatically be excluded because he or she had been involved in a legitimate protest.

The case the Deputy describes would not necessarily be a criminal offence, unless there was assault. The amendment seeks to raise the threshold to conviction for an indictable criminal offence. The commission will have very significant powers in ensuring compliance with Irish human rights law. It would fatally damage the credibility of any person with such a powerful role were that person to be convicted for a criminal offence while in office. The wording "is convicted" in the Bill means convicted now or in the future and does not refer to past convictions. This means a person with a criminal conviction is not precluded from appointment. While such a conviction would be a factor to be considered in the selection process, a person would not be precluded from appointment by virtue, for example, of a youthful indiscretion or incident. The existing provision is appropriate to a human rights commission and I will not accept the amendment.

The commission will have its own Vote, although this is not a matter for this Bill but for administrative arrangements which are in train. On the commission’s financial independence, in our system money may be voted for a public body only on foot of a request from the Government. This is set out clearly in Article 17.2 of the Constitution, which states:Dáil Éireann shall not pass any vote or resolution, and no law shall be enacted, for the appropriation of revenue or other public moneys unless the purpose of the appropriation shall have been recommended to Dáil Éireann by a message from the Government signed by the Taoiseach.We are all very familiar with this. Within this constitutional imperative, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform’s consent is required for any allocation of public funds and a Minister of the Government – in the case of IHREC the Minister for Justice and Equality – must take political responsibility for the allocation and be answerable to this House for the amount allocated. There have been calls for the commission to receive its funding directly from the Oireachtas. While this is not possible, we have put arrangements in place to ensure the commission is fully independent while conforming to our constitutional system. Having its own Vote and having its director as Accounting Officer are important further innovations in that regard. There is no departmental involvement in day-to-day expenditure decisions by the Equality Authority and the Human Rights Commission, and there will be no such involvement in the new body to be established by this Bill.

Senior level posts in the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission are never to be filled by secondees from government departments.”.What this amendment seeks to achieve is fairly self-explanatory, and it is to ensure, in as much as is possible, the independence of the new body. It should not be a matter of Department officials being seconded to this new body so we are trying to put a ceiling on the number of people who may be seconded to the new human rights and equality commission, as well as overall human rights institutions. This particularly applies to senior positions.

Section 24(6) of the Bill allows for temporary engagement by the commission of staff of other organisations but prohibits such temporary postings from being on a secondment basis by providing that such persons shall be under the direction and control of the commission rather than the current employer. The following might be helpful in understanding why we are not accepting this amendment; put simply, the Bill does not allow for any secondment to the commission. This is a clear policy decision to go beyond what is required by the Paris Principles and the amendment would actually weaken the separation of the commission from the Government by allowing secondment of senior civil servants to the commission, something which the Bill as published does not allow to happen. On the basis of the explanation, the Deputy might reconsider his approach to the amendment.

The job description for the position as advertised by the Public Appointments Service includes key responsibilities, and Deputies are very familiar with them. The person shall act as chairperson of the commission and its committees as appropriate and ensure that the commission operates as a collegiate body; provide strategic leadership to the commission, including leading on the development of the strategic plan and the strategic plan cycle; represent and act as the public voice of the commission, including participation in relevant national and international forums; and support and supervise generally the director in the exercise of his or her statutory functions and the day-to-day administration of the commission’s business. An outstanding individual is sought to become chief commissioner and this person should be able to give strategic direction to the work of the IHREC. He or she should also be able to unite and lead a team of commissioners from diverse backgrounds and forge good working relations with partner organisations across the public, private and voluntary and community sectors. The Attorney General has advised that these are too detailed for inclusion in legislation and could prove to be too restrictive if they were included. It is better to leave day-to-day decisions about which member of the commission is best placed to handle specific tasks to the discretion of the commission as a body corporate. That said, we thought it useful to provide that the chief commissioner should set out his or her personal key priorities and objectives for his or her term of office as part of the commission’s strategy statement. That is the right approach as the statement will be laid before the House. The approach I am recommending in this amendment therefore gives an opportunity for the chief commissioner to engage directly with the committee on what his or her personal contribution and priorities will be. This will be laid out for the term of office or the life of the particular strategy statement. This amendment allows for increased engagement by the commission with the Parliament through work in committees. The priorities of the commissioner will be laid out clearly, which will lead to more effective discussion on how the strategic plan may go.

We are asking that the commission should be "reasonably sufficient" by itself rather than with the consent of the Minister.
#FrancesFitzgerald	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-party	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-dob	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-04 00:00:00	Visit of Mozambiquan Delegation	248	I should say that it is a good try. Most bodies would like that but the idea is somewhat problematic in view of what I stated regarding the Constitution earlier. In our system, money may only be voted for a public body on foot of a request from the Government. Within that constitutional imperative, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform’s consent is required for any allocation of public funds and a Minister – which in the case of IHREC is the Minister for Justice and Equality – must take political responsibility for that allocation and be answerable to this House. No State body, no matter how important its work, can be given a guarantee of receiving all the funding it regards as sufficient. This could vary from time to time. The current language of the Bill is stronger than one would often find in similar language in legislation. There is reference to "reasonably sufficient", although it is not what the Deputy desires, but that is not found in the legislation relating to any comparable State agency. This recognises the work of the commission as resources can be an issue. This text is a recognition that this commission is in a special position and we have gone as far as is constitutionally permissible to protect funding, which is effectively what the amendment is trying to do. We have gone as far as we can to put in a wording that is quite robust compared to what would normally be in legislation. If a future Government should decide to impose disproportionate cuts on our human rights and equality bodies, that is an issue for political resolution in this House and elsewhere, but it cannot be solved in advance by this amendment or any other form of words that one might wish to put in legislation. We need to ensure the best cross-party support for these issues, and I acknowledge the cross-party support that we have seen with the development of the new commission. I will oppose the amendment on that basis.

These are all continuations with little substantive change of existing provisions in the Employment Equality Act 1998 and as such, they form part of our EU equality law obligations. This is so on the basis of provisions in the relevant directives that prohibit a regression in existing standards of protection. This obligation exists even though these provisions have not been used in recent years in practice. Section 33, to which the amendment relates, provides that, in connection with preparing either an equality review or an equality action plan, the commission may serve a substantive notice on a person to supply information with regard to an equality review or action plan. Such a notice may also be served if an undertaking fails to implement the requirements of an equality action plan as outlined in section 32. This section also provides an opportunity for an undertaking to appeal such a notice and a penalty for failure to comply, other than in the case of a successful appeal being lodged. The notice takes effect, and has the force of law, after the expiry of 56 days, but a person can appeal within 42 days to the Labour or District Court as appropriate. In the current legislation, notices take effect after 42 days, but 42 days is also the deadline for taking an appeal. Following consultation with the Equality Tribunal, the length of time for taking an appeal in relation to this section remains unchanged, but the period of time after which a notice takes effect is being extended to 56 days. This is to avoid a situation where an appeal is lodged on the last day possible and on the immediately following day the Commission, which may not have notice of the appeal, commences enforcement action. Such legal confusion is to be avoided if at all possible. It is good practice to leave a "gap" and two weeks seems a reasonable length of time and not excessive. This change in the Bill was made following consultation with the Equality Tribunal and I hope the Deputy will accept that.

The Government must also ensure that adequate budgets and resources are made available for them to carry out their duties.

I do not need to speak here about the challenges of different levels of expenditure for various agencies or EU obligations, and the decisions we have to make in that respect, day in, day out. Resources are limited and additional expenditure demands or costs, arising for whatever reason, will have to be paid for through expenditure reductions elsewhere, or through the raising of additional revenue. These are challenging issues in respect of the allocation of resources. The amendment does not change that reality and will not be of any help to this Government or any future Government in making difficult decisions on allocation of resources.

The Government would make the choices that had the least negative impact. If public bodies human rights proof policies and decisions that will inform their decision-making. If the Government is faced with a choice between a decision that has a negative impact on human rights and one that does not, with the same financial bother, it can decide on that basis. It is an important principle, that public bodies should respect human rights in our society. Strong consideration should be given to this principle.

It aims to provide a mechanism whereby when the commission feels that public bodies have failed in their positive duty it can ensure they comply with the requirements under the Act. On Committee Stage the former Minister said that the threat of being brought before an Oireachtas committee should be enough to ensure a public body complied with the human rights legislation. In the past week or two we have seen how serious that threat is when Secretaries General of Departments can come before a committee and stonewall and not answer any questions. The threat of being brought before an Oireachtas committee is not enough of a deterrent to ensure that public bodies comply with their obligations. There does have to be some enforcement measure to ensure compliance. In the UK, where regular reviews are carried out, public bodies do not believe that any of their duties cause them to take action which is disproportionate to the benefit of those delivered. They accept that they must comply and there is no additional cost. On Committee Stage the former Minister raised the cost of doing this. The bodies covered in the UK believe that their required duties are effective and positive. We need an enforcement mechanism.

The commission will assist public bodies to comply with that positive duty, including by producing guidelines and codes of practice, which will be very helpful, as outlined in section 31. Those guidelines and codes of practice should lead, as they develop, to higher standards in all public bodies in the implementation of human rights and good practice.

#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-04 00:00:00	Visit of Mozambiquan Delegation	260	I move: "That the Bill be now read a Second Time." Just over three years ago in the programme for Government, we pledged to change the social welfare system to make it fairer, better structured, more transparent and less open to abuse. We pledged, among other things, to provide a fit-for-purpose system, provide better services, remove poverty traps and, critically, focus on providing opportunities for jobseekers. In the Social Welfare Bills I have introduced over that time, many significant structural reforms and changes have been implemented, as acknowledged by the European Commission, the IMF and similar institutions. These reforms have helped us maintain a very strong social welfare safety net, despite being in an EU-IMF bailout programme up to the end of last year and having to reduce State expenditure to get the public finances in check. Research conducted by the Economic and Social Research Institute, in tandem with my Department, and published last December shows that approximately 87% of all households in Ireland receive social transfers, such as jobseekers' payments, pensions and child benefit. We pay child benefit in respect of every child, we have a strong support system for those unfortunate enough to lose their job and we have a State pension structure that has dramatically reduced pensioner poverty. Ireland's system of social transfers remains the most effective in the EU in reducing poverty and is far superior to that of the other countries most affected by the crisis. The fact we maintained this safety net throughout the worst financial crisis this country has ever seen is one of the key reasons we are now emerging on the other side and I am not the only one who believes this. In its Society at a Glance 2014 report on Ireland, which was published earlier this year, the OECD said: "Income losses in Ireland would have been far greater without a functioning and adequately resourced social protection system". It also said that the "focus now needs to be on helping people get off benefits and back into work". This is precisely what the Department is doing. Since coming to office, I have focused on transforming the Department from a passive benefits provider to an active and engaged public employment service through the Pathways to Work strategy. Through Pathways to Work, we are getting people back to work and that is the single best way of reducing welfare expenditure. Every 10,000 people we help to leave the live register saves approximately €95 million in welfare expenditure per year. That in turn creates the room to protect key services, supports and schemes in other areas of the Department. People at work, through their taxes and PRSI, fund the system safe in the knowledge that it will be there for them or their families when they need it. We need to thank the people at work who are paying the taxes and contributing the PRSI for this system which ensure we have adequate social safety nets. This is a key element of the social bargain and I am grateful that the public has continued to support a very strong social protection system in Ireland when the mood in some other countries has been notably different. However, to maintain that public support, it is essential that we ensure every euro of the welfare budget is properly spent and where fraud or error arises, that we recover the overpayments as appropriate. In this Bill, I am building on the reforms made to date to further improve the system, safeguard its sustainability and ensure Ireland continues to have a very strong welfare state to protect those who need it. I have introduced a comprehensive package of changes in the area of fraud and control over the past three years. Effective debt recovery is a key aspect of the Department's control policy as outlined in the new compliance and anti-fraud strategy 2014-18, which I launched in April this year. It is an integral part of the deterrent approach to control fraud and error. It ensures that people who have been overpaid realise they have a responsibility to repay and that the Department will take appropriate steps to obtain recovery. I make no apologies for this, because it ensures that the social welfare budget is there for those who need it most. Most social welfare customers receive only the payment to which they are entitled. However, where overpayments arise, whether through fraud or error, it is essential that these moneys are recovered. The Department now has greater powers to recover money that has been erroneously paid out or claimed fraudulently. In 2012, I introduced legislation which allows for up to 15% of the personal rate of the person's social welfare entitlement to be deducted where there is an outstanding overpayment. Last year, I introduced additional powers for the recovery of social welfare overpayments by way of notice of attachment to earnings and-or money held by an overpaid person in a financial institution. This measure was designed to improve the Department's ability to recover overpayments from persons with disposable assets or earned income and who are generally no longer dependent on social welfare payments. The Bill further extends the powers of the Department to recover social welfare overpayments. Notice of attachment provisions are being extended to allow recovery from payments being made or to be made by public bodies such as Departments. In this way, we can ensure that one arm of Government is not paying out lump sums to individuals who owe significant amounts of money in respect of welfare overpayments.  I am also bringing in changes to ensure that money can be recovered from employers or former employers. It is the responsibility of an employer to make statutory redundancy payments to its eligible employees. Where the employer cannot afford to make these payments, lump sum payments can be made by the Department from the Social Insurance Fund. This creates a debt against the employer for the amount paid and I am now proposing that these debts be recovered by deduction from any refund of employer PRSI to which that employer may be entitled. I firmly believe that all possible steps should be taken to recover moneys due to the Department and these measures will add to the measures I have already put in place to achieve this.  These new powers have significantly improved the Department's ability to recover moneys from individuals who do not make reasonable efforts to repay their debt while having due regard to their financial circumstances. In 2012, just over €53.3 million was recovered in overpayments, while the amount recovered in 2013 was approximately €70 million. Bear in mind that free travel, for instance, which our pensioners in particular rightly value, costs the State approximately €77 million per year. The scale of the recoveries really allows certain vital areas to be supported financially.  I am also making changes to ensure that people must continue to be habitually resident in the State to receive certain social welfare payments. Until now an evaluation of the person's habitual residence was only made at the time of application. From now on, habitual residence may be reviewed after the date of award to ensure that residence conditions continue to be satisfied. Also, to clarify the application of the habitual residence test, the presumption that persons are not habitually resident in the State if they have not been present for a continuous period of two years in the common travel area at the date of making the application is being removed. This is what people often call the two-year rule.  I am also taking the opportunity in this Bill to transpose the provisions relevant to the social welfare code of EU Directive 2010/41 on the principle of equal treatment between men and women engaged in an activity in a self-employed capacity.The social welfare provisions of the directive mean ending the exclusion from social insurance of spouses or civil partners of a self-employed worker who participate in the activities of their self-employed spouse or civil partner performing the same or ancillary tasks. The effect of the provision is to allow those categories of worker access to social insurance for the first time. The majority of people who will be affected by the measure are women. It is particularly important that spouses - many of whom are women - of self-employed people, or self-employed farmers, will be eligible to have social insurance cover. In other words, this Bill will extend social insurance cover to spouses or civil partners of a self-employed contributor in cases where the spouse or civil partner is participating in the person's business and earning more than €5,000 a year. Up to now only one of the couple could be insured as a self-employed worker for social insurance benefits. This means that the spouse or civil partner will, under the social insurance system, be able to establish entitlement over time to maternity benefit, widow's, widower's or surviving civil partner's contributory pension and State pension contributory in their own right. This is a very important and welcome reform and will provide excellent value for those involved. I am very pleased to be able to introduce the measure. As the Actuarial Review of the Social Insurance Fund 2010 pointed out, social insurance benefits "offer excellent value for money" for the self employed. The review stated:The self employed achieve better value for money compared to the employed - when the comparison includes both employer and employee contributions in respect of the employed person. Self-employed contributions are charged at the rate of 4% of reckonable income over €5,000 or €253, whichever is the greater. Self-employed contributors who pay the minimum contribution of €253 and build up a sufficient contribution history to qualify for the State pension contributory are getting exceptional value for money. To put the matter into context, individuals paying at the minimum €253 per year over a full working life will receive a pension of €230.30 per week during retirement.I hope the measure will be availed of by the spouses of the self employed, especially as many of them are women. In this Bill I am also strengthening the residence requirements relating to entitlement to means-assessed social welfare payments by requiring the qualified adult of recipients of those payments to be resident in the State or not in prison in order for the qualified adult increase to be paid. This means that increases in jobseeker's allowance, pre-retirement allowance, supplementary welfare allowance, disability allowance or farm assist in respect of the qualified adult of the recipient will not be payable for any period during which the qualified adult is resident, whether temporarily or permanently, outside the State, or in prison or otherwise detained in legal custody. In regard to family income supplement, FIS, the Bill will ensure that, in general, once a family qualifies for FIS, payment of the supplement will continue for 52 weeks regardless of a change in circumstances, such as an increase in weekly earnings. As Deputies are aware, FIS is a weekly tax-free, top-up payment for employees on low pay with children. It is one of the major incentives and supports to people with children in low-paid work to bring up their income. At present, more than 44,000 working families with more than 98,000 children benefit from the scheme. The Department's spend on FIS will increase to more than €280 million this year - a 25% increase since 2012. I have placed a very high priority on FIS because all the evidence shows that families are better off in work and FIS helps them to continue in work and build towards financial independence. FIS is crucially important to working families, and the measure in the Bill is about ensuring that families in receipt of the supplement have security and peace of mind about the length of their payment - that it is a full 52 weeks. In the area of pensions, the Bill provides for an amendment to the Pensions Act to clarify the notification procedures on a direction from the pensions authority to the trustees of a pension scheme to restructure their scheme. I will table three amendments to the Bill on Committee Stage to allow for the implementation of the Youth Guarantee, to allow secondment of gardaí to the Department of Social Protection, to allow Irish Water to use PPSNs, and to facilitate the transfer of data on households with children to enable the provision of a water allowance for children in the context of the huge data we hold on child benefit. I will now outline the main provisions of the Bill. Section 1 provides for the Short Title. Section 2 defines a number of common terms. Section 3 provides for changes to enable functions relating to payment of benefit or assistance and related payment services to be provided under arrangements with selected payment service providers. Section 4 provides that only gains from share option transactions which result in the employee actually receiving shares will come within the definition of "share-based remuneration" in order to benefit from the exemption from employer PRSI liability. Section 5 clarifies the powers contained in the Social Welfare Consolidation Act 2005 enabling the Minister for Social Protection to provide for refunds of employer PRSI contributions in the case of certain seafarers employed onboard vessels that are registered in a member state of the EU or European Economic Area and are providing scheduled passenger services between ports within those states. Section 6 provides that where an employer has a debt owing to the Minister in respect of redundancy lump sum payments and the employer qualifies for a refund of PRSI contributions, the debt owing to the Minister can be recovered from the PRSI refund. The Redundancy Payments Act 1967 provides for lump sum payments by employers to their employees upon their dismissal by reason of redundancy. Where an employer does not pay such a lump sum payment to his or her employees who have been made redundant, the Redundancy Payments Act provides that such payments can be made by the Minister for Social Protection to the employee. The Minister can then recover such amounts from the employer. Section 7 provides that increases in jobseeker's allowance, pre-retirement allowance, supplementary welfare allowance, disability allowance or farm assist in respect of the qualified adult of the recipient will not be payable for any period during which the qualified adult is resident, whether temporarily or permanently, outside the State, or in prison or otherwise detained in legal custody. Sections 8 and 9 clarify the rules on entitlement to family income supplement and set out the circumstances in which a claimant who is living apart from his or her spouse or civil partner and children can still claim the supplement; and ensure that, in general, once a family qualifies for family income supplement, payment of the supplement will continue for 52 weeks regardless of a change in circumstances, such as an increase in weekly earnings. Section 9 also provides that where payment of FIS ceases to be paid to a family during the 52 week entitlement period and the family requalifies for FIS before the end of the 52 week period, then payment of FIS will recommence for the unexpired portion of the 52 week period at the rate that was payable at the start of the 52 week period. That is to facilitate people who might go in and out of employment. Section 10 provides for changes in respect of the application of the habitual residence condition, HRC, for entitlement to certain social welfare payments. The presumption that persons are not habitually resident in the State if they have not been present for a continuous period of two years in the common travel area at the date of making the application is being removed.In addition, a person must satisfy the habitual residence condition for the duration of his or her claim in order for entitlement to continue. This also allows for the review of habitual residence in respect of persons who were not required to satisfy such conditions under EU law at the date of application for the schemes concerned. Habitual residence is just one condition of these payments. A person must also satisfy other conditions to receive a payment. Section 11 provides for a number of amendments, consequential to the changes in section 11, to uncommenced provisions contained in the Social Welfare and Pensions Act 2008 relating to the transfer of responsibility for the blind welfare allowance scheme from the HSE to the Department of Social Protection. Section 12 is a minor technical amendment to correct an incorrect reference. Sections 13 and 14 extend the powers for the recovery of social welfare overpayments to include recovery from certain lump sum payments made by the Minister for Social Protection to that person, that is, refunds of PRSI contributions, lump sum payments made under the Redundancy Payments Act 1967 and the Protection of Employees (Employers' Insolvency) Act 1984. Section 15 extends the provisions relating to the recovery of social welfare overpayments by way of a notice of attachment to include situations where the person who has been overpaid has sources of income from payments made from State funds, for example, grants, refunds and repayment of tax. Section 16 provides for the transposition of Directive 2010/41/EU on the application of equal treatment between men and women engaged in self-employment activity, in so far as that directive relates to ensuring that the spouse or civil partner of a self-employed worker can benefit from social protection in accordance with national law. Section 17 provides for the deletion of three uncommenced amendments to the Social Welfare Consolidation Act 2005 which are no longer necessary. Section 18 provides for a number of minor amendments to the Social Welfare Consolidation Act 2005 to correct minor typographical and textual errors. Section 19 defines the term "Act of 1990", which is used for the purposes of Part 3, as meaning the Pensions Act 1990. Section 20 clarifies the detail to be provided by trustees to scheme members in the notification, including the right to appeal to the High Court in situations when the Pensions Authority issues or proposes to issue a unilateral direction to the trustees of a scheme to restructure a scheme. Section 21 provides for similar clarification regarding the notification of scheme members in advance of the Pensions Authority making a direction to wind up a defined benefit scheme. Section 22 amends section 50C of the Pensions Act to cross-reference the new section inserted. In the Bill, I am making a number of important changes to the social welfare system to ensure that money continues to be spent on those in genuine need, and every opportunity to recover money owing is explored and used. The requirement for a strong and sustainable welfare state has been a lifelong conviction of mine and despite inheriting the worst economic crisis the country has seen in modern times, the Government has maintained a strong sustainable welfare safety net to protect those who need it most. I firmly believe that the safeguarding of the very strong social welfare safety net helped preserve social cohesion throughout the crisis, which is now thankfully coming to an end as we have exited the bailout and seen a return to economic growth and a welcome surge in employment, but continued public confidence in the welfare system is essential to maintain it in the long term. This is why I am bringing forward the important changes in the Bill. In 2014, the Department of Social Protection will spend almost €20 billion in social welfare payments and will provide income support to approximately 1.4 million people every week. The simple truth is the Department will impact on almost every person in the State at some point in his or her life. We therefore have a great responsibility to our customers or clients, be they children, jobseekers, people with disabilities or pensioners, to ensure their entitlements are paid in full and on time. Equally, we have a responsibility to citizens to ensure their taxes are properly spent, and that the money is there to ensure the social protection system meets its obligation to protect those who need it when they need it. I commend the Bill to the House and I look forward to an informed debate and to hearing the views of Deputies on the measures contained in it.
#WillieODea	unknown-#WillieODea-party	unknown-#WillieODea-dob	unknown-#WillieODea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-04 00:00:00	Visit of Mozambiquan Delegation	261	One of the greatest myths perpetrated in Irish politics since the foundation of the State has been the notion that changes, or should I say reductions, in social provision for the past three and a half years have been dictated by the troika. We all know this is a gross distortion. The fact of the matter is that the members of the troika - I had occasion as part of my party's delegation to meet them several times - were and are interested in the bottom line and reaching certain financial targets. They were not unduly prescriptive about how the targets should be attained. For the past three and a half years the Government has chosen quite deliberately and consciously to reach these targets in a regressive manner. Progressive budgeting means taking more from those who can most afford it and taking least from those who can least afford it. What has been done for the past three and a half years is precisely the opposite. The greatest burden has fallen on those least able to afford it. The House need not take my word for this. Look at what Social Justice Ireland, an independent private organisation, has stated; look at the Government's own organisation, the ESRI, which has confirmed it; the United Nations has also confirmed it, as have the EU and the OECD, which the Minister quoted in her speech. They have all confirmed that the approach of the Government has been regressive in budgetary terms. The net result of these regressive budgets is that 16%, which is one in six, of our people are still at risk of poverty. This is despite the fact the income level by which one measures poverty risk has fallen. Approximately one quarter of the population experienced two or more enforced types of deprivation, the consistent poverty rate is almost 7% and approximately one in five children up to the age of 17 are in the risk of poverty category, which is double the OECD average. The basic social welfare rate for a single person is €25 per week below the internationally accepted poverty line. If one is under 25 this shortfall can reach as much as €113 per week. This is not a very attractive legacy. The changes to the jobseeker's allowance announced in the most recent budget mean the casual debasement of young people continues unabated. These changes were supposed to be introduced as some type of character building exercise to compel people, or encourage them very strongly if I can put it like that, to avail of employment opportunities, even though for every vacancy there are 30 applicants, or to take up a training place, even though the number of training and education places is grossly inadequate for those who need them. The reality is the sole and exclusive purpose of the changes was to speed those young people on their way to the nearest airport. The Minister has a technical amendment to enable the Youth Guarantee scheme to be brought into existence. I have no problem with the technical provision. The Minister has gained great publicity in various newspapers and electronic media from one end of the country to the other about her commitment to the so-called Youth Guarantee scheme and her great work at European level to get the EU to agree to it. On the other hand it is actions that count and not words. The Government has ring-fenced €14 million when all the experts state that a proper youth guarantee scheme, which would cost €6,000 to €7,000 per head for unemployed youth in Ireland, would cost something between €250 million and €300 million. In addition, the Government's treatment of the elderly has been contemptible. I could refer here to the fuel allowance, the emasculation of the free schemes, the abolition of the free telephone rental allowance, changes in pension entitlements that have made people worse off. Not to mention the abolition of the bereavement grant, the slashing of home help hours and the medical cards fiasco. In view of the Government's stated objective of encouraging lone parents to enter the workplace, its treatment of these people is quite incomprehensible. The amount one can earn and still receive the lone parent allowance has been progressively reduced. Therefore, the Government appears to be proceeding on the extraordinary proposition that the less a lone parent has to gain by going out to work, the more likely he or she is to go. It is unsustainable. I will not mention issues pertaining to respite care grants and so on, as I wish to turn to some of the Bill's provisions. While examining the contents of the Bill this morning, I noted an apparently innocuous section of the Bill, namely, section 3. It appears to be an innocuous technical section referring to amendments to amendments and to insertions of new sections and subsections into various items of legislation. However, this may be the most significant section in the Bill, albeit concealed in the appropriate legalese. The significant point about section 3 is that it provides for the amendment of section 242 of the principal Act, which is the Social Welfare Consolidation Act 2005. If one reads the appropriate section that is being amended in the aforementioned Act, it is interesting that it makes specific reference to An Post as the service provider for the Department of Social Protection. However, this legislation quite deliberately is taking out the reference to An Post and is replacing it with something called the payment service provider, whoever that may be. In other words, the way is being cleared to provide a payment system for social welfare other than through the traditional route, namely, post offices. This is despite the Government's repeated commitments to the Irish Postmasters Union and its various representatives, in public statements both inside and outside this House, that the post office network is safe and that the contract for the social welfare payment system will remain with the post offices, because this is absolutely necessary to preserve the post office network. Without the social welfare contract, the post office network will fall apart. While the Government has given repeated assurances that the network is safe, it is safe because the rock on which it rests - namely, the social welfare payment system - will remain as is. However, this legislation is deliberately clearing the way to change this, which gives the lie to many of the reassurances the Minister's colleague, the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, has given both inside and outside this Chamber. Consequently, Fianna Fáil will be opposing the section on Committee Stage. Sections 13 to 15, inclusive, deal with the collection of social welfare, and the Minister referred in her speech to the change she brought about which enables overpayments to be collected at up to 15% of the principal rate. When speaking here today, I do not refer to recovering overpayments that were made due to fraud, because more than 70% of overpayments are due not to fraud but to simple error. Sometimes, these errors were honest mistakes on the part of the individuals but, as often as not, they were on the Department's side. Even though last year's legislation specifically refers to collection of "up to 15%", there is compelling evidence that the Department of Social Protection is interpreting that provision differently. It is interpreting it as 15%. I have come across numerous cases through my constituency office in which the Department is insisting on a payment of 15%. Its representatives are stating that they are entitled to seek 15% and that is what they will take. I have encountered individual cases in which this has caused great hardship and appears to me to be a departure from the actual wording of the legislation under which the Department is operating. At the very least, Members require a commitment from the Minister to give a directive to the Department to exercise some discretion in this regard. A change being provided for in the Bill is that an overpayment can now be snatched back in a single lump sum by the Department from other social welfare moneys the Department may owe to the individual. Alternatively, an attachment order can be issued to snatch back the money in a single lump sum from moneys owed by another agency of the State, such as the Revenue Commissioners or the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine. I can envisage cases in which this will cause individual hardship. Again, I do not refer to people who defraud the Department of Social Protection, for whom I have no sympathy. I refer to people who find themselves in an overpayment situation due to simple error. There should be some element of choice in this regard. Members have been told it is the intention of the Department that this will only happen as a last resort, when the person who has been overpaid is proving to be unduly recalcitrant and is not dealing with the Department on a fair basis. However, if that is the Department's intention, why not spell it out in legislation? At present, as far as I can discern, several offices of the Department are choosing to interpret this part of the legislation in their own way. If it is the genuine intention of the Minister and the Department that this will be used as a last resort, this should be spelt out clearly and unambiguously. The Minister stated that she is delighted to introduce section 16. However, she is introducing it on foot of a European Union directive and Members have no choice but to introduce it. Having thought about it today since first reading it, I do not know how it will work in practice. As an example, one could takes a business which brings in profits of €80,000, owned by an individual whose wife works in the business performing ancillary tasks. If she is an employee who is being paid €20,000 or €25,000 per year, that is fine - PRSI can be paid in the usual way and the individual can get whatever benefits flow therefrom. If she is a 50:50 partner, that also is fair enough, because the profits can be allocated accordingly. Incidentally, while one can have types of partnership other than a 50:50 partnership, I believe the Department has an idea that partnerships must be on a 50:50 basis. However, if the person concerned falls into neither category - that is, is neither partner nor employee - will a certain sum of money be allocated to him or her? There is a reference to the necessity for such a person to be earning at least €5,000. If one is earning money, surely one is an employee? I really do not know how this will work in practice. However, this issue can be teased out on Committee Stage. The important point in respect of the self-employed is the failure of the Government, once again, to grasp the nettle and deal with the real problem. The Minister is well aware of a report gathering dust in the Department that points out that the contribution system and the benefits system for the self-employed are inadequate. The report contains many examples from throughout the OECD in which self-employed people can pay contributions to insure themselves against falling ill, becoming unemployed and so on. Such measures would encourage people to set up on their own. Ireland, in common with some obscure place such as Lithuania, is about the only country in the OECD that does not allow for this. The report recommends that the Government do something about it, whether by means of a compulsory system or a voluntary system - I favour the voluntary system - but if it is to be a compulsory system, so be it. There are differing views. The fact of the matter is that three and a half years down the line there has been a detailed report, representations from organisations representing the self-employed, and continuous and very well argued representations by my colleague on the social protection committee, Deputy Ray Butler from County Meath. I can only take the man at his word - he tells us he has received various commitments from the Minister - but three and a half years down the road, with time running out, still nothing has been done to deal with this fundamental flaw, nor is there any indication as to when, if ever, anything will be done. That is what real reform in this area should look like. Section 7 disallows increases for qualified adults if the qualified adult is incarcerated or abroad for a period of time. My understanding is that this is a repetition of previous legislation. I ask the Minister to explain if this changes the provisions in any material way. I have been advised by the Department that the previous legislation only refers to the principal, not the qualified adult. I am not quite sure that is correct; I will need some clarification from the Minister. Under the 2005 Act, where this provision previously appears, there was a commitment to draw up regulations. A situation cannot be allowed whereby if somebody's wife goes for a week's holidays, for example, the principal loses the adult dependant allowance for that period of two or three weeks. I would like to have sight of those regulations if they are in existence and I would appreciate a copy of them. I want to know whether any material change is being made. The adult dependant provision is already dealt with in the previous legislation, in my view. Again, this shows the complete reluctance to confront the notion of real reform in this area. For example, everybody knows that the three-day rule constitutes a poverty trap. In effect, the rule means that a person working 15 hours per week over three days might receive a significant jobseeker's payment whereas another person earning exactly the same amount and in exactly similar family circumstances, working for five days a week, is entitled to no payment. Is this fair? Surely the Minister is aware of the numerous representations and submissions made that the three-day rule should be replaced by an earnings-based system to take into account the realities of the modern labour market. However, any move to eliminate this obvious poverty trap would constitute real reform, which is the one thing we will not get.  I welcome the changes in the family income supplement in so far as they go. I still do not understand why, if a person's circumstances change materially for the better or worse during the 52-week period, the FIS cannot be adjusted accordingly. With respect to the structure of FIS, there have been numerous recommendations and submissions that FIS be changed because, as currently structured, it can constitute a poverty trap. This arises from the requirement that in order to qualify one must work at least 38 hours per fortnight. That means, for example, that a person earning €100 per week under the FIS threshold for his or her family size would receive an income support of €60 per week from the State - 60% of the difference - whereas a person with a smaller income and therefore a greater need for State support, working a half an hour less per fortnight, would get nothing at all. That is obviously wrong. I do not have to spell it out in any great detail in the limited time available to me. Why is this wrong not being confronted? The Minister announced to some fanfare that the habitual residence rules had changed. I think this provision will change very little. I refer to the programme for Government, which contains a reference to habitual residence:We will raise the issue of payment of Child Benefit in respect of non-resident children at EU level and seek to have the entitlement modified to reflect the cost of living where a child is resident.I asked the Minister for Finance on Leaders' Questions today whether this had been raised at European level and, if so, what the result had been. He informed me that I should not be asking him that question on Leaders' Questions because it was a matter appropriate for the Minister for Social Protection. I am asking the Minister that question now and she will have the opportunity to explain to me in her concluding reply. The Minister may correct me, but in my opinion the new provision means that any child benefit payment to a non-Irish national currently in receipt of benefit remains unaffected. It also means that the payment of child benefit to EU migrant workers whose children are living in their home countries remains unaffected. I need confirmation that I am correct on those matters. I refer to the previous Social Welfare and Pensions Bill 2013. I mentioned that sections 13 and 14, which provide for reckonable benefits and loss of earnings claims, would cause difficulties in practice, but I did lament the fact that we had not had time to discuss it properly. Now, for once, the Law Society has come to my rescue. It has made submissions to me and, I presume, to my colleagues. The society has provided concrete examples of how this provision could work horrendously in certain situations. I can say as a member of the legal profession that there is no doubt that it will be a powerful disincentive to out-of-court settlements. If anything is done in this country to disincentivise the practice of settling out of court then the whole system will grind to a halt. It has taken long enough already - although not as long as it used to take in certain circumstances - but if out-of-court settlements are disincentivised it will have horrendous consequences. I remind the House of the old adage that justice delayed is justice denied. There will be a hell of a lot of justice denied if this provision works out as envisaged and as it will work out. The Law Society has expressed this concern much more clearly, and, I am sure, more intelligently, than I could ever put it.  Those provisions have not been commenced yet, thank goodness. They were due to be commenced last month. I wish to ascertain the Minister's intentions in this regard. For example, will these provisions be reconsidered? Will the views of interested parties be sought? Will the new provisions - if these are to be reconsidered and recast - reflect the reality of claims settlements? Has the Department looked at what has been done in this regard in Northern Ireland, which seems to have an eminently more sensible scheme than the one we are trying to implement? The Bill contains a minor reform to pensions. As a result of this legislation, if a directive has come from the Pensions Board then the trustees are under an obligation to communicate that directive to their members. There are various provisions for people to go to court, for example. I refer to the Pensions Act 1990, which in my opinion contains that obligation. It is implied in the terms of the Pensions Act 1990. I have no objection to putting it down in black and white in legislation in specific form rather than saying it is there by way of implication.Where is the penalty? The legislation specifically states that the trustees are obliged to communicate this information to their members. From a reading of the section, however, it appears they will not face a penalty if they fail to do so. What is the point of introducing an obligation without penalties? The obligations on trustees provided for in various Pensions Acts, including the 1990 Pensions Act, are accompanied by specific sanctions for failure to comply. The position in respect of pensions extends beyond this relatively minor point. The major point is that a pensions crisis has been looming for some time. While the entire public sector is covered for pension purposes, only 50% of the population as a whole has pension cover. This means that employees in great swathes of the private sector do not have any pension cover and will rely completely on the State pension on retirement. As the dependency ratio decreases, as is forecast in all available projections, the current position will become steadily unsustainable. Anything I have seen by way of legislation or innovation from the Government for the past three and a half years has constituted a disincentive to people to provide pensions for themselves. Having changed the name of the Pensions Board, the number of members on the board and the title of its chief executive, the Government is now imposing on trustees an obligation to communicate with members that is not subject to any penalty or follow-up. What is being done to confront the major problem facing the country, namely, the need to provide a pensions structure that is financially sustainable and socially adequate? While various proposals and suggestions have been made and reports gather dust, the Government has decided to issue an ineffective directive to trustees and change the name of the Pensions Board. Nothing is being done to confront the real problem. I am aware that an election is taking place for the leadership of the Minister's party. Far be it from me to get involved in the internal affairs of another party, although I wish the Minister well on a personal level, but I cannot help noticing, given the blanket media coverage it is receiving, that the buzzword in the Labour Party leadership election is "change". The party is experiencing a catharsis as a result of the recent exercise of the franchise by the electorate, which means change is required. If one examines the Minister's record of change, however, one finds she has not changed anything of consequence. Defined benefit pension schemes are still in a mess and in terminal decline. No attempt has been made to place the national pensions scheme on a sustainable footing or allow the self-employed to insure against illness or unemployment, nor has any effort been made to deal with a major report that recommends recasting the entire system of child benefit. The Minister has not made any effort to confront real reform or make hard choices. Given the need to be balanced, I should point out that the Minister is certainly associated with change. When she entered office, for example, she found a system in place for providing free telephone rental allowance to vulnerable elderly people. She changed the system by abolishing it. She also emasculated the system of free electricity allowances, which were concentrated primarily on the elderly in an effort to target expenditure towards the vulnerable, by reducing the payment to approximately one third of its previous value. The Minister also reduced the period for which fuel allowance was paid from 32 weeks to 26 weeks per annum and drastically cut jobseeker's allowance for persons under the age of 25 years, much to their detriment. She changed pension rules to make pensioners worse off who had paid contributions for many years and readjusted child benefit downwards, despite having made specific promises to the contrary. The Minister changed the respite care grant by reducing it by 25% and cut the amount lone parents in receipt of social welfare payments can earn, thus creating a disincentive to work. She also changed the position whereby those who paid social insurance were entitled to a bereavement grant by simply abolishing this payment. Notwithstanding the administrative changes it introduces, what does the Bill do for social provision? The clue is on page 5 of the explanatory memorandum which, under the heading "Financial Implications", states the following: "The measures contained in sections 6, 13, 14 and 15 of the Bill to strengthen the powers to recover social welfare overpayments will lead to savings in overall social welfare expenditure." This is another cut and yet another missed opportunity.

This is, in the main, innocuous legislation. Its only urgent provision is in section 16, which deals with an EU directive from 2010 and, therefore, addresses an outstanding matter that was not addressed when other parts of the directive were adopted previously. I propose to discuss an issue to which Deputy O'Dea alluded and to which neither the Bill nor the explanatory memorandum explicitly refers, namely, An Post or, for that matter, post offices. According to the explanatory memorandum: "Section 3 provides for changes to enable functions relating to payment of benefit or assistance and related payment services to be provided under arrangements with selected payment service providers." When one trawls through social welfare and pensions legislation, including the principal Act of 2005, one finds that the purpose of this section is to delete all references to "An Post". The removal of references to An Post as the named service provider for social welfare payments could have devastating implications for the survival of local post offices. The Department has explained that this deletion is being made to remove the privileged position - those are the words it uses - of An Post in the consideration of service providers in future. This measure does not feature in any of the documents before us. There is nothing privileged about hanging on by one's fingertips, as many of our post offices are doing. An Post should have a principal position to reflect the important role local post offices play in the community. The post office network is crucial to the social fabric, especially in rural areas, but also in urban neighbourhoods. Post offices have played a key role in the anti-fraud measures of the Department and could probably play a greater role in this regard if all payments made by the Department were facilitated by An Post and its services. The removal of An Post's status creates the possibility of a multinational company, bank or other entity with no connection to our communities swooping in and acquiring the contract for social welfare payments. The manner in which the Minister has acted in this Bill opens up this possibility, which would not be in the best interests of those who receive payments, post office workers or the wider community. There is no reason we should not retain An Post as a preferred bidder, if one wishes, rather than removing all references to "An Post" and placing it on the same level as all other financial institutions and all that would entail.

We could also argue whether the new system he has introduced will add another layer of bureaucracy to a system which requires fewer structures, not more. When I was Minister, I inherited a strange mishmash of local and community development companies. Not all of the country was covered by the local development companies, LDC, programme and in some areas there were two companies operating. I simplified the system considerably to ensure one company would cover all of the territory of the State, that there would only be 53 companies that would be coterminous and, where suitable, a company’s boundaries would match those of a local authority. We also decided that many services, not only the social inclusion and Leader programmes, such as Tús, the rural social scheme, rural transport and FÁS schemes, could be run by these local companies. The local company would be a one-stop-shop in the delivery of State-funded community services. The Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government has, however, taken a different route. I accept, reluctantly, that in practical terms with the bringing forward of the legislation the LCDCs, local community development committees, are a reality. However, as the process progresses, it seems to have run into problems which are getting worse. Before we get into a total morass, it is time to stop, particularly the tendering process, and examine the difficulties created. The local authorities do not have the capacity to deliver all of these programmes which means that they will have to sub-contract the work to other companies. The system sees the LCDC making the decision on a Leader programme which will have the Department over it and, in turn, Brussels over it. Where we used to have three layers, we now have four. I accept that this is the way it will proceed and that there is nothing I can say that will change the Minister’s mind. However, I hope he will listen to reasoned argument and, before it is too late, consider making some changes to the delivery of the local and community development programmes.  I believe having one LCDC in some counties is not suitable. For example, should the city and county of Waterford and Limerick have one LCDC? From sheer geography, one would say having one LCDC for County Cork is not suitable. Traditionally, there were problems with the Gaeltacht in County Donegal, including the Inishowen Peninsula which is as large as County Louth. County Mayo was always split. In County Galway, there was one Leader company delivering rural development programmes in all non-Gaeltacht areas west and east of the Corrib. Connemara and the rest of County Galway were as different as any other two counties. One cannot travel from Connemara to the rest of County Galway without passing through another local authority area, either that of Mayo County Council or Galway City Council. The topography and geography are totally different, as well as there being significant linguistic differences between the two. It covers a very large area, from north to south, from Ballinasloe to Slyne Head. Before the Department proceeded to the tendering process, it should have decided the number of LCDCs there would be and consulted those involved. It was not good enough to allow county council managers or even councillors to decide. For example, there are 30 councillors in east Galway, as opposed to only nine in west Galway, which means that those in the east always have a majority. The Minister should examine the suitability of the arrangements put in place by local authorities. Where they are not suitable and the areas covered are too large, he should inform them to come up with more workable solutions. There is no better organisation than Pobal for prescriptions and bureaucracy. I understand it has come up with a process whereby one tenders for lots, but no one knows what they are. For example, someone tendering to provide a service in County Dublin might wind up providing it in Tallaght only or in the whole of south County Dublin. However, he or she does not know because no one has decided what the lot should be. This has made the business of tendering incredibly complicated - it is like buying a pig in a poke. I understand various combinations and permutations have to be included in a tender to ensure that when lots are decided, they will fit into the Department’s constructions. It should have been done the other way around. Before the tendering process began, the Department should have decided the areas to be included and it would have been a straight bidding process, not a mind game, as seems to be the case. Another issue that has arisen is that in some places local authority boundaries do not suit. In the last reorganisation of the programmes I brought most of them within county boundaries. For example, the programme for Ballyhoura is across boundaries. Duhallow is in a mountainous area straddling counties Kerry and Cork.It is an area with its own clear identity predating the setting up of the counties. We come then to an issue I have discussed with the Minister and for which he has a certain sympathy, namely, the islands. I am told in the arrangement that is put out - I do not how far the Minister went into the minutiae of this - that in the islands' case it will be up to each county to decide whether the islands can be treated as a group or whether the local authorities will grab the islands, so to speak. If I know anything about local authorities, they will grab anything they can. Comhar na nOileán has been a successful Leader company and is also the channel through which the funding is given to the island community development partnerships. A special arrangement made was for it because of the particular role in the islands which is not the same as it would be in a town. I understand from the tendering process that it will be difficult for Comhar na nOileán to tender because the criteria are for a much more populous place than the offshore islands. For example, I understand that when it comes to Irish speaking areas, there is no linguistic criterion laid down even though the 20 year strategy for the Irish language is clear that it was meant to be an all-of-Government strategy spanning all proposals from Government and that all Departments, in making proposals, were meant to take the linguistic requirements of Irish speakers in the Gaeltacht into account when drawing up how to provide services to the people. As I stated at the beginning, I do not want to cry over spilt milk, but I am a person who believes that it is important to try to get a solution that works locally. Of course, there is a temptation for those in back rooms to always want the tidy solution, for example, that county boundaries are sacrosanct, but the person who said that a tidy desk is a sign of a sick mind was not far from the truth because there are many human situations that do not fit the tidy desk syndrome. There is an opportunity here to catch our breath. It has not gone beyond the point of no return. As I stated, I am willing to accept that the local community development committees are in place, with the legislation having been passed by this House, but the tendering process we have entered into is highly flawed. It could lead to unintended results. It is more suitable for large operations which are good at tendering. Such operations might be no good at delivering programmes. Some of the most effective tenderers are not good on the ground or rooted in the community, but they are good in getting through what is becoming an ever complex web in trying to submit a public tender for any service, and I do not think that is what the Minister wants. I would have thought the criteria should include, for example, that the company should be forced to have its headquarters within the functional area in which it will provide the service and that it cannot be effectively an absentee landlord with a big headquarters far removed from the community in which it delivers the service. Of course, the most extreme such case is the islands. If one takes Comhar na nOileán out of the islands, one will destroy an effective company that not only has delivered to islanders in a way that no mainland company will do with the islands as an adjunct, but also has done something that has helped the growth of Dublin and all urban areas, that is, provided service jobs on the islands. It has certainly kept Inis Oírr very much alive. Would it not be an irony, when one thinks about it, if when all this is done we wound up with a situation where, instead of having these companies with their bases in towns such as Athenry and Kanturk, the services, for example, for rural Galway, under the rural development programme were headquartered in Galway city, as is the local authority, robbing the county of the jobs? It would rob the staff in such places as Letterfrack and Kanturk, in the far ends of their county, who have jobs in these companies of their employment. Would that not be a terrible irony that rural development funding would be going in significant measure to urban development rather than to rural development? I hope that, instead of having a combative two days over this Private Members' motion, the Minister reflects on serious points we are trying to make. I suggest that the Minister would halt the tendering process, that we would return to the pre-tendering process, that we would address the issues I mentioned about deciding how many LCDC areas there will be and what would be suitable in the tender documentation so that it is user-friendly for those who have the practical experience of providing the programmes, that the Minister would refer this to the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Environment, Culture and the Gaeltacht for examination, suggestions and consultations before he proceeds with the tendering, and that the current tendering process that does not kick in until 11 July would be suspended until the Oireachtas committee would have a chance to examine the implications of all the proposals and make cogent submissions to the Minister, Deputy Hogan, based on the widespread concern about how this project of his is proceeding.
#DaraCalleary	unknown-#DaraCalleary-party	unknown-#DaraCalleary-dob	unknown-#DaraCalleary-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-04 00:00:00	Visit of Mozambiquan Delegation	266	I thank Deputy Ó Cuív for giving us the opportunity to discuss this issue. There is no need for us to be kicking this around the place, so to speak. Everybody on all sides of the House agrees with the phenomenal success of the community development sector since 1991, when the then Commissioner, Mr. Ray MacSharry, initially rolled out the Leader model which has developed into many other community delivery projects. The reason he rolled it out in that fashion then is as relevant today as it was in the early 1990s. I refer to the disconnect we witnessed again two weeks ago between the public and institutions, such as this House and local authorities. That disconnect has in many ways damaged the sense of community, meitheal and entrepreneurship in the same way now as it did back then. The various Leader and community development companies managed to get around that because they were connected to and based in the community and their staff were of the community. The Leader programme and the various development programmes sparked a sense of enterprise, social cohesion and ambition within communities that otherwise would have been lost. If we continue to go the way the Minister is going with these proposed plans, I fear we will lose that enterprise, cohesion and ambition. One of the difficulties in community and local development is that it is basically an alphabet nightmare, with, for example, LDPs and LCDCs. However, there is one project which stands out as a testament to the faith and trust in these programmes, that is, the Great Western Greenway. Last year, 200,000 people used that greenway, from Westport through to Achill, either walking or cycling. A number of landowners got involved, giving away their land to support that project, and that could not have happened without the trust in the rural social scheme operated by South West Mayo Development. The trust on the ground encouraged landowners to get involved in the project. The ability and acumen of the staff of South West Mayo Development and the ambition of their board, all of whom are from that community, for that project ensured there was innovation and there was a dream. It ensured that right along the greenway there are products, services and jobs that otherwise would not have been there. Mayo County Council was a fantastic partner in that project. Nobody takes away from its contribution, but the trust on the ground, the sense of ownership and the dream and ambition of the greenway belongs to South West Mayo Development in a way one does not get with a large local authority in a county the physical size of Mayo. Through these new programmes, with the local community development committee, that trust will be lost.The local board, which runs the development company, will be replaced by the LCDC which will have as many people on a countywide board as are currently on a local board.  The Minister has expressed frustration, and he has cause to be worried, about the burden of administration within some of these companies, as well as the financial issues, but local authorities are not necessarily in the best financial health to be held up as a model of propriety either.  We need to ensure that the work done to date will not be lost. I agree with Deputy Ó Cuív's proposal to draw back from this and try to give the consultation period one chance to ensure that people on the ground are in agreement with this going forward. If this matter proceeds in the way the Minister is currently going, it will be without local buy-in, input or support. The whole notion of local development would then be catastrophically undermined. In a recent article in the Irish Examiner, the Minister said he was not privatising community services. He said these services were never undertaken by the public sector but by private local development companies. I have gone through the structure of many such companies with boards which, through articles of association, have to be drawn from various community organisations. They are community trusts and community-based companies, not private ones.  As Deputy Ó Cuív said, there is a danger in the tendering process that without that community basis, companies will tender but will not be able to deliver the service. There is a difference between preparing a tendering document and having the ability to deliver a service. Local development companies the length and breadth of this island are blessed with the quality of their staff's commitment and contribution. They are so blessed that the Irish model of local development is now put forward as European best practice. Representatives of recent EU accession countries are being brought here to see how local development is being undertaken at a time when we are about to destroy that very model by bringing it back in under the auspices of a local authority whereby that localism is lost. The Minister said we are not going to lose that community involvement but I have gone through the proposed set up and we will lose it. The notion of having community representatives involved, as opposed to elected representatives - there is a difference - will be lost. The ability of that community trust which is so important in so many projects will also be lost through the broader local authority structure.  Can the Minister clarify the tendering process? I presume it is correct that the current development companies will be allowed to tender, but what other companies will be allowed to tender? Will private service companies, although not even in the county and perhaps based in Dublin or in another EU state, be able to put together a tendering document developing and delivering services remotely? Could such companies usurp the very model the Minister is trying to protect? What will be in the tendering process to protect a service provider's local integrity?  I know the Minister is constricted by EU tendering rules, but someone somewhere will have to stand up to them. Perhaps the Minister will get a chance later in the year to stand up to an EU tendering model that is so anti small companies, be they community ones or small and medium enterprises. If the Minister gets the chance to do that around the European Commission table he will have done a great service. Now is his chance to start by saying "No".

It should not be lost for the sake of some tendering rules which are utterly unfair and disregard the success of that model in the first place. The Minister has made an argument concerning administration costs. There have been leaks to newspapers about the salaries of various CEOs, but moving them into county councils will not save a huge amount. If, as the Minister says, the local companies will be protected, then nothing will be saved. The majority of those companies operate very tight ships considering the effort and hours that staff put in, as well as the projects they take on. There will be job losses because this tendering model will not guarantee jobs. The Minister is trying to protect the skills we have but that tendering model will not protect existing staff who have skills that cannot be bought in the market place or replicated. Protection must be given to existing companies both to deliver Leader and the LCD programme. They have both the required expertise and ability. In the previous cohesion round, we saw there were good people for tenders but when it came to delivery it did not happen. We saw the difficulties it caused for companies such as MFG, so we do not want that to recur. We cannot allow that loss of time and delivery space in communities.  The Leader programme was a beacon that sustained rural economies through dark times. We need it again now to sustain rural communities. We need the LCDP to give communities a chance and to help those who are left behind so they can catch up. In addition, we need the training opportunities it presents to communities and particularly to participants. The very schemes rolled out by Deputy Ó Cuív when he was a Minister, such as Tús and RSS, are now used as models in other programmes. They owe their successful ethos to the health of the local development sector, which is now under threat. One of the lessons of the recent local elections is that rural economies are falling apart. The heart is being taken out of them by the move towards bigger urban centres. We can use the current network of local development companies to shout "Stop", as the late John Healy said. They can be an effective model to do that if we give them responsibility for rural services, such as a one-stop-shop for services, including local transport, rural enterprise and agricultural supports. In such circumstances, one could invest in those companies for the future of rural Ireland, or one can decide to adopt a tendering model which can be done anywhere by any entity with no connection to rural Ireland.  The staff and board members of local development companies have done this State very significant service. The Minister should allow them to continue doing so. In the coming weeks, he should engage with them to see if there is a shared way of moving forward. Everybody shares their aims, so this is the Minister's opportunity to deliver on them.

As we are all aware, local development companies have played a major role in the development of rural and urban areas in recent years. The first such company in Wexford commenced in 1991. They have been very successful since then in providing facilities for people to establish their own businesses, as well as helping local communities in various ways. It is important to defend the core community partnership ethos of local development companies in providing Leader programmes. Local development companies have played a critical role in supporting local enterprise, as well as providing services in communities across Ireland. The Minister's plans to subsume the programme into local authorities and contract it out will jeopardise the independence of companies involved. Instead of reforming local government, this measure will destroy a successful model of communities being empowered to help themselves. The Government should re-examine this matter immediately before the link between the companies and communities is destroyed. I have serious concerns about this matter being handed over to local authorities. Will future allocations be ring-fenced for specific projects or will the county manager of the day be able to raid the fund for pothole repairs or other local government projects that are short of money?

We all know about the huge waste of money in local authorities, but we are now going to hand over another block of enterprise to councils who will be the ring-masters. If the Minister goes ahead with this project - I certainly hope he does not - he should ensure that whatever moneys are allocated in future will be ring-fenced and that county managers will not be able to raid the kitty of whatever the Minister may decide to allocate. I find it difficult to understand why the Minister is going down this road. He has visited many of the development companies around the country and has seen at first hand the tremendous work they do. In my county, Wexford, the boards have been doing great work in the past four or five years, and I am sure it is the same in every other county. Wexford Local Development, WLD, is a company limited by guarantee with a voluntary board of 24 directors, eight of whom are elected community and voluntary sector representatives. It is a not-for-profit company and the membership of the local community development committees will have far fewer community and voluntary sector representatives under the Minister's proposal. Much valuable expertise and many people who have been providing a free service will be lost under the Minister's proposal. It is a major mistake. From January, the local and community development programme currently delivered by WLD will be procured by Wexford County Council through a public tendering process, raising the prospect of private commercial companies delivering the county's biggest social inclusion programme under the auspices of the local authority on a for-profit basis. Deputy Calleary referred to the tendering process. How will it work? There is a major concern that these companies will no longer be able to compete against private sector companies that are already providing such services. Companies in the EU - for example, in the UK and Germany - will be eligible to tender for these projects, and that is a major concern regarding the new board when it is established.  In my constituency, many good projects were funded by WLD. The Minister is also aware of this as he was briefed fully on WLD, visited some of the projects and recognised the important work it was doing in the county. WLD employs 81 people directly, with a further 450 people employed through various employment schemes such as Tús, community employment, CE, and the rural social scheme, RSS. What will happen to these people? I met 73 of them recently and they had no notion of where they will stand. There has been no dialogue or discussion. In a reply to a parliamentary question, the Minister told me the CEO was supposed to brief these people and tell them what was happening. However, the CEO and board are very much in the dark about what is going to happen.

Communities will lose out on funding leveraged by WLD to complete community projects and deliver programmes and services to which Wexford County Council does not have access. This would be a major blow to communities in Wexford, which in 2013 benefited from an additional €3.1 million in funding leveraged by WLD. In 2014 or 2016, will there be €3.1 million available? I doubt it, and if so it will probably go to private enterprise or some other area through tendering for the schemes. The powers that be and Brussels, as the previous speaker said, regard this country's model, which was established by former Minister, Deputy Ó Cuív, and others and is being destroyed by the Minister, Deputy Hogan, as the way forward. We are abandoning a scheme that is recognised Europe-wide as the model for other countries. We are putting it under the local authorities, and we all know what happens when they get hold of things. Many years ago when I was a councillor and the Minister was a member of Kilkenny County Council, the development projects were within local authorities, and it did not work very well. We established the county enterprise boards and local development companies because it was recognised that it was not working as it should have within local authorities. Local authority members and officials see their role as overseeing such matters as roads, planning and waste management, and they are not in the business of creating or developing jobs, other than protecting their own jobs within the structure of local authorities. That is why I am afraid the Minister's proposal will seriously damage the future of local development companies. The Leader companies are local action groups which were established in 1991 to promote the development of their own specific rural areas. If one travels to any rural community, one will see the tremendous work that has been carried out by local groups. Local groups became active, got involved in working with the local development companies and had a sense of purpose, moving forward and doing things for their communities. I fear this will be lost because we have already received a communiqué from the Minister's office - I do not know if he has read it yet - saying that when the new county councils are established this week they need not nominate people for local development companies. There were members of Wexford County Council in the previous local development companies and it worked very well. Why is the Minister sending a diktat that elected members of local authorities should not be on the new local development companies? We have seen too much of that, with Deputies and councillors precluded from sitting on certain boards. The Wexford local development committee has no Fianna Fáil councillor, only Fine Gael councillors, but it is working very well. Will the Minister explain why he is sending a diktat to the county manager not to put councillors in local development companies? It is not right, because the councillors were elected by the people for the people, and surely they have a right to make contribution to whatever new board structure the Minister is talking about. The Minister comes from a rural constituency, Carlow-Kilkenny, is a former local authority member and is very aware of what happens on the ground and how successful the local development companies were under their own steam when they were autonomous. While he says the local authority will not have much power over them and that they are only being housed within the local authority structure, from what I hear, the county managers and officials do not think that way. We have a new county manager who sees himself as the driver of this new company the Minister is establishing, and this is where it will fall down. I predict that in a year or 18 months Wexford County Council or another council will be left short by the Government for road works or other local authority schemes and the county manager will propose to take €1 million from the fund the Minister of the day has allocated. We will have fireworks when this happens because we will see that the Minister's decision was not in the right direction and was not going to help job creation and community development.When the Minister replies I ask him to specifically state that the moneys allocated to local authorities for this project be ring-fenced. County managers should not if they can get county managers on-side be able to hive off money for normal council projects.

This Government has set out clearly its aim to position local government as the primary vehicle of governance and public service at local level. That role involves local government in leading economic, social and community development; delivering efficient and good value services; and representing citizens and local communities effectively and accountably. These were the cornerstones of our policy document, Putting People First - Action Programme for Effective Local Government, published in October 2012, and they have also been reflected in the Local Government Reform Act 2014 under which the recent elections to a radically streamlined system of local government have taken place. Local economic and social development involves a complex set of factors, including public service inputs, employment, skills, investment, innovation, productivity and quality of life. Supporting local development involves fostering methods to engage local people in the process in order to promote sustainable development and participation. It is widely recognised, most notably in a recent OECD report examining the delivery of local development in Ireland, that the co-ordination and management of this type of integrated process at local level is a key function of local government. Given the capacity and, in particular, the democratic mandate of local government and the enhanced role set out for it in Putting People First, it is entirely appropriate that local government would have a key role in local and community development into the future. It will ultimately ensure more efficient and effective delivery of local and community development supports and interventions at a local level, putting the needs of citizens first in the delivery of publicly funded programmes and services. It is this focus on citizen-centred outcomes rather than the protection of existing delivery structures that is my primary concern. Far from eroding local democratic structures, as the Fianna Fáil motion suggests, the commencement last Sunday, 1 June, of the principal provisions of the Local Government Reform Act 2014 represents a major milestone on the path towards a reformed and improved local government system, which will represent its citizens and communities effectively and accountably, which provides the services that people need efficiently; and which works in a financially responsible way, achieving the best possible value for money. It restores key elements of local government removed by Fianna Fáil-led governments since 1977. Fianna Fáil, in effect, reduced local government to just local administration. The structural and other changes in place since last weekend constitute the most far-reaching changes in the local government sector since the current system was established in 1898. At county and city level, this has involved the dissolution of local authorities in Limerick, Tipperary and Waterford and their replacement by new merged authorities in each case. At sub-county level, we have introduced an innovative approach to local governance in the form of municipal districts which, unlike the isolated town councils they have replaced, embrace all parts of the county, uniting towns and their hinterlands and dispensing with outdated town boundaries. Overall, the number of local authority structures has reduced from 114 to 31 and the number of councillors from 1,627 to 949. A key outcome of this reorganisation will facilitate the refocusing of resources to be used to improve front-line services and to enhance the quality of life in local communities for the future rather than maintaining duplicated structures. It is important to emphasise that the reform programme is not just about structural reorganisation. A range of other new policy initiatives also came into operation on 1 June, including provision for an enhanced role for elected members regarding economic development and enterprise support; new regional spatial and economic strategies; stronger oversight of local authority performance; the dissolution of city and county development boards; and the establishment of local community development committees. A further central element of the reform programme is the positioning of local authorities to take a much more central role in local and community development, particularly to ensure the most efficient and effective outcomes for citizens and communities. Before I advance any further on this issue, it might be useful in order to provide a context for the current reforms if I remind members briefly of the background to local development structures and programmes and how they have developed in the recent past. In 2002, the then Fianna Fáil-led Government established the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs against a background of concern at the multiplicity of structures and agencies through which local and community development schemes and programmes were delivered. There was an inherent danger of fragmentation of services and diffusion of resources, with the new Department inheriting a number of local and community programmes with diverse structures which had been operated under the aegis of several different Departments. The cohesion process initiated a number of years ago by Deputy Ó Cuív to address these issues resulted in a significant reduction of local delivery structures for a range of rural and local development programmes. The close to 100 partnerships and Leader companies operating until 2009 were reduced to a total of 53 entities providing full nationwide coverage, a figure that has since been reduced further to 50. This rationalisation was then to be built on in a subsequent phase of cohesion concerned with improving and joining up the outputs of programmes. In particular, the then Government saw a clear need to redesign its community development and social inclusion programmes, particularly the local development social inclusion programme, LDSIP, and the community development programme, CDP, drawing on good international practice and providing for ongoing evaluation of the programmes. A comprehensive programme of redesign was implemented which streamlined the delivery of the LDSIP and CDP with the introduction of the local and community development programme, LCDP, in 2010. The reduction in overheads achieved would support the effort to maximise the impact of available funding at the front line. There was opposition, as there always will be, among some groups to the model for integrated service delivery and structures at local level, maintaining the status quo was never an option given the issues relating to the delivery of the previous programmes, the concerns of the Committee of Public Accounts about the multitude of structures in the system, the criticisms in the McCarthy report and the prevailing budgetary reality at the time. In May 2011, following the formation of this Government, responsibility for community functions and the LCDP transferred to my Department. The LCDP is my Department's main community development scheme, covering all areas of the country and representing the largest social inclusion intervention of its kind in the State. Total funding of €281 million has been allocated to the LCDP since it was introduced in 2010 and all 50 local development companies are contracted to deliver the LCDP to the end of 2014. The current programme officially ended at the end of 2013, having operated for four years, but it is being implemented on a transitional basis for 2014 with a budget of €47 million, pending the roll out of a new social inclusion programme in January 2015. Over the past three years, my focus has centred on building on the reform process that the previous Fianna Fáil-led Government had started. I am therefore more than a little mystified as to where Fianna Fáil is coming from with the motion it has tabled. As part of the programme of reform of local government, local community development committees, LCDCs are being established in each local authority area. These committees, comprising public private socioeconomic interests, will have responsibility for local and community development programmes on an area basis, including my Department's Leader and local and community development programmes.They will develop, co-ordinate and implement a more coherent and integrated approach to local and community development than heretofore, with the aim of reducing duplication and overlap and optimising the use of available resources for the benefit of citizens and communities. I am trying to finish what Deputy Ó Cuív started. In the specific context of local development, the primary objective of the alignment process, outlined in Putting People First, is to improve co-ordination of publicly funded programmes at local level, to reduce overlap and duplication and to better target resources at a time of significant social need. Looking back over time, several studies and initiatives under successive Governments have sought to identify or implement improved co-ordination of local development funding, including reports such as Better Local Government: A Programme for Change, 1996; the report of the task force on integration of local government and local development systems, 1998; and the Indecon review of the county and city development board strategic reviews and proposals for strengthening and developing those boards, 2008. In general, these initiatives did not achieve their objectives so, in many respects, it was unsurprising that the most recent report by the alignment steering group highlighted that challenges remain in terms of the multiplicity of agencies and committees that are supported locally, with the consequential risks around duplication, overlap, lack of joined-up planning and the need for better targeting of resources of publicly funded programmes. The Government policy on alignment recognises that the capacity of all those involved must be mobilised for more effective delivery of services, the local authorities, local development bodies, other statutory partners, and the community sector. It is with this in mind that as part of the process I am introducing the new public participation networks, PPNs, which will greatly enhance the voice of the community and voluntary sector, in particular through their role in local community development committees, LCDCs. For the first time community is being recognised on a statutory basis. The PPNs will nominate people to LCDCs, and will include not just a community voice but also representatives of social inclusion and environmental interests. This is all part of the overall push for greater citizen engagement in the context of the local government reform programme. For the sake of clarity, the House should be aware that there are approximately 700 people directly employed in local development companies to support the delivery of the Leader and local community development programmes, LCDPs, on behalf of the Department. The companies also deliver a range of other programmes and interventions under contract to other Departments and agencies, and this may explain some of the misinformation that Deputy Browne had when he spoke about the various rural social schemes and Tús programmes that will be effectively obliterated. These are managed by the companies on behalf of the Department of Social Protection, so perhaps he will address those issues to that Department. My Department's contractual relationship is with the individual companies which are in turn responsible for their own staffing and employment issues. Therefore, my focus has to be on ensuring the structures and contractual arrangements between my Department at the centre and the local delivery mechanisms are designed in a manner that ensures the most efficient and effective outcomes from the Leader programmes and LCDPs which are delivered on my Department's behalf. I would be failing in my duty if I did otherwise. I fully recognise the strengths and capacities of the local development companies, which is very well articulated in the Government's policy document, Putting People First. As for all organisations involved in delivering services to the public, the prime focus of local development companies must be, first and foremost, on serving the public, rather than on retaining sole control of public programmes. We need to ensure value for money and, therefore, in accordance with the public spending code, best practice internationally, legal advice and ensuring the optimum delivery of services to clients, the LCDP successor programme will be subject to a public procurement process. I do not have any option. I must observe the law. With regard to the delivery of the development programmes managed by my Department, as an integral part of the alignment of community development and local government, oversight of the LCDP will transfer to the local community development committees, LCDCs, within each local authority from 1 July next. The new social inclusion and community activation programme, SICAP, is one of my Department's key priorities and its budget for its first year of operation will be addressed as part of the 2015 Estimates process. The SICAP public procurement process will be a competitive process that will be open to local development companies, other not-for-profit community groups and commercial firms that believe they can provide the services to be tendered for to deliver the new programme. The LCDCs will procure the programme locally. All proposals received will be assessed in accordance with the assessment criteria notified with the tender documentation, and the contract or contracts will be awarded on the basis of that assessment. The aim of SICAP is to reduce poverty and promote social inclusion and equality through local, regional and national engagement and collaboration. It aims to build on more than 20 years of local and community development work funded by my Department and its predecessors. It strives to build on the country's internationally commended history of local and community development activity and also aims to take account of international experience in recognising the need for local approaches to complement and add value to mainstream service provision in our public employment and education services. My Department is aware of the work undertaken in recent years by the leadership in energy and environmental design, LEED, and other divisions within the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development in recognising the value of local approaches to promoting inclusive economic growth and in recognising the role for local government as a key player in that regard. Eurofound, the OECD, the International Labour Organization, the National Economic and Social Council, and the Economic and Social Research Institute, have all commented on the fact that the key route out of social exclusion is to support individuals to be in employment. Programmes such as SICAP can be beneficial in helping those most distant from the labour market to be better prepared for access to the labour market by working with them to enhance their educational and training capacity. This programme will prioritise supports to those who are unemployed, including those not on the live register. SICAP is being introduced at a time of significant structural and policy change in the Department with regard to local government reform and the roll-out of the new LCDCs and the governance model for local and community development in each local authority area. SICAP is a substantial player in the change process as a key programme for which the new LCDCs will have management and oversight. Leader, the community-led local development approach, has been a tool for the delivery of rural development interventions in Ireland since its inception in 1991, and will remain at the heart of the delivery of rural development interventions for the 2014 to 2020 programming period. The Government acknowledges the positive impact the use of the Leader approach has had on the development of rural areas in Ireland in the 2007 to 2013 period and recognises the part the local development companies have played in this. In the context of a more cohesive approach to the delivery of all local development interventions, it is important that Leader funding is part of a more strategic approach to supporting development in rural areas, and for that reason the Government is proposing some changes to the future delivery of the Leader elements of the rural development programme. The changes are proposed to achieve two main objectives, to promote a more cohesive approach to local development as outlined in Putting People First, which I have just outlined, and to address issues and challenges faced through delivery of the current 2007-2013 programme. The added value of the local development companies' role in the delivery of Leader lies in their well-developed ability to empower their communities and support them to build their capacity to access funding through Leader. This role is, and will remain, critical to the delivery of Leader funding and ensures the quality of the interventions funded under the programme and the ability of these interventions to address local needs. For the avoidance of any confusion, I acknowledge that the current local development companies have well-developed skills and experience in this area in particular and I see them continuing this role in their capacity as partners on the LCDCs. I have indicated this to the local development companies on many occasions. I have met the representatives of the Irish Local Development Network and of the County and City Managers Association many times and have repeated these points to them over the past 18 months. It is incumbent upon us in government not just to ensure the funding delivered through Leader supports high quality interventions that address needs locally but also that it complies with the processes of sound financial management and audit compliance. The Deputies opposite are well aware of issues around good corporate governance, financial management or lack of it in many of the companies, but I heard no mention of those issues in this debate. I suppose in some respects I am not surprised by that but there are issues that cannot go unnoticed when one is trying to reform the programmes we have now. We must take those issues into account when developing the new structures and models of financial management and proper compliance with the programmes because we are subject to audit, not just at national level but also at EU level. The broader role currently undertaken by the local development companies involves the management of the administrative and payment processes that are also an integral part of the Leader funding process. It is in this context that my Department has experienced some difficulty in the current programming period. It is part of the job of my Department to mitigate risks to funding as far as possible, and I make no apology for this. We are dealing with European and Irish taxpayers' money and we must ensure the systems for the management of that money are robust. I propose to do this by amending the systems to address the challenges identified and experienced in the 2007 to 2013 programming period. I believe this is a sensible approach which will ultimately ensure a more efficient delivery of the funds in the 2014 to 2020 period. Primarily, this will involve ensuring the systems we use to deliver the Leader elements of the 2014-2020 programme are fit for purpose and that any entity contracted to deliver the Leader elements of the RDP has the financial and management capacity to do so. In this context and in the interest of clarity, Ireland proposes to support the implementation of rural development interventions through the Leader elements of the RDP 2014-2020 at local level using a public private partnership approach.This will form part of a more integrated and coherent approach to local development that involves community and local government organisations in leadership roles, guiding a more integrated and co-ordinated approach to the delivery of all funding, both European and national, at a local level. The priorities at local level will be developed using a partnership approach that will draw on the skills and expertise of local public and private socioeconomic interests, including local development expertise, local authorities and community and voluntary organisations, in consultation with the wider population. These strategic priorities will then form the basis for programme-specific priorities in each area. This approach would see local authorities working in partnership with local development agencies and community representatives to design and implement local development strategies at local level, based on the strategic priorities already identified. Both strategic priorities and programme-specific priorities would form part of an overall planning process at a local level and this would be integrated with planning processes at regional, national and European levels, thereby addressing the need for a more integrated approach to support for rural development. Such an arrangement also envisages the identification of a lead financial partner as part of the partnership arrangement. The lead financial partner must have the capacity to provide the financial support necessary to ensure successful financial delivery of Leader-type interventions for the duration of the programming period. This will address the significant challenges relating to the financial solvency and capacity of legal entities which were experienced in the programme period. The system also proposes to delegate the administrative checks required to verify expenditure to an independent entity with the capacity to ensure these checks are carried out to a consistently high standard at all times. The composition of the proposed public private partnership will be in line with the requirements of the EU regulatory framework and fulfil all the criteria necessary to be considered a local action group in both composition and ethos. I am proposing to conduct a two stage local development strategy selection process providing the opportunity to develop this partnership approach incrementally and with full and comprehensive consultation to maintain the integrity of the community-led local development approach. The aims of these processes are to facilitate the development of robust, implementable strategies that address the needs of individual local areas and are complementary to other development processes at local, regional, national and European level. I am confident that the systems to be put in place will facilitate the effective inclusion of support provided though the Leader elements of the rural development programme in the broader local development context, while ensuring the efficient management of expenditure as required by the regulatory framework. There has been comment on the need to engage with the local development sector. Let me put the record straight. Shortly after the Government published Putting People First, which included recommendations from the expert group on alignment, I invited the Irish Local Development Network to participate on the alignment implementation group which was being established to assist and advise on the implementation of the proposals approved by Government. The implementation group was to have two ILDN representatives, two local government representatives and representative from my Department and Pobal. In fairness to the ILDN, it wanted time to consider its participation, and the implementation group met without its participation initially. The ILDN then come back to my Department and indicated that it would participate if the name of the group could be changed from "implementation group" to "working group", if its terms of reference could be changed and if they could have an extra nominee. My Department acceded to all these requests. Since then, the group has met 11 times and, additionally, I have met them directly on three occasions, while my Department has had several further bilateral meetings with the ILDN representatives. The notion that there is not consultation or that there is no engagement is absolutely a false one. Any suggestion that I or my Department have not engaged in consultation simply does not stand up to scrutiny. There has been far too much inaccurate commentary on this and other aspects of the alignment process, not least during the recent local elections campaign. Despite all of that, it is important that there is clarity around the fact that the process is marching on, not least through the establishment of the new local and community development committees under the Local Government Reform Act and the development of the new SICAP and Leader programmes. I wish to reiterate what I have said earlier in this debate and many times previously, namely, that the Government recognises and acknowledges the contribution of local development companies in the delivery of local development interventions at a local level. Equally, I want to make it clear that they form only part of a complex landscape that requires a more streamlined approach in order to increase efficiencies and ensure that all funding available at a local level has the maximum impact. The role of local government is widely recognised as key to the delivery of local and community interventions, and the aim of the local government reform and alignment processes is to strengthen this role for the benefit of communities all over Ireland. I have assured the local development companies on a number of occasions that they will maintain a role in the new architecture that will support a more integrated approach to the delivery of development funding at local level. I envisage that this role will play to their particular strengths and I am absolutely convinced that the new systems will allow them to focus more on supporting the delivery of high quality development interventions at local and community level. It is with this in mind that I again request that local development companies continue to engage with the reform process, and I am glad they will meet my Department this week, as I firmly believe that the outcome of this will support us all to facilitate the sustainable, integrated development of communities across the country, an aim towards which I believe we should all be working. I thank Deputy Ó Cuív for his constructive approach and also Deputy Calleary in regard to the matters they raised, and I will certainly consider some of the issues raised by them, of which I have taken note. Perhaps we can have a further engagement on these matters in the future. I assure Deputy Browne that all moneys under these programmes will be ring-fenced for what they are intended and not for filling potholes in Wexford, and I am sure his son, whom I congratulate on his recent election to Wexford local authority, will ensure that.
#MartinHeydon	unknown-#MartinHeydon-party	unknown-#MartinHeydon-dob	unknown-#MartinHeydon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-04 00:00:00	Visit of Mozambiquan Delegation	283	I thank the Minister for sharing his time with me on the important topic of this Private Members' motion. I welcome the overall funding package for the next Leader programme, which should not be taken for granted. Normally, when one fights for things, once they have been obtained, people, particularly those in Opposition, move on to the next fight without acknowledging, as in this case, that the securing of €250 million in funding has been a massive achievement by the Minister. The EU regulations stipulate that a minimum of 5% of the rural development programme be allocated to Leader, and Ireland has decided to increase its proportion to 7%, acknowledging the vital role Leader has played in rural development down through the years. It is vital that greater efficiencies and operational savings are achieved in the delivery of the new programme. As in any facet of public life, we have had to cut our cloth to suit our measure across the board. We must ensure that we find greater efficiencies, minimise administration costs and maximise the funding available to support projects and local communities. The Commission for the Economic Development of Rural Areas, CEDRA, launched by the Taoiseach last month, identified a range of areas of particular need that could be supported through Leader interventions. These include economic development, job creation, rural tourism, enhanced national communication initiatives to improve broadband and building community capacity. Broadband provision, in particular, strikes me as a particularly important issue. The Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, Deputy Rabbitte, recently unveiled Government plans to extend fibre broadband to villages and towns around the country that currently have a significant deficit. This is a crucial issue in my constituency of Kildare South where people who currently commute could work from home a few days a week. That would have a massive impact on local communities and a knock-on impact on improving the quality of life for many people. If there was a way to allocate some of this money, for example, towards increased and improved broadband provision, that would have an knock-on impact on economic development, job creation and small start-up businesses where people could work from home, as many people who have businesses already do. The knock-on impact on local communities would be very significant. I would like to reference some Leader projects that have already been undertaken in Kildare South, with which I have worked closely and directly. The Minister will be well aware of the community centre project in Suncroft, for which funding was sanctioned recently, and the Kilcullen child care centre that was allocated funding of €317,000. Mistakes were made along the way and there were delays and huge headaches for local community groups. As a local Deputy, I ended up being dragged into the middle and going back and forth between Department officials, the local community groups and the County Kildare Leader Partnership. The Minister is aware of the issues that I have highlighted to him. In the formation of a new Leader programme, we must ensure that instances such as those do not happen in the future. Funding under the programme has had a positive impact. The child care centre in Kilcullen opened today. In Suncroft the development project is continuing apace. Only last week the community had a hugely successful "Strictly Come Dancing" event to help fundraise the last segment of the project, and it was a real example of community spirit. I am thinking of places such as Rathangan, which was granted funding of €500,000 for a community centre, and Castledermot, which was granted the same amount of funding. Deputy Calleary mentioned the heart being taken out of rural towns and villages. These were communities that were left behind in the boom that the previous Government, of which his party was a member, oversaw. When one meets people from Castledermot now, one does not hear them talk about derelict buildings or issues in their town but about a huge sense of community pride. The old school that has been redeveloped on Main Street has transformed the community, and this has brought out the best in the people. Castledermot has a population of 1,398 people, according to the last census, and the funding allocated of €500,000 has been a massive investment in that small community. Rathangan has a population of fewer than 2,500 people and Suncroft has a population of 735 people, and the funding allocated to those communities has made a massive contribution. What we are doing in terms of reform is adopting a citizen-centred approach that concentrates and gets the best return on such investment. It has been suggested that local authorities are a problem and that we should avoid putting any services their way. That has been the Fianna Fáil approach in the past, ever since it abolished rates in 1977, a decision that forced local authorities to go cap in hand to the Government. The establishment of local enterprise offices and the centring of a broad range of services therein will allow us to maximise the return from the existing local government structures and leverage them more effectively. I trust local authorities to use the additional powers they have been given, including those relating to the local property tax, to best effect. With greater power comes greater responsibility and accountability and this, in turn, will give us a much more accountable and fit-for-purpose local authority structure. The provision of community services and their administration should be undertaken through this improved structure.  I acknowledge the Minister's engagement with the Irish Local Development Network on its alignment implementation role. I take the opportunity to thank the local development companies throughout the country, past and present, for the work they have done in local communities. I look forward to seeing a stronger Leader programme into the future, a programme that will facilitate the great community spirit we have seen throughout the country in the past.

The European Court of Auditors, in condemning what is now proposed by the Government, has recommended that other member states follow the example of what was done in this country in recent decades. If the so-called alignment proposal is implemented, control of funding will be retained in local authorities but not - this is the key point- under the control of the democratically elected councillors. Instead, the control will rest with the county manager and there will be no certainty that funding will go to where it is needed most. In many cases, it will be used by managers to compensate for the drastic cuts in local government funding in recent years. The Government claims these cuts are being made to reflect the removal of water services provision from local authorities. However, the level of cuts is far greater than what is being spent on water services. Moreover, the revenue from the local property tax which was supposed to go towards local services such as parks, libraries, footpaths and lighting has been handed over almost in its totality to Uisce Éireann.  The attacks on the local community development sector are just the latest phase in the onslaught on local democracy and the community sector in which the Government is engaged. These attacks are happening, even though the record of local community development companies and the Leader programme speaks for itself. According to SIPTU, the local community development programme dealt with 47,792 cases in 2012. It was responsible for providing after-school and other outlets for 84,722 young people. In the same year 7,000 people were supported into employment and more than 18,000 took part in education and training projects. This is apart from the 1,900 people directly employed in delivering the programme. That is a remarkable achievement, the evidence of which can be seen in every county. Of course, there are examples of where the schemes have been less successful. However, I can speak authoritatively in saying the programme has been a huge success in County Laois, as I understand it also has been in the Minister of State's county. As I said, the Leader and community development programmes are held up as models of social inclusion by the European Union. The proposed alignment threatens to undermine all of this. Not only will it threaten the jobs involved, but it will also have a potentially disastrous impact on communities, with many being forced to curtail services or close them down. The Fianna Fáil motion before the House does not refer directly to the issue of competitive tendering. It is a source of great concern that private companies will be able to bid for contracts to perform community work. There is no benefit in setting community groups against each other to compete for the same resources. Moreover, no private company should benefit from people's disadvantage. We need look no further than Mother England to see what happens to the community sector when this approach is attempted, with services formerly provided by voluntary and community groups farmed out to the private sector. That strategy has been a disaster across the water, where the authorities are now trying to pull it back. It is difficult to envisage how the new structure will operate. I checked in recent days to see how it was panning out in County Laois and it is not a pretty picture. All of the changes are happening on 1 July, but there is very little of the infrastructure in place. Private companies, of course, will only be interested in making bids for schemes that are guaranteed to make money, leaving other schemes to bite the dust. In the five years of the Leader programme, the Laois Partnership Company has assisted 434 projects. In 2013 it assisted 150 people directly in returning to employment and assisted 119 small businesses. Some 108 children from disadvantaged areas are attending preschool and after-school projects. In addition, the company manages a local employment scheme and provides a vast range of training courses, many of which provide candidates with FETAC qualifications. The administration of all of these schemes is largely funded through the social inclusion programme. Without this funding, the Laois Partnership Company would be unable to administer dozens of projects. It is that funding which keeps the show on the road. Community employment schemes, preschool and after-school projects and everything else cannot be delivered out of thin air. Local development companies have a strong voluntary ethos and their board members are volunteers. Unfortunately, as I said, the Fianna Fáil motion does not address the possibility of privatisation. Fine Gael is determined to go down the Thatcherite road which proved a miserable failure in Britain. What do members of the Labour Party, none of whom is here, have to say about this? Are they happy to follow their colleagues in government down that road? SIPTU is seeking to deal with the industrial relations issues and it is vital that the Department engage with it, through the Labour Relations Commission, to seek to address the likely consequences for workers employed by the local development companies. I brought forward a number of amendments to the Local Government Reform Bill 2014, not to be mischievous but to highlight the danger of leaving so much power in the hands of county managers. If a local authority is fortunate enough to have a good county manager, everything will be fine. However, the legislation states in respect of the membership of the local community development committees, "The chief officer of the Committee shall, in consultation with the Corporate Policy Group, seek and select nominees to the Committee ... and shall submit a list of recommended nominees to the members of the local authority for their consideration". The punch line is in the provision which states, "The nominees shall be appointed to the Committee, without omission or addition, by resolution of the local authority". Do people understand this is effectively putting everything in the hands of the county manager? The Government's reform programme is supposed to be about taking power from county managers and putting it back in the hands of councillors. This provision stands that principle on its head and will seriously restrict local authorities. The Government has tied the hands of the 949 councillors elected last week.
#MartinFerrisSF	unknown-#MartinFerrisSF-party	unknown-#MartinFerrisSF-dob	unknown-#MartinFerrisSF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-04 00:00:00	Visit of Mozambiquan Delegation	285	Once again, I find myself in this Chamber challenging the Fine Gael-Labour Party coalition on its lack of consultation and erosion of democracy. This time we are talking about local development companies and the privatisation of the community sector. The reputation of community development companies in the allocation and administration of Leader programmes is second to none. All of us who have worked with them in locations throughout the country can verify this. Community development companies have 20 years experience and are a real success story. The Leader projects have been a successful job creation mechanism in rural Ireland. Without them, many rural communities would be destitute at this point. From 2011 to last year, they created nearly 3,000 jobs.They also assisted more than 6,700 enterprises and supported more than 2,000 tourism initiatives. Villages and communities, which were enhanced one way or another by Leader projects and funding, numbered almost 4,000 in those three years. The model was adapted by other member states in the European Union. It was a valuable tool to combat social exclusion and was a cost-effective job creation mechanism under democratic control of communities. Now we have a tendering process established which will do no more than pit community organisations against each other and leave the way open for yet another way to privatise something. If the profit margin is not thought sufficient, will they just disappear altogether? The Minister, Deputy Hogan, is the whizz kid of privatisation and here is another example. His plan is to make community development another source of profit for the private sector. Is nothing safe from this drive for profit? Will we see profitability becoming the driving force behind these projects instead of the common good of the community and job creation in rural areas? We now have Irish Water. Remember refuse collection was privatised and there were waivers for old age pensioners and people on low incomes but they are gone. Local development companies are following that. Will child care, community supports for the vulnerable, youth recreation projects and those designed to include those who are excluded from communities disappear? That is a big question and I have no doubt that if we proceed along this route, that is what will happen. The community-led ethos must be preserved with participants' needs being prioritised over profit. The changes to the way local development is organised will have serious consequences for the community and rural development programmes. Currently, the Leader partnerships, independent non-profit organisations, manage and administer Leader funding for development programmes and they do a damn good job. The planned changes will see the management of funding being transferred from the partnership to local authority-led entities and, as Deputy Stanley said, giving absolute power to county managers. Those of us who have been on county councils have seen good ones and not so good ones. Giving that absolute power to one person is an affront to democracy. There is also a workers' rights aspect to these measures. If the LCDP is put out to tender, the fear is that it will lead to a race to the bottom, with private companies seeking to undermine pay and conditions with a view to winning tenders and boosting profits. What are the arrangements being put in place for any transfer of employment of workers? Will there be redundancies and, if so, who will pay the redundancy of workers being laid off?  It will also impact on the efficient delivery of the local services, currently run by local development companies. I fully appreciate the invaluable work that companies such as North and East Kerry Development do in supporting local organisations. The likes of North and East Kerry Development should remain the applicant body for Leader and the successor programme to the local and community development programme from this year onwards. I work very closely with it and with its directorship. It does fantastic work and has helped small companies start up. Such companies are far more important to the area I come from and to many areas in Ireland than the IDA. It is mind-boggling to think that while the European Commission holds Ireland's community-led model as an example to the rest of Europe to follow, our Minister is proposing to replace our example of best practice with the centralised version of which the Commission is so critical. Local development companies should retain their independence and be allowed to continue their brilliant work in our communities.  I do not know if members of the Government are listening to people who live in rural isolated areas. If they were honest and truthful, they would relay to the Minister what I and others on this side of the House have been doing tonight that the way local development companies operate is invaluable to local communities and rural Ireland. To do away with them and to give absolute power to county managers will do an awful disservice to the people who put us here. Will the Government reconsider the road it is going down? Why tamper or do away with something which is working beneficially for everyone?  Deputy Áine Collins is shaking her head but she knows as much as I do, given the areas from which she comes, the value of local development companies, what they have contributed over the past number of years, the number of jobs they have created, the amount of work they do in local communities and the number of small businesses they helped to start up, but all of that will be taken away from them and given to one person as a result of what the Government is proposing. I ask the Government to reconsider this proposal. In particular, I ask those who call themselves members of the Labour Party to reconsider going down the road of privatisation, although it is nothing new in that they have sold out everything since they went into Government. They will do anything for power. They have given up all the values and principles for which they are supposed to stand. I commend the motion put forward by Deputy Ó Cuív and his party. The removal of the partnerships and the local development companies is a retrograde step.

The first time I engaged with Leader partnerships was during the time of the former Minister of State, Liam Hyland. They have come a long way. I mention the work Deputy Ó Cuív did when he was Minister. The Government needs to listen to the people unlike what is happening now when they are being totally ignored. One would have thought it might have changed after 23 May when it was sent a salutary message but it is still not listening. I compliment all the volunteers, the board members and the staff and management of the independent Leader non-profit organisations in Tipperary. The one with which I worked closely was South Tipperary Leadership partnership and I compliment Niall Morrissey and Martin Quinn, the chairperson.  The Minister, Deputy Hogan, should have some respect for county councils. Like everything else, the Government wants to privatise and punish the electorate. I have been saying for three years that the Government is trying to punish the electorate for keeping Fine Gael and the Labour Party out of Government for 14 years. The people gave them their answer last week but what did the Government do? It issued a diktat in Monday's newspaper attacking all the elected councils. It cut travel expenses, training courses and so on. It was a punishment. The sooner this Minister leaves us to go to Brussels, the better. He will not stand and face the people. I hope the Minister of State, Deputy Tom Hayes, and Deputy Áine Collins will face the people because they are waiting for them. They can shake their heads until they fall off but what is happening is downright wrong. It is blackguarding and bullying ordinary people and community projects. As the Minister of State, Deputy Tom Hayes, knows, there are hundreds of projects throughout County Tipperary but the Government is trying to close down the companies. It is a smash and grab raid by the Minister, Deputy Hogan, to get the money for his friendly county managers.  The document enabling the Local Government Reform Act 2014 was entitled Putting People First. What could be further from the truth when the Government allowed the closure of all the town councils and borough councils, including the town council in the Minister of State's town of Cashel? It locked them up and locked the people out of them. Is that putting people first?  The Government has continued tonight by attacking the Leader companies. The Minister of State, Deputy Hayes, should represent the people who elected him.

The Minister, Deputy Hogan, is fleeing the country. The hiding ground for the Minister of State, Deputy Tom Hayes, is very scarce unless he goes into the mountains in Duhallow or up to Hollyford and escapes. What is happening is the devastation of rural communities. Did one ever hear such bunkum as getting private companies to tender to do voluntary work in communities? Private companies are driven by profit, and rightly so. We need them as well. There is a place for them but not in community development.

We know who the vermin are and the people of Tipperary know who the vermin are. They will know.

If I could be allowed to finish, this is the biggest attack on rural Ireland by the Minister - "Big Phil" as I call him. He is fleeing to Europe. It is an attack on community development and the volunteers that I salute and have worked with over the years, unlike Deputy Hayes, who could not be found. He was in Brussels or gone off on some other holiday. I stood with the people and will stand with them. This is not over. I have notice of a diktat for next Friday's council meeting on Putting People First. It is an instruction from the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government telling people that they are not to select members to sit on the boards at their AGMs around the country next Friday. Is that not interference by the Minister? The sooner he leaves for Brussels the better. The former Minister, Deputy Shatter, has already left. The Minister of State voted confidence in him. The sooner he leaves this country on board a ship the better because he has to get protection in Kilkenny. The Minister of State, Deputy Tom Hayes, will need it in Tipperary if he keeps going on the way he has done, trying to fool the people.

He will resort to any tactics. Thank you, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle for trying to offer me some protection but it was an outrageous intrusion on the five minutes I had to speak.
