            <p eId="para_2">16<b>Deputy Aengus Ó Snodaigh</b> asked the <b>Minister for Social Protection</b> the number of additional persons to whom the new lower rent supplement ceiling was applied in the past month; the number who have been forced to move as a consequence of the new ceiling to date in 2012; her views on whether it may be too late for parents who are forced to leave their locality to enrol their children in new schools; and if she will seek to make savings on rent supplement by negotiating directly with landlord representatives instead of placing exclusive responsibility for achieving her Departments savings on individual vulnerable tenants. [35043/12]</p>
          </question>
          <speech by="#JoanBurtonLAB" as="#Minister_for_Social_Protection" eId="spk_2">
            <from>Minister for Social Protection  (Deputy Joan Burton)</from>
            <p eId="para_3">The Government has provided €436 million for rent supplement in 2012.  Total expenditure on the scheme over the past five years from 2007 to 2011 was €2.36 billion.  At present, approximately 92,000 persons are in receipt of rent supplement, of whom approximately 37,000 are single persons.  The remaining 55,000 clients are couples, couples with children and single-parent households.</p>
            <p eId="para_4">New maximum rent payments reduced from 1 January 2012 based on a review of the most up-to-date market data available.  The emphasis of the rent review was to ensure value for money for tenants and taxpayers while ensuring people on rent supplement are not priced out of the market for private rented accommodation.  The revised limits are applicable to new rent supplement tenancies from January 2012 and existing tenancies on review.  Approximately 25,000 rent supplement claims have been awarded in 2012, of which 3,700 were awarded within the last month, indicating that accommodation can be secured within the new limits.</p>
            <p eId="para_5">When rents are in excess of the limit, clients are being asked to contact the landlord and renegotiate the rent.  Where landlords do not agree to reduce the rent within the limits, staff will discuss the options open to the tenant, including seeking alternative accommodation.  Statistics on the numbers who have secured alternative accommodation are not available.  Officials administering the scheme advise that customers are securing alternative accommodation within their locality.  Any customers who have specific issues with regard to relocating should discuss these issues with departmental officials, who continue to provide support and advice to customers in addressing their accommodation and other needs.  There will be no incidence of homelessness due to these changes.</p>
            <p eId="para_6">Additional information not given on floor of the House.</p>
            <p eId="para_7">Rent supplement is specifically for the benefit of the tenants to assist them with their accommodation needs.  The Department does not intend negotiating directly with landlords to reduce rents on behalf of a tenant.</p>
            <p eId="para_8">I have recently introduced powers of inquiry for appropriate staff to request formally and oblige landlords to provide information in respect of their rent supplement tenants, principally to verify the agreed rent and existence of the tenancy.  This measure will improve both the governance and oversight arrangements in place and complement existing compliance arrangements which the Department has in place with the Office of the Revenue Commissioners.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#AengusOSnodaighSF" eId="spk_3">
            <from>Deputy Aengus Ó Snodaigh</from>
            <p eId="para_9">The last sentence spoken by the Minister is completely and utterly wrong as there will be homelessness due to this measure.  Those people who cannot find accommodation in the areas affected, where the rent supplement rates have been substantially reduced, are being displaced from areas in which they and their families have laid down their roots.  They will be homeless.  While they may not be captured by the homeless agency, they will be homeless by virtue of the Minister's steps.</p>
            <p eId="para_10">The Minister is a bulk purchaser of a service.  Does she not agree that the Department, through local authorities, already negotiates directly with landlords?  Why does she refuse point blank in this instance to negotiate the reductions in rent with the landlords rather than through tenants who already are vulnerable?  The Department and not the tenant negotiates in the case of the rental accommodation scheme.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#JoanBurtonLAB" eId="spk_4" as="#Minister_for_Social_Protection">
            <from>Deputy Joan Burton</from>
            <p eId="para_11">The Deputy and I have discussed this issue previously.  Rent supplement is intended as a short-term renting scheme for people who have lost their jobs and who expect to find new employment within a short period.  Over the past decade, the numbers relying on this scheme have grown enormously.  The purpose of the scheme is to provide a rent supplement to persons who require that supplement because they are not in employment.  I have said previously that it is our intention to reform the scheme in a way that will provide for its transfer to the local authorities.  I agree with the Deputy in his reference to local authorities in regard to the rental accommodation scheme.  They have housing departments which are experts on the provision and acquisition of housing.  The community welfare service staff in my Department are not experts on housing, rather they are experts in giving monetary assistance on a monetary basis to persons in need of assistance and they do this with great consideration and care.  As I indicated to the Deputy, more than 25,000 rent supplement claims have been awarded to date in 2012.  One must bear in mind that the total number we anticipate this year is 92,000.  To date, we have had more than 25,000 people negotiating claims, of which 3,700 relate to this month.  That indicates that people are negotiating.</p>

            <p eId="para_12">We know people are negotiating and they are doing so from a position in which they are in severe distress.  They have no choice because the Minister will not meet her responsibility in that regard.  She mentioned the rental accommodation scheme.  Why are the numbers under that scheme reducing?  According to the Revised Estimates for public services in 2012, the numbers under the scheme have shrunk from 6,800 to 6,300 and the Minister has outlined her big solution.  We have argued about the issue previously and the Minister referred to the local authorities.  Why does she not give them some of the 230,000 vacant housing units across the State?  There are only 100,000 families on local authority housing lists.  They are the ones in need of accommodation and many of them are in receipt of rent supplement.  I have never supported the notion of the State subsidising private landlords.  I have always argued that it should provide social housing.  Why is the Minister not delivering the NAMA houses and the empty units around the country to the local authorities, rather than continuing to subsidise private landlords?</p>

            <p eId="para_13">The issue concerning the NAMA houses, an important potential resource, is under negotiation between my colleague, the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, and NAMA.  The Department of Social Protection commands approximately 40% of the private rental market.  There has been a fall at historic levels in the value of housing and property assets and the Deputy is seriously suggesting those who rent privately – they account for 60% of the private rental market - should have their rent driven up by the Department oin order to benefit private landlords.</p>

I have advised Deputy Aengus Ó Snodaigh that in the past five years the country has spent €2.36 billion on rent supplement.  That is a great deal of money in anybody's language.  I share any concern the Deputy may have about any individual in distress, but the officials in the Department, community welfare officers, have been extremely careful to be diligent towards those who are renting and who may have special requirements.</p>

            <p eId="para_49">15<b>Deputy Barry Cowen</b> asked the <b>Minister for Social Protection</b> if she will outline her plans to introduce statutory sick pay on employers for the first four weeks of illness; and if she will make a statement on the matter. [35041/12]</p>
          </question>
          <speech by="#JoanBurtonLAB" eId="spk_42" as="#Minister_for_Social_Protection">
            <from>Deputy Joan Burton</from>
            <p eId="para_50">From 2008 to 2011, inclusive, total expenditure on illness benefit, invalidity pension and disability allowance was €10.6 billion, of which €3.6 billion related to illness benefit.  It is estimated that expenditure on illness benefit in 2012 will be €847 million.  The introduction of a scheme of statutory sick pay, whereby employers would directly meet the costs of illness-related absence for an initial period of illness, is being considered in the context of the need to reform the social welfare system to bring it into line with practices in other countries in this area, the need to address the deficit in the social insurance fund and the need to limit progression from short-term illness to long-term illness or disability, as well as in the wider context of enhancing the health of the workforce and addressing absenteeism levels.</p>
            <p eId="para_51">Most other European countries, including all of our major competitors, oblige employers to pay for some sick pay costs.  The extent of this obligation varies considerably.  For example, it is two years in the Netherlands, 28 weeks in Northern Ireland and the UK, six weeks in Germany and nine days in Finland.  I will circulate a table with the Official Report which illustrates in a concise format the statutory sick pay arrangements in a range of other countries.</p>
            <p eId="para_52">A range of complex issues needs to be addressed before any decision can be taken by the Government on the possible introduction of such a scheme.  These include the extent of coverage, the duration of payment, the rate of payment, compensation mechanisms for smaller scale employers and how to ensure such a scheme would be enforced and policed.</p>
            <p eId="para_53">Earlier this year, I hosted a consultative forum on the feasibility and implications of introducing a scheme of statutory sick pay.  This afforded an opportunity to key stakeholders to discuss the complex issues involved.  All of these issues will be discussed in the course of the wider process associated with the preparation of the 2013 budget.</p>
            <p eId="para_54">Additional information not given on the floor of the House.</p>
            <p eId="para_55">Any decision which might be taken by the Government on the possible introduction of a scheme of statutory sick pay will be considered in that context.  One of my priorities in this regard is to promote wellness in the workplace and to address levels of absenteeism generally.</p>

            <p eId="para_120">The Minister said there needs to be more consultation in Government on this proposal.  Is she aware, however, that some Government backbenchers and one Cabinet member have stated they do not agree with her proposal?  Last week, the Deputy behind the Minister, Deputy Harris, said that the sick leave situation in Departments was three times more serious than in the private sector.  He suggested this should be dealt with before we examine sick leave arrangements in the private sector.  Is the Minister aware that small businesses and the self-employed are still awaiting legislation on upward-only rent reviews and proposals for new methods by which rates are calculated, let alone paid?  Is she aware that many of those whom she implies should be brought into this sick pay arrangement - taxation by the back door – cannot afford an arrangement which could possibly amount to €89 million in new taxation?</p>

            <p eId="para_123">I have stated on a number of occasions that in the context of the consultative forum held a short time ago, a statutory sick pay scheme would have to take into account the needs of different sectors of employment, particularly those small businesses, and other specific situations.  The costs relating to illness benefit, disability allowance and invalidity pension are enormous.  The number of people claiming these payments and the costs relating to them have soared in recent years.  I wish to put a point to Deputy Cowen.  All of our principal competitors have statutory sick pay systems and they have found - this is evident from published information and from conversations I have had with people from other countries - that it improves matters and provides for a much better atmosphere in places of work.  In other words, these systems lead to employers being interested in both the health and welfare of their employees and in promoting a wellness environment in the workplace.  The most up-to-date international research, including that compiled by the OECD over a protracted period, indicates that this is good for everybody.  It is a win-win situation for employers and employees.  It is particularly positive for employees who may develop problems and who, together with their employers, can actually access assistance in order to provide for their good health.</p>

            <p eId="para_124">I welcome that there has been some movement on this issue.  That is evident from the Minister's initial reply and her comment to the effect that proposals in this regard will be categorised.  In other words, the scheme will be based on an ability to pay and the needs of different categories of businesses to which it apply will have to be taken into consideration.  She also indicated there would be a saving of €89 million if employers paid the first four weeks of sick pay.</p>

            <p eId="para_128">At this stage of the Minister's quest to bring this scheme forward, is it the case that, in light of the dissent that is obvious within the ranks of Government backbenchers and among some of her Cabinet colleagues, the saving involved has been watered down by half?  What is being proposed does not go far enough.  It is not enough to state that everything will be categorised.  How is it proposed to categorise the scheme?  Will a table be produced - well in advance of any decisions the Minister might make - which will give an indication of who exactly is going to be lumped with paying this?</p>
            <p eId="para_129">I return to my initial point that this is merely taxation by the back door.  What provision will be made in respect of PRSI contributions, over and above those statutorily required, for self-employed people whose businesses might fail and who may need to claim benefits from the Department?</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#JoanBurtonLAB" eId="spk_52" as="#Minister_for_Social_Protection">
            <from>Deputy Joan Burton</from>
            <p eId="para_130">The savings indicated have been exactly the same on every occasion on which I have commented on this matter.  As stated earlier, introducing a statutory sick pay scheme involves a series of very detailed steps and an in-depth examination must be carried out.  Both the dialogue and the consultation process which have taken place indicate that all sick pay schemes generally take into account the needs of smaller firms.  There is no doubt, and the OECD frequently reports this fact, that Ireland is probably the only country which does not have a statutory sick pay scheme.</p>
            <p eId="para_131">I reiterate what I stated previously, namely, that except where companies, Departments or whatever have sick pay schemes in place, most employees, regardless of whether they work for small or large employers, pay for the first three days of their illness.  There is no proposal to change that.  The first three days of sick leave are not paid for by the employer, they are paid for by the individual.  Following this initial period, an employee is obliged to obtain a medical certificate from his or her doctor to claim illness benefit.  One of the issues some employers raised during the consultation - individuals dealing with occupational health issues were among the most prominent speakers - was the perception among employers, which I share, that there were serious issues about the way in which some medical practitioners issued sick notes.  This emerged as a significant issue for employers during the consultation process.  Having examined what employer groups such as Retail Ireland have stated about this issue, it is an important point.  At the end of the day we want to have good sick pay schemes for persons who are ill, while reducing the overall level of absenteeism.  I acknowledge that absenteeism is a significant problem in large parts of the public sector, although generally not among all employees but often among less than 25% where a pattern has been formed.  This information gathering is part of the process of looking at this important issue.</p>

            <from>Deputy Joan Burton</from>
            <p eId="para_132">I propose to take Questions Nos. 17 and 19 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_133">The Government is committed to tackling Ireland's economic crisis in a way that is fair, balanced and recognises the need for social solidarity.  The appropriate level of overall expenditure by the Department of Social Protection will be considered in the context of budget 2013 and subsequent budgets.  This consideration will be informed by the commitment in the programme for Government to maintain social welfare rates.</p>
            <p eId="para_134">Sustainable public finances are a prerequisite for future economic stability and growth, as well as being a prerequisite for maintaining and developing the social protection system.  The Government's priority is to secure economic recovery, promote growth and employment, and enhance our international reputation.  As Deputies will know, we are required to return to the 3% general Government deficit over a period of time, as set out in the Stability and Growth Pact.  The State must pursue a determined deficit reduction strategy.  Accordingly, there will be an ongoing requirement to curtail expenditure in 2013 and later years.</p>
            <p eId="para_135">There are a lot of challenges ahead and we want to protect, as far as possible, the key income supports and services operated by my Department.  These services and supports impact in some way on the lives of almost every single person in the State.  They are important to older people, children and those who have lost their employment following what was done to the banks by the previous Government.  The scope and scale of this expenditure play a key role in the wider economy.  Social welfare income support is widely recognised as being one of the most important forms of stimulus in European economies.</p>
            <p eId="para_136">There is no question of introducing changes by stealth.  If the Government decides to change eligibility rules or make other changes to achieve savings, any such measure will be announced in the budget and debated in this House.</p>
            <p eId="para_137">As regards the preparations for budget 2013, I will be holding a pre-budget forum in the autumn to which I will invite a wide range of organisations, including the Society of St. Vincent de Paul.  I will listen carefully to their submissions on the next budget.  In addition, I will take into account the views of the Money Advice and Budgeting Service which operates under the aegis of the Citizen's Information Board, an agency of my Department.  As part of the deliberative process for the next budget, the Department will analyse, in so far as possible, the distributive and poverty impact of possible welfare changes.  These impacts will be taken into account in arriving at final decisions on the budget.</p>
            <p eId="para_138">The Government's priority is to get the economy moving, restore confidence, fix the banking system and support the protection and creation of jobs.  The success of our economic plans will lay the foundations for the rest of our agenda for change.</p>

            <p eId="para_139">The report released by Social Justice Ireland confirms what many Deputies are aware of, particularly those who represent constituencies with high unemployment levels.  The gap between Ireland's rich and poor is spiralling out of control.  The disposable income of Ireland's poorest households fell by 18% in a single year.  By comparison, the income of the richest in Ireland rose by 4%.</p>

            <p eId="para_141">It is estimated that 10% of the population receive almost 14 times more in disposable income than the poorest who are experiencing the worst income distribution for over 30 years.  Some 200,000 children live in poverty.  My question is straightforward.  Based on the comments of organisation such as Social Justice Ireland and the Society of St. Vincent de Paul, a huge number of the people suffering from poverty are unemployed and in receipt of social welfare.  It is inconceivable to consider reducing social welfare rate based on much of what the Minister said when she was in opposition and what fine organisations such as Social Justice Ireland and the Society of St. Vincent de Paul have stated.  As we are in the final week of the Dáil session and before the Cabinet decides on the budget, I ask the Minister to relieve people's misery, because of the speculation and comment in some of the right-wing press that social welfare rates should be cut, by telling the 450,000 who rely on an income on which they can barely survive that their payments will not be touched or cut in the next budget.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#JoanBurtonLAB" eId="spk_57" as="#Minister_for_Social_Protection">
            <from>Deputy Joan Burton</from>
            <p eId="para_142">I cannot make any commitment about what will or will not be included in the budget.  That is a matter to be decided by the Government.  The announcement of the budget will be made in this House.  I acknowledge and share the Deputies' concerns that during this very difficult period for the economy we should protect those who are most vulnerable, particularly the elderly and people who have retired.  However, for people of working age, the best way to get back to financial independence is for the Government to assist them to get a job.  Most of those who, unfortunately, are languishing on the live register would love to have an opportunity to return to work.  That must be the focus of policy.  For that reason, I am reforming the system in the Department of Social Protection to provide for a process that will not be passive, whereby we leave people alone when they receive social welfare payments, rather we should give them options.  It is difficult to get a job, but many could return to school, training or education and take opportunities provided by internships.  We must expand the range of options available, as well as providing, when we roll out the new Pathways to Work programme, a more dedicated one-on-one service for persons who are unemployed.</p>

            <from>Deputy Joan Collins</from>
            <p eId="para_143">When I heard the Minister's reply to Deputy Aengus Ó Snodaigh's Question No. 16, I thought she was not living in the real world.  Her most reply indicates that she is definitely not living in the real world.  The income of Ireland's poorest households fell by 18%, while the rich got richer.  Is the Minister going to stand over this as a Labour Party Minister?  She asked people last year to elect her to protect them from this horrible gap between rich and poor.  Some 700,000 are living in poverty, of whom 200,000 are children.  The Minister has cut back on the lone parent allowance and the household package for the elderly.  She is leaving people more vulnerable.  I want to see a more aggressive approach being adopted by the Department to auditing how changes will have an impact on people.  There are international models for such an approach, including in Australia and Canada.  The Scottish Parliament, to give another example, conducts gender-based and poverty-based audits.  Will the Minister give a commitment to undertake such audits in respect of all proposed measures in advance of the budget?</p>

            <p eId="para_146">Deputy Joan Collins referred to the platform on which the Labour Party contested the last election.  That platform included a commitment to protect basic social welfare rates, which I am pleased to say was done in the budget for this year.  In addition, we ensured some 330,000 people on very low pay were taken out of the universal social charge net, which had an important impact for those affected.  One of my first actions as Minister was to reinstate the minimum wage.  We are in a period of unprecedented crisis in terms of the national finances, as a consequence of the collapse of the banking system.  Our objective in the budget was to oversee with fairness and compassion and in a targeted way the distribution of the €20 billion plus we are spending on social protection.  Deputy Collins might think that sum is not enough.  The overriding objective in all of this is to get people back to work.  That is why I reinstated the original level of the minimum wage, which the Deputy supported.</p>
            <p eId="para_147">In regard to pensioners, our system of payments and supports for older people means that pensioners in this country are among the least at risk of poverty in the European Union.  In fairness to it, Social Justice Ireland has fully acknowledge that in its reports.</p>

            <p eId="para_148">I remind the Minister that the Irish Association of Suicidology has indicated, based on international research, that for every one percentage point increase in unemployment, there is a 0.78% increase in the rate of suicide.  Let us be clear that as the economic situation worsens, human lives are at stake.  I urge the Minister to bear in mind the arguments put forward by those organisations working at the coalface to combat poverty in this country, as she was wont to do when in opposition.  She has indicated that she will meet representatives of Social Justice Ireland, the Society of St. Vincent de Paul and the money advice and budgeting service, among others.  Deputies, including those in the Minister's party, in constituencies with high unemployment, such as Waterford city in my constituency, are aware of how difficult things are for people.  There is no point in asking the Minister to increase social welfare rates, as should be done, because I know she will not do it.  I ask, however, that she at least not reduce them.</p>

            <p eId="para_149">The Minister is correct that the period referenced in the Social Justice Ireland report is 2009 to 2010.  She chose, however, to ignore that organisation's observation that current Government policy is making the situation worse.  The Minister cannot hide behind Fianna Fáil forever.  That party ruined this country, but it is the Minister's job now to protect those who require protection.  She has it in her gift to restore people's confidence in the Government.  People need protection, not compassion.  Will she put in place audits in regard to gender, poverty, impact on children and so on in advance of the cutbacks of more than €3.9 billion that will be introduced in the next budget?  It is worth bearing in mind that in 1945, under Churchill, the British establishment created the National Health Service at a time when that country's debt to GDP ratio was 240%.</p>

            <p eId="para_152">I am sure Deputy John Halligan from Waterford is aware of the work of Mr. Bevan from across the water in Wales.  Credit should be given where it is due, to the British Labour Party and to Mr. Bevan.</p>
            <p eId="para_153">To respond to Deputy Halligan's comments, unemployment is the most important issue we face.  Since becoming Minister, I have reinstated the minimum wage because it is vital that people avail of employment opportunities that become available.  Last year, 140,000 people left the live register to take up work.  Unemployment is also the reason I am reforming my Department and adopting a new approach that is much more active and provides for training needs.</p>
            <p eId="para_154">Years ago, I used to work in Waterford for months at a time.  I know how devastating the unemployment crisis has been in that city, with the loss of TalkTalk, the Waterford Crystal factory and other firms.  We must focus our efforts on employment.  For this reason, I established the national internship scheme, which has so far attracted 8,500 participants, of whom 5,000 are currently taking part in the scheme.  A further 4,500 people are taking part in the Tús scheme.  These schemes are alternatives for people in a tight and difficult jobs market.  I am working with my colleague, the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Ruairí Quinn, to address our inability to fill certain high-level jobs.  We need to redouble our efforts in the area of training to ensure local people on the live register have opportunities to fill vacancies in sectors such as high-level information technology, medical devices and pharmaceuticals.</p>

            <p eId="para_156">Total expenditure on the community employment programme in 2012 will be approximately €340 million.  The number of places available on the community employment programme has remained constant at 23,300, including supervisors.  The financial review of the schemes has been completed, and the Department has contacted schemes to advise them of their revised materials and training allocations.  The materials and training budget for community employment schemes has been increased by €9.5 million from the original budget of approximately €11 million following transfers from savings identified elsewhere in the departmental budget.  The new materials and training budget is thus €20.5 million.</p>
            <p eId="para_157">Under the revised arrangements, schemes will no longer be given universal amounts of financial support but will instead be provided with specific levels of support aimed at meeting the particular costs of community employment schemes, having regard to the overall level of funding available for community employment nationally.  To date, significant savings have already been made to the overheads of community employment projects in annual insurance costs and audit fees.</p>
            <p eId="para_158">I am not aware of any proposals to close community employment schemes following the outcome of the financial review.  I urge all schemes, supervisors and boards of management to work closely with officials of my Department to ensure community employment continues to play an important role in the provision of local community services, work experience and training opportunities.  I thank the many sponsors, staff and participants in community employment schemes who co-operated with the Department's review in a positive manner.</p>
            <p eId="para_159">On the training allocation for schemes, community employment participants may also access a number of Springboard, VEC and FÁS courses free of charge.

They were also notified of the details of their revised grants for the year.  The Minister also noted a slight increase of €9 million in materials and training grants from the originally budgeted figure of €11 million.  The allocations made to many community employment schemes have been cut by between 30% and 40%.  That will tip many of them over the edge in their efforts to continue in existence.  Given that it had been going on since the budgetary process in January, when was the review completed and placed on the Minister's desk?  When will she publish the plan for us to review?  In direct communications and also at the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Education and Social Protection, Deputy Ó Snodaigh and I have asked her to publish the plan.</p>

            <p eId="para_161">It was a very substantial piece of work because, as the Deputy knows, the FÁS employment officers and responsibility for the community employment, CE, schemes transferred to my Department on 1 January.  The review was a major undertaking and I received the report in recent weeks.  I do not have the exact date, which I can get for the Deputy, but it was towards the end of June.  As soon as I received it we contacted those involved with the schemes.  However, I was very impressed by the level of contact between the social protection officials, who are now managing CE, and the schemes.  I had the opportunity, which I greatly valued, to visit and meet a number of sponsors of schemes and those involved.  As there are almost 1,000 schemes, obviously I could not visit them all, but I visited very many of them and had very detailed discussions about how people envisage the schemes being used for the improvement and enhancement of their communities as well as providing quality experience to the participants.</p>

            <p eId="para_162">From my discussions with those involved in CE schemes in my constituencies and beyond, I have discovered extensive variations in the size of cuts.  In some cases those cuts will lead to possible closures of the schemes.  The Minister is very precise in saying the budgetary allocation towards that materials and training grant has increased from €9 million to €11 million in this year's budget spend.  Obviously it compares unfavourably with the allocations for last year and previous years.  Can the Minister say to me definitively - as definitively as she mentioned the increase in her initial allocation from €9 million to €11 million - the revised average cut taken by CE schemes?  It has been a long and drawn out process.  We all recognise and pay tribute to those involved in the schemes and the good work they do in their communities.  We acknowledge that and it goes without saying.  The process has taken a long time and been very labour intensive with intense negotiations and deliberations by the departmental officials in arriving at their conclusions.  Based on that process, surely the Minister can indicate the percentage cut to these CE schemes.</p>

            <p eId="para_163">Schemes have been allocated funding of between €500 and €1,000.  Approximately 6% of schemes have been allocated less than that because the process depended on two things: the submission and application the schemes themselves made and the availability of funding for both materials and training of up to €1,000.  Some schemes would have other forms of funding whereas other schemes might have almost no other sources of funding.

            <p eId="para_167">Illness benefit is a non-means-tested social insurance payment.  It is payable to people who are unable to work owing to illness, satisfy the relevant contribution conditions, are certified as unfit for work by a medical practitioner and aged under 66 years.  It is not payable for the first three days of an illness.  That cost is borne by the employee, except where there is a work scheme.  The benefit is payable for a maximum of two years or 104 weeks in respect of new claims made from January 2009.  During the period 2008 to 2011, inclusive, total expenditure on illness benefit was €3.6 billion and an estimated €846.5 million has been provided for in 2012.</p>
            <p eId="para_168">A total of 150,154 illness benefit claims were processed in the first six months of 2012.  To process such a large volume of claims expeditiously the Department prioritises the capture and maintenance of critical customer and claim records such as customer biographical data, information on pay-related social insurance, PRSI, contributions made, information on dependants, payment method and certified incapacity data.  The Department does not, however, maintain data on the sector of economy of illness benefit claims.  As a result, it is not possible to distinguish between claimants working in different sectors of the economy, including the public sector.   However, my Department is undertaking research to arrive at an estimate of illness benefit costs in the public and private sectors, respectively.</p>
            <p eId="para_169">Deputies will appreciate that a given claim is supported by a certified medical practitioner.  It is based on a person's personal public service, PPS, number and the system is geared to capture the contribution record of an individual to determine whether he or she qualifies for illness benefit and then to pay him or her.</p>

            <p eId="para_173">I propose to take Questions Nos. 21, 34 and 43 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_174">The Department is establishing the new national employment and entitlements service, NEES, which is central to the realisation of the Government's Pathways to Work policy.  As set out in the NEES project plan, published on the Department's website, the development of the NEES is a multi-annual programme to the end of 2014.</p>
            <p eId="para_175">The first step in establishing the NEES was integrating staff from FÁS, the community welfare services and the Department of Social Protection.  The integration which involved the transfer of almost 2,000 staff was completed on schedule in January this year.  The new body will facilitate the delivery of a one-stop-shop service to clients and greatly simplify the process.  Previously clients had to apply to three organisations for welfare and employment services.  The delivery of a one-stop-shop service is being piloted in four of the Department's offices and will be extended to a further ten offices by the end of the year.  Under these pilot schemes clients can receive a single decision on their welfare entitlements.  They are assessed to determine their employment services requirements and, following assessment, attend a group interview with subsequent one-to-one interviews.  Clients who do not engage with the process are placed on a penalty rate of payment.</p>
            <p eId="para_176">The delivery of such a personalised case management service is a resource-intensive process and as the service is rolled out, the Department intends to deploy more staff to this activity.  The staff will be redeployed from other functions in the Department and the wider public service.  The Department also intends to evaluate the potential to increase the role of the voluntary and not-for-profit sector, in particular the Local Employment Service Network, LESN.  Moreover, because of the need to address the unemployment crisis and develop flexibility, the Department is examining the potential of contracting with private sector providers as a means of supplementing its own resources in some case management and activation services.  In this regard, the Department is exploring several international models of private sector provision, including the not-for-profit and voluntary sectors, as well as for-profit organisations.  Any arrangements in this regard will be made within the framework of the Croke Park agreement.</p>

            <p eId="para_178">The targets set out in Pathways to Work are to be achieved in the period up to 2014.  This is a major change.  The first part of the year was spent taking in the new staff and integrating the three strands of staff, that is, the original Department of Social Protection staff; the former FÁS staff who, on 1 January, became civil servants and the former community welfare service staff who, on 1 October, became civil servants.  We have been working on the integration and rolling out the project in four offices on a pilot basis in Sligo, Arklow, King's Inns Street and Tallaght, Dublin.</p>
            <p eId="para_179">In terms of targets, we have put in place the engagement procedures whereby people are profiled for employment and education history and a prediction is made about whether they will be able to find a job.

They were formerly funded by FÁS.  The annual spend on these programmes is approximately €20 million.  There are other not-for-profit organisations such as Rehab which has been involved in Ireland and abroad in providing activation services.  We are examining best practice in a range of countries, especially countries in Scandinavia and others such as New Zealand, Australia, the United Kingdom and France.

            <p eId="para_183">I am committed to supporting people with a disability to participate more fully in society and enabling people to become more self-sufficient.  To do this it is necessary to provide supports which address barriers that people may face when entering and remaining in the workforce.  Earlier in the year I announced several initiatives in this area.  First, a scheme of partial capacity benefit, PCB, was introduced.  This scheme supports the progression of people with a disability to full open market employment by providing an opportunity for those with capacity to engage in open market employment to some degree and continue to receive an income support payment.  The intention is that the PCB will largely replace the exemptions system and address the limitations associated with the current system which categorises people as "able to work" or "unable to work" by concentrating on their ability to work.</p>
            <p eId="para_184">Second, existing programmes to support persons with disabilities are being consolidated as a national EmployAbility service, with the emphasis always on the ability of persons who may have a disability but are anxious and able to participate in the workplace with appropriate supports.  This EmployAbility service will provide a new impetus to persons with a disability and potential employers to focus on the positive benefits of ability and capacity to work.  In addition to job coaches, workplace adaptation grants are available on a small scale as part of this programme.</p>
            <p eId="para_185">Third, a wage subsidy scheme is also available to persons with a disability.  The objective of the scheme is to increase the numbers of persons with a disability in employment by creating, as far as practicable, a level playing field for them in seeking out or remaining in employment.</p>
            <p eId="para_186">Additional information not given on the floor of the House.</p>
            <p eId="para_187">The scheme provides payment of a wage subsidy to the employer to compensate for the reduced productivity of the worker with a disability.  The wage subsidies are designed to provide an incentive to employers and to look more closely at the potential of persons with a disability to meet their labour force requirements.  There are 946 registered on wage subsidy schemes.</p>
            <p eId="para_188">Fourth, the Department will announce shortly details on funding innovative projects in the Border, midland and western regions.  These projects will be designed to provide persons with a disability with appropriate progression, education and employment opportunities to enhance their access to employment.</p>
            <p eId="para_189">In addition, in May last, recipients of disability allowance became eligible to participate on the national internship scheme, JobBridge.  The measures outlined above will facilitate greater levels of recruitment of persons with a disability in open market employment.</p>

            <p eId="para_190">The programme for Government states, "We will also facilitate people with disabilities in achieving a greater level of participation in employment, training and education."  Many would say the opposite has occurred.  Despite the fact the workforce participation is significantly lower for individuals with a disability and those with a disability are more likely to be at risk of poverty, can the Minister substantiate that statement by virtue of her 18 months in office?  I would ask the Minister to provide, if not now then in the coming days, evidence-based information to prove that in the past 18 months she lived up to the commitment in the programme for Government to facilitate a greater level of participation in employment, training and education for those with a disability.  The evidence coming into my constituency from representations that I receive is to the contrary and I would like the Minister to put the matter right.</p>

            <from>Deputy Joan Burton</from>
            <p eId="para_191">As I stated, I have introduced a series of new options for persons with a disability.  The partial capacity benefit had been spoken of as a desirable development for many years but I am happy to say that since becoming Minister, I have gone ahead and introduced it.  That is an innovation which, over time, will bear fruit.</p>
            <p eId="para_192">Second, in the discussions on JobBridge, a number of Deputies and Senators raised with me the issue of persons with a disability being able to access JobBridge.  I am pleased to say I was able to expand the number of JobBridge places by 1,000 and to open, at the end of May, JobBridge applications to interested persons who were in receipt of a disability allowance or a lone parent's allowance.  That started at the end of May and I do not have statistics on its take-up.</p>
            <p eId="para_193">On EmployAbility, we place 2,800 persons with a disability and we are at the maximum capacity, but that is a scheme I have a strong interest in expanding.  In April we advertised a scheme, partially funded by the European Union, on innovative projects for persons with a disability and related organisations in the Border, midlands and western regions.  I sent a note to Deputies at the time.  We hope to be able to make an announcement on those example projects shortly.</p>

            <p eId="para_196">I propose to take Questions Nos. 23 and 27 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_197">The €100 rate of jobseeker's allowance was introduced for claimants aged under 20 in April 2009, and this rate was applied to claimants aged up to 21 from December 2009.  The €100 rate does not apply to certain categories of claimant, including those who were in the care of the HSE during the 12 months before they reached the age of 18.  A rate of €144 applies to claimants aged 22 to 24.</p>
            <p eId="para_198">The adoption of these measures reflects the need to encourage more young jobseekers to improve their skills by either pursuing further study or accessing a labour market programme, thereby reducing their risk of becoming long-term unemployed.  The aim is to assist young jobseekers to progress into sustainable employment on a long-term basis.  Where a young jobseeker is in receipt of a reduced rate and he or she pursues further study or accesses a labour market programme, the full normal rate of payment applicable to that course or scheme applies without any reduction for persons aged under 25.</p>
            <p eId="para_199">I understand that Deputies have been contacted with regard to these measures following a campaign by Focus Ireland.  My officials and I have met Focus Ireland on its concerns.  These are being examined and further discussions are planned.</p>
            <p eId="para_200">More generally, Deputies may wish to note that the Department, through its work in the homeless persons unit and the asylum seekers and new communities unit, provides assistance to persons in sourcing the most appropriate accommodation available.</p>

There are approximately 1,000 homeless in the Dublin city area.

            <from>Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett</from>
            <p eId="para_204">My question to the Minister is simple.  Whereas a person in the care of the homeless services retains his or her full social welfare, a person who becomes homeless between the ages of 18 and 24 does not get the full social welfare payment and, consequently, becomes trapped in homelessness because even if the person finds private rented accommodation and gets rent supplement, the person's income is so low that he or she cannot pay the rent.  As a result, it becomes more difficult for the person to access work because he or she must give as an address a homeless hostel.  What we are asking simply is that any young person who, at any point between the ages of 18 and 24, becomes homeless should be given the full social welfare entitlement so that he or she can get out of homelessness and can access other accommodation.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#JoanBurtonLAB" eId="spk_87" as="#Minister_for_Social_Protection">
            <from>Deputy Joan Burton</from>
            <p eId="para_205">My objective as a Minister is to ensure as far as possible that no young people in society go onto social welfare and that we provide a pathway for young people who may not be able to find work to continue to expand their education and training and to take up training positions and places from among the various options and opportunities we have laid out.  I cannot stress enough how important it is that young people should not be encouraged to go on social welfare and that they should be encouraged into an alternative of work and to become involved in education and training, and improving their skills and qualifications so that eventually they can become financially independent.</p>
            <p eId="para_206">In the budget, we provided specifically that young people leaving care would have arrangements through the HSE.  The homeless unit, in dealing with young people who become homeless, is acutely aware of the difficulties that befall young people in that situation.  The focus of public policy should be to encourage such young people into education and training or to take up options for the development of their skills.  As I said, if they do that, they then get a full rate of payment - that is what actually applies.  I would prefer to avoid sending out any kind of signal that would do other than encourage young people to stay in education and training or go into employment.  We do not want young people to find themselves in a position in which they become homeless and then probably enter into a very difficult period in their lives, where their chances of becoming financially independent are limited.</p>

            <p eId="para_207">I cannot believe I am hearing this from a Labour Party Minister.  This is the Michael McDowell school of economics - if we have inequality and if people are downtrodden, this will somehow act as an incentive for them to get a job.</p>
            <p eId="para_208">Does the Minister understand the question?  People who are homeless as a result of whatever circumstances led them into homelessness are trying to get out of homelessness and they are being prevented from doing so because, even if they access private rented accommodation and get rent supplement, the low level of social welfare income provided for them under the jobseeker's allowance - because of the cuts imposed by Fianna Fáil - means they cannot take up that accommodation and get onto the next step of the ladder to try to access employment and get back into society.  The question is simple.  For those between the ages of 18 and 24 who are homeless and trying to access homelessness services, will the Minister review the situation and give them the full social welfare entitlement of €188 so they can get out of homelessness, access private rented accommodation and, from there, apply for jobs?  It is very difficult to apply for a job from a homeless hostel.</p>

          <from>Deputy Micheál Martin</from>
          <p eId="para_220">Upskilling of the population and the workforce is stated as Government policy and it is a great pity this aspiration is not matched by policy decisions by Ministers.  The Taoiseach frequently mentions in the House PayPal and its announcement of 1,000 jobs as being great news for the people of the north east, which it is, and it is very welcome.  However, as the Taoiseach can see, its chief executive officer made a strong statement yesterday that she finds it extremely difficult to find local people with the necessary language skills to fill the jobs.  There are reports today the company has to recruit more than 500 workers with language skills from overseas.  The CEO said in a speech yesterday at the Louth economic forum that she continues to promote Ireland as a location for foreign direct investment but that it will have to address the languages problem.</p>
          <p eId="para_221">It seems to me - and I have looked hard - that the only response the Government has taken to the language agenda in our schools is to scrap the one innovative modern language initiative that was introduced back in 1999, under which we now have more than 550 schools teaching four modern languages at primary school level.  For some unknown reason and with no rationale, the Minister, Deputy Ruairí Quinn, decided to scrap that programme, which cost only €2 million a year.  This flies exactly in the face of what the CEO of PayPal is saying.  It goes to the heart of a Government that exercises itself more on spin than on substance that many of its decisions fly totally in the face of any logic or rationale, particularly in the context of this issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_222">It is interesting, for example, that across the water our competitors in the United Kingdom have decided to launch a new curriculum in primary schools which makes languages compulsory from the age of seven.  The British Labour Party had got rid of its compulsory programme for children under 14 and the result was a 32% reduction in the number of children who took languages in secondary school.</p>
          <p eId="para_223">Does the Government have a plan to address the different language requirements of foreign direct investors and of indigenous companies that export overseas?  Will it reverse the decision to scrap the modern languages initiative?</p>

          <p eId="para_224">No, we will not reverse that decision; we will take a different course.  Many schools are still operating alternative schemes to the pilot programme to which the Deputy referred.</p>
          <p eId="para_225">It is a fact that learning the Irish language is compulsory in this country.  It is also a fact that our students go to our own schools, go through the language course for up to 14 years and still cannot speak it fluently.  It is a fact of life.  The chief executive of PayPal made the point to me that 150 more people could be employed if they could have high-quality German speakers, and I do not mean just technical German but fluency in the language.  My view is that we should start this process much earlier.</p>

          <from>The Taoiseach</from>
          <p eId="para_227">Our children are no less intelligent than they ever were.  The surveys I carried out myself many years ago in the Department of Education showed that the Irish Celtic route is actually more favourable to learning languages than many others, and I suppose many students come here to learn English because of the quality of the language spoken by our young people in particular.  We need to start the process at a much lower level, at junior certificate level and before that, as languages are picked up by children in primary school without any great difficulty.</p>
          <p eId="para_228">It is the teaching methods that are critical here.  The Deputy, as a former múinteoir, knows this himself.  It is now easy to learn modern languages in so many ways, given the facilities.  We should look at what we have done.  After 70 years, the vast majority of young people leaving the secondary school system are still not conversant in the language of their native country.  The Deputy speaks about compulsion and the Labour Party in England.  That is a matter for it.  We have a compulsory language, and it has not delivered in the context of fluency.</p>
          <p eId="para_229">I share the view of the chief executive that we could do so much more in terms of modern languages.  We are in the top 20 globally in terms of competitiveness.  We are in the top three in terms of availability and flexibility of workforce.  We are in the top three in terms of the productivity of our workers.  Language is very specialist.  In a global sense, when that particular company deals with different dialects, it needs fluency.  That is an issue we as a people should be able to address and that Government will address.  I would like to think that when multinationals and foreign direct investment companies make the decision to site here they do so for a package of issues be it tax, technology, track record or talent and in that talent there is always an issue for language fluency.</p>
          <p eId="para_230">In the Deputy's county recently I spoke to people in a number of multinationals where the receptionists deal with different languages.  Some of them are international; some are Irish.  I spoke to somebody the other day about the Japanese companies which come here.  One firm has a Donegal native who speaks fluent Japanese and has been doing so for many years.  There is no restriction upon us in having the competence to learn languages fluently.  It is a combination of teaching method, and the capacity to teach it properly, that makes our young people aware of the opportunities that come from being able to speak language with the fluency required by business these days.</p>

          <from>Deputy Gerry Adams</from>
          <p eId="para_261">I raise the issue of symphysiotomy of which the Taoiseach is very aware.  It is an 18th century surgical operation performed on women that unhinges the pelvis and splits the pubic joint and its ligaments with a surgical knife or a saw.  Patients were rarely asked for their consent.  They were never told of the nature of the surgery or its risks or offered the safer alternatives of Caesarian section.</p>
          <p eId="para_262">In my constituency, 350 of the estimated 1,500 symphysiotomies were carried out, many without the consent of the women victimised by this procedure.  There have been statements in the Dáil and in the Seanad on this issue.  In opposition both Government parties, including the Minister for Health, gave their support to the women involved.</p>
          <p eId="para_263">There are approximately 200 survivors, some of whom are becoming quite frail.  They are all very elderly agus níl aon dabht ann ach go ndearnadh éagóir uafásach ar na mná seo agus tá siad ag lorg birt ar a son de bharr an dochar a rinneadh orthu.  Rinneadh brúidiúlacht ar a gcorp agus loiteadh a saol dá bharr.  Tá sé thar am go ndéanfar an rud ceart agus cóir dóibh.  All of the women involved, and we had them in here recently, bear deep physical and emotional scars.</p>
          <p eId="para_264">I ask the Taoiseach to ensure that justice is done for these women by introducing legislation to lift the Statute of Limitations for 12 months to ensure that those who want to can seek redress through the courts.  This was done previously regarding the issue of child abuse.  Will the Government bring forward this legislation and, if so, will it do so early in the new Dáil term?</p>

I was struck by the words of the woman involved who said that while it happened many years ago, she still goes to bed at night with that pain and wakes up with it every morning.</p>
          <p eId="para_266">I understand there are several hundred people involved who may wish to take recourse to the courts.  In regard to that matter, obviously they will take legal advice on the route to follow.  The Minister for Health will consider the Deputy's request.</p>

        <speech by="#GerryAdams" eId="spk_135">
          <from>Deputy Gerry Adams</from>
          <p eId="para_267">To be clear, the woman who won the recent court case, and she is a constituent of mine, basically did so on a technicality.  She was at pains to point out that this does not apply to the vast majority of the survivors of symphysiotomy.</p>
          <p eId="para_268">I have here the Statute of Limitations (Amendment) Act.  I imagine introducing the legislation I request would get the support of every Deputy in this Chamber.  These are very brave women.  They have long campaigned for truth and justice.  The Taoiseach is right.  This was an act of barbarism.  There is all-party support for this issue.  When the Taoiseach was in opposition he supported them.  The Minister for Health moved a motion in support and therefore there is an imperative that the Statute of Limitations is lifted.  That is what is preventing those women who want to go to court from taking that avenue.</p>
          <p eId="para_269">Sinn Féin could introduce a Private Members' Bill and if it comes to it, we will but this is not a party political issue.  This is an issue the Government should make time for and which I am sure all the parties in this Dáil would support.  It is the very least we could do.  Many people have been afflicted by injustice, and this did not happen on the Taoiseach's watch, but these women suffered major trauma.  We can rectify that in so far as it is possible to show them that we, as legislators, are prepared to uphold their rights as citizens.  I appeal to the Taoiseach to give a commitment to lift the Statute of Limitations for just 12 months.</p>

The Minister, Deputy Reilly, is studying the court judgment, which was very clear in respect of the person from County Louth who was courageous enough to appear on television and to give her views, both about the court case - which she won on a technicality, as the Deputy said - but also about the pain she feels every night and morning as a result of a treatment that was carried out many years ago.</p>

          <p eId="para_278">In the programme for Government the Taoiseach stated:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_279">[O]ur parties are committed to protecting the vulnerable and to burden-sharing on an equitable basis.  Fianna Fáil presided over an unequal and increasingly divided Ireland. We are both committed to forging a new Ireland that is built on fairness and equal citizenship.</p>
          <p eId="para_280">They are fine words but the facts revealed this week confirm again that the opposite is the truth under the Government.  Social Justice Ireland shows that while the poorest people in society have seen their income drop by 18% in the past year, the wealthiest 10% have seen their income increase by 4% and that the gap between the richest and the poorest has opened dramatically in recent years.</p>
          <p eId="para_281">When we say that one should tax the wealthy in this country, the Taoiseach claims there is no pot of gold.  I got shocking replies from the Minister for Finance about the earnings of the wealthiest people in society last week and how much tax they paid.  They showed a very low level of effective taxes on the wealthiest in society.  For example, the top 10,000 earners earned just under €6 billion last year, an average of €595,000 each, and paid an effective tax rate of only 29%.  That information came from the Department of Finance.</p>
          <p eId="para_282">What everyone on the street knows is now official: the rich are getting richer and the poor are getting poorer.  Working people and the least well-off are getting it in the neck with austerity while the rich are being protected.  What is the Taoiseach going to do about it?  Is he going to address the inequality and unfairness and is he going to impose taxes on the super-wealthy who can afford it or will he continue to slaughter the poor, the vulnerable and the working people?</p>

          <p eId="para_290">The Central Statistics Office pointed out that the basic rates are now higher than they were even at the height of the boom.  The Government is cognisant of the pressure on people.  We did not increase income tax and we did not reduce the basic rates of social welfare.  We removed the requirement on 330,000 to pay the universal social charge and we reversed the minimum wage.  It was much to the annoyance of some people that it could be done by negotiation with the troika.</p>
          <p eId="para_291">The answer to the problem is employment.  That is why the Government announced today, in addition to the €17 billion capital programme for the period of the Government's lifetime, €2 billion to cover investment in schools, primary care centres, a number of justice buildings and the major development in the inner city of the Grangegorman DIT facility to tie all those strands together.  These matters are the focus of Government which is why the Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, is in Frankfurt today speaking to Mr. Draghi in respect of the decision by the European Council to break the link between sovereign debt and banking debt and that the deal that can be got for this country would be at the highest level possible so that confidence can be restored to the indigenous economy and that we can get people back to work.

While the road ahead is still challenging, the Government, in its collective decision in dealing with the budget for 2013, will do so on the basis of protecting the most vulnerable and at the same time understanding that the elderly population must be cherished and respected for what they did for this country in times that were far more difficult than now.

            <p eId="para_313">I accept the Taoiseach's reply.  Does he accept there is a broad principle across the public service that, where possible, those who have retired should not be re-employed and that opportunities should be given to younger people and those seeking jobs for the first time to gain experience and opportunities?</p>

            <p eId="para_314">I do, of course, accept that principle.  It is only right and proper that where young people have the qualifications and the opportunity, they should be given it.  Information received by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform shows the number of re-engagements of retired civil servants at 850 for 2010, 767 for 2011, and 70 for 2012.  In implementing the principle that I stand by, that should happen where it is possible.  Deputy Martin will understand that some retired public servants have a particular specialty and they are often brought back on a specific contract, as distinct from being employed again on the basis of having retired and drawing a pension.  I accept the principle and, in so far as we can, we implement it.</p>

I refer to arrangements that allowed them to operate companies in the United Kingdom from which their services were then provided for the Minister for Health.  This pertains to the advisers who had been recruited.  It was reported some time ago in <i>The Sunday Business Post</i> - I raised this issue with the Taoiseach - that people were being employed as advisers to the Minister for Health but through companies located in the United Kingdom and that in consequence they, apparently, were legally avoiding the necessity to pay tax in this country.

However, a figure of 850 still constitutes 850 too many, given current unemployment rates.  I note that it was revealed last week that rules aimed at curtailing the amounts retired public service staff could earn if they returned to State employment were not applied if such individuals' services were provided through employment agencies.  Is this the case and does it affect, for example, the single person employed in the Taoiseach's Department?  Is the introduction of rules to prevent this from recurring planned or anticipated?</p>

I continue to have these concerns which I believe to be well founded and widely shared.  My remarks were intended to highlight the remarkably small volume of documentation held in the Department of the Taoiseach from the night of the bank guarantee, which bears out these widely held concerns.  I did not intend to suggest I had evidence the documentation relating to the bank guarantee had been destroyed or otherwise removed.  I have since clarified the position on the record of the House in response to a question from Deputy Michael McGrath.</p>

The only possible construction on what the Taoiseach said is he believed records might have been shredded.  It is the only reason he would have said it.  He has been in sole charge of Government Buildings since early last year and it is unacceptable to throw out conspiracies like a man standing at the bar in a pub.  It is beneath his office and he should have the decency to withdraw his statement fully and without equivocation.</p>
            <p eId="para_329">In addition, the Taoiseach is oversimplifying a serious decision on a bank guarantee for which he and his party voted.  To quote him at the time, they did so "in the interests of the country, in the interests of protecting our economy and to protect the interests of our taxpayers."  This is the precise reason the previous Government made the decision itself.  I do not know why the Taoiseach-----</p>

With modern digital technology, I have seen some leaders texting or sending information out, too.

The Committee of Public Accounts should be allowed get on with its work in this regard, having already put in six months of significant work on the issues around the bank guarantee, the collapse of the banks and the banking crisis not just here but across the world.  This is the worst banking crisis since the late 1920s.  It has been unprecedented.  What faced the Government the last time was unprecedented as well.  The Taoiseach knows that in all sincerity.  Putting the politics to one side, those are the issues.  We need to find out, first, why the banks collapsed and, second, the policy response to that collapse which was the bank guarantee.</p>

Will the Taoiseach assure the House that we will not witness an unacceptable undermining of the status of the Committee of Public Accounts?

            <from>The Taoiseach</from>
            <p eId="para_516">I propose to take Questions Nos. 6 and 7 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_517">My Department will shortly be consulting Departments generally about the question of publication of regulatory impact analyses carried out before Government decisions are taken.  I draw the Deputy's attention to the fact that the Government has, in a number of instances, been publishing the general schemes of Bills and referring them to Oireachtas committees for consideration in advance of publishing the related Bill.</p>
            <p eId="para_518">As regards the rationalisation of regulators, given the radical changes in the Irish economic environment in recent years, there is a need to reassess and reframe the role of regulators as a central part of Ireland's recovery.  In particular, the creation of an investment-friendly environment that encourages job creation, at lowest cost to business and consumers, should be an important factor in the overall work of all regulatory bodies in Ireland.  This is captured in the programme for Government commitment on economic regulation.  In that context and under a commitment in the action plan for jobs, Forfás is undertaking a study to identify changes in the operation of sectoral regulators that would enhance cost competitiveness.  The Forfás study which is expected to be completed later this year and the recommendations arising will provide an important evidence base and input into work on the effectiveness of economic regulation more generally as envisaged in the programme for Government which is being co-ordinated by my Department.</p>
            <p eId="para_519">Given the multifaceted nature of the overall regulation agenda and the need for clarity and certainty for businesses and consumers, the Government recently confirmed the assignment of lead responsibility in respect of the various functions in this area across a number of relevant Departments.  As with other major policy areas of government, overall strategic co-ordination and work on economic regulation in general will be overseen and progressed at Cabinet committee level.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#MichaelMartin" eId="spk_354">
            <from>Deputy Micheál Martin</from>
            <p eId="para_520">It is difficult to make much of the Taoiseach's reply which has been scripted in such a way as to avoid specifics.  In the context of regulatory impact assessments being made before Government decisions are taken, do I understand from the initial part of the reply that this is not quite happening as normal in respect of legislation being brought forward?  Is there a requirement to produce regulatory impact assessments in respect of all items of legislation before they are published and prior to the taking of all Government decisions?</p>
            <p eId="para_521">The consumer and competition Bill has been delayed on three occasions.  Is the Taoiseach in a position to outline the progress made in promoting the interests of consumers in the context of rationalising the position on regulators generally?  The rationalisation of regulators has its origins in the many statements made by the Taoiseach and the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Phil Hogan, when they were in opposition.  The Minister, in particular, wanted to rationalise the position to such an extent that there would be a single regulator who would have responsibility for all areas.  I do not get the sense that we are moving in that direction.  If anything, we are moving towards creating even further regulators.  I refer to the Government's proposals to appoint a regulator with responsibility for water services.  I would like the Taoiseach to clarify the position on the points I have made.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#EndaKenny" as="#Taoiseach" eId="spk_355">
            <from>The Taoiseach</from>
            <p eId="para_522">The programme for Government states, "We will require Departments to carry out and publish Regulatory Impact Assessments (RIAs) before Government decisions are taken".  As the Deputy is aware, regulatory impact assessments involve an examination of the likely impact of proposed new regulations or regulatory changes.  They help to identify side-effects or hidden costs associated with regulation and clarify the likely outcome of proposed changes.  During the assessment process everyone affected is entitled to ensure his or her views and interests are understood.</p>
            <p eId="para_523">All Bills have not been referred to the Cabinet or Oireachtas committees prior to publication.  My Department is taking the lead in this matter and will consult all other Departments on it.  I expect that the process in this regard will be completed in the autumn.  The Government will then consider how to implement what is proposed.  The heads of Bills are being published more frequently.  This is not happening as often as I would like, but they are being published more frequently and referred to the relevant Oireachtas committees, which is good.  Where committees have considered the heads of Bills, they have made some very pertinent points.  The quality of the consultation in this regard has assisted the process relating to taking a Bill on Second and Committee Stages, when matters go that far.</p>
            <p eId="para_524">I referred to the multifaceted nature of the overall regulation agenda and the need for certainty regarding the allocation of responsibilities.  In that regard, the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation has responsibility for reducing red tape and administrative burdens, dealing with competition issues and representing Ireland at EU-OECD international fora dealing with regulation, the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform has responsibility for dealing with regulatory impact assessments, that is, training, support, monitoring and compliance, while the Department of the Taoiseach has responsibility for dealing with the effectiveness of economic regulators.  In addition, the Department of the Taoiseach and the Office of the Attorney General have responsibility for dealing with the transparency and quality of regulation.</p>
            <p eId="para_525">As I have already informed the Deputy, my Department is involved in consultations with all other Departments and we expect to conclude the process by early autumn.  We will then make a Government decision on implementing the programme and see to it that all Departments publish regulatory impact assessments before Government decisions are taken.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#MichaelMartin" eId="spk_356">
            <from>Deputy Micheál Martin</from>
            <p eId="para_526">Many business concerns state they are over-regulated.  That was also said to be the case in the financial world for a long period.  The Government's policy is to reduce regulation and the regulatory burden and also to simplify regulations in order to avoid duplication.  The position of the European Union and the OECD is the same.  However, every European directive brought forward will, in all likelihood, increase the regulatory burden on somebody somewhere in the context of their business.  I do not get a sense that, either at official level across Departments or at Oireachtas level, penetration is being achieved on the regulatory issue.  There is no indication that people are shouting, "Halt", that they are taking stock or that they are bringing forward alternative or simple mechanisms.</p>
            <p eId="para_527">I do not intend what I am about to say in a partisan way, but the Taoiseach has referred to three or four Departments which are dealing with different bodies internationally.  That sounds itsy bitsy and somewhat all over the place.  In the context of the Government, the European Union and the various Oireachtas committees which deal with it, we need a far more simple approach to dealing with regulation that is coming down the tracks and a more honest approach to assessing what will be the impact of such regulation on businesses and sectoral interests and how it may relate to costs and jobs.</p>

          <speech by="#EndaKenny" as="#Taoiseach" eId="spk_357">
            <from>The Taoiseach</from>
            <p eId="para_528">I do not disagree with this principle.  The Department of Finance has produced a report which was brought before us just today which outlines the reductions achieved in the administrative and red-tape bureaucracy associated with the Revenue Commissioners.  I understand Revenue measured up in all areas in this regard, except in the area of VAT.  I have indicated that the Departments of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Public Expenditure and Reform and the Taoiseach and the Office of the Attorney General have been allocated lead responsibility in a number of the areas to which I refer in the context of starting a process of co-ordination.  I recall talking to the Mayor of Chicago, Mr. Rahm Emanuel, who informed me that in order to establish any kind of an enterprise in that city one required well over 100 licences.  He then stated that because of the authority invested in him, he had been able to reduce the burden in this regard by up to two thirds.  In so far as businesses and retail outlets in this country are concerned, the Minister of State at the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy John Perry, is considering what is involved.  Some of the licences which apply in Ireland have European connotations and reducing their number is not as simple as one might think.  The Nice treaty stated we should reduce bureaucratic red tape by 25% and this has been an aspiration for a long time.  While it is not where I would like it to be, it is taking shape.  I hope that by mid-autumn we will be in a position to publish our decision in respect of having the process right for publishing all of these in order that Deputies and others involved will have that information before the Government decision is made.</p>

            <p eId="para_529">I have one question about consumer regulators.  The National Consumer Agency was established in 2007 to protect and promote consumers' rights.  In 2008, it was announced that it would be amalgamated with the Competition Authority which, it appears to me, is a totally different body responsible for enforcing Irish and European competition law.  The National Consumer Agency has a good record of defending consumer rights in a number of disputes, including the one involving Aer Lingus.  It is now 2012, so can the Taoiseach give us some sense of where this merger stands?  Will legislation be introduced and, if so, when?  Can the Taoiseach give a commitment that this merger will not in any way reduce the service provided and the role played by the National Consumer Agency in defending and promoting consumers' rights?</p>

The members have met 25 times so far this year, most recently on 12 July, and have met 12 times since the Easter recess.  The Government has been working closely with the Irish banks to ensure that the banking sector supports economic recovery.  The members of the council last met with the banks on 26 June.  The general topic of the meeting was mortgage arrears and new mortgage lending.  The timing of the meeting coincided with the Government's decision to publish the personal insolvency legislation.  During the meeting, members of the council took the opportunity to set out the Government's commitment to assisting those in mortgage arrears and set out our strategy to address mortgage arrears difficulties.  The council also took the opportunity to seek assurances from all of the banks that they are fully committed to addressing the mortgage arrears of their customers.</p>

            <p eId="para_535">Did the Taoiseach deal with the issue of tracker mortgages with the banks?</p>
            <p eId="para_536">The European Central Bank cut rates earlier this month but most of the 250,000 variable rate mortgage holders are not expected to benefit from that.  AIB, EBS, National Irish Bank, Bank of Ireland, KBC Bank and Irish Nationwide are still considering whether to pass on the latest cut.  Did the Taoiseach take the opportunity to raise that matter with the banks?</p>
            <p eId="para_537">Did he raise the issue of bank branch closures, which will have a significant social consequence, particularly in rural areas?  According to the figures, upwards of 200 bank branches are threatened with closure, which will make it difficult for people in rural communities to bank locally.</p>

          <speech by="#EndaKenny" as="#Taoiseach" eId="spk_364">
            <from>The Taoiseach</from>
            <p eId="para_539">The Economic Management Council has met with the banks on a number of occasions.  On the last occasion we had a series of questions about SME credit, including how banks are ensuring that their targets will be met, whether they are taking practical initiatives to assist SMEs in obtaining credit, and whether they show a willingness to implement and support the Government's initiatives as set out in the action plan on jobs.  There was also a discussion on the Government's proposed microfinance agency and the partial loan credit guarantee report on freeing up access to credit for small businesses.</p>
            <p eId="para_540">With regard to mortgage credit, we asked how banks were ensuring that credit is available to support the Government's budget initiative on first-time buyers, whereby they will have access to mortgage interest relief this year and for years to come if they buy in 2012, but not if they buy in 2013.  We asked what checks and balances there are to ensure that conditions on mortgage credit are fair, balanced and not unduly restrictive.  We also asked the banks for an analysis of the differences in what is happening in the various regions.  In some parts of Dublin city house prices have begun to rise to a small extent, while in other areas prices are continuing to fall or there is a slight fluctuation.</p>
            <p eId="para_541">We want to see banks supporting the mortgage interest relief initiative.  We sought examples of how banks were dealing with difficulties in regard to mortgage arrears, asked whether they were sitting down with customers to work out solutions in these cases, and asked about their implementation of the Keane report.</p>
            <p eId="para_542">At the last meeting, we indicated that we intended to publish the Personal Insolvency Bill and two days later the banks came out with a range of facilities they were offering.  That is part of a regular process of meetings with the banks to ensure that the focus is kept where it should be.  The pillar banks are both committed to lending €3.5 billion of new money this year.  That is for approval for new loans as distinct from loans that are not drawn down.  I hope the banks will keep to those targets.</p>
            <p eId="para_543">Banks have been encouraged to get back out into the workplace and inform people that they have money to lend, which is available under the normal rules.  The Deputy asked for examples of the types of business that have been funded by banks.  While funding is not as extensive as one would wish, it is beginning to happen.  I hope that will continue.  It is a measure of the confidence that is returning to the indigenous economy, which has been very flat for quite some time.</p>
            <p eId="para_544">In moving around the country, I have seen that in general the number of new business start-ups is quite encouraging.  I know that some businesses have gone to the wall but there are also people who are putting their money where the challenge is.  They are measuring up and starting off new small and medium-sized businesses.  It is great to see people who are prepared to put their own money into initiatives where they can get access to credit and employ up to ten people where they see such opportunities.</p>

            <p eId="para_545">I appreciate that the main focus of the Taoiseach's meeting concerned the Government's Personal Insolvency Bill.  Sinn Féin has welcomed the publication of that legislation but we are disappointed that the banks are being allowed to have a veto.  Would the Government consider an independent agency, as we have sought, which is empowered to enforce legally binding settlements on debtors and creditors?</p>
            <p eId="para_546">Did the banks give the Taoiseach an assurance that they would work within the terms of the Bill and engage constructively with mortgage holders?</p>
            <p eId="para_547">Has the Taoiseach had any opportunity to consider the apparent change in the European Central Bank's policy on burning senior bondholders?  If press reports of remarks by the ECB president, Mr. Draghi, are correct, this would be a significant change.  Has the Taoiseach had an opportunity to consider the matter?  Can he cast any light on reports that Mr. Draghi's proposals for the Spanish banks were rejected by EU finance ministers?  I do not know whether that is true, but perhaps the Taoiseach has an inside line on it.</p>

            <p eId="para_548">To answer the Deputy's first question on the Personal Insolvency Bill, I met with a number of representatives of Money Advice and Budgeting Service organisations around the country, which have been dealing with debt and distress arising from credit cards, car loans and other financial issues, as distinct from mortgages.  If people wish to go down the road of personal insolvency under the legislation, a personal financial statement must be prepared.  Under the legislation, they have access to skilled accountancy expertise for two hours, which is paid for by the banks.  At that stage, they are required to put up all the information about their indebtedness.  The point made by MABS was that it would prefer a more comprehensive response.  If someone is going down the road of personal insolvency resolution, all indebtedness must come to light, including the expertise that the MABS personnel had been dealing with, together with the expertise available from accountants, which will come from a panel of accountants.</p>
            <p eId="para_549">As far as the ECB is concerned, the matter was discussed at the eurogroup meeting.  There were differences of opinion and the matter has not been finalised.  Ireland has paid off most of the bondholders for the past number of years.  The requirement is for Ireland to get the best deal it can on the outcome of European Council meeting, where the eurogroup was charged with putting flesh on the decision.  That is part of the reason the Minister for Finance is in Frankfurt speaking to Mr. Draghi.  This country has paid off the bondholders but, in the case of Spain, I understand it is talking about banks that would become defunct.  The impending crisis meant the Spanish Government of the day encouraged people to save and some of those savers may get caught in that situation if it was to apply in Spain.  Irrespective of the decision on Spain, we want the best possible deal for our restructuring of debt.  The fact the European Council meeting made a specific point about equality of treatment is important.  At the eurogroup meeting, that was followed by similar requirements in respect of Ireland.  The matter has not been concluded.  Members are aware of the statement of Commissioner Rehn that he would like to see this concluded for Ireland by October.  The approach has been endorsed by Commissioner Barnier, the IMF and Europe, which has been far more supportive of the challenge faced by the Irish people in regard to safeguarding Europe and meeting the challenge.  Now is the time for analysis and negotiation so we can have the best deal possible secured for our people arising from these negotiations, which will take place between now and October.</p>

            <p eId="para_550">There was widespread disappointment at the Personal Insolvency Bill.  It failed to do what should have been done, which is to provide for the writing down of unsustainable mortgage debt left on the backs of people through no fault of their own.  It happened because of the pumping up of the property bubble by the banks, the developers and their friends, Fianna Fáil, in government at the time.  People have been left with this disastrous situation, which is no fault of their own.  They hoped there would be real relief in writing down the debt and recognising it was a debt artificially created by the greedy and imposed on the back of people who want nothing more than to put a roof over their heads.

            <p eId="para_556">I am not too sure Deputy Boyd Barrett would recognise a happy day if he saw one.  Does he think we live at one remove from ordinary people?  Does he not think people walk in to the offices of members of Government parties to talk about their problems?  Does he not think they express their concerns, anxiety and distress about the challenge they face every day in their lives?  They do, and the Personal Insolvency Bill is an incentive for banks to get on with it.  They have been recapitalised to the extent that they can deal with mortgage arrears, mortgage distress and people's concerns.  At the Economic Management Council meetings, we have encouraged the banks to put teams together to sit down with people, to work out solutions from the Keane report or from another facility, such as mortgage to rent, split mortgages, mortgage to lease or part write-downs without having recourse to personal insolvency.  There is a real incentive for the banks and lending institutions to sit down with their customers and work out individual solutions.  That is what it takes because a particular formula does not fit every case.  Each case is different given the human circumstances, where the people live, and whether they are working.  We encourage that process.</p>
            <p eId="para_557">In the case of Deputy Boyd Barrett, impossible is the measure of his satisfaction.  I do not know who Deputy Boyd Barrett meets in his constituency or whether he has a good word to say about anybody ever.  We tried to help in the best way we can those who are in distress and who have concerns and anxieties.  For Deputy Boyd Barrett to suggest you do not meet people like this everyday is complete and utter nonsense.</p>

            <p eId="para_572">-----the fact that the Keane report produced recommendations on how to bring about a resolution for distressed mortgages and those in arrears and in difficulties, is the reason the lending institutions have an incentive to sit down with everyone and work out an individual solution for each case.  There are those who have had solutions worked out where the house is not being taken from them, where one of a variety of things has been put in place and people know they will have a roof over their heads and have a sense of an end in sight for their problems.  It works both ways because people make adjustments and the lending institutions make adjustments.  That is why the taxpayer recapitalised banks to that extent.  Banks said they need to put teams of competent people in place in order to do so.  The trend in banks for many years was to throw out money.  The more they threw out, the more they got paid.  This seemed a complete contradiction and certainly led to this country standing on the cliff edge.  I share the Deputy's view in that regard.</p>

          <p eId="para_619">I assume the Deputy is referring to provisions regarding the separation of alcohol for sale in outlets.  The Minister has his documentation ready in that regard.  That 2,000 hospital beds throughout the State are taken up every night by people fuelled with drink is an appalling statistic.  The Minister of State at the Department of Health, Deputy Róisín Shortall, has been working on a range of propositions in regard to the sale of alcohol.  We had a good discussion about this issue at the Cabinet sub-committee on social affairs some time ago.  The agreement at the conclusion of the meeting was that the Minister would reflect upon the issues that were raised and the good range of comments that were made and would bring her findings back to the next meeting of the Cabinet sub-committee, which would be entirely devoted to the question of alcohol.  This matter is of the most serious import given what happened, along with drug abuse, in the Phoenix Park recently with horrendous consequences.  I saw some sort of an altercation on Talbot Street in one of the videos one sees on the newspaper websites in which somebody kicked somebody else in the head.  It was absolutely appalling.  This issue is of major significance and must be dealt with correctly.</p>

It will come back to the Cabinet sub-committee on social policy's next meeting, which will be devoted fully to this matter.  We will include in that the recommendations of the Minister, Deputy Shatter, in regard to the sections of the 2008 Act.  We will, in the most comprehensive way we can, bring it to the House and have a proper discussion about it.</p>

On critical infrastructure legislation, last week I raised with the Taoiseach and the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine the critical situation facing farmers.

          <p eId="para_629">The Minister has commented on this matter publicly and, as the Deputy will be aware, sections of the single payment have been brought forward.  Clearly, the bad weather has exacerbated the position.  I note today's reports that farmers could lose up to €250 per head through the drop in the value of cattle caused by this problem.  The situation has been exacerbated by the flooding of 100,000 acres on the wetlands of the River Shannon.</p>

          <p eId="para_631">The problem is that there has never been any management structure in place to look at that issue to see what could be done.  It is not a case of going back to drain the river.  Much more sophisticated early warning systems are needed, and a system that operates to the best advantage of everybody.  For years, farmers have had to put up with winter flooding but nothing of the scale of the current summer flooding which has devastated the incomes of many.</p>

When will legislation be introduced to implement minimum pricing for alcohol, which is a key part of the national substance misuse strategy?  In view of the finding of a recent report commissioned by the National Suicide Research Foundation that up to 80% of suicides of young males were related to alcohol or substance abuse, this is clearly an issue of major importance.</p>

          <p eId="para_642">Unfortunately, it is true in my experience that drink and drugs are involved in the vast majority of cases resulting in self-harm or suicide.

When it concludes its discussions the Government will make its collective decision and we can all debate it in the House.  I listened to the points made about the urgency of this issue but it is also important to get it right.  Somebody brought to my attention last week that on the morning after a recent celebration following examinations young people were wheeled out of ambulances on trolleys with their mothers walking alongside them as they went to have their stomachs pumped out.  While we have issues of parental responsibility, these things should not happen in 2012.</p>

            <from>Deputy Patrick O’Donovan</from>
            <p eId="para_938">I thank the Ceann Comhairle for selecting this matter.  It might not be one that affects constituencies up and down the country, but it is one that was brought to my attention in the recent past by a number of nursery and garden centre owners, namely, the need for the establishment of a national horticultural strategy to drive the potential of the sector.  I welcome the presence of the Minister of State, Deputy Shane McEntee, and thank him for and compliment him on the work he has done so far.  He might take on board the need for engagement with all stakeholders in the horticulture sector, including garden centre and nursery owners, those responsible for training graduates and SOLAS which is in the throes of revamping the old community employment and training initiatives.  In the recent past, having regard to the level of construction that took place, both in Ireland and our nearest neighbour, the sector experienced large growth in numbers employed in it.</p>
            <p eId="para_939">The sector is being promoted by Bord Bia.  It struck me and those working in the sector that, first and foremost, the remit of Bord Bia should be the promotion of Irish food, in respect of which it is doing a good job.  There is a danger, however, that the sector will be subsumed into it and, perhaps, have a less important place than it would enjoy if there was a board or a subsidiary of it with its own label and unique identity.  There is a difference between the approaches taken in Britain and Ireland to garnering the potential of the sector.  One need only look at the approach of the BBC in promoting both the gardening and the horticulture sectors as a means to encourage people to engage in these activities.</p>
            <p eId="para_940">I would like the Minister to engage with the local authorities and State agencies which in many cases have a hefty budget for the procurement of horticultural services and plants and shrubs from nurseries.  There is a concern that these services are not being put out to tender by local authorities and State agencies and that small nurseries and garden centres are not being given an opportunity to offer their material to these outlets and promote their stock.  The nursery owners and garden centre operators whom I met recently are also concerned about the standards of training and certification for college graduates.  They would like to see a comparative study being carried out of the standards and courses on offer in Ireland versus those on offer in our nearest neighbour, the United Kingdom.  There is obviously a needs for a closer relationship between the sector and the colleges to ensure, first, that the right calibre of person is steered in the direction of the sector and, second, that the standard reached reflects the needs of the sector.  The nursery owners and garden centre operators to whom I spoke are not concerned that there is a shortage of graduates available but that their skills base does not reflect the needs of the modern sector.</p>

            <p eId="para_942">I welcome the opportunity to raise this issue which is not one that affects every constituency, but it is one, as I am sure the Minister of State will agree, which has considerable potential.</p>

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine (Deputy Shane McEntee)</from>
            <p eId="para_943">I thank the Deputy most sincerely for raising this significant issue.  It concerns a sector which has considerable potential for growth, but much must happen and it must start with the producers themselves.</p>
            <p eId="para_944">On a number of occasions, I have got them together to try to become one unit but they have failed to do that and have continued to work individually.</p>
            <p eId="para_945">I know a lot of money and help has been invested through Bord Bia.  The one point that really annoys me about the whole horticultural industry is the manner in which it allows itself to be treated by the supermarkets, whether it be in regard to plants or food, where they use Irish product as a loss leader.  I have tried to address this on several occasions, but with no great success.  We have met all the companies and, some six or eight months ago, I had all of the different people involved in the horticulture industry, in particular the nurseries, around the table to try to draw up a plan.  I left it up to them to come back to me with a plan on how they were going to operate as one, as they do in England, but they have not done that.</p>
            <p eId="para_946">As the Deputy rightly said, while the industry is going through a bad time at present, there is great potential, not only for the home market.  I do not know how many lorry loads of plants and shrubs come into supermarkets in Ireland daily.  For the first time, however, through a grant aid system we put in place, a nursery is this year being given the opportunity to supply one of our supermarkets, and I hope many more will follow.  The producers have much to do themselves.  They went through a good time during the Celtic tiger period and did not care about anybody.  Now, they have left themselves with an awful lot of large borrowings.  They have to come together.  I am glad the Deputy has raised the issue.</p>
            <p eId="para_947">Production of fruit and vegetables is a significant entity within the overall agricultural industry, making an important economic contribution in terms of supplying the domestic market, employment and foreign trade.  The horticulture and potato sectors contributed approximately €400 million to farm output in 2011 and this includes non-food horticultural crops such as plants and nursery stock.  It is estimated that Ireland is 24% self-sufficient in fruit and 85% self-sufficient in vegetables, including potatoes, although these estimates relate only to produce that can be grown domestically.</p>
            <p eId="para_948">The horticulture sector has performed well over the past decade and has grown to be a significant entity within the overall agricultural industry.  The area and proportion of production under protection from the weather has increased significantly.  Improvements in the quality and presentation of Irish produce over the past decade have also been significant.  Quality of output, hygiene and food safety concerns have become critical issues for the sector.  The industry is labour intensive, employing approximately 18,500 across the food and non-food areas, and employment is broadly based across the country.</p>
            <p eId="para_949">The sector continues to have considerable potential for further development but is experiencing strong competitive pressures, particularly from the highly concentrated retail market and competitively priced imports.  The multiples have enormous bargaining power in that they prefer to be supplied from one or two sources and they exert unrelenting pressure on producers to drive down prices.  This pressure, coupled with ever-increasing input costs, particularly the costs of energy and labour, has resulted in many producers leaving the sector.  Scale has become a significant prerequisite for success.</p>
            <p eId="para_950">Following the publication of the Harvest 2020 report in June 2010, the then Minister of State with responsibility for horticulture at the then Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food established the horticulture action group in December 2010 to oversee the implementation of the relevant recommendations relating to horticulture in the report.  The membership of the group consisted of eight people who represented the various sectors of the horticulture industry.  They comprised a nursery stock producer, a horticulture wholesaler and protected crop producer, a field vegetable producer, a mushroom producer, a potato producer and representatives of Teagasc, An Bord Bia and the then Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food.</p>
            <p eId="para_951">The group met on a number of occasions and submitted a detailed 25-page report to myself at the end of June 2011.  The group also reported back to the high level implementation group for the overall management and implementation of the Harvest 2020 recommendations.  In addition, Teagasc, in consultation with the other State agencies and relevant stakeholders, has established a number of working groups to examine in detail individual horticultural sectors and, to date, two reports on the cut foliage and apple sectors have been prepared.</p>
            <p eId="para_952">Since receiving the horticultural action group report, I, my officials and the relevant State agencies have been involved in progressing the implementation of as many of the recommendations as are feasible in the current economic climate.  I have met the main supermarkets to impress on them the need to support Irish producers, although to no avail in that they continue to abuse the Irish farmer and supplier daily and are putting them out of business.  They do not seem to be listening to anybody.  I have also secured funding of €3.25 million for the horticultural grant scheme for this year which has been allocated to projects across all areas of horticultural activity.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#PatrickODonovan" eId="spk_495">
            <from>Deputy Patrick O’Donovan</from>
            <p eId="para_953">I welcome the Minister of State's response, although it highlights the fact there is an issue with regard to labelling.  In the supermarkets, unfortunately, whether the product is a chicken or a griselinia, consumers do not know that it is Irish because the labelling of Irish farm products, whether from a greenhouse or a field, is totally inadequate.</p>
            <p eId="para_954">The fact Bord Bia is the responsible agency does not give this issue the significance the industry deserves.  The fact there are some 18,500 employees means there are a lot of mouths to feed.  The producers deserve, if not a quango, a separate entity that will drive forward the labelling, marketing and research that is needed.</p>
            <p eId="para_955">The recommendations of the report commissioned by the Minister of State will be interesting.  I take on board his point in regard to the horticulture industry.  I have made the point to the producers that they need to formalise themselves into a national association and engage with the Minister of State in a constructive way.  There is also massive export potential, when one considers the number of garden centres and of people engaged in this area in the UK in particular.  One thing Ireland has is plenty of rain, as we know, which means we have an excellent climate for growing the type of plants, flowers, fruits and vegetables that will get into the UK market, and which are traceable, safe and useable.  However, unless we are prepared to take on board the recommendations of the report commissioned by the Minister of State, put a proper labelling system and marketing system in place and bring all the stakeholders together under the one roof, it will not work.</p>
            <p eId="para_956">I take the Minister of State's point in regard to the disparate organisations pulling and dragging in separate directions.  That is in the past, however, and we need to move on.  I will go back to the people who contacted me and ask them to formalise themselves into a national association.  When that is done, perhaps the Department and its officials can sit down with them again.  This is an industry that clearly has huge potential given it already sustains 18,500 employees and God only knows how many families.</p>

            <p eId="para_957">I appreciate the Deputy's comments.  If he is free on Thursday, I invite him to Citywest where there will be an open day on the horticulture industry, in particular the plants sector.  Doors are opening in China and in England with regard to exports, but we have to come together with regard to the logistics of transport and standing up to the multiples.  If we do not do that, we are wasting our time.  Please God, in the not too distant future, I will be announcing a plan that will take on the multiples, whether they like it or not.</p>

          <heading>Job Creation</heading>
          <speech by="#CiaraConway" eId="spk_497">
            <from>Deputy Ciara Conway</from>
            <p eId="para_958">As the Minister, Deputy Bruton, is aware, the IDA last year had a record breaking year in terms of job creation, with a net figure of almost 6,000 jobs created.  This is not the first time the Minister will have heard somebody from Waterford try to hold the IDA to account and it will not be the last because, unfortunately, for all the good that is in the recent report, it makes very poor reading for the south east, the only region of the country to see a marked decline in terms of job creation through IDA initiatives.  This drop of 8.2% translates to in excess of 1,000 jobs, a figure that is nothing to be scoffed at for Waterford city and the south-east region, which has a current unemployment rate of 20%.</p>
            <p eId="para_959">There has been a lot of rhetoric about this high unemployment rate in the south east.  The reality is there are people and families behind these figures who find it increasingly difficult to make ends meet.  What I want to know, and I have asked the same of the IDA, is whether exit interviews are being conducted with prospective investors.  What is it that Waterford and the south east is lacking that other regions seem to have in abundance?  If exit interviews are not being conducted, why not?  Can we develop a policy to ensure that, as a Government, we have the information we need to make the best decisions to ensure something both parties promised in the run-up to the election, namely, balanced regional development?</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#RichardBruton" as="#Minister_for_Jobs,_Enterprise_and_Innovation" eId="spk_498">
            <from>Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation  (Deputy Richard Bruton)</from>
            <p eId="para_960">I thank Deputy Conway for raising this issue.  She is correct that the IDA had a record year last year, with 13,000 jobs and a net expansion of 6,000 jobs.  It was the highest job creation rate in a decade and the lowest rate of job loss in a decade, and that pattern is being continued into the first half of this year.</p>
            <p eId="para_961">The Deputy is also right in saying that the south east is an area that has not shared in that success, and a number of responses are necessary to try to reverse that.  Part of the problem is that the pattern of IDA gains in recent times has seen a move towards very high end types of project and that has favoured the very large cities with very deep labour pools and strong and established centres.  Undoubtedly, that has favoured Cork, Dublin and Galway.  They have built bases in clusters and they are seeing the product of that.  They act as magnets.</p>
            <p eId="para_962">The challenge for us in Waterford is to seek to build an equivalent cluster of strength around the existing base within Waterford.  As the Deputy is aware, I have established a south-east action plan in recognition of the particular structural problems in Waterford.  We have got all the key agencies around the table, including the local authorities and the Waterford Institute of Technology, WIT.  It is a question of identifying the competitive strengths and how we build those.  We had a successful review meeting there recently as a result of which a number of sectoral opportunities will now be focused on, and we will seek to develop those.  To be fair, WIT has a strong base in technology across telecommunications, pharmaceutical and ICT for us to build upon.</p>
            <p eId="para_963">I have given a direction to our agencies to give renewed emphasis to the south east, and one of the products of that is that so far this year the number of site visits to the south east have doubled.  Enterprise Ireland has had a competition for new start-ups, and I attended one of the sessions with the 20 individuals who were successful in responding to a competitive start fund.  Enterprise Ireland is working intensively with those as high potential new start-ups.</p>
            <p eId="para_964">There is no doubt that regional spread will be an increasing challenge because of the type of companies IDA Ireland is winning, and in trying to achieve a greater regional spread, IDA Ireland is now targeting emerging companies, not just the iconic names.  It is now looking at companies that are considering their very first move out of, say, the United States to come to Ireland.  We have had 11 of those so far and they will be much better prospects for getting regional spread.</p>
            <p eId="para_965">The other initiative is ConnectIreland which, as the Deputy is aware, is being conducted with the assistance of a company based in the south east that is aiming to use the diaspora or anyone with connections to attract companies to consider Ireland.  More than 200,000 companies come to Europe each year and most of them would not have Ireland on their radar because IDA Ireland would not be working at that level.  An impressive example is that 3,500 Irish accountants are working in multinationals across the United States.  That is a huge group of people whom we can use as ambassadors.</p>
            <p eId="para_966">We have set a target for IDA Ireland of 50% outside of Dublin and Cork.  It did not come anywhere near that in 2011; it was only 28%.  This year so far we are showing much better.  It is closer to the 50% target, although not quite at it, but I would have to admit that the south east continues to be a challenge.  We are working on it.  We have had a six months review.  We will continue to have those meetings.  We set targets that we seek to achieve, and we are examining the reason companies are leaving.  By and large, it is not always a great guide.  It is not that Waterford is doing something wrong.  Companies reach the end of their cycle.  I am not sure looking at those who are leaving is the best source of information.  We are trying to examine the competitive strengths of the region and build on that.  However, I will ask IDA Ireland to examine if there is a pattern to the companies which have left in the past two years to determine if there is a diagnostic from that on which we could build based on what the Deputy is suggesting.</p>

            <p eId="para_967">I thank the Minister for his response.  He may have misunderstood me.  I welcome that there has been a notable increase in the number of companies that have visited Waterford but are questions asked when prospective investors do not choose Waterford rather than the reason people are leaving?  I can understand that macroeconomic issues can arise that impact on a company's decision to move or whatever, but in terms of the issue I raise, we have seen a huge increase in the number of IDA site visits to Waterford.  However, they have not yielded any results.  With the greatest respect, one can bring a horse to water but one cannot make it drink, and we need to know why they are not drinking because we need a significant investment in employment in Waterford and in the south east as a region.</p>
            <p eId="para_968">There were some positives from IDA Ireland's report on Waterford, including Bausch &amp; Lomb's investment in continued production and the loyalty that company has shown to the city over the years.  Also, Genzyme is making a significant investment.  Two weeks ago, I and a number of other Oireachtas Members visited GSK in Dungarvan which employs 700 people.</p>
            <p eId="para_969">The companies in Waterford must be brought into the fold in terms of trade missions to allow them drum up more business for themselves and perhaps expand and secure the jobs we have already in Waterford.  A vital part of the south-east task force would be to ensure those companies which are there remain.</p>

            <p eId="para_970">I take the point.  I will ask for that to be done in that we will examine the reason companies ultimately choose to locate elsewhere.  Very often it is not Waterford competing with Limerick.  It is Ireland, or Waterford, if it is the preferred location, competing with Scotland.</p>

            <from>Deputy Richard Bruton</from>
            <p eId="para_972">The issues are to do with what many of these companies are now looking for, namely, ICT skills and language skills.  There may not be the same depth of skill base in Waterford compared with some of the competing locations.  In other areas we have Genzyme, on the pharmaceutical side, and we use established companies as the main reference sale.  It is people who have come here and been successful in a region who become the reference sale.  To be fair, Eistec, which replaced TalkTalk, is in a class of its own.  It may be an Irish-owned company but it is a quality company and I am optimistic about its prospects.  It will be a very good reference point in the future.</p>
            <p eId="para_973">On foot of the Deputy's suggestion, we will examine the visits that do not succeed to determine if there is a pattern to those, but there are structural problems in terms of many of them.  The Deputy knows them also.  Many issues have arisen, some infrastructural and some to do with the knowledge infrastructure, and there are a number of issues enterprise policy alone cannot address.  It was recognised in the south-east action plan that we must examine elements of the development of the region other than simply what we can do within enterprise policy.</p>
            <p eId="para_974">I will take note of what the Deputy said.  We will use that to see if we can analyse more closely the items we might be able to tweak in our promotion, but I reassure the Deputy of our continuing commitment.  We recognise that this is an area where we have not been as successful as we would have liked, and we will continue to persist.</p>

            <from>Deputy Billy Kelleher</from>
            <p eId="para_978">The reasons I raise this issue are twofold.  First, a report was published today which analysed suicides in Cork over a three year period.  It was quite disturbing in view of the fact that behind the statistics I personally knew some of the people who had taken their own lives for whatever reason.  There is a need to implement the national substance misuse strategy and to address the issue of alcohol once and for all in society.  I hope we will not park the issue and refer it to a committee that will wait for ages before a sub-committee issues a report.  We know for certain, and all the statistical data show, that alcohol is a major contributory factor to mental health problems and suicide in this country.  The recent report found that 80% of young males who took their lives were abusing alcohol for a year prior to their committing suicide.  For all those reasons I urge the Government to implement the substance misuse strategy as quickly, efficiently and effectively as possible.</p>
            <p eId="para_979">Recently we witnessed disturbances and anti-social behaviour connected with a concert in the Phoenix Park.  Thousands of people congregate on a regular basis in this country and no difficulties arise but it is a recipe for disaster where there is a cocktail of cheap drink sloshing around the system and the use of illegal and other substances in terms of anti-social behaviour, damage to individuals, collective damage to society and, in this unfortunate case, deaths.</p>
            <p eId="para_980">According to the World Health Organisation, tackling alcohol pricing is one of the most effective policies a government can undertake to reduce alcohol consumption and associated alcohol-related harm.  We have taken action on tobacco.  We adopted the policy of increasing prices to decrease consumption and of making advertising less attractive so as to reduce consumption.  I do not blame the Government but it is unfortunate that we have done the exact opposite with alcohol.  Collectively, the Government and the people should try to limit the availability of cheap alcohol, in particular to younger people.  For all those reasons I urge the Minister to follow up on the report commissioned by the Suicide Support and Information System, the National Suicide Research Foundation and Dr. Ella Arensman.  It brings home the impact of alcohol on society and on individuals who are already under pressure, who may have mental health issues and use alcohol as a crutch and for escapism, and who end up in a situation where further depression leads to self-harm or suicide.</p>
            <p eId="para_981">I was a little disappointed at the Cabinet's response to the proposals on the advertising of alcohol.  Let us have such a debate, but the Government should at least introduce minimum pricing for alcohol.  That would automatically make drink more expensive and less available to people.  We can have a debate on the other issue again but we should not let it slow this issue down.  It is critically important for us to show, collectively, as a society that we acknowledge that we have a problem with alcohol in this country.</p>

          <speech by="#RuairiQuinn" as="#Minister_for_Education_and_Skills" eId="spk_507">
            <from>Minister for Education and Skills  (Deputy Ruairí Quinn)</from>
            <p eId="para_982">I thank the Deputy for raising this important matter.  As the House has been informed, my colleague Deputy Kathleen Lynch, whose shoes I would never attempt to step into, is unavoidably detained and I have offered to take both this matter and the subsequent matter on her behalf.</p>
            <p eId="para_983">Reach Out, the national strategy for action on suicide prevention, recognises that alcohol and substance misuse are strongly related to deliberate self-harm and suicidal behaviour.  The national registry of deliberate self-harm for 2011, published by the National Suicide Research Foundation, again highlights the misuse of alcohol as one of the factors associated with the higher rate of self-harm presentations on Sundays, Mondays and public holidays.</p>
            <p eId="para_984">We, as a society, can no longer be tolerant or ambivalent when it comes to the pattern of alcohol consumption and the problems for which alcohol is responsible.  The Government is concerned at the harm caused by the use and misuse of alcohol and, to that end, a report of the national substance misuse strategy steering group was launched in February this year.  The report contains a range of recommendations to, among other things, reduce the consumption of alcohol in general.  The recommendations are grouped under five pillars of supply reduction, prevention, treatment, rehabilitation and research.</p>
            <p eId="para_985">The main recommendations cover areas such as those correctly raised by Deputy Kelleher, namely, the price of alcohol, advertising, sponsorship, monitoring the enforcement of the provisions of the intoxicating liquor legislation and the development of early intervention guidelines for alcohol and substance use across all relevant sectors of the health and social care system.  The substance misuse report is a roadmap for the future direction of policy to deal with the misuse of alcohol and an action plan is currently being developed.</p>
            <p eId="para_986">The latest figures for the number of people who died by suicide last year or who have engaged in deliberate self-harm are truly disturbing.  Suicide is a tragedy that we are constantly working to prevent, and we are also working to give more support to the families affected.  The implementation of Reach Out, the national strategy for action on suicide prevention, is a priority for the Government and a personal priority for the Minister of State directly involved in the area, Deputy Kathleen Lynch.  The National Office for Suicide Prevention, NOSP, is implementing the Reach Out actions as part of a four-way strategy which involves delivering a general population approach to mental health promotion and suicide prevention; using targeted programmes for people at high risk of suicide; delivering services to individuals who have engaged in deliberate self-harm; and providing support to families and communities bereaved by suicide.  The annual budget for this work has been increased by the Government to more than €12 million.</p>
            <p eId="para_987">A wide range of awareness and training programmes are available, including safeTALK and ASIST, which train participants to become more alert to the possibility of suicide in their communities.  The Irish College of General Practitioners is currently developing a specific suicide prevention skills training programme which will be rolled out in the near future.  The NOSP has also piloted a system under which suicide crisis assessment nurses work with emergency departments and GPs, which will be rolled out nationally this year.  Up to 20 voluntary organisations part-funded by the HSE provide excellent prevention, intervention and postvention support services including telephone helplines and web-based support.  The special allocation of €35 million for mental health which was announced in budget 2012 will be used primarily to further strengthen community mental health teams in both adult and children's mental health services.  Some of the additional funds will also be used to advance further suicide prevention initiatives and to initiate the provision of psychological and counselling services in primary care, specifically for people with mental health problems.</p>

            <p eId="para_988">I thank the Minister for the reply.  We must admit that as a nation we have a problem with alcohol.  We must introduce policies that send out a strong message that we accept our difficulties in terms of how we deal with alcohol and our pattern of drinking and binge drinking.  The reduction in the age of people who regularly abuse alcohol is disturbing.  I do not wish to be seen as a killjoy.  I was a young lad too, but the bottom line is that we cannot ignore the issue any longer.  If the Cabinet, as is indicated, has a difficulty with the area of sponsorship then let us have the debate at another time, but let us deal with minimum pricing and supply as a matter of urgency.  At least that would send out a message that the Government, Parliament and people are willing to tackle alcohol consumption and its fallout in terms of mental health problems, suicide, anti-social behaviour and all that flows from it.</p>

            <p eId="para_989">I thank the Deputy for raising the matter.  I do not think we can say any longer that we do not know the facts, that we do not have the evidence and that we are not aware of the scale or extent of the problem.  As the Deputy rightly said, the evidence is in front of us.  I share his concern that the Government must listen to what is being said in this House and must consider the various reports I have cited on behalf of the Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch.  I assure Deputy Kelleher and the House that I will convey his concern to her personally.</p>

            <p eId="para_991">I wish to raise once again the forgotten issue in current political debates, that of young people with a physical and intellectual disability.  This issue is hugely important for the young people themselves and, in particular, their families.  It is also an issue that can be dealt with easily with the right attitude, with sensible and correct policies and the support of parents and service providers.</p>
            <p eId="para_992">Is it not an absolute and total disgrace that today the Government can find €2 billion for roads and buildings and yet cannot find €2 million to €3 million for 220 young people with a disability who have no place to go to next September?  Does anyone in his or her right mind find this acceptable, despite the current economic crisis?  Does the Minister?  Is he aware that 226 young people with an intellectual disability who need a training or day care place have been forced to go on a waiting list?  Moreover, 660 other school leavers need some form of specialist placement.  This is the reality for those on the ground.  For example, one disability service covering the north side of Dublin has 40 service users who are in crisis and need residential care.  I hope the Minister understands what the term "crisis needs" means.  These are adults in their 40s and 50s whose parents are dead, very ill or who have dementia or Alzheimer's disease and who need urgent care.  In other words, there are 40 such young people and adults in one service alone, yet the Government is prepared to spend billions of euro on roads and buildings.</p>
            <p eId="para_993">In addition, at a national level between 2012 and 2016, 217 people will require a new day care service, while 486 will require a home support service and 2,248 residential places.  In addition, 2,040 support services will be needed in respect of respite services.  While these are the facts, the Minister will have noted I referred to what will happen in the next five years.  I urge him to deal with this issue concerning people with intellectual disabilities who have left school this week and will need a place in September.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#DenisNaughten" eId="spk_512">
            <from>Deputy Denis Naughten</from>
            <p eId="para_994">Nearly one in four school leavers with an intellectual disability and one in five young adults who have left post-leaving training courses are seeking a placement.  This comprises a significant cohort of young adults who await a placement, even leaving aside the issues relating to physical and sensory disabilities about which there are also problems.  Quite a number of those awaiting a placement have high dependency needs, requiring either one-to-one or two-to-one care.  The high dependency places cannot be provided from existing resources, as has been the instruction by the Minister to the service providers which have taken a 3.7% cut to their overall funding.  This will have an impact on the individualised services provided for these young people and marks a reversion to providing group services which are contrary to public policy.</p>
            <p eId="para_995">It is not good enough for parents to be obliged to wait until the middle of July to learn whether they will have a place for their son or daughter next September.  They are waiting for letters to arrive and some have gone on waiting lists, which is not acceptable.  Others have been informed they have a part-placement, for either two or three days per week, while others have been informed they will be provided with a place until Christmas, but the position thereafter is unknown, which simply constitutes kicking the can down the road.  Moreover, on top of all this, they are being given no choice; they are being told they can either like it or lump it.  Some placements are not appropriate and it is akin to telling a leaving certificate student that, having failed to secure his or her preferred choice of a college to study agricultural science, he or she must take up a place in speech and drama studies instead.  It is not acceptable that people are being forced into positions in which they must take particular places and that other young people are not even being given the opportunity to take up any placement.  Additional funding will be required to address this issue and I urge the Minister to discuss it with the Minister of State at the Department of Health, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, and address the issue as urgently as possible.</p>

          <speech by="#RuairiQuinn" eId="spk_513" as="#Minister_for_Education_and_Skills">
            <from>Deputy Ruairí Quinn</from>
            <p eId="para_996">I thank the two Deputies for bringing this important matter to the attention of the House.  It is not unrelated to my own responsibility in education, although it is catered for by the Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, whose apologies have been conveyed to the House.</p>
            <p eId="para_997">I recognise the importance of life skills training and day services to people with disabilities who are leaving the education system and assure Members that every effort is being made within the available resources to provide services for all of the 2012 school leavers.  Day services for adults with disabilities provide a network of support for more than 25,000 people who have a wide spectrum of needs ranging from those with severe and profound disabilities and who are likely to need long-term specialist service provision to those with lower support needs and a greater potential for community participation and inclusion.</p>
            <p eId="para_998">The HSE, through its occupational guidance service, works with schools, service providers, service users and families to identify the needs of young people with disabilities who are due to complete their second level education.  The aim is to address the needs of individuals through health-funded life skills training which usually is referred to as rehabilitative or RT training, health-funded day services, FÁS-funded vocational training and further education.  Service providers and the HSE have come together under the auspices of the national consultative forum to identify how the needs of those individuals who require day services or RT places in 2012 can be responded to within available resources and the Minister of State is being kept informed of progress on a regular basis.  I assure Members the process of notifying families whether a place is available or whether the young person is to be placed on a waiting list has commenced.  Many families have been informed this week and every family should know the position very soon.</p>
            <p eId="para_999">The demand for services for school leavers continues to grow as more than 660 school leavers will need services in 2012 and suitable placements also must be identified for a further 390 people who are completing their RT course.  Disability services are required to cater for demographic pressures such as new services for those leaving school and RT training from within their existing budgets.  The budgets for 2012 have been reduced by 3.7% and the moratorium on staff recruitment gives rise to challenges in service provision.  However, both the voluntary sector and the HSE are committed to making the best use of available resources in a creative and flexible manner in order to be as responsive as possible to the needs of this cohort of young Irish citizens.  To date, more than 500 of those leaving school this year have been placed in an RT place or other day service.  In addition, places have been found for 321 of those who are completing their RT course.  I thank the HSE disability service and service providers for working to achieve this without additional funding.  The HSE and the disability service providers acknowledge this is a difficult time for the young people who have yet to be placed in an appropriate service, as well as for their families.  Therefore, the Government will continue to make every effort to find suitable arrangements for them.</p>

          <speech by="#FinianMcGrath" eId="spk_514">
            <from>Deputy Finian McGrath</from>
            <p eId="para_1000">The Minister should bring back the message that he will make every effort to find suitable arrangements for these young people.  However, I will quote briefly from a letter I received this morning from a parent who is dealing with a seriously disabled young teenager.  He wrote:</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1001">What I am hearing is that some parents are being communicated with verbally and the trend appears to be that the HSE are madly scrambling to get the numbers down by addressing those with ‘lower' needs (or perceived to be lower needs or their needs have been inadequately assessed) in the first instance, shoehorning people in where ever they can.  Those with greater needs are being left as the resources required are greater.  Not sure where this is all going to go but I can tell you that the stress levels are rising in this house.</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1002">I feel that it is still going to need input from outside the HSE to redirect the required resources.</p>
            <p eId="para_1003">In other words, my point is that the severely disabled kids and young teenagers are the ones who are being hammered because they will cost more from a resources perspective and as that parent's letter demonstrates, stress levels are rising.  Consequently, I urge the Minister to support them as best he can.</p>

          <speech by="#DenisNaughten" eId="spk_515">
            <from>Deputy Denis Naughten</from>
            <p eId="para_1004">To follow on from Deputy Finian McGrath's comments, this pertains to a cohort of young people, many of whom have profound disabilities.  At the best of times it is a difficult challenge for parents who are involved in caring for such children on an ongoing basis, without being left in limbo in which they do not know what will happen from 1 September onwards.  To be quite honest, it is not good enough that we are telling those parents in the middle of July that they will find out their position very soon.  An intellectual disability database was set up to ensure this crisis would not be replicated year after year, yet parents will now have to wait until the end of July.</p>
            <p eId="para_1005">How many families have received a letter from the HSE at this stage?  How many families have a full placement or a part placement offer from the HSE, or even a placement for part of a year, which is only kicking the can down the road?  How many families have now been left on a waiting list with no service provision whatsoever?  These are basic questions and I hope the Minister can answer them.</p>

I also recognise that we are dealing with a cohort of young people who are moving from a certain phase in their life out of secondary education or training and into the wider world.  The relationship between those young people and their families is itself changing, and the fact that they have disabilities does not alter that transition process.</p>
            <p eId="para_1007">I do not have the answers to the questions raised by Deputy Naughten, but they are on the record of the House and I will ask Deputy Kathleen Lynch to ensure that specific replies are conveyed to both Deputies.</p>

Consequently, amendment No. 29 deletes the text of the definition of "terms" from section 42.</p>
          <p eId="para_1014">The remaining seven amendments are also amendments of a technical nature that amend sections 29 and 42.  These sections facilitate the making of contributions by relevant trusts, which are defined as the congregations that were party to the 2002 indemnity agreement, or those charities that manage scheduled institutions.  The existing text provides that the trusts can make contributions, notwithstanding that this may not be authorised by the terms of the trust.  These amendments extend the provisions to allow contributions to be made where it may be inconsistent with the charitable purposes of the trust.  These provisions are being made to address concerns raised by some congregations in discussions with the Department.</p>
          <p eId="para_1015">Amendments Nos. 26 and 27 provide consequential clarifications and are necessary to ensure there is no confusion about the word "purpose", which appears in sections 42(2) and 42(3).  I am satisfied that these provisions are necessary and that they will further assist congregations in making contributions towards the cost of redress.</p>

          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1019">In page 7, to delete lines 14 to 20 and substitute the following:</p>
          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_1020">"3.—(1) This Act shall apply to any person (in this Act referred to as a "former resident"), whether or not he or she is resident in the State, who is a former resident of Irish institutions identified in the various approved schedules of institutions as applied within the Residential Institutions Redress Act 2001 and eligible to apply to the Redress Board.".</p>
          <p eId="para_1021">This was discussed at length on Committee Stage.  It is probably one of the biggest areas in which people have sought change.  It relates to the fact that the Bill restricts access to the fund to those former residents who have already received awards from the RIRB or from a court.  Many survivors have said that this is just too restrictive and is unjust on that basis.  There are many reasons people may have chosen not to seek redress.  We dealt with them in this Chamber even on Second Stage.  Some people had to deal with the issues themselves.  Some people were outside the country and were not aware of the availability of the scheme.  Some did not want others to know about their plight or simply found it too hard to deal with it at that time.  It is unfair that they should be denied again this time.</p>
          <p eId="para_1022">The reason given for their exclusion is that the fund is limited and that if more people are added, it will delay the process and eat into moneys for everybody else.  I do not accept that.  Very strong arguments have been put forward about the small number of applicants living outside the State, mainly in Britain, numbering no more than a couple of hundred people who would seek to avail of the assistance.  That will certainly not break the bank.</p>
          <p eId="para_1023">Another area that has been identified as a complexity is how to identify the people.  Very good points have been made by some of the religious orders.  The trust fund is not a redress issue.  The redress issues have been dealt with by the redress board.  Many people who were resident in these institutions, whether or not they were abused, should be able to avail of the fund because they were disadvantaged by virtue of the fact that they were in the institutions in the first place.  One of the orders was quoted in the Ryan report as stating that an important aspect of this process of exploration, acceptance and understanding by the State and the congregations is the acknowledgement of the fact that the system failed the children, not just that the children were abused because occasional individual lapses occurred.  People who were resident in these institutions have needs which have not been met.  They were disadvantaged by their time there.  Many arguments have been made about the nature of the fund and whether people should avail of a lump sum or a pension.  These are worthy demands, but I think the definition and the terms are too restrictive at the moment.  That is why we are moving the amendment.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#RuairiQuinn" eId="spk_523" as="#Minister_for_Education_and_Skills">
          <from>Deputy Ruairí Quinn</from>
          <p eId="para_1024">As the Minister of State, Deputy Sherlock, explained on Committee Stage - I was not able to attend myself - the effect of these amendments would be to widen significantly eligibility to the fund, which Deputy Daly has acknowledged.  Some suggest that former residents who would be eligible for an award from the redress board should be eligible, while it is unclear in other instances whether the proposal is to include all former residents, irrespective of whether they were abused, in scheduled institutions.  Amendment No. 5 also proposes to include family members of former residents in the case of educational services.</p>
          <p eId="para_1025">As I have repeatedly stated, the Bill's primary purpose is to establish a statutory fund to support the needs of survivors in keeping with the all-party motion that was unanimously agreed by Dáil Éireann in 2009 in the aftermath of the Ryan report.  As the Deputies are aware, a maximum of €110 million will be available to the fund to assist around 15,000 potential beneficiaries.  If eligibility were significantly widened to include all former residents of scheduled institutions, as is proposed, then the amounts available to fund services for individuals could be greatly reduced.  Accordingly, the effectiveness of the statutory fund would itself be put at risk.  Some of the amendments refer to former residents who were eligible to apply under the redress Acts.  Anyone could apply to the redress board and we know more than 900 applications to the board were withdrawn, refused or resulted in no award, generally on the basis that the person was not resident in the scheduled institution itself.</p>
          <p eId="para_1026">The Government has deliberately and for good reasons proposed confining entitlement to the 15,000 or so survivors who will have come through the redress process.  If the fund were to investigate applications to establish residence and injury consistent with alleged abuse, as would be required if amendment No. 3 were accepted, clearly a considerable structure similar to the Residential Institutions Redress Board would be required, thus expanding the role of the statutory fund and deflecting it from its intended focus.  The statutory fund is not intended nor is it designed to consider issues such as abuse.  Since it will take applications only from those who received an award from the courts or the redress board, all issues relating to abuse have been dealt with, allowing the fund to focus on the needs of the prospective recipients.  Extensive efforts were made to facilitate claims to the redress board.  Those former residents who did not apply to the redress board can continue to avail of the counselling and family tracing services available.</p>
          <p eId="para_1027">The motivation for amendment No. 5 appears to be to allow the child of a former resident who received an award from the redress board to benefit from the fund in so far as it relates to educational services.  The receipt of a grant or assistance of educational services from the education finance board was not linked to the receipt of an award from the redress board.  This amendment proposes that any former resident and his or her relatives, including children and grandchildren, could benefit.  Again, widening eligibility to include children and grandchildren would result in broadening the scope of the fund beyond that for which it is intended.  The education finance board has done excellent work in distributing the moneys which came from the religious congregations under the 2002 indemnity agreement.  Former residents and their relatives did benefit from this support.  However, it was always clear the particular fund would run out and we are now almost at that point.</p>
          <p eId="para_1028">I appreciate the sentiments expressed by Deputies regarding the range of eligibility issues.  I urge them, however, to see the logic of the Government's position on this matter.  I have indicated previously that the issue of who was eligible to apply for assistance could be reviewed following the establishment of the statutory fund in the event of the applications to the fund not resulting in a significant expenditure of it.  In view of the considerable concerns expressed by Members and by some groups and congregations, I am prepared to commit to reviewing the operation of the fund two years after its establishment.</p>
          <p eId="para_1029">While I note Deputies' many useful and positive comments, I believe it is best to proceed on the basis as proposed in the Bill as outlined.  Regrettably, I must, therefore, oppose these amendments.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#SeanCroweSF" eId="spk_524">
          <from>Deputy Seán Crowe</from>
          <p eId="para_1030">Eligibility is one of the major weaknesses of the Bill.  On every Stage I have argued about this section.  It was discussed at length on Committee Stage with the Minister and I altered my amendments for Report Stage to take on board some of his points.  The fund should be opened up not just to those who applied successfully for redress but also to those who, if they had applied, would have been successful.  It should be opened up not just for those who have been through the courts concerning their abuse in a residential institution but those who may go through the courts in the future.</p>
          <p eId="para_1031">Having spoken to many of the survivors, I noted many of them found the whole redress process very difficult and regretted going through it.  Some spoke about the process lacking empathy and how it opened up old wounds from the past which they are still trying to live with today.  I find it difficult for us as legislators to draw a line in the sand when it comes to who is and who is not eligible for this fund.  Clearly, we are talking about people who fulfil all the criteria and who were abused in residential institutions with the complicity of the State.</p>
          <p eId="para_1032">There are many reasons survivors of abuse did not feel able or were willing to apply to the redress board.  It is wrong they should be penalised for not meeting a deadline.  Many of those to whom I have spoken were clearly traumatised by their experiences in the institutions.  Understandably, they did not want to re-open it at this time in their lives.</p>
          <p eId="para_1033">To illustrate the point, this morning I spoke to the husband of a survivor who had spent 19 years in an institution.  She was supposed to be released when she reached her 16th birthday but she was retained in the institution until she was 21.  In the 1990s, she took a court case which took seven years to get to court because of delays due to changes in solicitors on the State's and the institution's sides.  In court it emerged from one of the witnesses that sexual abuse was involved which led to the case having to be stopped.  The same woman applied to the redress board but was turned down on the basis she had gone down the court route.  In one of her discussions with a counsellor, she was asked if she was still considering going down the court route, to which she replied it would be her preference.  She did not get redress as a result.  This woman is now outside the process, meaning she is not eligible for this fund.</p>
          <p eId="para_1034">Another survivor, who is disabled and now lives in the United States, suffered from severe post-traumatic stress disorder after 16 years of abuse.  He will require counselling and medication for the rest of his life but must survive on a small stipend.  He applied successfully to the redress board and the State is paying for basic counselling but refuses to cover his medication costs.  It is wrong that only those eligible for assistance from the fund will be former residents who were offered awards from the residential institutions redress board or received awards pursuant to court actions.  We need to show those who are not eligible for the fund – those who decided they could not go through the redress process - that we are concerned about what happened to them and that the State's apology to them is inclusive.</p>
          <p eId="para_1035">Under this legislation, a person who pursues a court action relating to their abuse will not have access to the fund.  This is a weakness in the legislation that needs to be addressed.  As matters stand, those who have not received redress to date will be excluded from benefiting from the new fund.  It is expected that some 15,000 former residents - whether living in Ireland or abroad - will successfully complete the redress process and be eligible to apply for the range of services on offer.  The Minister has previously stated that to widen the eligibility criteria to include all former residents would reduce the amount of money available to fund these services.  When discussing the moneys for this fund, it must be remembered that last year we gave away an absolute fortune to zombie banks.  The fund is relatively small, particularly when one considers what families have gone through and the inter-generational effects that have become apparent.</p>
          <p eId="para_1036">There is a need for flexibility.  It is welcome that the position will be reviewed after two years.  However, I do not want us to be obliged to wait two years.  As the Minister, other Deputies and I are aware, those whom we are discussing have experienced absolute horror in their lives.  Mr. Justice Ryan mentioned some of the things done to people in his report.  As public representatives, we have spoken to people and are aware of the abuse they endured.  In all conscience, I do not believe that, as legislators, we can put up a barrier for those to whom I refer.  We failed them in the past and by not including them under the legislation we will fail them again.</p>
          <p eId="para_1037">I experience strong emotions in respect of this matter.  That is because people have related their stories to me.  Some individuals were not able to seek redress or go to the courts.  The difficult part for them was that they would have been obliged to narrate what had happened to them to counsellors, the Garda, the courts and their families and friends.  That is a huge step for anyone to take.  Many of those to whom I have spoken were not prepared to take it.  As stated, others who went through the process regret doing so to this day.  Their families also have regrets in this regard in the light of the impact it has had on their lives.  In short, they did not have a positive experience.  Most of the individuals with whom I have been in contact have informed me that it was never about the money.  What they wanted was an apology and to be able to tell their stories.</p>
          <p eId="para_1038">That is the background to my amendments.  The Minister of State, Deputy Sean Sherlock, indicated on Committee Stage that there was a difficulty with them.  The Minister asked how we would actually process what was proposed.  A number of later amendments in my name outline how we should proceed in the context of the board which will not be not a court of law.  There are those who would be quite capable of making decisions on allowing the people to whom I refer access the fund.  According to Right of Place, at least 150,000 children and teenagers went through orphanages, industrial schools and centres for young offenders, with many suffering abuse at the hands of religious orders and others in charge of their care.  An estimated 100,000 left Ireland afterwards, with a large proportion going to the United States.  In that context, previous speakers referred to the fact there were people who were not aware of the State's efforts in establishing the redress board.  We have, of course, discussed that matter in detail on previous occasions.</p>
          <p eId="para_1039">The eligibility criteria severely limit people who have a right to avail of the statutory fund.  They fail to take into consideration survivors who for many reasons were unaware that they could seek recompense from the redress board or were unable to do so while it was in operation.  The amendment tabled in Deputy Brendan Smith's name refers to approved services covered under the Bill and would allow the children of survivors to avail of services relating to the statutory fund.  I support what the Deputy is seeking to achieve in this regard.  I want to facilitate those who were hurt by ensuring they will have an opportunity to access the new fund.  That is why I am seeking to have the eligibility criteria widened.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#BrendanSmith" eId="spk_525">
          <from>Deputy Brendan Smith</from>
          <p eId="para_1040">Amendment No. 4 in my name requests that the phrase "former residents who would have been eligible to receive an award under the Act of 2002 but who failed to apply under the Act of 2002" be inserted into the Bill.  I am seeking to ensure people who would have been eligible if they had applied will not be excluded.  Some of the other amendments refer to people who might apply.  Last year, when we debated what became the Residential Institutions Redress (Amendment) Act 2011, under which the redress board was wound up and which was the forerunner of the Bill before the House, I appealed to the Minister to insert a provision whereby an appeals or some other mechanism would be put in place to cater for people, should they come forward at this point, who would have met the criteria set down by the redress board and thereby qualified for payment.</p>
          <p eId="para_1041">I am much better informed about this issue than was the case one year ago.  Having had the opportunity to meet the individuals involved and the groups with represent them, I am even more convinced of the need to put in place a mechanism whereby people who did not go before the redress board will not be excluded.  I have been in contact with some of the advocacy groups in Britain and with an eminent public representative in London who outlined her concerns about the possible exclusion of people who required help.  I am concerned by the fact that the most marginalised have not availed of the redress board mechanism.  We are all aware of the particular difficulties they face in terms of a lack of literacy and, perhaps, social skills.  In that context, they might not have been aware of the existence of the redress board.  Advocacy groups, both here and outside the jurisdiction, have done a huge amount of good work in trying to get the message out in respect of the availability of assistance from the redress board and the eligibility criteria that applied.  However, that message did not reach all potential applicants.</p>
          <p eId="para_1042">The group we are discussing is small.  As time passes, the age profile of those who were resident in the relevant institutions is increasing.  I appreciate the Minister's comment to the effect that the work of the statutory fund will be reviewed after two years.  A period of two years is particularly lengthy for those who are in the older age cohort.  That is a factor about which I am extremely concerned.</p>
          <p eId="para_1043">When we debated what became the Residential Institutions Redress (Amendment) Act 2011 last year, I stated provision could be made in legislation for residual functions to be brought back within the remit of the parent Department.  As Deputy Seán Crowe indicated, on Committee Stage the Minister of State, Deputy Sean Sherlock, said this could lead to the creation of an unnecessary layer of bureaucracy and that funding could be used up in a way none of us would desire.  I fundamentally disagree with the Minister of State's assertion.  There are enough competent people in the Department who possess the relevant expertise and could take on the role previously played by those who served on the redress board.  As Deputies Seán Crowe and Clare Daly stated, there were individuals who were abused in the past and lacked the mental strength to come forward and relate their stories to the redress board.  I appeal to the Minister that in the event of someone who did not previously receive assistance or support coming forward and meeting the criteria applied when the redress board was in place, he or she should not be denied the possibility of accessing such assistance or support.</p>
          <p eId="para_1044">Amendment No. 5 relates to the provision of education services.  The Minister has rightly pointed out that the work of the Education Finance Board has proved to be very important.  I am aware of this because I have spoken to people who availed of the services or assistance on offer from the board directly or the family members of those who did so.  My understanding is that third level students in receipt of some assistance who commenced their courses in 2010 will be assisted throughout the full duration of their courses.  However, it has been brought to my attention that in the case of students in receipt of assistance who began their courses in the current academic year, 2011-2012, this new legislation will not provide for such assistance to continue.  As I said on Committee Stage, it would be a shame if the lack of additional support and incentives that many young people need was to cause them to quit their third level or further education studies.  I would like to have that matter investigated also.</p>
          <p eId="para_1045">No matter what good promotional campaigns the Minister conducts on the availability of Government programmes, many of the most marginalised will not have been reading the newspapers and as such will not be aware of the redress board and its functions.  What I genuinely believe is a small number of people should not be denied access to assistance that would have been readily available to them had they participated in the work of the redress board earlier.  Through no fault of their own, however, they did not apply to it.</p>

          <p eId="para_1046">It is crucial for us to step back and look at the reason we are here - the experience of horrendous abuse suffered by many in institutions.  The State has a responsibility in that regard.  The people concerned have been excluded during their lives and not listened to.  However, in framing this legislation we are talking about excluding some of them who under other circumstances would have been entitled to redress before now.  That is simply wrong.  The Minister says he will review the matter in two years, but Deputy Brendan Smith's point is critical.  This is a diminishing group and because of their age profile their numbers are, sadly, becoming smaller.  Therefore, two years is a long time for such a group to wait and providing for such a review period is just not good enough.  We are talking about a statutory fund, allegedly, to meet the needs of survivors, many of whom tell us that their needs are not being met because we are excluding them from participating.  The fund must be opened up in that regard, as otherwise we will be doing another wrong to the very ones for whom we are seeking some justice.  The definition is too narrow.  I fully endorse the point made that this would not be creating a bureaucratic nightmare of assessment if we were to open it up to the small numbers eligible to apply.  These points have to be taken on board.</p>

          <from>Deputy Ruairí Quinn</from>
          <p eId="para_1047">I appreciate the sincerity with which colleagues on the other side of the House have approached this matter.  I know they have met, as I have, many members of the wide group of people concerned.  One cannot really call them a group, but there is a large number who share a common experience - they had this horrendous experience.  However, as their experiences are different, one cannot generalise.   For that reason, I have given an undertaking to review the matter in two years time.  This does not mean that in two years we will start a review process.  We will monitor the way the process unfolds and will make some statement or evaluation after two years.  That will not overload the working system, but we are not going to kick the can down the road.  Therefore, there will be a response in two years time as to what our experience has been and if changes or alterations are required, we will consider them.  That is the only commitment I am giving, to review the matter within that timeframe because I have heard what Deputy Clare Daly said about the age profile of some of the survivors.</p>
          <p eId="para_1048">The redress scheme has been running since 2002 and over 15,000 people have come through the system.  We know, however, that there are more who did not apply.  We also know of some who did apply but who were not given compensation for all the reasons with which Deputy Clare Daly is familiar.</p>
          <p eId="para_1049">We have considered the amendments and the process involved.  The total fund is of the order of €110 million.  If it is divided by 15,000, one gets an average figure of €7,300 per person.  Any widening of the fund would lessen its effectiveness.  It is available to help people who have, to a certain extent, been granted an award which recognises that it is the State's response by way of compensation.  It is to assist them in the rest of their lives.  This is the best way to go in that it is the most effective way to respond to what are considered to be this particular group's requirements.</p>

          <from>Deputy Seán Crowe</from>
          <p eId="para_1050">I have referred to the woman who spent seven years going through the courts without success.  She failed because the local bishop or archbishop took a case on the basis of "an inexcusable and inordinate delay" in taking the original case.  Consequently, she found herself out of the legal process.  She went to the redress board where, for whatever reason, she was not successful either.  She is outside the process and in the age cohort mentioned.</p>
          <p eId="para_1051">Is there any point in trying to understand the mindset of those who did not take the courts' route or apply to the redress board?  It is similar to those who are raped or otherwise attacked and assaulted.  At this stage they may not feel able to go through a claims process.  Having spoken to many such persons, I know that the thought of narrating their stories is too difficult for them.  Gardaí who regularly deal with victims know that they may feel strong enough to tell their story at some stage, but it is a huge step to ask someone to do so.  We call them survivors who have survived some terrible things in their lives.  My worry is that in establishing a process to help and support them we may actually make it worse in some cases.  In establishing such a fund to help with support, including counselling and medical care, we must not leave people out, yet I believe strongly that that is what we are doing.  I have listened to what the Minister is saying, but he is wrong on this one.  I will be pressing my amendment.</p>

          <p eId="para_1052">I thank the Minister for his clarification, but I am still concerned about a two year review provision.  We all know that no matter who is in government, such review periods can often be extended.  They are generally never undertaken within the timeframe set, although that is not a reflection on the Department.  However, it is a reflection on the system that deadlines for reviews, whether in the public or private sector, are generally not met.</p>
          <p eId="para_1053">The Minister has stated - this is understandable - that there is a finite amount of money available to be divided among the number of people who were granted awards by the redress board.  Having spoken to many of them, as well as their representative groups, I know that a lot of them have been in ill health during the years.  There has also been natural attrition of the age cohort.  I wonder, therefore, how many of thelm will be alive when the time comes.  We do not know the answer, but it depends on the law of averages.  I do not know if dividing the finite amount of money available by the exact number of recipients of awards will provide the correct amount.  I mentioned this when we were debating the legislation over one year ago when I had been spokesperson for only a few months.  From speaking to individuals and groups both here and in Britain, I am convinced that a small number did not take the opportunity to go before the redress board.  In the overall scheme, it would be a shame if, having met the relevant criteria, they were to be denied the much needed support and assistance available from the trust fund.</p>

          <p eId="para_1180">The Minister will agree that I am being consistent in bringing forward this amendment which has been suggested to me by persons who have been through the redress process.  The argument which we have gone through on Committee Stage is essentially that the people concerned should be allowed to decide for themselves how they will use a payment received from the fund.  The Minister referred at the committee to the specific purpose for which the fund was being established.  However, many of the people to whom I spoke felt very strongly that the decision should be theirs and that the availability of a once-off lump sum payment would allow survivors the choice and opportunity to spend their compensation as they saw fit, whether on counselling, education or otherwise.  They are very much opposed to the State asserting its power by demanding they must operate within the parameters of the fund.  Rather than having to use the money for counselling, as prescribed by the State, people who have been through the process, particularly those living abroad, are strongly of the view that there should be more flexible access to moneys.</p>
          <p eId="para_1181">The Minister referred to a figure of €7,300 when he broke down the fund.  He argued that the fund was separate from the redress process as its purpose was to provide supports for former residents of the residential institutions.  The survivors argue that they should be free to choose how they spend moneys from the fund.</p>

          <from>Deputy Clare Daly</from>
          <p eId="para_1182">I support the arguments made by Deputy Seán Crowe on this extremely important amendment.  We should listen to those who have been excluded.  It is indisputable that a large number of those who have contacted Deputies believe the fund, as constituted, will not meet their needs.  The role of the Oireachtas in this matter is to address their needs.  Deputies who participated in the Committee Stage debate will have met one or two individuals who broke down during a break in the discussions.  I recall one man who took hold of my hand and told me that while he was well - to be honest, he did not look well - and his needs at his advanced age had been met, he worried about what would happen to three of his children who were in wheelchairs.  If he could use a payment for the welfare of his children, the fund would meet his needs.</p>
          <p eId="para_1183">I have received correspondence from people who need educational services for their children and wish to have a choice about how to spend money from the fund.  Others have made an equally persuasive case for using the fund to provide some form of pension for victims of the residential institutions.  Having a lump sum payment which individuals would be free to administer would be a much more straightforward and faster option than that proposed.  One of the major issues to emerge from the correspondence we have received from survivors is that many of them believe the services to which the legislation will give them access are public services that are available to them in any case.  While there may be problems with waiting lists for health services and so forth, survivors believe this legislation is an underhand means of investing more money in public services and does not meet their specific needs.  Their needs would be met if they had control over the fund.  This is an extremely important amendment which I ask the Minister to accept.</p>

          <p eId="para_1184">The proposal in amendment No. 7 that a once-off payment be made from the fund is not acceptable, given that there is no apparent linkage between the making of such a payment and the needs of a former resident.  The purpose of the fund is not and never was to provide a form of additional compensation - that issue has been dealt with by the redress board - the fund, as advocated in the motion passed by the House in 2009, is intended for the support of victims of abuse.</p>

Tá cuid des na hiasachtóirí seo ag éirí saibhir ar dhroim theaghlaigh atá faoi chruatán.  Ní tharlódh seo murab é go bhfuil an Rialtas ag ligint do rátaí ollmhóra úis tarlú. </p>
          <p eId="para_1304">Throughout the State low and middle income families are struggling to get by.  As each month passes the recession bites deeper and deeper.  Unemployment, wage cuts, tax increases, the household charge, cuts to rent supplement and rising mortgage distress are pushing more and more families into severe financial hardship.  Hundreds of thousands of people are turning to moneylenders to make ends meet.  Only recently I spoke to a constituent who had turned to moneylenders to pay basic household bills while waiting for a social welfare claim to be processed.  The interest rates she had to pay on the loan put her into significant financial hardship but since it took several months to process her social welfare claim she took the view that she simply had no choice.</p>
          <p eId="para_1305">According to Social Justice Ireland, the State's poorest families experienced a disposable income drop of almost 18.7% in 2000 alone.  We know that families are having to make impossible decisions on a daily basis, such as whether to pay the gas and electricity bills or pay the mortgage.  Faced with these impossible choices, many are getting into even greater levels of debt simply to get by.</p>
          <p eId="para_1306">The What's Left Tracker 2012, published last week by the Irish League of Credit Unions, provides a graphic picture of the human face behind these figures.  The report stated that 1.8 million families are left with €100 or less each month after bills are paid, some 25% of credit card holders rely on their credit cards to make ends meet each month and 40% of people have borrowed to pay household bills in the past 12 months.  Astonishingly, 10% of people are using moneylenders.  Incredibly, there is no cap on the rates of interest that moneylenders licensed in this State can charge.</p>
          <p eId="para_1307">Some 46 licensed moneylenders operate in the State and according to some figures they provide credit to more than 300,000 people.  Much of this credit takes the form of short-term loans, often offered at high interest rates.  Under existing legislation there is no cap on interest charged by licensed moneylenders.  Some lenders charge an annual percentage rate, APR, of up to 210%.  I have one question for every Member and Minister while we are dealing with this Bill.  Can they stand over the imposition of such charges, especially on the poorest in society, who believe they have no option but to go to these lenders?  The only reason these lenders can charge such excessive rates is that the House has not yet placed a cap on interest rates.  As a result of the inaction of the Oireachtas over many years some lenders are, without doubt, getting rich on the back of hard-pressed families.</p>
          <p eId="para_1308">Let us consider the position throughout the European Union.  Many EU member states operate interest rate caps on licensed moneylenders.  A 2010 European Commission study identified 13 states that operated such a cap.  These included Belgium, where the cap ranges from 10% to 19.5% APR, France, where the range is from 5.7% to 21.6% APR, and Spain, where the rate cap is 10% APR.  In these and other states politicians have already decided there is a limit to the amount of interest licensed moneylenders can charge, especially when lending to low income families struggling under the weight of household debt.</p>
          <p eId="para_1309">The Bill tabled by Sinn Féin seeks to bring this State into line with our EU counterparts.  Of the 46 moneylenders with licences in this State, 29 charge an APR of more than 100% while 14 charge more than 150% APR.  One moneylender charges an APR of 210%.  This means it would cost a person who goes to that moneylender and takes out a €500 loan for his family, who may be struggling to pay the bills and get by, a total of €186 if the loan were for six months and €375 if the loan were for 12 months.  Given that loans of the same amount from the Credit Union would cost the same family €13 and €25 respectively, there is no justification for this vast mark-up.  Such excessive interest rates push hard-pressed families further into financial stress and poverty.  It is a vicious cycle and we all know it.  There is no moral or economic justification for the absence of a cap on interest rates charges by licensed moneylenders.</p>
          <p eId="para_1310">The Bill under discussion proposes a cap of 40% APR.  This would mean that while some moneylenders would be required to charge less, no lender could breach the 40% cap.  What would this mean for the family to which I referred earlier, a member of which went to a moneylender for €500?  At a maximum that struggling family would have paid €50 for a loan for six months or €97 for 12 months.  This is a fairer level for customers and it would also allow licensed moneylenders to operate on a sound commercial basis.</p>
          <p eId="para_1311">Some licensed moneylenders in EU member states are significant businesses.  The largest moneylender in this State is an organisation called Provident.  Bloomberg reported recently that Provident is set to make €1.3 billion in profits next year from its operations in Ireland and other member states.</p>
          <p eId="para_1312">In 2006 the Polish Government introduced a cap of 20% on licensed moneylenders.  As in Ireland, Provident is one of the largest moneylenders in the market in Poland.  It has continued to trade profitably in Poland even after the introduction of a cap.  An APR of 20% is the maximum charge in Poland whereas in this State the largest moneylender can charge a rate of 187%.  It is no wonder the company is set to make €1.3 billion in profits globally.  If the Government supports the principle of a cap but is unsure about the figure of 40%, I call on Government Members to let this Bill pass to Committee Stage.  At that stage we could tease out the finer details and determine the appropriate level to ensure that moneylenders can continue to exist but people are not being fleeced at the same time.  Sinn Féin is open to discussing the level of the cap but of greater importance to the party is that over the course of the debate the Government accepts the notion that there should be a reduction in the APR charged and that we need to follow the example of other European countries and introduce a cap.  There is an urgent need for Government to introduce a cap on interest rates and there is also a need for a wide-ranging reform of the regulation of licensed moneylenders and the policing of illegal loan sharks.  Last month the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Shatter, in a reply to my party colleague, Deputy Stanley, confirmed there is no record of a successful prosecution for illegal money lending in the past seven years.  Clearly, there is something wrong and that also needs to be reformed.</p>
          <p eId="para_1313">Earlier this month I asked the Minister for Finance to consider the issue of an interest rate cap on moneylenders as part of a broader reform of the regulation of licensed moneylenders.  He stated that he had no plans to amend the existing regime and he quoted a 2007 research paper from the Central Bank which stated that a cap might not reduce the total cost of credit.  I have read that piece of research to which he referred and its conclusion is not based on any empirical evidence.  It took two similar loans with different APRs and different durations and from that comparison alone, it drew its conclusion.  This is not a sufficient basis for making such an important policy decision.</p>
          <p eId="para_1314">Níl sa leasú atá molta sa Bhille seo romhainn ach leasú macánta.  Is féidir go cinnte le gach Teachta tacaíocht a thabhairt don leasú.  Má chuirtear an leasú seo i ndlí, beidh tionchar láidir aige ar an gcruatan airgid atá á fhulaingt ag na céadta mílte teaghlaigh, atá faoi ualach trom.  Déanfaidh an leasú seo an saol níos fearr do líon mór daoine ag am nuair atá cuid mhór den tsaoil buailte ar dhrocham agus ar chruatan.</p>
          <p eId="para_1315">The amendment contained in this Bill is modest.  It does not pretend to be anything otherwise.  However, it is an amendment that I hope every Deputy in this House can support.  It is also an amendment that, if put into law, would have an immediate impact on the financial hardship experienced by tens, if not hundreds, of thousands of hard-pressed families.  It is an amendment that would make life better for a large number of people at a time when so much of their lives have been hit with bad news.  It is an amendment that is being tabled in the genuine hope it can get cross-party support.</p>
          <p eId="para_1316">I sincerely hope there is no Deputy in this House who believes it is right or just to charge APRs of 150% or 210%, as is currently happening, on loans, especially those taken out to pay essential household bills.  I urge the Minister and Deputies from all parties to stand together and support this Bill.  It will not solve the burden of household debt but it will make a real and tangible difference to many of the most financially distressed families in the State.</p>

          <p eId="para_1317">The Consumer Credit (Amendment) Bill aims to introduce a cap of 40% on the amount of APR a licensed moneylender can charge a borrower.</p>
          <p eId="para_1318">To our shame, the State has failed to introduce any cap on interest charged by licensed moneylenders, allowing the 46 licensed moneylenders to charge as they will.  The highest rate being charged, at 210%, is scandalous.  This is forcing households into spiralling debt that will never be cleared.  Households which cannot access credit from the banks or credit unions live in permanent debt.  They are always burdened about how they will clear this.  What should be enjoyable occasions, such as first communions, Christmas and birthdays, become a nightmare for them and turn into crises in that they worry and torment themselves about how they will find money for them.</p>
          <p eId="para_1319">The Bill is a reasonable response to a massive crisis.  We are dealing with legal money-lending tonight, but I have seen the effects of both legal and illegal moneylenders, particularly on the most vulnerable.  We fully understand that if we propose an APR that is too low - Sinn Féin is trying to be reasonable about this - we will force legal moneylenders underground, the sector will become totally unregulated and that will only lead to further and more sinister problems with illegal moneylending.</p>
          <p eId="para_1320">In County Laois I have witnessed the effects of the crisis, with both legal and illegal moneylenders.  I have come across cases where children's allowance books are held as a surety by moneylenders and women are forced to hand over money each month outside the post office.  As I found out in reply to a parliamentary question, there have been no prosecutions in the State in the past seven years for that type of activity by moneylenders.</p>
          <p eId="para_1321">Moneylending is not done by some small group of shady individuals sneakily driving around the estates. The biggest moneylender, as Deputy Pearse Doherty stated, is a multi-million euro institute called Provident, which is mainly owned by banks and large financial institutions.  Provident has the largest share of the moneylending market in the State, yet, because its headquarters is in London, it is under no obligation to publish figures on its trading balance and profit here.  All we know is that there are approximately 100,000 doing business with it, if one could call it that.  We estimate its Irish profits are high.  What we know is that Provident, internationally, is set to make millions of euro in profits again this year and in the coming year.</p>
          <p eId="para_1322">The Bill does not pretend to solve all of the problems facing families caught up in the awful spiral of debt but by not supporting the Bill, the Government remains out of step with our EU partners.  There is much talk in this House about being in step with the rest of Europe and being good Europeans.  Let us be good Europeans by supporting this Bill.  Thirteen states have a cap on the interest rate moneylenders can charge, with an average APR of 15% to 20%.</p>
          <p eId="para_1323">One of the longer term solutions is that families which normally do not have access to bank or credit unions would have that.  One in six adults are excluded completely from the banking and financial sector which means they have no access to loans or mortgages as those in the mainstream who are working have.  The irony of this is that some of the banks which are refusing them permission to open a bank account are owned by the State.  The State should use its influence - I appeal to the Minister of State, Deputy Brian Hayes, to bring this to the attention of the Government - to encourage banks to allow those who are poor and those with small amounts of money to be able to open bank accounts.  To date, the banks have behaved disgracefully, keeping those on the margins in the grasp of legal and illegal moneylenders.  Ultimately, there is a need for a not-for-profit lending institute the sole function of which would be to make small interest-free loans available.  The credit unions could play a more active role in this regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_1324">I urge Deputies from all parties to back this Bill.  The Bill is about relieving poverty in the State.</p>

          <p eId="para_1325">The economic crisis gripping this country has left many in difficult situations.  Every one of us in this Chamber has heard the harrowing tales of those who simply do not have enough money to afford the bare necessities.  It puts so many people in a difficult situation.  What do they choose to spend their little amount of money on?  Do they spend it on crippling mortgage payments?  Do they spend it on food for their families?  Do they spend it on school books and uniforms for their children?  There are people willing to sacrifice heating their home just in order that they can afford essential medical services.  These must be some of the most difficult questions that any household could face and it is our duty, our responsibility as elected representatives, to help alleviate their suffering in any way we can.</p>
          <p eId="para_1326">The purpose of this Bill is simple.  It is, essentially, to place a cap on the interest rates that legal moneylenders can enforce on those who must borrow from them.  The difficult questions people are forced to ask of themselves places many in that difficult situation where they have little choice but to seek money from the easiest, and often only, possible route.  When one is not able to obtain a loan from a credit union or from a bank, one is forced to seek a loan from moneylenders.  The current legislation means those who find themselves in difficult situations can suffer extortion from moneylenders and extremely high interest rates.  This is immoral.  Moneylenders are using the suffering of people to make a profit off them, which simply cannot be allowed to continue.  A 40% interest rate cap is a necessary step to bring these moneylenders into line with reality.  We cannot, as legislators, let them extort from the most vulnerable in this society.</p>
          <p eId="para_1327">We also need a wider debate on the role moneylenders play in our society.  First, we must address why people are forced to seek loans from these outlets.  It is not a healthy sign for our society that so many people are forced into a situation in which they must go to such lengths to cover essential items.  Second, we need to have a discussion as to how we may find an alternative to the current system of moneylenders.  There must be an easier and better way for people in difficulty to attain small, short-term loans.</p>
          <p eId="para_1328">We also need to take cognisance of the recent report by Social Justice Ireland showing the alarming and growing imbalance between the poor and the wealthy in this country.  We must re-examine the level of disposable income required to maintain an individual or a family with some dignity, we must put protections in place to support those whose income drops through no fault of their own, we must eliminate the inexcusable delays in deciding on applications or on appeals for social welfare and we must make the supplementary welfare scheme fit for purpose.</p>
          <p eId="para_1329">Moneylenders, licensed or unlicensed, are an indictment of the State and its failure to protect our people.  This Sinn Féin Bill merely seeks to put a cap of 40% on licensed moneylenders' interest.  If the Government Deputies oppose this Bill, it will certainly appear to us and, more importantly, it will be obvious to the public that the Government is opposing a very modest but real attempt to make life better for at least 100,000 of our citizens.</p>

          <p eId="para_1330">As I said during my contribution to the debate on the Personal Insolvency Bill last week, we need to take into account the reasons people are resorting to moneylenders, whether of the licensed or illegal variety.  In most cases, we are talking about people who have been refused credit from the banks and other high street lenders for mortgages, personal loans or, in some cases, business loans.</p>
          <p eId="para_1331">On Monday last, a young woman came to my office in Tralee because her single parent payment had been stopped on the pretext that she was residing with her boyfriend, which was not true.  For the past four months, she has been living on handouts from her parents, friends and so forth.  She is so desperate that she is going to illegal moneylenders to try to feed her three children and the Society of St. Vincent de Paul has kept her alive up to this point in time.  People are being forced into situations in which they feel they have no recourse but to seek loans from sub-prime lenders or moneylenders who charge much higher rates of interest than the mainstream institutions.</p>
          <p eId="para_1332">Last week I mentioned the Wise Mortgage Company in this context and specifically asked the Minister to respond to the fact that this company is in clear breach of Central Bank regulations.  The Wise Mortgage Company is owned by an American citizen, Mr. Ronald Weisz, who has bankruptcy and convictions against his name both in the United States and in this State.  That surely ought to preclude him from being involved in moneylending and providing mortgages, yet there is no legal structure covering companies such as the Wise Mortgage Company in regard to their suitability to operate here.  During the debate in the House last week, I noted that the Minister of State, Deputy Perry, appeared to indicate to his Department officials that I had referred to this issue, and I hope there will be a response to the issues I raised.  The Wise Mortgage Company came to my attention some eight years ago when a farmer in my constituency was having his land repossessed by this vulture.  The fact that he was prepared to pay back the original loan and substantial interest would not suffice.  When he got the loan initially it was at 9% interest, but this doubled to 18% if there was a late payment.  This man is still operating.  I am dealing with another case in the west in which the Wise Mortgage Company is involved.  What is even more criminal is that a solicitor acting on behalf of the Wise Mortgage Company was also acting on behalf of the person borrowing the money.  That solicitor was at that point in time on the board of the Wise Mortgage Company, yet there seems to be no regulation that can do anything whatsoever to prevent such people carrying out this type of activity against decent, honourable people who are struggling to make a living.</p>
          <p eId="para_1333">It is also a fact that while sub-prime and high interest mortgages and loan facilities may be necessary and welcomed by the people initially taking out the loans, in many cases they then find themselves in trouble, and the sub-prime lenders and moneylenders are more likely to take aggressive court action for repossessions on foot of outstanding loans.  Of course, in the case of illegal moneylenders, the consequences can be far more serious for people who fall behind on repayments.  I note the comments of my two colleagues that it is seven years since there was a conviction against illegal moneylenders, while we all know it is happening in every working class housing estate throughout the country.</p>
          <p eId="para_1334">While in some cases the mainstream lenders might feel the problems encountered by clients of moneylenders justify their having refused them loans, in many cases they have also driven them into that position.  We are all familiar with people, including business people, who were at one time considered to be worthy of loans but are now considered too high a risk.  Many, if not most, businesses in the State will attest to the difficulties of securing loans, even when they believe they have presented a viable repayment plan and when the loan requested has been to expand operations and employment.  Indeed, there were cases in which businesses were refused loans to expand operations but were instead offered loans to invest in property.  Of course, while all of that ended with the collapse of the speculative bubble, it spoke volumes about the attitude of some banks that were central to this madness.</p>
          <p eId="para_1335">Banks have also placed people in financial difficulties by increasing their credit card limits without applications from the people concerned.  Human nature being what it is, most people probably welcomed that and spent accordingly.  However, this does not absolve the banks of their responsibility, and the same applies to their role in the issuing of mortgages.</p>
          <p eId="para_1336">Another problem is that people who formerly found it easy to get loans from credit unions are now being turned down for a variety of reasons.  In some cases this has been due to reductions in repayments or missed repayments, but in other cases they have been told they are ineligible for new loans until previous ones have been cleared.  In some cases, such applicants have had substantial deposits with the credit union and, therefore, might be considered good risks.  The point is that although the criteria have clearly changed, the attitudes of credit unions also appear to differ depending on the branch.  One reason I have heard is that the IMF audit of credit union books has led to a tightening of loan criteria, which is generally known, but also that all credit unions are being made to pay for the sins of a few credit unions which were involved in reckless lending.  Surely the rogue branches ought to have been taken to task rather than the institution as a whole being hamstrung by the intervention of the Central Bank on the instructions of the IMF.</p>
          <p eId="para_1337">The point of all this is that the restriction of loans, including from credit unions, is driving more and more people into the hands of high-interest moneylenders, including illegal moneylenders.  A small six-month loan from a legal moneylender will typically have an interest rate from 187% upwards.  One of the main lenders, Provident, has recently been reported as having 100,000 clients.  It offers short-term loans at high rates but, presumably, in the vast majority of cases the people accessing the loans are able to meet whatever weekly repayments are involved in borrowing, say, €500 over three to six months.  The real issue, of course, is that when someone is paying back €25 or €30 a week, they do not notice the huge interest being charged, even if they have been told they will be repaying a much higher amount than borrowed.  All they are interested in is the short-term necessity of having €500 or €1,000.</p>
          <p eId="para_1338">Surely the mainstream institutions have a case to answer in driving people down that avenue when in most cases people, even those with a bad credit rating, would be able to meet repayments on small short-term loans.</p>
          <p eId="para_1339">Given the reliability of the credit unions, which were always considered to be the poor person's banks, the fact that such stringent criteria are being applied is driving people who find themselves in desperate circumstances - they may be trying to get children ready for first Holy Communion or confirmation or to buy books for children returning to school - into the hands of sub-prime moneylenders or illegal moneylenders.  The matter becomes more insidious when one considers that in a high proportion of cases people are borrowing for the short term to deal with emergencies, including paying household bills and putting food on the table, and their mortgage repayments are in arrears.</p>
          <p eId="para_1340">It must be factored in also that Provident is not some homely corner shop but a massively lucrative company with profits of hundreds of millions of euro in this country and, as we have heard, billions of euro internationally.  It is an integral part of the global financial octopus which is sucking the life out of this country.  For many people, one of the tentacles is the extraction of more and more of their income.  It is truly a vicious circle at every stage.</p>
          <p eId="para_1341">As with the mortgage and other personal debt issues, moneylending is something that must of necessity be tackled by the State.  This Bill is an opportunity for the Minister of State, the Government and all Deputies who support the Government to show courage and stand with the people most in need in our society.  They should take a stand against the vultures that are out there, including the Wise Mortgage Company, Provident and illegal moneylenders, by accepting this Bill and creating an opportunity for people to borrow in a reasonable way to feed and clothe their children or get themselves out of extreme difficulty.</p>

          <p eId="para_1342">Ba mhaith liom an Teachta Pearse Doherty a mholadh de bharr an Bille seo.  This is an important initiative to introduce a cap on what is paid back to licensed moneylenders.  However, we should not forget that many loan sharks are intimidating and extorting exorbitant rates from citizens.  Last week saw a mother of five receive a suspended sentence after loan sharks forced her to grow cannabis plants in her children's bedroom.</p>
          <p eId="para_1343">Every day this Dáil discusses the impact of the Government's savage austerity policies on the lives of citizens.  In our constituencies we meet community and voluntary groups and individuals desperately struggling with the consequences of unemployment, austerity, cuts to public services and debt.  It is the austerity policies of this Fine Gael and Labour Party Government which are driving more and more citizens into the hands of moneylenders.  This is evidenced in the ESRI report which found that budget 2012 disproportionately affected citizens on low and middle incomes.  Beidh an Rialtas ag pleanáil an chéad bhuiséid eile ó seo ar aghaidh.  Tá éileamh á dhéanamh don séú austerity budget seo nach gcuirfear leis an mbochtanas atá ag 1.8 milliún duine atá ag maireachtáil ar €100 nó níos lú. Sin €25 a week.  Very few Deputies or Ministers could live on €25 a week.  One of the bleakest findings in the report was that 17% of adults - that is, 600,000 people - have absolutely nothing left for discretionary spending once all bills are paid.  These are the citizens who are being forced to borrow not to buy drink, luxuries or pleasure but to pay utility bills, make mortgage payments and put food on their tables.</p>
          <p eId="para_1344">According to the Irish League of Credit Unions, 10% of households are turning to moneylenders to pay household bills, and many find that once caught in the moneylending trap it is almost impossible to escape.  There is no cap currently for licensed moneylenders, and some lenders charge up to 210% APR.  These lenders are making super profits on the back of hard-pressed families.  They can do that only because the Government has done nothing to tackle excessive interest rates.  A 210% APR means that a €500 loan taken out by a struggling family to pay a gas or electricity bill would cost them €186 if the loan was for six months and €375 if the loan was for 12 months.  With little prospect of work or increased earnings, families are forced to return to moneylenders even before they have the last debt paid to try to pay the next bill.  It is a vicious circle.  Given that a €500 loan from a credit union would cost the same family €13 and €25, respectively, the excessiveness of these rates is obvious.</p>
          <p eId="para_1345">There is undoubtedly a broader issue in regard to the way those on low incomes interact with financial institutions.  One in six of the population do not have a bank account, a bank card, or access to an overdraft or other borrowing facilities.  These citizens are dependent on cash and credit from legal or illegal moneylenders.  Of the 46 licensed moneylenders in this State, 36 offer a doorstep collection service.  That means that every week someone calls to collect the money.  Of the 46 moneylenders currently operating licences, 29 have APRs of more than 100%.  Fourteen of them charge 150%.  Sin fiacha ar bharr fhiacha.  Tá neart scríofa agus ráite faoi na deacrachtaí atá acu siúd atá faoi riaráistí morgáiste.</p>
          <p eId="para_1346">Ar an 18 Eanáir bhí tuairim agus 70,019 duine i riaráistí ar feadh 91 lá.  Fine Gael and the Labour Party promised a lot for mortgage holders when in opposition.  Sinn Féin welcomed the arrival, belatedly, of the Personal Insolvency Bill, but that Bill hands the banks a veto over personal insolvency arrangements.  The reality is that 15% of mortgage holders are now in serious distress.  The Governor of the Central Bank, Patrick Honohan, has told us that 25% of all mortgages, by value, are in arrears or have been restructured.  That is illustrated by the huge increase in claimants of mortgage interest supplement in recent years.  That is the payment which provides short-term support to help an individual make mortgage interest repayments.  In 2007, in my constituency of Louth, only 75 citizens were in receipt of this payment.  By March of this year, that number had leapt to 465.  The State-wide figure is 18,000.  By any measure, therefore, we have a huge crisis in regard to mortgages.  The Taoiseach has stated that this is the single biggest crisis facing our people, but the problems of debt, moneylenders and austerity have more profound implications.  Figures show that the number of suicides rose last year to 525 - an increase of 7%.  Those are the ones that are reported.  Some 439 men and 86 women are recorded as having taken their own lives in 2011.  Deputy Dan Neville, President of the Irish Association of Suicidology, acknowledged that these figures were frightening but not surprising given the state of the economy.  Yesterday's report made a clear connection between austerity and suicide.  It revealed that of the 190 deaths in Cork - that is a huge number of citizens in that city - 31% were unemployed.</p>
          <p eId="para_1347">The excessive interest rates being charged by licensed moneylenders, and all the other pressures upon pressures, are pushing hard-pressed families further into financial stress, real distress and increased poverty.  There is no real moral, economic or political justification for the absence of a cap on interest rates charged by licensed moneylenders.  The Bill introduced by Sinn Féin proposes a cap of 40%.  This level is fairer to customers while allowing licensed lenders to operate on a sound commercial basis.  It may be that the Government did not know the detail or the consequences of all of this.  I say that in a very fraternal way.  Having heard the facts, there is obviously an urgent need for a cap to be introduced on interest rates and for there to be more wide-ranging reform of the regulation of licensed moneylenders and the policing of illegal loan sharks.  I ask all Deputies to support the Bill.</p>

          <p eId="para_1350">I thank Deputy Pearse Doherty for preparing the Bill we are debating tonight and tomorrow night and for presenting it for the information of the House.  There is a comprehensive licensing system in place for moneylenders.  In that regard, I will outline shortly for the information of the House the main provisions of Part VIII of the Consumer Credit Act 1995 which deal with moneylenders.  However, I wish to inform the House that the Government intends to oppose the Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_1351">The most likely impact of applying a cap rate of 40% APR - or a lesser rate as is outlined in the explanatory memorandum - is that moneylending would no longer be viable, licence renewals would not be sought and it would effectively close down the industry.  The Government is aware of the burden placed on customers because of the high rates charged by moneylenders.  However, as Deputies will appreciate, moneylending is an inherently expensive business.  Licensed moneylenders serve a high-risk borrower segment, by way of a labour intensive operational model, and through offering loan amounts which are too low effectively to cover the costs of running the business if offered at low interest rates.  Given that many customers of licensed moneylenders would have few, if any, other sources of licensed credit available to them, the proposal regarding a cap on the APR would likely increase growth in illegal moneylending.  That is one unintended consequence of the Bill and it is something that all of us, I presume, oppose.  Pushing more people into the hands of unscrupulous and unregulated moneylenders would make no sense and would further marginalise those who need protection most.</p>
          <p eId="para_1352">Licensed moneylenders service a varied group of customers but are closely identified with marginalised or vulnerable consumers.  Meeting the financial needs of such consumers is a complex multidimensional policy issue.  The Government is already engaged in a number of measures, such as the provision of basic payment accounts and the implementation of a national financial education programme, both of which are designed to support persons and families targeted by moneylenders and, more generally, promote financial inclusion and reduce over-indebtedness.</p>
          <p eId="para_1353">For the information of the House, an EU proposal will shortly come into being, which will provide for a basic payment account.  It is crucial to give everyone the right to have an account so that their financial transactions can be carried out.  The basic payment account, if properly designed and marketed, provides marginalised consumers with an opportunity to engage with mainstream credit providers, build up a good savings record and ultimately access mainstream credit.  I was surprised to hear the information that has been estimated that currently 17% of Irish householders do not have access to a bank account that can make payments through the clearing system.  The implications for people are stark if one does not have access to a bank account.  The question arises as to how one pays a bill, makes debit payments, and collects and transacts with financial institutions.  What is required in this case is a further exploration of the need to have basic payment accounts for all citizens rolled out over a period.  Without that, we are not going to make a great difference.  It is no surprise that people would call around to one's house to collect money if one does not have a basic bank account because one cannot work through the clearing process.  It is a major inequality if people do not have access in the normal way to the banking system that is in place for everyone else.  It can have a significant impact on the financial well-being of citizens.  As part of the Government's policy to improve financial inclusion levels, a pilot project has commenced to introduce a basic payment account.  The project is being tested until the end of this year and it will be evaluated to ensure it is meeting the needs of the target population before a more refined offering will be rolled out on a nationwide basis next year.</p>
          <p eId="para_1354">Deputy Pearse Doherty referred to a study from 2007, but the House might wish to note that a more recent UK study from 2009 found that a licensed moneylender, to be financially viable, must charge a high cost of credit, even on a not-for-profit basis.  Specifically, the study found that a not-for-profit home credit business to break even by year five would require an £18 million subsidy of start-up capital and APR of 123% on an average £288 loan over 56 weeks to be commercially viable.  Given the Irish context, in particular the small market size, and taking into account the above findings, it is not likely that many moneylenders would be commercially viable operations by offering loans at rates of credit of substantially less than they are currently authorised.</p>
          <p eId="para_1355">While licensed moneylenders may be the subject of adverse comment, which I understand, they service a gap in the market not served fully by mainstream lenders, in a manner which is deemed to suit the particular needs of their customers, for example, convenience in payment and collection, speed at which a loan may be granted and a long-standing or family relationship with a particular moneylender.  As I indicated, there is a comprehensive licensing system in place for moneylenders.  Currently, 46 licensed moneylenders operate in the State.  Annually, each must complete and return the appropriate moneylending application form to the Central Bank, together with a number of items for review and consideration.  A moneylender's licence granted by the Central Bank is specific to a moneylender, in that each individual moneylender's licence outlines the specific products that the moneylender offers, the APR for each product and the total cost of credit for each product.  Before applying for a moneylender's licence, an applicant must give notice of this intention in a local or national newspaper published in Ireland and circulating in the District Court area in which the applicant intends to engage in the business of moneylending.  Under section 93(10)(<i>g</i>), of the Consumer Credit Act, the Central Bank may refuse to grant a moneylender’s licence if, in the bank’s opinion, the cost of the credit to be charged is excessive or, if any of the terms and conditions attaching thereto are, again in the bank’s opinion, unfair.</p>
          <p eId="para_1356">There is provision in the Consumer Credit Act to appeal the decision to the Circuit Court.  There is a view that there may be a lack of transparency in how the Central Bank determines the authorised limits of APR and total cost of credit of moneylenders, nor are there guidelines in place to steer the bank in its authorisation-making process.  The Minister for Finance proposes to engage with the Central Bank with a view to deciding if the bank can develop guidelines, which will provide greater transparency on the rates charged by moneylenders.  The benefits that the introduction of guidelines could achieve include increased transparency for the public, a greater emphasis on the total cost of credit as the primary metric, a better understanding as to why the APR is a poor measure for typical moneylender loans, that is, low value and short-term loans, and greater confidence that licensed moneylenders are not earning big profits as a result of an express linkage between authorised terms and conditions and the underlying cost of providing the service.</p>
          <p eId="para_1357">The Minister for Finance has also asked the Central Bank to assess the situation in other EU countries, because, as Deputy Pearse Doherty and others have said, a variety of responses is evident.  Some countries have a cap while other countries do not.  However, one is not comparing like with like because the legislative framework in each of the countries is different.  Consequently, on foot of the Bill outlined by Deputy Pearse Doherty and his colleagues, the Minister for Finance proposes to engage with the Central Bank to undertake a thorough assessment of the position across other member states to get the best possible model, albeit at a guideline level, which the bank might propose.</p>
          <p eId="para_1358">In 2011 the Central Bank published the results of a themed inspection of licensed moneylenders.  The Central Bank has advised the Department of Finance that this inspection showed a high level of compliance with the law among firms.  Overall, the inspection found that customers were charged in accordance with the moneylender's authorised annual percentage rates, APRs, and the cost of credit.  Members also will be aware of the Central Bank's consumer protection code for licensed moneylenders.  The code sets out the general principles with which a moneylender must comply.  The code also places requirements on moneylenders in respect of the provision of information to the consumer, preservation of consumer rights, knowing the customer, suitability and unsolicited contact, debt collection and the contents and presentation of advertisements.  For example, all advertisements must contain the following warning in large font: "WARNING: This is a high cost loan".  In addition to the annual licensing regime, moneylenders are subject to new fitness and probity requirements under sections 20 and 22 of the Central Bank Reform Act 2010.</p>
          <p eId="para_1359">As I have outlined, the Central Bank is the competent authority with regard to licensed moneylending and in overseeing and regulating this activity.  It is an offence under the Consumer Credit Act to engage in the business of moneylending without the appropriate licence granted by the Central Bank.  Any suspicion of moneylending activity should be brought to the attention of An Garda Síochána for investigation.  As the Minister for Finance pointed out recently in reply to an oral parliamentary question, it is appreciated that enforcement can be difficult when moneylending is carried out on a small scale and the persons to whom the money is lent are reluctant to come forward to assist the Garda in bringing forward proceedings.</p>
          <p eId="para_1360">Before concluding, I wish to acknowledge the important work of the credit union sector in providing low cost loans for the unbanked and other vulnerable consumers.  The Government will continue to support the restructuring of the credit union sector to ensure its continued contribution to communities nationwide.  I thank Deputy Pearse Doherty and his colleagues for raising the issue of interest rates charged by licensed moneylenders.  The Government is aware of the concerns raised in this debate.  However, this issue must be examined carefully to ensure the solution proposed does not adversely affect the most vulnerable members of society.  This will be the Government's main aim in considering the findings of the examination to be carried out by the Central Bank and by the officials of the Department of Finance.</p>

          <from>Deputy Michael McGrath</from>
          <p eId="para_1361">I welcome the opportunity to contribute to the Second Stage debate on the Consumer Credit (Amendment) Bill 2012.  I commend Deputy Pearse Doherty and Sinn Féin for introducing the Bill.  On behalf of the Fianna Fáil Party, I confirm we will support it.  It echoes a call by the Irish League of Credit Unions, which is at the coalface in respect of dealing with such matters.  It is fair to state the question of how to regulate the practices of moneylenders has long challenged legislators.  All Members should acknowledge that for the vast majority of people, moneylenders, be they legal or illegal, are the lenders of last resort.  Members also should acknowledge it is understandable that a risk premium would be charged with regard to the interest rate.  The question posed by this Bill concerns what constitutes an acceptable risk premium to charge to customers who avail of the services of moneylenders.  Many such customers have a poor credit history and many of them turned to moneylenders because they are unable to access credit through the conventional routes normally are open to people, including the local bank or credit union.  Consequently, the Bill takes cognisance of this fact and in allowing for an APR of up to 40%, it recognises the reality that some of the loans being extended by moneylenders are of a risky nature.  Members should be fair and should acknowledge this point.  Moreover, that is the reason such interest rates are being tolerated, even within the proposals being made by Sinn Féin.</p>
          <p eId="para_1362">I listened to the Minister of State's speech on the monitor and do not believe anyone is trying to outlaw the practice of moneylending.  The question is what represents a fair interest rate to charge them?  The Minister of State referred to the Central Bank's report into the sector of 2007, as in the past has the Minister for Finance, Deputy Michael Noonan.  However, it would be reasonable to impose some level of a ceiling to the interest rate being charged by moneylenders.  In his opening remarks, Deputy Pearse Doherty asked the Government to accept the principle that a ceiling would be put in place and the finer details with regard to the precise APR could be worked out subsequently.  This is a reasonable position and the Bill should have been allowed to proceed to Committee Stage for a more detailed debate.  Perhaps the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform could have held hearings, involving groups such as the Irish League of Credit Unions, FLAC and the Society of St. Vincent de Paul, at which its members could listen to those who deal with people who are customers of moneylenders on a day-to-day basis.  When one deals with a regulator or a Central Bank, one often gets one perspective on an issue but the perspective of individual customers is equally important.</p>
          <p eId="para_1363">As all Members are aware, many people use moneylenders in the hope it will be a short-term measure to tide them over.  However, they end up by getting in deeper and find it hard to extricate themselves from being involved with them.  Statistics from the Money Advice and Budgeting Service showed that in a nine month period last year, 830 new clients were indebted to moneylenders, while the equivalent figure for the whole of 2010 was 1,418.  The Society of St. Vincent de Paul has raised concerns about how moneylenders operate by targeting people at certain times of the year and sending agents door-to-door offering cash.  More than 40 years have elapsed since the now infamous "Seven Days" RTE documentary on the practice of moneylending in Ireland was broadcast.  The programme caused significant controversy as it alleged there was a scourge of illegal moneylending in Ireland at the time and that moneylenders were using strong-arm tactics to extract payment from customers.  The programme's presenters, including current RTE sports presenter Bill O'Herlihy, were condemned at the time for what were believed to be exaggerated claims.  The Oireachtas set up a tribunal which to some extent shone a light on the moneylending sector.</p>
          <p eId="para_1364">While I am sure that some of the worst practices of that era are now behind us, it certainly is the case that the history is not without problems that must be addressed.  All Members can agree the Consumer Credit Act 1995 put in place a robust licensing regime in respect of moneylenders.  For example, it provided that a customer is entitled to a proper written agreement when borrowing money from a licensed moneylender, that a customer is entitled to a properly filled out repayment book, that it is illegal for a moneylender to charge interest on interest and that it is illegal for a moneylender to grant another loan to clear an existing loan.  Moreover, it is illegal for a moneylender to contact one at one's place of work without one's permission and it is illegal for a moneylender to trade without a licence.</p>
          <p eId="para_1365">Most Members will agree these are sound measures, in so far as they go, and provide a good basis for underpinning the operation of the sector.  However, the legislation does not address the question of potentially excessive interest rates.  The annual percentage rate allowable under each moneylending licence is set out on the Central Bank website and while no maximum rate of interest is set out in legislation, under section 93 of the Consumer Credit Act, the Central Bank may refuse to grant a moneylender's licence if, in the opinion of the bank, the cost of the credit sought by the moneylender is excessive or if any of the terms or conditions attaching to it are unfair.  Consequently, it beggars belief that the Central Bank is approving APRs at present levels and some of the previous speakers put on record the APRs that are being charged by the 46 licensed moneylenders in the country.  The true measure is an APR that includes the collection charge because when one examines, as I did today, the schedule of licensed moneylenders, one finds, for example, that one moneylender has a collection charge of 14 cent in the euro.  Many of them have collection charges of 10 cent in the euro.  By any measure, these are extremely exorbitant collection charges to be imposing on customers who are, by their very nature, vulnerable and who are accepting loans from moneylenders at a time when they are put to the pin of their collar.  When we include the collection charge, the APR can rise as high as 280%.  One licensed moneylender, based in Stillorgan, County Dublin, has an APR of 287.72%, including the collection charge.  There are many others with an APR in excess of 200%.  Any person who has experience of drawing down and trying to repay a loan will know exactly the impact of the interest rate on the amount of money being repaid.  It is scandalous that the State is standing over a situation where licensed moneylenders that are complying with all of the rules - I do not wish to suggest otherwise - are in a position where they can charge upwards of 300% APR when the collection charge is included.</p>
          <p eId="para_1366">I note that in February, the Central Bank published the results of a themed inspection of licensed moneylenders.  Inspections were conducted in 11 of the 46 licensed moneylenders currently operating in Ireland.  Overall, the inspections found a high level of compliance with the requirements and that consumers were being charged in accordance with the moneylenders' authorised APRs and costs of credit.  I have no evidence to the contrary.  I am sure the licensed moneylender sector is generally adhering to the rules that govern its operation.  This is hardly surprising, given the leeway under which licensed moneylenders can operate.  The rules on interest rates are so broad and so generous that it is no surprise they are operating within them.  It begs the question: if the Central Bank is approving moneylenders and allowing them to charge an APR of 288%, including the collection charge, then at what level of interest would the Central Bank shout "stop"?  At what level will the Central Bank declare that this is not acceptable and will put customers who are already in a difficult financial situation into an even worse situation?  How many applications is the Central Bank refusing?  Is it refusing applications by moneylenders who want to charge an APR of 400% or 500%?  There are moneylenders abroad who charge that level of interest.  I cannot understand how it is acceptable for the regulator, the consumer watchdog, to stand over a situation where moneylenders are allowed to charge 288% APR, including the collection charge.</p>
          <p eId="para_1367">I looked at the list of licensed moneylenders on the Central Bank website today.  Some of the charges are truly staggering.  In the case of a company called Southside Finance, the APR is 287%, including the collection charge.  When we consider the profile of people who go to moneylenders looking for help, this is nothing short of extortionate, but it is entirely legal and entirely licensed.  The fact that they are operating within the letter of the law is irrelevant.  They are engaged in a predatory practice exploiting very vulnerable citizens.  The typical client of a moneylender is a parent who is trying to get money together to pay the electricity or gas bill, or cover a family event like a First Holy Communion or Christmas presents.  The vast majority of clients of such firms do not have the time to study APRs across different providers to ascertain the best deal available.  The Minister of State acknowledged that much of this activity is focused on disadvantaged areas.  We all know from our own constituencies that this is the pattern of activity in the moneylending sector.  These consumers need the protection of the law and setting a maximum APR for moneylenders is the obvious way to do it.  Even lending at 40% APR would still be a profitable activity for such providers.</p>
          <p eId="para_1368">Anyone who has ever been at home during the day and put on a UK TV channel will be familiar with the advertising of short term or pay day loans.  The advertising is certainly slick and promises people a way out of their financial difficulties with easy access to credit, even if they have previously had an impaired credit record.  As with most consumer products, it is likely that the services of legal moneylenders will migrate online.  One such provider advertising heavily in Ireland is Provident Financial.  I took a look at its website today, which certainly looks good.  It offers "money advice, hints and tips" and a budget planner.  In addition, it promises no complicated forms to complete, cash delivered to the client's door within days, and manageable, fixed repayments.  The "representative example" cited by the website sets out the cost of a typical loan - other Deputies have referred to this - where essentially the APR is 157%.  This is not a small scale problem.  This company has thousands of customers throughout the country.  An <i>Irish Examiner</i> investigation in 2009 revealed that Provident Financial had 75,000 customers here.  This rose to 88,000 in 2010 and the firm now lends to 100,000 people.  We would simply be failing in our duty to citizens if we did not legislate to outlaw such excessive charges.  I am the first to acknowledge that this should have been done sooner, but it is more important now than ever, at a time when people are really struggling.  They are struggling to meet their day to day basic financial commitments.  This is a golden era for moneylenders, both licensed and unlicensed.  They are preying on very vulnerable customers and it has never been more important for the Oireachtas to step in and provide those people with some level of protection on the interest rate that such moneylenders can charge.</p>
          <p eId="para_1369">In 1988, a report by the Combat Poverty Agency indicated that there were three unlicensed moneylenders for every licensed moneylender.  It would be interesting to know the ratio today.  We cannot be sure because we have no mechanism for keeping account of the activities of the illegal moneylenders.  We can only rely on consumer advocacy groups and others who are directly helping consumers to deal with the consequences of accepting loans from illegal moneylenders.  That is a different matter from this debate, but it is equally important.  While there is a regulatory regime for licensed moneylenders, there is an unknown number of illegal moneylenders who are using tactics that are entirely unacceptable within the licensed sector.  That issue needs to be tackled. The lack of any evidence of enforcement action by the authorities on illegal moneylenders is disturbing.</p>
          <p eId="para_1370">In respect of legal moneylenders, we should apply a reduced maximum interest rate.  Collection charges, whereby money is charged to customers for collecting payment at their home, should be outlawed or strictly limited.  Up to 14 cent in the euro is currently charged legally and that is absolutely outrageous.  If the Government is not going to accept this Bill, it should find some other mechanism of giving consumers the protection they deserve.  The people who are going to moneylenders are the people who can least afford to pay the exorbitant interest rates being charged.  I do not think it is fair or reasonable that the Oireachtas would stand over that situation.  I know the Central Bank's theory is that introducing a low cap could bring about the end to the sector and that could have unforeseen consequences for those who rely on it at the moment.  However, I think we can strike a balance between those issues.  I am disappointed the Government is rejecting the Bill, but I hope this issue is tackled at an early date.</p>

          <from>Deputy Arthur Spring</from>
          <p eId="para_1372">Any licensed business is under great duress to be upstanding to citizens.  The reason financial and lending institutions are licensed is because they can cause great stress and harm to people and society.  I agree with the sentiments expressed by the non-government parties.  As Deputy Michael McGrath stated, the most vulnerable in society are those who are always exploited by moneylenders, licensed or unlicensed.  One of the first television programmes I recall was a "Today Tonight" episode from the early 1980s in which Pat Cox chased cars, pointing out extortionate moneylenders who were preying on people, offering loans for communions, Christmas and other family events.</p>
          <p eId="para_1373">In a proper society, everyone would either have a bank or, more importantly, a credit union account.  One priority taught by grandparents in my day was how to set up a credit union account as soon as one could to save the few quid from a first communion or the selling of a calf.  It showed people the benefit of delayed gratification.  Every citizen should be encouraged to follow this example.</p>
          <p eId="para_1374">The transferability of bad loans causes me some concern because a licensed institution could send a bad loan to be chased by a debt collection agency.  We have seen these agencies under many guises.  Some of them have resorted to violence, taking personal belongings and crystallising unsecured assets to get back loans.</p>
          <p eId="para_1375">The credit unions must be promoted in society.  We have a wonderful credit union tradition, particularly when compared with the United Kingdom.  Members of credit unions contribute deposits which, in turn, provide for lending.  In times of hardship, I do not believe any credit union would deny people some level of lending.  People who use credit unions are also conscious that their credit history will also be impaired if they do not pay back a credit union loan.</p>
          <p eId="para_1376">There are 40 licensed moneylenders in the country.  If a lender is in trouble with one, more than likely he will borrow from another to pay off the original loan, taking from Peter to pay Paul.  This kind of show should stop.</p>
          <p eId="para_1377">The sentiment of the non-government parties, as I like to call them, is correct.  However, the specifics may have problems.  A 2009 UK study on high credit called for a non-profit payday loan service, funded by a government subsidy of £18 million.  To cover operating costs the loans would need to cost at least 123% APR.  This is a bad business model that will not serve society, lending or prudent business well.</p>
          <p eId="para_1378">I am glad the Central Bank will examine this Private Members' Bill and deliver a better form of management in the area of high credit.  It will also have to examine, however, the elephant in the room, namely, unlicensed moneylenders.  They have put many vulnerable people to the pin of their collars and have acted violently in some cases of non-payment.  I thought those days were well and truly and over.  We are in a credit crisis and the least well-off need to be protected most of all when it comes to accessing credit.</p>
          <p eId="para_1379">When it comes to the budget I will be saying the most well-off need to take a fair share of the burden and maybe even a little more.  When people are stressed financially and emotionally, they will turn to what appears to be the easy option of the moneylender when it is far from it.  Licensed lending institutions are obliged to provide a form of business that is beholden to the people.  They make money through a banking system that we allow them to carry out.  At no stage should their profits or the debt burden on individuals be extraordinary.</p>
          <p eId="para_1380">I am concerned about the Central Bank's ability to get things right.  It needs to be given a specific mandate to examine microlending and educate people on how money works.  People should understand why they need to save and how to borrow in ratio to their earnings for items like the family home or a family car.  I know people from school in Tralee, with similar intelligence and ambition, who are now in debt to moneylenders because of their lack of knowledge in how to deal with money and borrowing.</p>
          <p eId="para_1381">While I agree with the sentiments expressed by the non-government parties on this matter, the specifics of the legislation are not accurate and need to be worked on.  We need to push moneylenders out of society.  That can only be done through education and encouraging credit unions to develop.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#GeraldNash" eId="spk_559">
          <from>Deputy Gerald Nash</from>
          <p eId="para_1382">This is an important issue that needs to be debated not just here but across wider society.  The moneylending business is a fact of life and it should be a matter of increasing concern for those of us concerned with those who find themselves on the margins of society.  The uncomfortable fact is that moneylenders are often the last port of call for people who are brutalised and worn down by the challenges of just living to exist.  This is a business, whether we are prepared to accept it, that profits from the misery of thousands of people.  To say I am uncomfortable with this is an understatement.</p>
          <p eId="para_1383">I am also deeply uncomfortable that the State is presiding over a regulatory regime that has the effect of often compounding the financial problems of those driven into the arms of moneylenders in the first place.  I note the facts outlined by the Minister of State earlier and I very much appreciate the position he proffered on how, if the provisions of this Bill as tabled were adopted, there could be unintended or unforeseen consequences which could exacerbate the horrendous circumstances in which many with relationships with licensed moneylenders and otherwise find themselves.</p>
          <p eId="para_1384">If we are to accept the <i>status quo</i>, however, we need to implement some urgent measures to take moneylending out of the darker recesses of society and the economy.  The Central Bank’s code of practice and a raft of consumer protection legislation, of which we are all aware, are all well and good.  However, the Central Bank’s code of practice does not come across the radar of most people struggling to survive and provide for their families in desperate circumstances.  We are dealing here with many citizens who have severe literacy and numeracy challenges.  We are dealing with people who have no idea whatsoever that they too have rights.  We are dealing with dire situations where people have developed a dependency on the local moneylender and may even have an intergenerational relationship with him or her at the level of their own family.  These are people who will not and cannot make a complaint because they do not know to whom they should complain or they distrust the institutions whose remit it should be to protect their interests.  There could also be a fear of repercussions if complaints are made by those caught in this vicious cycle.  That vicious cycle needs to be stopped.</p>
          <p eId="para_1385">Instead, it should be made easy to permit people to bring their concerns to the relevant authorities in respect of a moneylender, licensed or not.  The public should be told repeatedly who these authorities are and awareness of them should be raised.  I would prefer if moneylenders and loan sharks did not exist at all.  Accepting that they do - human nature determines they always will be there – we need as a society to be much more forceful about bringing the practice of moneylending into the open while shining a light on the dark recesses and grey areas in which it operates.</p>

          <p eId="para_1388">There is no doubt some people value doorstep credit, even if it could have severe consequences. It has to be acknowledged there are occasions when people need to quick access to credit.  Representing Dublin Central, I know moneylending of the illegal kind has been a fact of life there for many years.  Going back to the days of the Monto, the largest red light district in western Europe at the time, moneylending was a feature of life.</p>
          <p eId="para_1389">Another feature of life in Dublin Central was that people could buy goods "on tick" from various shops.  The pawn shops in the constituency used to do a roaring trade but not anymore.  There is a need to acknowledge that people need money and we must ensure they can access it easily.</p>
          <p eId="para_1390">I am concerned, as a result of the economic recession and the number of job losses that have occurred, about people turning to moneylenders and, in particular, those which are unlicensed.  Community and voluntary workers have much evidence that this is happening.  Deputy Michael McGrath and others have stated these are the lenders of last resort.  However, I know people for whom they are the lenders of first resort.  This is because those to whom I refer are not in the habit of going to credit unions or banks.  I am a strong supporter of credit unions because I am aware of the work they have done to assist people in various communities.  What is great about credit unions is the tradition on which they are based, namely, that people must save in order to borrow.  Credit unions accept the smallest amounts in savings.  The credit union in the East Wall area in which I live is one of the oldest in the country.  I know young people whose parents encouraged them to join the credit union once they began to earn a few bob.  That is how the tradition of saving in order to borrow is maintained.</p>
          <p eId="para_1391">The banks have fallen down considerably on this matter because they provide people with little or no encouragement to invest small amounts with them.  Credit is due to An Post because of the stamp systems it operates.  One example in this regard is that a person can purchase a stamp each week and put it towards paying for his or her television licence when it falls due for payment.  The Money Advice and Budgeting Service, MABS, is often left to pick up the pieces when people get into difficulties.</p>
          <p eId="para_1392">A balance must be struck in respect of interest rates which must be capped but not to the extent that they discourage institutions from lending and thus oblige more people to turn to unlicensed moneylenders.  A practice has developed whereby people borrow from moneylenders and then obtain a second loan in order to pay off the first.  What is happening in this regard must be regulated in some way.</p>
          <p eId="para_1393">Sinn Féin hosted an interesting briefing on this issue earlier today at which reference was made to the TASC report, which indicates that the poor borrow more than the middle class and that they pay more for their loans.  We are aware that some of the most dangerous moneylenders are those who would be termed "legal".  These lenders charge high interest rates on loans and fees, for insurance.  In addition, they offer multiple loans.  I have read a report on one licensed moneylender in which it is indicated that for every €100 borrowed for one year, the company charges €56.  This means that the APR on a six month loan is 187.2%.  I must emphasise that this is a licensed moneylender.  One can only imagine what illegal or unlicensed moneylenders are charging for loans.</p>
          <p eId="para_1394">The banks currently exclude 20% of the adult population from the services they offer.  We are aware that there are people who would like to have bank accounts, but they are not approached by the banks as potential customers.  I came across three recent newspaper headlines which read as follows: "Middle class families secretly caught by moneylenders"; "Illegal moneylenders ‘instil fear in thousands'"; and "Caught in a trap".  The Society of St. Vincent de Paul compares moneylending to a cancer.  It states that if one person in a community borrows from a moneylender, the word gets around that there is money to be had.  Suddenly, everyone in the community is borrowing from a particular moneylender.  People in Dublin Central have been obliged to borrow from illegal moneylenders to pay the drug debts of their family members.  This has led to massive intimidation.</p>
          <p eId="para_1395">I will support the Bill.  However, the credit unions' suggestion the interest rate which should apply to loans from moneylenders should not exceed 25% rather than the figure of 40% put forward by Sinn Féin should be considered.  After all, there are enough Shylocks about the place charging exorbitant amounts of interest, etc.  The banks must take on board the fact that during the Celtic tiger era they sponsored personal recklessness when it came to borrowing.</p>

                    </p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1398">In page 10, between lines 4 and 5, to insert the following:</p>
          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_1399">"(8) (<i>a</i>) The Board shall make provision for the setting up of an assessment panel consisting of four members of the Board, including the participation of the Chairperson, to examine applications to the Residential Institutions Statutory Fund, made by residents of former scheduled institutions who did not make an application under the Act of 2002 or who will have had a court determination made in an action arising out of their residency within a scheduled institution.</p>
          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_1400">(<i>b</i>) The above assessment panel shall have the power to recommend to the Board the inclusion of former residents of scheduled institutions who qualify under section 7(1) of the Act of 2002, to make awards in accordance with this Act which are fair and reasonable having regard to the unique circumstances of each applicant.”.</p>
          <p eId="para_1401">This amendment was linked to the earlier debate on eligibility.  It arose from discussions on Committee Stage with the Minister.  Given that the redress doard is closed, he was asked how he would deal with it.  As bureaucracy was mentioned, this is one way of deal with the matter.  The Minister referred earlier to the review in two years time and perhaps this could be helpful in that regard.  If he does not consider it helpful, I presume he will vote it down.  The amendment refers to the function of the board, four of whose members with the chairman, will be empowered to make an assessment.</p>
          <p eId="para_1402">One of the reasons given for not widening the eligibility criteria was that there were concerns that people who unsuccessfully applied through the redress scheme could re-apply for assistance from the statutory fund.  However, the wording of the amendment clearly states that the panel will only examine applications from people who have not applied to the redress board.  Anyone else who was turned down after applying to the board would therefore be ineligible.</p>
          <p eId="para_1403">The amendment is an attempt to deal with the fact that we voted down the widening of eligibility.  I presume the Minister will say it is null and void but this is where the amendments arose from.</p>

          <from>Minister for Education and Skills  (Deputy Ruairí Quinn)</from>
          <p eId="para_1404">I have serious concerns regarding Deputy Seán Crowe's proposals as set down in amendments Nos. 9 and 18, that an assessment panel comprising four members of the statutory fund board be established to examine applications from persons who did not make an application to the redress board, or who will have a court determination made in an action arising from their residency in a scheduled institution.  Recipients of court awards will of course be eligible to apply for the fund under the provisions of the Bill.  Because this is Report Stage, I was not able to make that interjection when the Deputy was speaking before.  If they have established their bona fides though the award of a court decision, that qualifies them in the same way as somebody who has gone through the process.</p>
          <p eId="para_1405">While I do not wish to go over the ground that we have covered earlier in terms of eligibility, I must reiterate my concerns about any proposal to widen eligibility for the reasons stated.  There is a finite amount of money available and any extension of eligibility will mean that this money will be used for a greater pool of potential applicants, thus in effect reducing its own effectiveness.</p>
          <p eId="para_1406">The redress board is the State's vehicle for making awards to those who suffered abuse in residential institutions.  That board has made awards that were fair and reasonable in all the circumstances.  With respect, I stress again the different role intended for the new board.  As I said, it should not get involved in adjudicating on whether or not abuse took place.  To allow it to do that would severely compromise its key objective which is to meet the needs of former residents who have been through that entire redress process.  Regrettably, I cannot accept the amendments.</p>

          <p eId="para_1407">We have gone back and forth on this matter.  We discussed eligibility earlier and I firmly believe that we should not block people who clearly went through horrific times in these institutions.  We should not close down the criteria or block them off.  On that basis, this amendment is an attempt to deal with the issue.  On Committee Stage, the Minister said such a process would be cumbersome, over-bureaucratic and a logistical nightmare.  This amendment is an attempt to deal with the points he made by simply allowing the board to make an assessment.  It is different in that one does not need 100% proof on it.  If there is a view that this happened in all probability then the board can make an assessment that such people are entitled to apply for the fund.  We may not be talking about huge numbers, but we should not close the door to the individuals concerned.  It was on that basis that I tabled this amendment as a genuine attempt to deal with the matter.</p>

          <p eId="para_1408">The Minister says he is concerned about the amendments but he did not substantiate his concern, other than to say that it was akin to the earlier debate.  I do not accept that.  In some ways, this amendment restricts or qualifies the numbers involved by putting in place a procedure which would regulate the numbers seeking redress, in that it would be up to the board to assess them.  The amendment must be taken in the context of the decisive and important debate we had earlier about inclusion.  We are talking about a very small number and the fact that they would have to go through this system would make the number even smaller.  I do not see anything of huge concern about it at all.</p>
          <p eId="para_1409">We have had the same argument reiterated that the pot of money is fixed and this would eat into it.  However, by having such a mechanism it is not a free-for-all, it is a procedure that would in a certain sense control the numbers and cut across that.  The whole purpose of the fund is to meet people's needs.  They definitely have a need but because of various experiences in their lives they were excluded from seeking redress before now, or may have chosen not to do so owing to the horrendous experiences that other people had.  I agree with the points being made by Deputy Seán Crowe that this will regulate matters.  It is worthy in the sense that it is a half-way house and should be considered as a step towards more inclusion without provoking a free for all.</p>

We are trying to move on to the next stage now in order to deal with the existing requirements of those who have come through the process.  I remind Deputies that the process was kept open for much longer than originally intended to ensure that people who wanted to make representations to apply were able to do so.

          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_1416">", which shall be made available to the children and grandchildren of all former residents entitled to apply to obtain assistance from the Fund to advance their educational skills and employment opportunities".</p>
          <p eId="para_1417">This proposal was discussed for a fair amount of time on Committee Stage.  It is one of the aspects that has drawn most attention in terms of submissions from some of the groups.  While there may not be unanimity in that regard, there is an overwhelming desire among most of the survivors that access to the educational fund would be made available to the children and grandchildren of former residents in order for them to advance their educational skills and employment opportunities.</p>
          <p eId="para_1418">Everyone knows a distinction is being made with this fund, whereas the proposed provision existed previously.  We must reiterate some key points.  The experience of the last fund tells us that a minority of victims used it.  One quarter of applicants were victims and former residents, half of those who received the grant were children and the remaining quarter were grandchildren.  The key point is to deal with the transgenerational effects of abuse.  The children and grandchildren of abuse victims have also paid a price.  It is well established that access to education and training is the route out of poverty.  It is a route for breaking the cycle.  It has been a positive part of the existing fund and there is a desire for it to be maintained and carried on.  I will not read out the many letters we received from people saying that education is no good to those too old to avail of it.  They want their children and grandchildren looked after instead.  Some of the measures put forward were to introduce an exception in the legislation to allow family members to access the fund or keep the existing trust open.</p>
          <p eId="para_1419">The amendment extends the provision to include family members for all of the reasons articulated.  In order to have a meaningful input in terms of education, those generations will see more of it than the victims because of their age profile.  It is a key service and one people should have access to.  The appropriate age group is the children and grandchildren.</p>

          <p eId="para_1420">In one sense this is controversial because some survivors agree with the approach while others do not.  From discussions, it is clear that there was no coming together on the issue.  We tabled the amendment on the basis that many people talk about their age and the educational aspects of the Bill were not much use to them at this stage in their lives.  They would like to see their children and grandchildren having access to it.  People talk about breaking the intergenerational cycle of what they went through.  In many cases, they felt the effects continued into their family life and they are trying to make amends.  They want to see the opportunities they missed out on going to their children and grandchildren and feel this is one way of allowing the children or grandchildren the opportunity the parents did not have due to circumstances.  On that basis, we tabled the amendment.</p>
          <p eId="para_1421">When the matter was being discussed on Committee Stage, the Minister of State, Deputy Sean Sherlock, referred to the statutory schemes to ensure access to education.  There are clear income thresholds in respect of eligibility of children and grandchildren of former residents.  I wanted to be inclusive of all people, regardless of income at this stage or income from redress, which should not be taken into account.  Mainly, I want to provide support in respect of the Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_1422">It is clear that budget constraints are the main reason children and grandchildren of survivors have been denied access to the statutory fund.  Ensuring supports for children whose parents qualify under the redress scheme should be a measure provided for in the legislation because access to education can go some way to enhancing an individual's opportunities and life chances.  The survivors want to give their children or grandchildren an opportunity.</p>
          <p eId="para_1423">I talked to one man whose son was in jail.  His son went through a lot and had an addiction.  He put that down to his lack of parenting skills and how he treated his son.  He talked about being bullied in the institution and being a bully as a parent.  At this stage, he was a grandparent and wanted to make redress to his son.  He asked what he could do and felt this was one of the ways he could provide an opportunity to his son.  He hoped his son could take up the opportunity, which is why he approached me.  Others totally disagreed with that idea and did not believe the fund should be for grandchildren.  Some people to whom I spoke did not have children or grandchildren and were in favour of a lump sum.  We all accept that education plays an important role in helping families break the cycle of intergenerational abuse and can be a platform that enhances the life chances of children.  On that basis, individuals approached us so that the legislation could provide additional support or a chance to their children.</p>

We had conflicting views in representations made to us but any assistance given towards education is of the utmost importance.</p>

          <p eId="para_1425">I addressed the issue earlier.  The effect of the amendment is to extend eligibility of the fund to the children and grandchildren of former residents.  It will also include employment opportunities.  It remains the Government's position that eligibility for the new fund should be confined to former residents.  The Education Finance Board did excellent work in terms of distributing the money that came from the religious congregations under the 2002 indemnity agreement.  Former residents and their relatives benefited from the support.  It was always clear that the fund would run out of money given that a specific amount was provided to it and it is now virtually exhausted.  It remains the function of the Education Finance Board to manage the funds at its disposal.  The board has been closely monitoring the funding available to it in the past 12 months.  Last year it advised me that it expected its remaining funds would be fully allocated on applications it received by November last year.  It is a matter for the Education Finance Board to plan properly for the orderly wind down and to inform applicants of the facts regarding the funding available to it.  I understand this has been done.</p>
          <p eId="para_1426">I appreciate that the Education Finance Board will not be in a position to support some individuals but it was never the intention that the board would have an open-ended mandate.  While I appreciate the concerns expressed, it is open to any individual to apply for maintenance and college fee grants through the student grant scheme.  Some 42% of students in undergraduate programmes in our third level system are in receipt of such support.  The Education Finance Board has made a significant difference to many former residents and their relatives.  The Government is now focused on meeting the needs of former residents across a range of service areas.  Having regard to the available moneys and the potential numbers eligible to apply, it must confine itself to the eligible former residents if it is to do this effectively.  I cannot accept these amendments and I reiterate my commitment to reviewing the operation of the fund following a period of two years after its establishment.</p>

In many instances, they have used the fund to break the transgenerational problems facing them and their families by, for example, availing of educational and other opportunities for their children.  These are people who were left on the margins of society and not listened to when they were in institutions.  We have an opportunity to listen to them now and we must avail of it.</p>

          <p eId="para_1432">The purpose of this proposal, which was discussed on Committee Stage, is to copperfasten the rights of former residents to avail of a counsellor of their choice, subject to the requirement in respect of appropriate professional qualifications.  The Bill is structured in such a way as to minimise the amount of money required to fulfil its objectives.  It prioritises the use of public services, for instance, with which I have no difficulty, in order to avoid unnecessary wastage.  However, the imperative to restrict expenditure as far as possible cannot justify encroaching in any way on the individual's right to choose a counsellor of his or her choice.  I have had a litany of correspondence from individuals recounting how much they benefited from their work with a particular counsellor or how many years they lost through attempting to deal with a counsellor who was not right for them.  The ability to choose one's counsellor should be included in the Bill as a right.  The way in which it is currently framed, however, could give rise to a scenario where that right is diluted.  Survivors themselves are the best people to ascertain which particular counsellor will best help them to work through their difficulties.  Money or other issues should not stand in the way where survivors have developed a good rapport with a particular counsellor.  This amendment provides an additional level of protection in that regard.</p>

          <p eId="para_1433">I do not accept that this additional level of protection is required in the Bill.  Counselling services are specifically provided for in section 8 as a class of approved service.  While I appreciate the Deputy's concern to ensure former residents' existing counsellors will be retained once the fund is established, I do not see how that position would be threatened simply because the fund is established.  People can continue to attend their existing counsellor, with that service being funded under the National Counselling Service, NCS, without recourse to the fund.  The Government is committed to continuing the counselling service as recommended in the Ryan report.  If individuals are privately attending counsellors and wish to apply to the fund to have that service funded, they can advise the fund of their preference in their application.  As long as the counsellor in question meets the criteria specified by the fund in respect of service providers, it is difficult to envisage a situation in which such a request would be denied.  These matters should be left to the discretion of the fund,  which is, after all, required to act in the interest of former residents.  The additional specification proposed in this amendment is not necessary because the safeguards the Deputy is seeking are already built into the legislation.</p>

          <p eId="para_1434">I hope the Minister is right, but only time will tell.  I appreciate his clear statement that survivors will be able to advise the fund of their preference to continue with their current counsellor.  I agree that it is difficult to envisage a scenario in which such a request would be denied, but it is not impossible.  A decision might be made, for instance, that a particular counsellor is charging too much for his or her services.  Where a particular counsellor moves to a different area, it might be argued that the associated travel costs for the client are a strain on the fund.  The personal connection between the individual and his or her counsellor should be sacrosanct.  However, I must take the Minister at his word on this.  I hope he is proved correct in his view that this issue does not require explicit protection, because it is something that deserves protection.</p>

          <p eId="para_1435">I tabled a similar amendment on Committee Stage and discussed it, among others, with several of the Minister's officials.  Ms Mary McGarry was particularly helpful in clarifying many of the issues that arose.  This amendment reflects representations received from survivors in which they expressed a desire to continue working with an individual counsellor with whom they had built a relationship of trust.  I agree with Deputy Clare Daly that provided the counsellor in question meets the qualification criteria set out in the Bill, this is something survivors should be able to do.</p>
          <p eId="para_1436">The Ryan report recommended that counselling and mental health services should continue to be provided to alleviate the effects of childhood abuse and its legacy for the following generation.  The Taoiseach accepted all of the recommendations set out in the report and the Government subsequently produced an implementation plan which set out 99 proposals to address each of the 20 recommendations in the report, one of which is to improve services to children.  The Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Deputy Frances Fitzgerald, is chairing the implementation group and two progress reports have been laid before the House.  Deputy Clare Daly's amendment is in keeping with the commitments given by the Government in this regard. There must be an assurance that eligible former residents can continue to access counselling via the NCS and in the event of their not wishing to avail of that service or there being delays in accessing it, the fund would provide for counselling services for them, including those living abroad.</p>

          <p eId="para_1442">This amendment, which we raised on Committee Stage, reflects a minor issue in regard to the use of language.  Some survivors have objected to the reference in the Bill to "classes" of former residents.  Specifically, there was a feeling, given that most of the people who ended up in these institutions came from disadvantaged backgrounds, that it was reference to their socioeconomic background.  As such, they expressed the view that a word such as "categories" would be better than "classes".  The Minister of State, Deputy Sean Sherlock, pointed out at committee that the reference to "classes" might refer to a particular period of time or to some geographic area.  I totally accept that there is a basis for categorising groups of former residents in this way.  My point, however, in view of the concerns expressed by survivors, is that it would be just as easy to use the word "categories" rather than "classes" in this instance.  As well as providing greater clarity, this change would take cognisance of the sensitivity expressed by some survivors.  I will not fall out with the Minister on the issue.  It is not unimportant, nor is it decisive.  It is, however, something which could be easily changed.</p>

I am tempted to inquire as to whether the Socialist Party would want to reinvent the Marxist dialectic into a category struggle rather than a class struggle in terms of the dialectical evolution of society.  The word "classes" is clearly understandable as being in reference to particular groups of people and, as such, I do not propose to change it.</p>

The whole purpose of the fund which is not a large sum of money is to allow it to target its resources to meet the needs of former residents.  The section requires the board to have regard to the need to take account of the individual circumstances, including the personal and financial circumstances, of applicants when determining its criteria for making decisions on entitlements under the fund.  As drafted, it gives the board considerable latitude in setting its criteria which may be revised by it over time.  Removing its power to have regard to applicants' financial circumstances when determining its criteria would not allow it to target its resources at those most in need.</p>
          <p eId="para_1449">I acknowledge the opinion expressed by the Deputy on Committee Stage that it will almost certainly be the case that the overwhelming majority of applicants to the fund will have modest means.  This provision is not intended as a way of preventing vulnerable persons from benefiting from the supports that will be available under the fund.  I also stress that it is not intended to introduce a general means test application to the fund.  Its purpose is to enable the board to have regard, among other things, to the financial circumstances of applicants.  It will be a matter for the board to have regard to the need to take account of individual financial circumstances when determining its criteria for making decisions.  For his reason, the amendment is unnecessary.</p>

          <p eId="para_1492">During the Committee Stage debate the Minister of State, Deputy Sean Sherlock, indicated on my behalf that I would table an amendment to provide for the use of further cash contributions over and above the €110 million for the statutory fund for the new national children's hospital.  This amendment which is technical in nature deals with the mechanics of how contributions received will be channelled to the new national paediatric hospital.  This is in keeping with the previous stated position that all further cash contributions will be used for the new hospital.</p>
          <p eId="para_1493">As Deputies are aware, this and the previous Government adopted the position that it is appropriate for the management bodies which ran the scheduled institutions to meet the cost of the response on a 50:50 basis with the State.  These costs are now expected to exceed €1.36 billion and may even approach €1.5 billion.  The response to date falls well short of the 50:50 target.  I have noted the argument expressed by the select committee that those concerned should face up to their responsibilities and share the burden which has, by and large, been carried by taxpayer.  I continue to pursue the issue of additional contributions with the congregations.</p>
          <p eId="para_1494">Section 42(1) provides for the receipt of contributions from congregations towards the costs of redress.  It is these contributions that will go towards the cost of the national children's hospital.</p>
          <p eId="para_1495">Subsection (1) of the new section 43 provides for the placement of such contributions in a special account of the Central Bank in the name of the Minister for Health.  Subsection (2) specifies that the moneys in the account may only be used for the purposes of making contributions towards the building, furnishing and equipping of a national paediatric hospital or, if appropriate, the making of contributions towards the extension, refurbishment, equipping or re-equipping of the hospital.  Subsection (3) requires that moneys can only be issued from the special account by the Minister for Health with the approval of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform.   The provisions in subsections (4) and (5) are standard provisions which include requirements in respect of the preparation of accounts and audits by the Comptroller and Auditor General.</p>

An amendment I proposed on Report Stage on this matter has been ruled out of order on the basis that it is in the nature of a tax.  As Deputy Brendan Smith noted, a requirement on the religious congregations to increase their contribution would enjoy cross-party support.  People are angry that the congregations have not lived up to the initial agreement and want the State to vigorously pursue the amounts owed.  They will not accept a failure on the part of the State to aggressively seek to recover every penny of the money promised by the religious congregations under what was a very good deal for them.  I argue that the deal was wrong and that greater responsibility should have been put on the religious orders rather than where it seems to be falling - on the State.  I ask the Minister to do whatever he can to expedite payment of the money owed, on which matter he would have cross-party support.</p>

On the €110 million ceiling, the interest that has already accrued on the moneys on deposit should be treated separately.  Nothing in this amendment should alter that scenario.  The fund as it stands now is €110 million plus the interest that is there now.

          <p eId="para_1503">I also thank the officials for the help they gave on the Bill.  It was a difficult Bill and it was certainly difficult to deal with the hurt and trauma many of the survivors experienced.  I was disappointed that a number of amendments were ruled out of order because they were deemed to place a cost on the Exchequer, namely, those relating to the Magdalene Laundries and Bethany Home.  Some of the former residents suggested a housing option, which was also ruled out of order.  The Minister felt the eligibility clause could not be opened.  The other issue related to a tax on those religious institutions which clearly seem unlikely to pay at this stage.  On that basis and particularly given that the fund cannot be opened to those who should have access to it, the Bill is flawed and we have let people down once again.</p>

          <p eId="para_1505">As the Minister has reiterated on a number of occasions, this fund arose from the cross-party motion and the need for the State to deal with the needs of survivors of residential institutions.  The debate we have had has opened many scars for the survivors who have had to deal with many issues.  All of us received e-mails and distressed phone calls from many of those people who have been damaged and continue to carry the scars of the damage done.  All of us acknowledge that we can never undo that and, as a society, can only acknowledge it and try to make recompense.  At the very least we must try to give those people access to the services they require.</p>
          <p eId="para_1506">The Bill has deficiencies which have been highlighted by many of the groups representing people who feel they have not been listened to yet again.  There is a feeling that in some ways much of the money is going to shore up public services which should exist as of right in any case.  There may be a desire that, as with the hepatitis C victims, these people should have been given a special card to allow them to access services and so on.  As everybody's needs are different and cannot be put in a box, there should have been greater flexibility in the programme.  The fund should have provided for access to services in the way in which it does, but it should also have given the option of a lump sum for those who might decide they want to use it for their families.  The issue of a pension should also have been addressed.  For those reasons and because a number - albeit a small number - of people, who were eligible to apply for redress but could not do so for whatever reason, are again being excluded, which, sadly, has been the story of their lives, we will be opposing the passage of the Bill.  That said, I know we will not win the vote and I hope the fund is established without delay.  We will certainly be monitoring the review and other safety valves the Minister agreed to insert.</p>

            <p eId="para_1611">Since taking office the Government has made tackling unemployment its number one priority.  The latest data shows that there are currently 309,000 unemployed and addressing this challenge is central to all of our policy decisions.</p>
            <p eId="para_1612">For example, the Jobs' Initiative in May 2011, the establishment of NewERA and the Strategic Investment Fund, and the publication of the Government's <i>Action Plan for Jobs 2012</i> and <i>Pathways to Work</i>   have given effect to the vast majority of the Government’s commitments in relation to job creation and reducing unemployment.</p>
            <p eId="para_1613">Today's announcement of a €2 billion Stimulus Package aimed at creating the maximum number of jobs is further evidence of the Government's commitment in this regard.</p>
            <p eId="para_1614">Tackling unemployment requires action across many policy areas.  The restructuring of the banking system provides the basis for a core banking service that can deliver on the needs of start-up or growing businesses.  The establishment of NewERA and the Strategic Investment Fund will develop innovative ways to leverage State assets to ensure long term investment in key infrastructure.</p>
            <p eId="para_1615">The <i>Action Plan for Jobs 2012 </i> places tackling unemployment at the centre of Government policy.  The Plan ensures that every single Government Department and Agency is aligned around an enterprise growth and jobs objective.</p>
            <p eId="para_1616">The Plan will improve the operating environment and the State supports for job-creating businesses and remove barriers to employment-creation across the economy.</p>
            <p eId="para_1617">The 2012 Plan is the first instalment in an ambitious multi-year process which aims to:</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1618">Create the environment where the number of people at work will increase by 100,000 net — from 1.8 million to 1.9 million — by 2016, and reach 2 million people by 2020;</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1619">See Ireland become the best small country in which to do business;</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1620">Get back to a top-5 ranking in international  competitiveness;</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1621">Build world-class clusters in key sectors of opportunity; and</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1622">Build up the export market share of Irish companies.</p>
            <p eId="para_1623">A primary aspect of this Plan is the focus on actions and implementation.  The First Progress Report published in April, confirmed that Government is delivering on its commitments under the Action Plan, and this will in turn deliver real improvements in the environment for job creation.  In the first three months of this year, Government Departments and Agencies were to deliver 83 measures relating to 68 of the Plan's 270 actions and the Progress Report showed that 96% were delivered, in full, on time.  The Second Progress Report will be published shortly and continued progress on delivery is expected.</p>

            <p eId="para_1674">I propose to take Questions Nos. 24 and 59 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_1675">The Social Insurance Fund (SIF) is a pay-as-you-go social insurance scheme that is financed by contributions from employees, employers, the self-employed and by a contribution or ‘subvention' from the Exchequer when the cost of the benefits paid from the Fund exceeds the contribution income.  The Exchequer is the residual financier of the Fund and such subventions were the norm for over 40 years.  For example, in 1967, the State contribution was 38% of SIF expenditure and almost 29% in 1985.</p>
            <p eId="para_1676">From 1997 to 2007 inclusive, social insurance income exceeded Fund expenditure.  In 2008, the current operating balance of the SIF moved into deficit with expenditure exceeding income by €255m.  This deficit accelerated in 2009 when it reached €2.49 billion and further rose to €2.75 billion in 2010.  In addition, the surplus carried forward from previous years was eliminated during 2010, giving rise to the need for Exchequer subvention for the first time since 1996.</p>
            <p eId="para_1677">In total, the operating deficit of the Fund over the period 2008 to 2011, inclusive, was very close to €7 billion.  The Revised Estimates for my Department provide for a deficit of nearly €1.82 billion in 2012.  Significant exchequer subvention will be required to meet ongoing expenditure requirements in the absence of reductions in expenditure levels or increases in PRSI income.</p>
            <p eId="para_1678">I am most concerned about the deficit in the SIF and one of my key goals is to reform the system of social protection and to put it on a sounder financial footing for the future.  In the context of the SIF, Budget 2011 introduced a number of changes to the PRSI system and, in Budget 2012, my colleague the Minister for Finance announced a further widening of the PRSI base from 2013 to cover rental, investment and other forms of income from 2013.</p>
            <p eId="para_1679">In addition, I established the Advisory Group on Tax and Social Welfare last year in line with the commitment made in the Programme for Government.  The Group will, inter alia, examine and report on issues involved in providing social insurance cover for self-employed persons while the Actuarial Review of the Social Insurance Fund will inform both short to medium term and long term policy development in relation to the social insurance system generally.</p>
            <p eId="para_1680">Any proposals to address the sustainability of the Fund will have to be considered in a budgetary context.</p>

         if she will introduce provisions to ease the transition from carer’s allowance to jobseeker’s allowance for persons whose caring duties come to an end.

            <p eId="para_1682">Carer's allowance is a means-tested payment for carers who look after people in need of full-time care and attention.  In 2011, approximately 50,000 carers were in receipt of carer's allowance at a cost of over €504 million.  The maximum weekly rate is €204 for those under 66 with increases for qualified children.  In addition, carers receive an annual respite care grant of €1,700 in respect of each person for whom they care.  They have free travel and may be entitled to household benefits if they live with the person for whom they are caring.   While receiving carer's allowance, carers may work or receive training or education outside the home for up to fifteen hours per week.  Twelve organisations have received funding from my Department under the Dormant Accounts arrangement to provide training and support for carers.  This includes training associated with caring duties, computer training and personal development which enable carers to upgrade their skills base with a view to returning to work.</p>
            <p eId="para_1683">If the person being cared for has died, the carer's allowance continues to be paid for a further six weeks.  This helps the carer adjust after the time they have spent in caring and to make decisions regarding their future.</p>
            <p eId="para_1684">If they sign on for jobseeker's allowance, they will have access to the education, training and employment supports available to people on the Live Register, with the time spent caring counted in the qualifying criteria for these supports.</p>

            <p eId="para_1686">The number of places available on CE has remained constant at 23,300 including supervisors.  The estimated cost of CE programmes in 2012 is €340 million.  The financial review of CE Schemes has now been completed.  The Department has contacted schemes to advise them of their revised material and training allocations.  The materials and training CE Budget has been increased by €9.5million from the original budget of approximately €11.0 million following transfer from savings identified elsewhere in the DSP budget.  The new CE materials and training budget is thus €20.5 million</p>
            <p eId="para_1687">Under the revised arrangements, schemes will no longer be given universal amounts of financial support but will instead be provided with a specific level of support aimed at meeting the particular costs of CE schemes, having regard to the overall level of funding available for CE nationally.  To date, significant savings have already been made to the overheads of CE projects in terms of annual insurance costs and audit fees.</p>
            <p eId="para_1688">In addition to the training allocation for schemes, CE participants may also access a number of Springboard, VEC and FÁS courses free of charge.</p>
            <p eId="para_1689">I plan to publish the report on the review in the coming month or so.</p>

            <p eId="para_1692">I propose to take Questions Nos. 28 and 42 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_1693">Decisions on statutory social welfare schemes are made by statutorily appointed deciding officers/designated persons.  They determine entitlement to social insurance and social assistance payments and liability for Pay Related Social Insurance contributions in accordance with the Social Welfare Consolidation Act, 2005 (as amended) and regulations.</p>
            <p eId="para_1694">Guidelines are issued by the Department in relation to the legislation concerned to ensure consistency of decision making by officers throughout the Department.  In addition, training is provided on statutory obligations and the application of principles of natural justice and fair procedures.</p>
            <p eId="para_1695">In line with the Department's policy to promote the provision of information, scheme guidelines are also available to members of the public on the Department's website (<i>www.welfare.ie</i>) or on request from any social welfare local office.</p>
            <p eId="para_1696">Decisions on social welfare claims must be set out in writing and, where the decision is unfavourable, the reasons for the decision are included in the notification to the person concerned.</p>
            <p eId="para_1697">If a person is unhappy with a decision given, s/he has the right to have the decision reviewed, or for administrative schemes, referred for appeal to the Social Welfare Appeals Office.</p>
            <p eId="para_1698">A review of an initial decision will be undertaken, if there are new facts or evidence that have not been taken into consideration when the initial decision was made.  This provides a means of having an adverse decision reviewed as quickly as possible.  It is often the case that when customers seek an appeal they provide new information/ evidence.</p>

The drafting of the Heads of a Bill will commence shortly.

Following this process, I will be bringing the matter back to Government at the earliest appropriate opportunity, with a view to obtaining approval for the general scheme of a Bill.</p>

            <p eId="para_1702">The Department is committed to ensuring that claims are processed as expeditiously as possible.  Processing times vary across schemes, depending on the differing qualification criteria.  As can be seen from the data in the table below, schemes that require a high level of documentary evidence from the customer, particularly in the case of illness-related schemes, can take longer to process.  Similarly, means-tested payments can also require more detailed investigation and interaction with the applicant, thereby lengthening the decision making process.</p>
            <p eId="para_1703">As part of the Department's programme of service delivery modernisation, a range of initiatives aimed at streamlining the processing of claims, supported by modern technology, have been implemented in recent years.  Operational processes, procedures and the organisation of work are continually reviewed to ensure that processing capability is maximised.</p>
            <p eId="para_1704">In addition, the staffing needs of the Department are regularly reviewed, having regard to workloads and the competing demands arising, to ensure that the best use is made of all available resources.  The Department will continue to source available staff to fill critical vacancies by way of redeployment, or transfer from within the Department and other Government Departments, taking account of the employment control framework (ECF) target, as determined by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.</p>
            <p eId="para_1705">I wish to assure the Deputy that prompt processing of claims remains a priority for me.</p>

            <p eId="para_1772">Maternity benefit is an income maintenance payment awarded by this Department to eligible women for a 26-week period on foot of a confinement.  Entitlement to this benefit for employees is contingent on entitlement to statutory maternity leave.  Under the provisions of social welfare legislation, the 26-week period of core statutory maternity leave attracts a payment from this Department — subject to certain social insurance contribution conditions being fulfilled.  Maternity leave legislation also provides an option for a woman to take an additional 16-week period of maternity leave that does not attract a benefit payment.</p>
            <p eId="para_1773">The right to maternity leave is established under the Maternity Protection Act, 1994, legislation which is the responsibility of the Minister for Justice and Equality.  Any changes to current Maternity Leave provisions are a matter for that Minister to consider in the first instance — and entitlement to Maternity Benefit would normally follow suit and would have to be considered by Government in a Budgetary context.</p>

            <p eId="para_1781">Creating jobs and tackling poverty are two of the key challenges that Ireland now faces.  It is essential that our tax and social protection systems play their part in addressing these challenges.  To this end, I established an Advisory Group on Tax and Social Welfare last year, with the aim of harnessing expert opinion and experience to examine a number of specific issues.  These include making cost-effective proposals for improving employment incentives and achieving better poverty outcomes, particularly child poverty outcomes.</p>
            <p eId="para_1782">The Group's overall method of working is based on producing modular reports on the priority areas identified in the terms of reference.  In their deliberations the Group has been tasked to take into account existing analysis, research and submissions.  Where possible, the aim is to provide recommendations that can be acted upon in time for the annual budget, estimates and legislative cycle and to allow the Government to best address its commitments under the EU-IMF Programme of Financial Support.</p>
            <p eId="para_1783">Among the issues that the Advisory Group is currently progressing is the Budget 2012 proposals concerning disability allowance and domiciliary care allowance.  The Group's terms of reference also provides for the examination of the issue of working age income supports, which will be considered as part of its future programme of work.</p>
            <p eId="para_1784">I am conscious that the Budget 2012 measures concerning disability allowance and domiciliary care allowance gave rise to concerns about the impact on families of people with disabilities, most notably in the case of families of children and young adults with profound disabilities, and these very real concerns are being taken into account by the Advisory Group.  The Group will revert to me with its report on these proposals once their examination is completed.  At that stage, I, together with my Government colleagues, will reflect carefully on the findings of the Advisory Group.</p>
            <p eId="para_1785">The following additional information was provided under Standing Order 40A.</p>
            <p eId="para_1786">As stated in the reply, creating jobs and tackling poverty are two of the key challenges that Ireland now faces. It is essential that our tax and social protection systems play their part in addressing these challenges. To this end, I established an Advisory Group on Tax and Social Welfare last year, with the aim of harnessing expert opinion and experience to examine a number of specific issues.

In their deliberations the group has been tasked to take into account existing analysis, research and submissions and, in this regard, I consider that the report referred to by the Deputy may help inform the group's secretariat. I do not intend to refer specifically to the issue of precarious work to the group as I consider that the terms of reference are sufficiently broad for this issue to be considered in the context of the group's deliberation. Where possible, the aim is to provide recommendations that can be acted upon in time for the annual budget, Estimates and legislative cycle and to allow the Government to best address its commitments under the EU-IMF Programme of Financial Support.</p>

            <from>Minister for Social Protection (Deputy Joan Burton)</from>
            <p eId="para_1790">I welcome the publication of the Ombudsman's 2011 annual report and the Department is examining its contents in detail with a view to ensuring issues of concern are addressed.  The 1,135 complaints relating to the Department, which represents a slight drop on the 2010 figure of 1,181, must be seen in the context of the scale of the Department's business.  Some 1.76 million decisions were made on new claims in 2011.  This is in addition to the many decisions made on claims already in payment where there were changes in the claimants' circumstances, for example, changes to earnings or capacity to work or changes in family composition.</p>
            <p eId="para_1791">The Department has some 7,000 staff in 180 offices and 700 localised clinics; it administers over 50 schemes and makes 85 million payments annually.  Given the extent and complexity of the Department's business, unfortunately mistakes can sometimes occur.  The Department endeavours to keep errors to a minimum and take corrective action, where necessary, as soon as possible.</p>
            <p eId="para_1792">It is also noted that the number of complaints received is not an indication of the number of cases resolved — of the 1,395 total cases related to this Department completed in 2011, almost 1,000 (72%) were discontinued or not upheld.</p>
            <p eId="para_1793">Although the Ombudsman's report provides a case study about a man initially refused carer's allowance, it does not refer to any general dissatisfaction with the Department's administration of its illness/disability schemes or the domiciliary care allowance scheme.</p>
            <p eId="para_1794">However, some media reports covering the publication of the Ombudsman's report have raised issues in relation to these schemes.</p>
            <p eId="para_1795">Decisions on claims are made by statutorily appointed Deciding Officers/Designated Persons in accordance with legislation and extensive supporting guidelines.  Claimants who meet scheme criteria are awarded payment and those who do not, are refused.  Any notion that officers are using discretion to refuse claims to save money is completely unfounded; the only consideration is a person's eligibility under governing legislation.</p>
            <p eId="para_1796">Principles of natural justice are adhered to and it is an integral part of the decision making process to supply claimants with the reasons for, and the grounds of, refusal.</p>
            <p eId="para_1797">Where claimants are dissatisfied with decisions made they are afforded the opportunity of having the decision reviewed by the Department and/or appealed to the independent Social Welfare Appeals Office.</p>
            <p eId="para_1798">The review of the operation of the domiciliary care allowance scheme that I recently announced has commenced.</p>

            <p eId="para_1804">I propose to take Questions Nos. 38, 46, 47, 49 and 60 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_1805">There are currently approximately 92,000 persons in receipt of rent supplement, for which the Government has provided €436 million for 2012.  New maximum rent limits were introduced from 1 January 2012 based on a review of the most up-to-date market data available.  As part of the review, all major urban population centres (including Dublin) were analysed to ensure that maximum value for money for tenants and taxpayers was achieved whilst ensuring that people on rent supplement are not priced out of the market for private rented accommodation.</p>
            <p eId="para_1806">The revised limits are applicable to new rent supplement tenancies from January 2012 and existing tenancies on review.  Approximately 25,000 rent supplement claims have been awarded in 2012, of which 3,700 were awarded within the last month, indicating that accommodation can be secured within the new limits.  Information on the numbers who have secured alternative accommodation is not available.</p>
            <p eId="para_1807">Officials administering the scheme advise that customers are securing alternative accommodation within their locality.  Any customers who may have specific issues in relation to relocating should discuss these issues with Department officials who are continuing to provide support and advice to customers in addressing their accommodation and other needs.  There will be no incidence of homelessness due to these changes.</p>
            <p eId="para_1808">While rent supplement is not generally paid where the rent charged for the accommodation is above the relevant maximum limit, Departmental officials have flexibility around making payments above these limits where there are special housing needs related to exceptional circumstances which may include a person with a disability in specially-adapted accommodation.</p>
            <p eId="para_1809">Rent supplement is specifically for the benefit of the tenants to assist them with their accommodation needs.  The Department does not intend negotiating directly with landlords to reduce rents on behalf of a tenant.  Nor does it intend introducing rent controls for landlords.</p>
            <p eId="para_1810">Policy in relation to the acquisition of properties for social housing is a matter for my colleague, the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government.      Officials in my Department are continuing to monitor the impact of the revised limits; I have no plans to revise the rent limits at this time.</p>

            <p eId="para_1812">Self-employed people, including taxi drivers, can apply for the means-tested jobseeker's allowance if their business ceases or if they are on low income as a result of a downturn in demand for their services.  If a taxi driver has ceased operating in the taxi business completely, the Department requires a letter from the Taxi Regulator confirming that the customer has surrendered his or her PSV licence.  This is required, along with other evidence, so that the Department is satisfied that the customer is no longer receiving an income from self-employment in the taxi business.  If a self-employed customer is still trading as a taxi driver he or she does not have to surrender the PSV licence in order to claim jobseeker's allowance.  Means from self-employment will be assessed to determine the level of jobseeker's allowance paid to the person.  It is recognised that the present downturn in the economy is having a significant impact on many self-employed persons and the consequent reduction in their income and activity levels would be reflected in any assessment of their means from self-employment for jobseeker's allowance purposes.</p>
            <p eId="para_1813">If a self-employed person's situation changes after they have made an initial claim for jobseeker's allowance, the person can apply to have his or her means reviewed in the light of these changed circumstances.</p>

            <p eId="para_1815">The inter-departmental sub-group on school-age child care consists of representatives from the Department of Social Protection, the Department of Children and Youth Affairs — which is the lead Department in relation to child care policy and provision — and the Department of Education and Skills.   The role of the group is to explore the best possible model for enhancing the provision of school-age childcare to assist in meeting the childcare needs of the clients of my Department, including lone parents.  The model in question will address the child care requirements of children aged between 7 and 12 (inclusive).  The model will also address the school-age child care required during both the school-term and the school holidays.</p>
            <p eId="para_1816">Over the past few months, I and officials in my Department have met with groups representing lone parents and other relevant organisations to discuss their views on the changes to the One Parent Family Payment, which were enacted in the Social Welfare and Pensions Act 2012. My officials have also met with these groups to discuss their views on childcare provision. The views of the groups are being considered as part of the on-going work of the inter-departmental sub group on school-age childcare.</p>
            <p eId="para_1817">Once completed, the model, and accompanying proposals, will be submitted to Government for their consideration later this year.</p>

            <p eId="para_1819">The number of places available on CE has remained constant at 23,300 including supervisors.  The financial review of CE Schemes has now been completed.  The Department of Social Protection have contacted schemes to advise them of their revised material and training allocations.</p>
            <p eId="para_1820">The materials and training CE Budget has been increased by €9.5m from the original budget of approximately €11.0m following transfer from savings identified elsewhere in the DSP budget.  The new CE materials and training budget is thus €20.5m.</p>
            <p eId="para_1821">Under the revised arrangements, schemes will no longer be given universal amounts of financial support but will instead be provided with a specific level of support aimed at meeting the particular costs of CE Schemes, having regard to the overall level of funding available for CE nationally.  To date, significant savings have already been made to the overheads of CE projects in terms of annual insurance costs and audit fees.</p>
            <p eId="para_1822">In addition to the training allocation for schemes, CE participants may also access a number of Springboard, VEC and FÁS courses free of charge.  Details of the CE Financial review are due to be made available in the coming weeks.</p>
            <p eId="para_1823">In addition, there is a separate Labour Market Activation Schemes policy review nearing completion.  This review will inform the Department's strategic approach in relation to labour market activation including the CE and TUS programme into the future.</p>
            <p eId="para_1824">This review will be of interest and importance to all the stakeholders involved and, accordingly, the Minister for Social Protection will ensure that stakeholders will be able to respond to it findings ahead of a consultation she will hold with stakeholders in the autumn.</p>

            <p eId="para_1827">There are also close links between the Department and the Department of Children and Youth Affairs in this area.  Nationally, there are 276 schemes with ring-fenced places for childcare.  There has been no decrease in the number of CE ring fenced places allocated compared to the numbers that were on offer in 2011.  A key element in the approval of all CE programmes, including childcare ring-fenced places, is the requirement that such programmes do not displace current jobs or employees or that they are not used to fill vacancies.  Following the completion of the CE Financial Review, officials in the Department are advising sponsors of the revised allocations for materials and training for individual CE schemes.</p>

In allocating the budget to Schemes, the Department takes into account whether training can be accessed at no cost from FÁS or the VECs.

            <p eId="para_1857">I propose to take Questions Nos. 55 and 323 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_1858">Increasing retirement age was a key question that was considered in a major consultation exercise conducted as part of the preparation work for the Green Paper on Pensions and the National Pensions Framework.  Some 380 individuals and almost 70 organisations made written submissions while over 500 people attended consultation events.</p>
            <p eId="para_1859">A Steering Group, together with a number of subgroups, was established in my Department, to oversee the implementation of pension reforms.  The Steering Group has representation from the Department of Jobs Enterprise and Innovation.</p>
            <p eId="para_1860">I can confirm that officials of my Department are in on-going discussions with colleagues in the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation and the Department of Justice and Equality in relation to any implications arising as a result of the increase in State pension age.</p>
            <p eId="para_1861">A forum on retirement and working is currently being scheduled where these Departments will also engage with the social partners and other interest groups to further consider and identify the range of issues involved.</p>
            <p eId="para_1862">In relation to redundancy, the circumstances in which a person is deemed to have been dismissed by reason of redundancy are very specific and are set out in the Redundancy Payments Acts 1967 to 2011.  In addition to liquidation, receivership and bankruptcy of the employer these include: the employer having ceased or intending to cease to carry on the business for which the person was employed; the requirements for work of a particular kind having ceased or diminished or being expected to do so; and the employer having decided to carry on the business with fewer or no employees and therefore re-organising or rationalising.</p>
            <p eId="para_1863">Subject to these and the other requirements of the scheme, a person aged 65 or over can qualify for a redundancy payment on the same basis as any other person.  However, a person who retires from their employment would not be considered to have been made redundant and therefore no increase in applications for redundancy support is expected as a result of the changes to State pension age.  So far this year, approximately 740 redundancy payments were awarded to people aged 65 or over but in many of these cases the redundancy would actually have occurred in 2011.  Unfortunately, as the scheme has only been operating on the Department of Social Protection's systems since October 2011 it is not possible to extract corresponding figures for 2010 and 2011.</p>
            <p eId="para_1864">In relation to pension reform, as Irish society has changed, pensions policy has evolved to reflect these changes.  A key focus of mine has been to ensure that the State pension remains adequate and sustainable in light of demographic changes and the associated increases in pension costs.</p>
            <p eId="para_1865">This is compounded by the wider need for sustainable public finances.  So our primary consideration in making the changes we have made to reform pensions has been to ensure that the system is on a financially sound and sustainable footing.</p>
            <p eId="para_1866">Because the State pension is the bedrock of the Irish pension system, these reforms are essential to address the challenges of increasing life expectancy and to ensure its sustainability.  While the current State pension age of 66 remains, the State pension (transition) which applies for one year for persons of age 65 will cease from 2014.  Thereafter, State pension age will increase to 67 in 2021 and 68 in 2028.</p>
            <p eId="para_1867">For those with an income need, social welfare schemes will continue to be available, for those who fulfil the eligibility criteria.</p>

            <p eId="para_1870">I propose to take Questions Nos. 56 and 58 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_1871">There are approximately 92,000 persons in receipt of rent supplement for which the Government has provided a sum of €436 million for 2012. The aim of rent supplement is to provide short term income assistance, and not to act as an alternative to the other social housing schemes operated by the Exchequer.</p>
            <p eId="para_1872">New maximum rent limits were introduced from 1 January 2012 to ensure value for money for tenants and taxpayers was achieved whilst ensuring that people on rent supplement are not priced out of the market for private rented accommodation.</p>
            <p eId="para_1873">I welcome the Government decision to transfer responsibility for the provision of rental assistance to persons with a long term housing need from my Department, currently provided through rent supplement, to housing authorities using a new Housing Assistance Payment (HAP). This will achieve a key Government commitment of removing barriers to employment and at the same time returning rent supplement to its original purpose of a short-term income support.</p>
            <p eId="para_1874">A commencement date for the new arrangements of 1st January 2013 has been approved subject to further consideration of the matter by Government. Policy in relation to the HAP scheme is a matter for my colleague, the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government.   A multi-agency steering group has been established to develop proposals to give effect to this transfer. The group is chaired by the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government and consists of representatives from the Departments of Social Protection; Public Expenditure and Reform; Office of the Revenue Commissioners; the County and City Managers Association, and the Housing Agency. Latest figures show that over 39,900 rent supplement tenancies have transferred from rent supplement to the Rental Accommodation Scheme and other social housing options since its inception.</p>

Given the large number of appeals decisions given each year, 25,390 in 2011 for example, such a process would impose a significant overhead on the office.  However the Office publishes a number of case studies, suitably edited, on its website and also in the Chief Appeals Officer's annual report to the Minister and it is intended to increase the number of these case studies available on the website in 2012.</p>

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach (Deputy Paul Kehoe)</from>
            <p eId="para_1878">The Programme for Government sets out an ambitious agenda of Dáil Reform, which will continue to be implemented over the lifetime of the Government.</p>
            <p eId="para_1879">In July 2011, after just four months in office, the Government introduced a package of reforms which included:</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1880">An additional Leaders Questions session, taken by the Tánaiste, on Thursdays;</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1881">Topical Issues Debates, which replaced the adjournment debates and are taken earlier in the day. Under this arrangement, four debates are held each sitting day on issues of both local and national importance and a Minister or Minister of State from the Department concerned must, except where unavoidable, respond to the debate;</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1882">Special sittings on the first Friday of a month to provide time for TDs to introduce their own Bills, thereby enhancing TD's legislative role;</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1883">A procedure to allow Dáil Deputies raise issues regarding replies to Parliamentary Questions with the Ceann Comhairle. Under this procedure, the Ceann Comhairle can refer a matter back to the Minister with a request for further information;</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1884">Time limits for the Order of Business, to provide more structure to the working format of the Dáil;  Streamlining the system of Taoiseach's Questions;</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1885">Section 32 requests no longer being read out unless they are granted by the Ceann Comhairle;</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1886">The Taoiseach briefing the Oireachtas prior to attending European Council meetings.</p>
            <p eId="para_1887">The Programme for Government also contains a commitment to increasing the number of Dáil sitting days by 50%. The number of Dáil sitting days has been significantly increased since the change of Government by reducing the length of Dáil breaks at Christmas, at Easter, after bank holidays and during the summer and the introduction of regular Friday sitting days. Significant progress has been made in this area. In this Government's first year in office there were 127 Dáil sitting days compared with 88 Dáil sitting days in the previous Government's last year in office</p>
            <p eId="para_1888">In 2011 a new Oireachtas Committee system was established that included a number of reforms promised in the Programme for Government including:</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1889">The number of Oireachtas Committees was reduced from 25 under the previous Government to 16.</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1890">An Investigation, Oversight and Petitions Committee chaired by a member of the Opposition was established.</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1891">A system was established under which Oireachtas Committees are involved at an early stage in the development of legislation before a Bill is published.</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1892">MEPs can attend Oireachtas Committees.</p>
            <p eId="para_1893">In June 2012, we further re-structured the Oireachtas Committee system in light of its operation during the first year of the Government's term of office. This re-structuring was carried out following discussions by me with the other Whips; the Chair of the Working Group of Committee Chairs, Deputy David Stanton; the other Oireachtas Committee Chairs; TDs and Senators from across all the political parties who are members of Oireachtas Committees; and the Committee Secretariat.</p>
            <p eId="para_1894">It is the Government's intention to follow these reform packages with additional reforms in the future. Indeed, I am currently in discussions with the other Whips; the Ceann Comhairle; the Dáil Reform sub-committee of the Dáil CPP; the Chair of the Working Group of Committee Chairs, Deputy David Stanton; and officials in Leinster House regarding a second phase of Dáil reforms to be introduced in the Autumn Session.</p>
            <p eId="para_1895">I can assure the Deputy that my office continues to monitor the day-to-day working of Dáil Éireann, Seanad Éireann and the Oireachtas Committees, including the impact of the reforms we have already introduced.   This process of ongoing review, along with our Programme for Government commitments, will be the basis for further Dáil Reform.</p>

            <p eId="para_2086">The Open Government Partnership (OGP) is an ad hoc international initiative which was launched in 2011 and which is overseen by a multi-stakeholder International Steering Committee involving Brazil, Indonesia, Mexico, Norway, Philippines, South Africa, Tanzania, the United Kingdom and the United States, as well as civil society representatives.  The aim of the organisation is to promote progress by participating states in relation to enhanced transparency and anti-corruption measures.    To my knowledge, the Government has not been in receipt of any approach by the OGP to join the organisation and the question of possible participation by Ireland has not yet been examined.  It would be necessary as part of any such examination to consider, in conjunction with the other relevant Government Departments, the potential added value of membership as well as the resources implications.</p>
            <p eId="para_2087">Ireland participates at EU level and within the OSCE, OECD, Council of Europe and United Nations frameworks in efforts to promote cooperation on, and improvement in, transparency and anti-corruption measures.  We ratified the UN Convention Against Corruption in 2011 and are also a party to the OECD Anti-Bribery Convention.  During the Nineteenth Session of the UN Human Rights Council in March 2012, Ireland co-sponsored a resolution on "The role of good governance in the promotion and protection of human rights", which was adopted by the Council.  This encouraged States to ratify the UN Convention Against Corruption and emphasised the role of good governance in the full realisation of human rights, sustained economic growth, sustainable development and the eradication of poverty and hunger.</p>

            <p eId="para_2094">The enlargement agenda is an important aspect of EU foreign policy still within the purview of the rotating EU Presidency. We have already begun planning to take the process forward in relation to all five candidate countries — Iceland, Turkey, Montenegro, Serbia and the Republic of Macedonia.   With regard to Turkey, Minister of State, Deputy Creighton visited Turkey last week in part to discuss areas for possible progress during our Presidency. As the Deputy may be aware, progress on Turkey's EU accession has been very slow of late with the last Chapter in the negotiations opened in 2010.   12 of the 33 negotiating Chapters have been officially opened and one provisionally closed.</p>
            <p eId="para_2095">Of the remaining 21 Chapters, negotiations on eight of them have been suspended by the Council since December 2006 due to Turkey's failure to meet its obligations under the Ankara Protocol i.e. normalisation of relations with Cyprus. The Council also agreed that it will not decide on provisionally closing Chapters until the Commission verifies that Turkey has fulfilled its commitments related to the Protocol. A further four Chapters remain frozen since 2007 and Cyprus is blocking another six. This leaves three Chapters with a possibility of being opened.</p>
            <p eId="para_2096">In the absence of movement in the enlargement negotiations, Turkey is still proceeding, nonetheless, with reforms including plans for a new Constitution, in part to bring it more in line with EU standards. The December 2011 General Affairs Council also took "positive note" of the Commission's proposal for a renewed "<i>positive agenda</i>” to support the negotiation process which would involve enhanced cooperation with Turkey in parallel with the accession process in an effort to keep momentum behind the negotiations.</p>
            <p eId="para_2097">We will be working closely with Turkey, with the European Commission, and with our EU partners and will make every effort to move the agenda forward during our Presidency.</p>

            <p eId="para_2099">The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade operates a School Fees Assistance (SFA) scheme in respect of the children of staff serving abroad.  The rationale underpinning the scheme is that children of an officer serving the State abroad should not be disadvantaged in educational terms relative to children in the Irish school system.  Furthermore, a change of school can be traumatic for any child and my Department has a duty to facilitate officers in moving their children with as little disruption as possible between the different education systems of the countries to which they are posted in the service of the State.    In general, where language, educational standards and curriculum at accessible local public schools are comparable to Ireland, children of officers attend such schools.</p>
            <p eId="para_2100">The SFA scheme allows for reimbursement of additional costs which officers incur when, unable to source suitable publicly-funded education for their children abroad, they are required to place their children in local fee-paying schools or at boarding schools in Ireland.  Typically, under their conditions of service, officers rotate between 3-4 year postings abroad and assignments of similar duration at Headquarters. In such circumstances, the Department's SFA Scheme supports officers in their efforts to provide continuity of education for their children in an English language school environment. is allows the Department to fulfil the State's obligation to respect the child's Constitutional right to education.</p>
            <p eId="para_2101">In the case of officers serving in Brussels, those who are based at the Irish Permanent Representation to the European Union can secure places for their children at the non-fee-paying European Schools.  However, those assigned to our other diplomatic missions in Brussels have no automatic eligibility to places in this school and depending on levels of demand for places, may have to seek a place at a fee-paying English speaking school.</p>
            <p eId="para_2102">The total amount paid under the SFA scheme in 2011 in respect of staff of this Department based abroad was approximately €1,060,000. The breakdown of this amount per country follows.  The maximum amount paid in any particular case was €29,200.  Under Data Protection legislation, it would be inappropriate for me to give details in this reply which could lead to the identification of the officer and by extension, the child in question.</p>
            <p eId="para_2103">The estimated expenditure under the SFA scheme for 2012 is €1,141,000.</p>

            <p eId="para_2181">The Good Friday Agreement of 1998 put in place measures for accelerated release under licence within two years of more than 500 prisoners — approximately 300 republican and 200 loyalist — mostly in Northern Ireland but some also in this jurisdiction.  The provisions of the Good Friday Agreement with regard to the early release of prisoners dealt with those who had already been convicted of offences committed before 1998. Those provisions did not extend to those who had not yet been convicted of offences or indeed those who committed offences after that date.</p>
            <p eId="para_2182">The various measures included in the package agreed at Weston Park in August 2001 addressed four issues to assist in the successful implementation of the Good Friday Agreement: policing, normalisation, the stability of the institutions and decommissioning.</p>
            <p eId="para_2183">Proposed draft legislation by the British Government to deal with this specific issue as referred to in paragraph 20 of the Weston Park Accord was formally introduced by the then Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, Peter Hain MP. Those proposals were withdrawn however when the only supporting party, Sinn Féin, could not accept certain aspects of the proposed legislation. In doing so, the British Government said it was mindful of the views of all the political parties, of victim groups and others.</p>
            <p eId="para_2184">I and my officials continue to raise prisoner issues with the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland and with the Northern Ireland Executive, which is accountable to the Northern Ireland Assembly.</p>

            <p eId="para_2217">The policy of my Department regarding the re-hiring of retired officials is to do so to the minimum extent possible.  However, for certain once-off or short-duration projects, it is more productive and cost-effective to re-hire retired staff who already have the relevant expertise and experience than to go through a time-consuming and relatively expensive recruitment, induction and training process.  Where it occurs, retired staff are usually re-hired on a pension abatement basis, which means in effect that they continue to receive their pensions and are paid correspondingly reduced salaries by the Department.</p>
            <p eId="para_2218">Temporary Clerical Officers (TCOs) are recruited annually for the Passport Service through the Public Appointments Service and FÁS and, in general, rehired public servants are not disbarred from applying under public sector recruitment guidelines.

            <p eId="para_2227">NAMA advises that it does not own or operate hotels.  NAMA's role in relation to the properties securing its loans is that of a secured lender.  Other than properties that have been enforced, all of which are listed on NAMA's website and which are managed by the appointed receivers/administrators, properties including hotels continue to be managed by their existing owners or their professional managers/agents.  NAMA, in line with its legislative remit, takes a very close interest in their efficient management and sale with the view to maximum loan repayment in order to protect the position of the taxpayer.</p>
            <p eId="para_2228">NAMA advises that its debtors and receivers control 121 hotels in Ireland, of which 117 are fully operating; four hotels recently ceased trading.  There are over 900 operating hotels in Ireland and, accordingly, NAMA has exposure to only 13% of the sector.   Its potential impact on the overall viability of the sector is overstated. The Deputy may wish to note that NAMA have advised that while the Competition Authority received complaints about NAMA's impact on the hotel sector, the Authority decided not to pursue these complaints after engaging with NAMA.</p>
            <p eId="para_2229">NAMA further advises that as a secured lender it will not advance funding to hotels that are not commercially viable as there would be no foreseeable return on such funding and, therefore, it would run contrary to NAMA's statutory commercial remit.</p>

            <p eId="para_2231">The VAT treatment of goods and services is governed by EU law with which Irish VAT law must comply.  Although there is merit in the proposal to limit tax abuse in the construction sector through the introduction of a VAT refund for home owners employing VAT compliant builders, enforcement of tax law through tax reductions is not an advisable policy, especially in the current economic climate.  The black economy in the construction sector is dealt with, and should continue to be dealt with, through ongoing enforcement procedures by the Revenue Commissioners.   I would point out that construction services, including house improvements, are subject to the 13.5% reduced VAT rate instead of the general standard rate of 23%.</p>

NAMA advises that the income arising from the rental by State bodies of approximately 82 NAMA debtor and receiver properties is of the order of €30 million per annum.  NAMA advises that 48 properties are located in Dublin and the neighbouring counties of Wicklow, Kildare and Meath; these account for 76% of total annual rental income. There are 24 properties located in counties Limerick, Cork and Galway and these account for a further 21% of total income. The residual 10 properties are located throughout the rest of Ireland and account for 3% of rental income. The further breakdown by number and county sought by the Deputy would lead to the identification of specific properties, breaching Sections 99 and 202 of the NAMA Act, under which NAMA is prohibited from disclosing confidential details relating to its debtors or their properties, and the obligation on its debtors and receivers to uphold the confidentiality of agreements entered into with third parties.</p>

This ongoing supervision and assessment of operational risk includes an assessment of banks' IT systems and policies and a review of the banks' internal audit programmes.   Included in the operational risk framework are business continuity planning and contingency arrangements and the banks' own processes for testing those plans. The Central Bank does not test the operation of the contingency arrangements itself nor does it second guess the technical systems and processing arrangements that the banks have established as this would require technical knowledge of these systems and detailed knowledge of their operation. However, the Central Bank requires that the banks' plans are put through a proper governance process and are reviewed and approved by the relevant risk committees of the licensed banks.</p>

        <b>Minister for Finance</b>
         the amount of income cumulatively lost to the Exchequer in 2011 due to the various tax reliefs and breaks, grants, credits, expense allowances and exemptions, and double tax agreements available to corporations.

            <from>Minister for Finance (Deputy Michael Noonan)</from>
            <p eId="para_2268">I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that the total identifiable costs to the Exchequer which are currently available relate to income tax and corporation tax allowances, reliefs, exemptions and tax credits available as set out in the following tables for 2008 and 2009, the most recent year for which the necessary detailed historical information is available.    It should be noted that there have been changes since this period, i.e. some schemes have been abolished or modified and others have been introduced.  For instance, as the Deputy will be aware, virtually all of the area-based and property tax incentive schemes have ended and this year's Finance Act provided for a cap on property-based Accelerated Capital Allowance Schemes (in line with the tax life of the particular scheme) to be introduced from 1 January 2015.  Relevant notes relating to items in the tables are also included.</p>

            <p eId="para_2276">(a) Cost of Tax Credits, Allowances and Reliefs 2008 and 2009</p>
            <p eId="para_2277">The following table IT 6 shows the estimated cost in terms of revenue forgone of the personal tax credits and the main reliefs and deductions allowable under the income tax system. A number of reliefs which apply both to individuals and companies is also included and the cost shown in relation to these reliefs covers income tax and corporation tax.</p>
            <p eId="para_2278">An adjustment is included in the cost figures applying to income tax to compensate for incomplete numbers of tax returns on record at the time of compiling the estimates.</p>
            <p eId="para_2279">The tax credits and reliefs listed in the table serve varying purposes. Many are essentially structural reliefs through which individual tax liabilities are adjusted to reflect relative taxable capacity. The main personal tax credits are a good example of this since they may be regarded as part of the progressive income tax structure representing a band of income chargeable at a zero rate. Others, such as relief for interest paid in full or investment in corporate trades, are tax-based incentives in favour of specific groups or activities which are designed to promote certain aspects of public policy.</p>
            <p eId="para_2280">In computing taxable profits, account needs to be taken in some way of the depreciation of capital assets incurred in earning those profits. To this extent, the figures in the table of the "costs" of capital allowances should not be regarded as measuring a "loss of tax revenue" on profits. To compute such "loss", regard would have to be had to the excess of the amount of the capital allowances at current rates over the amount of the normal allowances.</p>
            <p eId="para_2281">The figures shown for the basic personal tax credits (married, single and widowed) are the costs of these tax credits as if all other tax credits and the exemption limits did not apply. They do not include individuals who are not on Revenue records because their incomes are below the income tax thresholds. The cost figures for the exemption limits are based on the excess of the exemption limits over the basic personal tax credits.</p>
            <p eId="para_2282">The figures of cost are for 2008 and 2009 and all figures are based on tax due in respect of assessments for each year and not on tax receipts within that year.</p>
            <p eId="para_2283">The figure against each credit or allowance represents the additional tax which would become payable if the tax credit or allowance were withdrawn assuming no consequent change in the behaviour of taxpayers (for example, in relation to the reliefs for savings), or the amounts of payments (for example, interest payable on certain savings schemes might need adjustment to take account of the new tax liability).</p>
            <p eId="para_2284">The numbers of claimants of each credit or relief are shown for both years to the extent that they are available. The numbers included are the taxpayers who would be adversely affected by the withdrawal of the respective credit or relief.</p>
            <p eId="para_2285">In the calculations, each tax credit or allowance has been dealt with separately and on the assumption that the rest of the tax system remained unchanged. It would be therefore inaccurate to calculate the effect of withdrawing all the credits, reliefs and allowances by simply totalling the figures. For example, the costs shown for capital allowances and stock relief are also calculated on the basis of separate withdrawal of these reliefs. Their combined cost would be greater than the sum of the separate costs because allowances are not always fully set off against available profits. For instance, a person with €1,000 gross trading profits, €1,000 capital allowances and €1,000 stock relief would pay no tax if either of the reliefs were withdrawn but would pay tax on €1,000 profits if both reliefs were withdrawn. In this case, the cost of each relief separately is nil but the combined cost is tax on €1,000. Basic data is not available to enable an estimate of the combined cost of these reliefs to be made.</p>
            <p eId="para_2286">The figures for estimates based on tax returns have been grossed up to an overall expected level to adjust for incompleteness in the numbers of returns on record at the time the data was extracted for analytical purposes.</p>
            <p eId="para_2287">Apart from the artists exemption, these figures do not take account of the application of the restriction of reliefs originally provided for in section 17 of Finance Act 2006, which took effect from 1 January 2007. The restriction was extended by Section 23 Finance Act 2010.</p>
            <p eId="para_2288">Finally, the estimates shown in many cases are tentative and are subject to revision in the light of later information.</p>

            <p eId="para_2658">(<sup>2</sup>) The cost figures for the exemption limits are based on the excess of the exemption limits over the basic personal tax credits. They include the cost of marginal relief for taxpayers whose incomes are not greatly in excess of the exemption limits.</p>
            <p eId="para_2659">(<sup>3</sup>) The figures shown for the basic personal tax credits (married, single and widowed) are the costs of these tax credits as if all other tax credits and the exemption limits did not apply. They do not include individuals who are not on Revenue records because their incomes are below the income tax thresholds.</p>
            <p eId="para_2660">(<sup>4</sup>) Arising from the change over to Tax Relief at Source the figures relate to the number of policies issued. These include policies where subscriptions were paid by businesses on behalf of their employees.</p>
            <p eId="para_2661">(<sup>5</sup>) Part of the cost of contributions to Permanent Health Benefit Schemes is not identifiable as a result of the move to a “net pay” basis for contributions by PAYE taxpayers from 6 April 2001.</p>
            <p eId="para_2662">(<sup>6</sup>) See the following note on “Green Paper on Pensions” for background commentary on the basis of the cost figures .</p>

            <p eId="para_2664">(<sup>8</sup>) The income on which the cost of exemption from income tax for charities, colleges, hospitals, schools, friendly societies, etc. is based includes dividend income on which income tax deducted at source has been repaid, other investment income, payments received under covenant, donations by the PAYE sector to approved bodies together with the associated tax relief and donations by the self-employed and corporate sectors to approved bodies and approved sports bodies. Information is not available about other income received gross.</p>
            <p eId="para_2665">(<sup>9</sup>) The cost figures for relief for certain Sports Persons are based on income tax self assessment returns and for donations to Approved Sports Bodies are based on income tax and corporation tax self assessment returns.</p>
            <p eId="para_2666">(<sup>10</sup>) In the absence of other information, tax has been assumed at the standard rate of income tax even though a different rate might be more appropriate.</p>
            <p eId="para_2667">(<sup>11</sup>) The costs and numbers for the Exemption of Statutory Redundancy Payments are based on external data. From 2009 the “numbers” indicate the numbers of claims received in the year and not the numbers of claims approved.</p>

Unused capital allowances can be offset as losses against taxable profits arising in the previous accounting period and against certain profits arising in future accounting periods and can be offset against the profits of another company in the same group of companies. It is estimated that €3587 million and €5373 million of unused capital allowances were claimed in respect of 2008 and 2009 accounting periods respectively but as the proportion of this item which is included in previous years losses and in group relief is not separately identifiable a reliable estimate of the cost of the capital allowance element cannot be provided.</p>
            <p eId="para_2670">(<sup>14</sup>) The tax cost shown for section 23 type relief is the estimated ultimate tax cost relating to the total allowable expenditure in respect of claims made in 2008 and 2009 tax returns for the first time. The cost shown is for income tax cases only.</p>
            <p eId="para_2671">(<sup>15</sup>) the cost shown for manufacturing relief for 2008 is compiled using the basic data available but for technical reasons associated with a system redesign it is understood to be understated by at least €100m.</p>
            <p eId="para_2672">(<sup>16</sup>) The costs shown for R&amp;D is for claims for R&amp;D on corporation tax returns for accounting periods ending in 2008 and 2009. However, the cost for 2009 includes the amount of credit allowed against 2009 tax together with the amount offset against tax of previous accounting periods and as payable credits.</p>

            <p eId="para_2674">As part of the work on the Green Paper on Pensions, a review was carried out of the current regime of incentives for supplementary pension provision with a view to developing more comprehensive and reliable estimates of the cost of reliefs in this area. The review examined, among other things, the current reliefs and incentives for investment in supplementary pensions and the data available on which to base reliable estimates of the costs in revenue foregone to the Exchequer.</p>
            <p eId="para_2675">The review drew on newly available 2006 aggregate data on contributions to pension schemes by employers and employees arising from a P35 initiative introduced on foot of provisions that were included in Finance Act 2004 with a view to improving data quality. Estimates of the cost of tax for private pension provision updated for 2008 and 2009 are included in table IT6.</p>
            <p eId="para_2676">The breakdown and make-up of these estimated costs of reliefs differ from presentations of costs in this area for years PRIOR TO 2005 in a number of respects and are not directly comparable. further details on the cost of tax and other reliefs and the changes in the methodology are contained in pages 106 and 107 of the Green Paper on Pensions which is available at <i>www.pensionsgreenpaper.ie</i>.</p>

            <p eId="para_2910">As the Deputy will be aware, virtually all of the area-based and property tax incentive schemes have ended and this year's Finance Act provided for a cap on property-based Accelerated Schemes (in line with the tax life of the particular scheme) to be introduced from 1 January 2015.</p>
            <p eId="para_2911">Notes:</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_2912">The figures shown relate to the various reliefs/incentives and exemptions as specified in the 2008 and 2009 form 11 and CT1.</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_2913">There were concerns that in some instances the new, separately categorised data on property incentives may not have been correctly entered on the Tax returns. Revenue drew the attention of the relevant tax practitioner bodies to these deficiencies to rectify them in future returns and also increased awareness among its own staff involved in processing tax returns of the need to ensure, through closer examination of the returns, that they are correctly completed.</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_2914">The estimated costs have assumed tax foregone at the 41% rate in the case of income tax and 12.5% in the case of corporation tax. This means the figures shown correspond to the maximum Exchequer cost in terms of income tax and corporation tax. However, the actual Exchequer cost could be lower, particularly in relation to the exempt income items, as the income could be subject to deductions for allowable expenses and other costs thereby reducing the level of income that would be actually subject to tax.</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_2915">Some of the costs shown above are included in the costs shown for capital allowances and section 23 relief in Table IT6. However, exempt income included above is not part of capital allowances.</p>

         if he will provide a break down of the €1 billion contribution to the Exchequer provided by Ireland's International Financial Services Centre into corporation tax and payroll taxes, and to break down the payroll tax figures by tax band.

            <from>Minister for Finance (Deputy Michael Noonan)</from>
            <p eId="para_2934">The €1 billion figure is an estimate based on a corporation tax figure provided by the Revenue Commissioners added to an estimate of payroll taxes which was derived from employment and average salary figures contained in a report which was published by Financial Services Ireland (FSI) in September 2010 —<i>The IFSC — the international financial services sector in Ireland</i>.  The report estimates that total direct employment in the sector is 32,700 people and that the average salary across the sector is €60,100 per employee.   In relation to corporation tax, I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that the estimated corporation tax paid in 2011 by companies previously licensed to operate in the International Financial Services Centre is of the order of €466 million.  With the change in the corporation tax rate from 10% to the standard rate now applying to international financial services activities, it is generally speaking no longer possible to distinguish between corporation tax paid solely on IFSC activities and on other income.  An exception is made in the case of the main associated banks where an estimate of the tax paid by them on their IFSC activities is derived from indicative data available. This estimate is incorporated in the €466 million figure provided above.</p>
            <p eId="para_2935">The €466 million figure relates only to those companies that were once licensed under the preferential IFSC tax regime which expired in 2005.  I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that it is not possible to identify international financial services companies that have been established since the end of that regime and so the corporation tax paid by such companies is not included in the €466 million figure.</p>
            <p eId="para_2936">I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that the detailed data in relation to payroll taxes requested by the Deputy is not readily available and either could not be identified or could not be identified without conducting an extensive investigation of the Revenue Commissioners' records.</p>
            <p eId="para_2937">In the absence of this data, my Department produced an estimate of payroll taxes based on an average salary figure of €60,100 and total employment figure of 32,700 contained in the FSI report.</p>
            <p eId="para_2938">The average contribution to the Exchequer per employee (PAYE, USC, Employee PRSI and Employer PRSI) was calculated using the €60,100 average salary figure as an estimate for 2011 for the main categories of income-earners — single, married one-earner and married two-earners.</p>
            <p eId="para_2939">These estimates were then multiplied by the total number of employees in the sector to give an estimated yield of circa €700 million.  It should be noted that these figures do not take account of pension contributions.</p>
            <p eId="para_2940">When the corporation tax figures and the payroll tax estimates are combined, it shows that the sector contributed in excess of €1 billion to the Exchequer in 2011.</p>

            <p eId="para_3107">The position is that income tax relief for contributions paid to permanent health benefit schemes is allowable in accordance with section 471 of the Taxes Consolidated Act 1997. This section provides relief for premiums paid to a permanent health benefit scheme approved by the Revenue Commissioners, which provides for periodic payments to an individual in the event of loss or diminution of income due to ill health. The relief is confined to an amount not exceeding 10% of the individual's total income for any tax year. Information on the cost to the Exchequer and the numbers of claimants availing of the relief in respect of the permanent health benefit schemes is available for the income tax years 2005 to 2009 inclusive, the most recent year for which final data is available.

            <p eId="para_3122">The following table provides a breakdown of the estimated cost of tax and PRSI reliefs relating to private pension contributions for 2006, 2007, 2008 and 2009, the latest year for which the most up-to-date data is available together with estimates of the notional or imputed cost of the tax exemption for the investment income and gains of approved superannuation funds. Corresponding estimates of the cost of tax reliefs are also provided for 2005 to the extent that it has been possible to provide them on a consistent and comparable basis. Figures have been rounded where appropriate.    I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that while corresponding updates of the cost figures are not yet available for the tax year 2010 the necessary work of assembling the basic data to enable this to be done is ongoing. No data is available for 2011.</p>
            <p eId="para_3123">Finally, it should be borne in mind that the information imparted by the costing of tax and other reliefs in the pensions area is inherently limited. It may suggest a significant notional loss in terms of tax foregone as compared with the savings that might be expected if the tax relief was not available. However, where tax relief arrangements are of such significance, as in this instance, the removal of the reliefs would represent a fundamental adjustment to the current balance of the tax system and would have very significant implications in terms, among other things, of the economic and behavioural impacts which would ensue. These impacts would be difficult to model in advance. For these reasons, the real informational content of the costings of tax reliefs is limited and should be treated with some caution.</p>

            <p eId="para_3172">The Foreign Earnings Deduction is a deduction from income for income tax purposes for employees who travel abroad to certain countries as part of the duties of their employment. A deduction from salary of up to a maximum of €35,000 will be granted for employees travelling to the so-called BRICS countries, namely Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa as part of the duties of their employment.  The individual claiming the deduction must be absent from the State for a minimum of 60 days in a period of 12 months beginning or ending in a relevant tax year. These days can be accumulated from a number of trips. However, in order to qualify each trip must have a minimum duration of four days.</p>
            <p eId="para_3173">The deduction has been introduced for three years and is scheduled to expire at the end of the 2014 tax year, at which point it will be reviewed.</p>
            <p eId="para_3174">It is likely that the cost of air travel for relevant journeys would be borne by an employer and therefore it would not be appropriate to include such costs when calculating the amount of income that can be deducted by an individual under the scheme. However, employers may claim a deduction for such costs in the accounts of the business when determining the profits of that business for tax purposes.</p>
            <p eId="para_3175">I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that an information leaflet on the Foreign Earnings Deduction will be available on their website shortly.</p>

            <p eId="para_3177">The Programme for Government indicates that, as part of its fiscal policy, the Government will ensure that "tax exiles" make a fair contribution to the Exchequer.   In Budget 2012, I abolished the "citizenship condition" for payment of the Domicile Levy to ensure that "tax exiles" could not avoid the levy by renouncing their citizenship.  I also stated that I intend to keep the contentious issue of the tax treatment of "tax exiles" (which is linked to the tax residence rules) under constant review.     In line with the position prevailing in many other jurisdictions, the capability to impose Irish taxation on an individual is linked to the residence status (i.e. resident or non-resident) for tax purposes of that individual.  In general, an individual who is not resident here for tax purposes is taxable on his or her Irish source income and gains, on income attributable to duties of an employment exercised here, and on gifts and inheritances of Irish situated property.</p>
            <p eId="para_3178">The Programme for Government update in March 2012 confirms the commitment to undertake a consultation process on residence issues in 2012 to inform preparation for further changes in 2013.  Earlier this year, I launched a public consultation on tax residence rules wherein I invited interested parties to make submissions on possible revisions to the current residence rules for the taxation of individuals.    I welcome views on:</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_3179">whether or not, and how, the current day counting rules should be amended;</p>

            <p eId="para_3202">I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that legislation now obliges taxpayers within certain categories to meet their tax filing and paying obligations in an electronic format using the Revenue On-Line Service, ROS.</p>
            <p eId="para_3203">ROS was introduced in 2001 and the legislation underpinning mandatory electronic filing was introduced in 2008 on a phased basis, commencing with large companies, and extending to Government Departments, Public Bodies, all other companies and certain self assessed individuals.  This progressive approach to mandatory electronic filing was extended to all VAT registered businesses in June 2012.</p>
            <p eId="para_3204">The mandatory legislation does not oblige non-self assessed individuals, e.g. employees, to engage with Revenue electronically.</p>
            <p eId="para_3205">There are some small businesses (not companies) that are not obliged to file electronically.  These businesses include all non VAT registered businesses (businesses with turnover less than €37,500 for the supply of services, and €75,000 for the supply of goods) and certain self assessed individuals.</p>
            <p eId="para_3206">The legislation allows Revenue to exclude a taxpayer from their obligation to pay and file electronically, if Revenue is satisfied that the taxpayer does not have the capacity to do so.  "Capacity" means sufficient access to the Internet, and in the case of an individual, also means not prevented by reason of age, or mental or physical infirmity from efiling or epaying.</p>
            <p eId="para_3207">Taxpayers who wish to apply for exclusion can do so to their local Revenue office.  Where exclusions are granted taxpayers can continue to meet their Revenue obligations in a non electronic format.</p>
            <p eId="para_3208">For those who do not qualify for exclusion under the Legislation, Revenue has offered, and will continue to offer assistance to all new ROS users.  This assistance includes a one to one tutorial on how to use ROS, which will be delivered at the customer's convenience.  This approach ensures that all new ROS users become accustomed to and confident in using the service.</p>
            <p eId="para_3209">There are many advantages associated with using ROS the main being the tax calculation facility which instantly calculates the tax due providing the user with an accurate tax liability.</p>

            <p eId="para_3211">I note the Deputy's concerns regarding exports through Dublin Port, particularly given that exports have been the bedrock upon which Ireland's recovery has been based. However, I would point to the recently published Quarterly National Accounts (QNA) which provides hard data on exports. Exports were 6.1 per cent higher for the first quarter of 2012 than in the corresponding period in 2011. Exports also increased by 2.6 per cent on a quarter-on-quarter basis. These positive figures are testament to Ireland's improving competitiveness.    It is important also to note the composition of Irish exports, with exports of services increasing steadily since 2009 and now representing nearly 50 per cent of all exports. This continued growth is reflected in the 11.9 per cent increase in services in Q1 2012 when compared with Q1 of 2011. However, given the nature of services, this will not be reflected in Dublin Port's figures.  Encouragingly though, the QNA data also show an increase in the export of goods over the same period of 1.1 per cent.</p>
            <p eId="para_3212">These figures are consistent with my Department's forecast for export led growth in 2012.</p>

            <p eId="para_3214">As the Deputy can appreciate, the welcome recent development from the Euro Area summit of 29th June, represents a major shift in European policy in terms of breaking the vicious circle between the banks and the sovereign. The Irish Government and its officials have been working extremely hard to secure a deal on the Irish bank debt.  This agreement provides an opportunity for the issue of the bank debt to be addressed at an EU level.     As part of the 7th Review of the Irish Programme which successfully concluded last week, technical work commenced with the troika and this work will intensify over the summer in advance of the September Eurogroup meeting. It has been agreed that when an effective single supervisory mechanism is established, involving the ECB, for banks in the euro area, the European Stability Mechanism (ESM) could have the possibility to recapitalise banks directly. While the policy position is very positive indeed, it would not be possible at this stage of the process to attempt to quantify the benefits which will accrue to the Irish economy. The details of how to separate banking from sovereign debt must now be discussed in detail.</p>
            <p eId="para_3215">Nevertheless, preliminary discussions on how to separate Irish banking debt from sovereign debt are underway, with a view to concluding in October. However I do not want to prejudice those discussions at this time by commenting on the likely contents of any agreement. The amount of our banking debt which could be considered under this agreement will be identified during the detailed discussions but I would not want Ireland to be constrained by setting a target figure. As the details have yet to be worked out, it is too early to say what the precise implications will be.</p>
            <p eId="para_3216">I can assure the House that we will seek to be ambitious in our negotiation and will seek to agree the best deal possible for the Irish taxpayer. As and when further measures are agreed/solutions emerge I will inform the Houses as appropriate.</p>

            <p eId="para_3218">I am informed by the National Treasury Management Agency, as Manager of the National Pensions Reserve Fund (NPRF), that the total value of the Fund at 31 March 2012 was €15.1 billion and that the value of the Discretionary Portfolio was €5.8 billion.   In announcing the Strategic Investment Fund (SIF) initiative in September 2011, the Government indicated a refocusing of the investments of the National Pensions Reserve Fund from global towards Ireland. Commercial investment will be channeled from the NPRF towards productive investment in sectors of strategic importance to the Irish economy.</p>
            <p eId="para_3219">A key principle of the Strategic Investment Fund is that the NPRF investment, which is to be solely on a commercial basis, will seek matching investment from third-party investors. In this way the Fund's assets can be used as a catalyst to attract additional capital for investment in the Irish economy. In addition, the Fund has been working closely with NewERA in respect of investment opportunities relating to the commercial semi-state sector.</p>
            <p eId="para_3220">The NPRF Commission announced in November 2011 a commitment of €250 million to a new Irish infrastructure investment fund which is seeking up to €1 billion from institutional investors in Ireland and overseas and which will invest in infrastructure assets in Ireland, including assets designated for disposal by the Government and commercial State enterprises and also new infrastructure projects.</p>

It is expected that moneylenders will pay levies in the order of €300,000 in 2012.   The Central Bank utilises a cost allocation model, developed by external consultants in 2004, to establish the cost of regulating each industry funding category. This model, which is reviewed and updated on an annual basis, allocates costs to industry categories on the basis of detailed estimates from individual supervision divisions of the expected deployment of available resources.</p>

         the rationale behind the incapacitated child tax credit; if his attention has been drawn to the fact that the Revenue Commissioner now requires medical evidence of a reasonable belief the child concerned will not be able to care for themselves after the age of 18 years; if his attention has been drawn to the difficulty families face in obtaining and providing this evidence as they seek to avail of therapies that will improve their child’s quality of life and their prospects of living independently as adults; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

            <p eId="para_3271">The position is that Section 465 of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 provides for an annual tax credit of €3,300 for each qualifying child that a claimant proves is living with him during the year of assessment.   For these purposes a qualifying child is—</p>

            <p eId="para_3274">In the case of a child under the age of 18 years the credit is granted only if there is a reasonable expectation that, if the child were over the age of 18 years, he or she would be incapable of maintaining himself or herself.</p>
            <p eId="para_3275">The requirement that there be a reasonable expectation that the child concerned would not be able to care for himself or herself after the age of 18 years was introduced in Finance Act 1986.</p>
            <p eId="para_3276">In general, a permanent incapacity may be taken as a mental or physical infirmity of a permanent nature which significantly reduces the mental or physical capacity of the child, below that which would be enjoyed by a normal child, and which cannot be ameliorated by the use of any treatment, device, medication or therapy.  In other words, the child's capacity to lead a reasonably normal life must be permanently impaired.</p>
            <p eId="para_3277">I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that the type of disabilities which are regarded as being permanently incapacitating include Cystic Fibrosis, Spina Bifida, Blindness, severe and permanent deafness that affects both ears, Downs Syndrome, Spastic Paralysis, certain forms of Schizophrenia, and Acute Autism.</p>
            <p eId="para_3278">If the disability is not one of the above, or where it is not obvious that the child's incapacity is of a serious and permanent nature a doctor's certificate should be submitted with the initial claim.</p>

The doctors' certificates that were provided by the person concerned, while stating that the condition is permanent does not give the certification required. Further clarification is required from the child's doctor in order for Revenue to consider granting the credit.

            <p eId="para_3294">Section 21 of the Credit Union Act 1997 provides that a member of a credit union who is of or over the age of sixteen may, by a signed written statement, nominate a person or persons to become entitled at the member's death to the whole, or such part or parts as may be specified in the nomination, of any property in the credit union (whether in savings, loans, insurances or otherwise) which the member may have at the time of his or her death.   There are a number of safeguards in place to prevent abuse of this provision:</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_3295">The nominee cannot be an officer of the credit union unless that officer is a member the nominator's family.</p>

         if it would be feasible to increase the drawdown of pensions from 25% to a larger sum or increase levels of flexibility in the drawdown system to avoid the current situation whereby an average adult of 64 years with a pension of €70,000 can only drawdown €19,000 on retirement and €2,000 per year thereafter; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

            <p eId="para_3301">Contributions to supplementary private pension savings are tax-relieved, within limits, at an individual's marginal rate of income tax while the accrued income and gains on those savings are exempt from taxation. These arrangements apply on the basis that the pension benefits when taken at retirement will be subject to tax. In an arrangement of long standing, an individual can, on retirement at normal retirement age (usually between 60 and 65), draw down a retirement lump sum up to a maximum of 25% of the value of his or her pension fund or 1.5 times final salary, depending on the type of pension scheme, the options available and the individual's particular circumstances. The retirement lump sum is tax-free up to an overall life-time tax-free limit of €200,000.</p>
            <p eId="para_3302">My understanding of the question is that the Deputy is requesting an increase in the amount of retirement benefits that may be taken as a retirement lump sum. I have no plans at this time to increase the levels of retirement benefits that may be taken in this fashion.   On the issue of flexibility, provisions in Finance Act 1999 introduced a considerable degree of flexibility and personal choice to certain categories of individuals in relation to the drawing down of benefits from their pension plans.  These choices include the options to purchase an annuity, to receive the balance of the pension fund in cash (subject to tax, as appropriate), to invest in an approved retirement fund (ARF) or an Approved Minimum Retirement Fund (AMRF), subject to certain conditions.</p>
            <p eId="para_3303">Access to these flexible options was extended to all main benefits from retirement benefit schemes (other than Defined Benefit arrangements) in Budget and Finance Act 2011. The changes made in 2011 have particular relevance for ordinary members of occupational Defined Contribution pension schemes, as up to the passing of Finance Act 2011, the only option available to such individuals in respect of their main scheme benefits had been the purchase of a retirement annuity after taking the retirement lump sum. Subject to meeting the conditions, these individuals now have the choices referred to above. It should be borne in mind, however, that the option to invest in an ARF or AMRF as opposed to purchasing an annuity may not be appropriate for everyone.</p>

I refer the Deputy to Part VIII of the Consumer Credit Act 1995, as amended, for detailed information on the licensing procedure with regard to moneylenders. Moneylenders have to apply annually to the Central Bank to have their licences renewed. Section 93 of the Consumer Credit Act 1995 sets out the Central Bank's powers on the grant or refusal of a moneylender's licence.</p>

I have been informed by the Central Bank that the associated maximum rate of APR that the licensed moneylender mentioned by the Deputy is authorised to charge is 187.22%.

Revenue currently has over 2,000 staff engaged on activities that are dedicated to target and confront non-compliance.

Revenue, in implementing the actions of the National Drugs Strategy and other anti-smuggling activities, deploys officers at all key ports and airports in the State.  Revenue officers also target the prevention of drug smuggling by carrying out intelligence-based operations and cooperating with other agencies, including the Garda Síochána.

            <p eId="para_3329">In response to the Deputy's question details of the bodies within the remit of my department that have the power to enter or search premises in the course of an investigation are as follows.</p>
            <p eId="para_3330">The Central Bank of Ireland</p>
            <p eId="para_3331">The Central Bank of Ireland ("the Bank") has been granted the power under various provisions of sector-specific legislation (i.e. legislation governing the supervision of different types of regulated financial service provider) to conduct investigations of regulated financial service providers (and entities related to such providers in certain circumstances) in order to assist the Bank in the performance of its statutory functions. While the scope of the Bank's powers to conduct investigations varies according to the applicable legislation, a power is usually given to the Bank to appoint persons (usually, but not always, referred to as "authorised officers") to enter and search the premises of regulated financial service providers. Each sector-specific investigation regime provides for the powers of authorised officers when entering and searching premises.</p>
            <p eId="para_3332">Save for entering a dwelling, there is no general obligation on an authorised officer to obtain a court issued warrant before exercising their powers of entry and search in accordance with their certificate/warrant of appointment. Certain sector-specific investigation regimes provide that where an authorised officer is prevented from entering a premises, he or she may apply to court for a warrant and/or an order of the Court requiring the firm or related party to cooperate. Certain provisions provide explicitly that the power of an authorised officer to enter and search a dwelling can only be exercised with the consent of the occupier or by a court issued warrant.</p>
            <p eId="para_3333">Pursuant to Part 3 of the Central Bank (Supervision and Enforcement) Bill 2011, most of the provisions governing the appointment and powers of authorised officers across financial services legislation are to be consolidated and the existing provisions repealed or revoked. Section 24 of the published Bill provides for the powers of authorised officers to enter premises, subject to the proviso that entry to a dwelling requires the consent of the occupier or a warrant issued under section 26 of the Bill. Section 26 of the Bill provides, inter alia, that notwithstanding the powers conferred on authorised officer to enter premises, a judge of the District Court may on the sworn evidence of an authorised officer issue a warrant authorising the officer to enter the premises (by reasonable force if necessary).</p>
            <p eId="para_3334">Officers of the Revenue Commissioners</p>
            <p eId="para_3335">I have been provided with the following information in by Office of the Revenue commissioners.  Officers of the Revenue Commissioners, appropriately authorised by the Commissioners, have statutory powers of entry to premises. These powers do not extend to private dwellings. Where it is intended to enter and search a private dwelling, a search warrant under the appropriate statutory provision must be obtained.  The following at A is a list and a brief summary of the statutory powers allowing for entry onto a premises without warrant; and at B a list and brief summary of the statutory provisions for search warrants for premises including private dwellings.</p>

A search warrant is not required for such entry.  The activities are as follows:</p>

                  <p eId="para_3412">As Minister for Finance I announced the establishment of the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council on a non-statutory basis on 7 July 2011.  The Council is part of a wider agenda of reform of Ireland’s budgetary architecture which is envisaged in the Programme for Government and is a requirement of the EU/IMF Programme of Financial Support for Ireland. When establishing the Council, I stated that the Council would be an independent body whose existence and independence would be underpinned by legislation to be brought forward by Government in the Fiscal Responsibility Bill.The Chairman did not undergo interview by Oireachtas Committee but the Fiscal Council appeared before the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform on 17 November 2011 to discuss their first fiscal assessment report published in October.I appointed the members having regard to a number of criteria including the desirability of having a mix of appropriate backgrounds (academia, the financial sector/financial markets and public finance), macroeconomic/microeconomic expertise and a strong international dimension, as well as the need to take gender considerations into account. I am satisfied that the appointed members have the mix of skills and experience, including in relation to fiscal affairs, to ensure that the Council will be highly effective in fulfilling its mandate.  The Fiscal Responsibility Bill will include provisions for the appointment of members once the Council is on a statutory footing.</p>

The Deputy will appreciate that in the absence of all of the relevant details that would be contained in an individual's application in relation to nationality, residency, previous academic attainment and means it would not be possible for me to say whether or not a student would qualify for a grant.

            <p eId="para_3446">The sharp decline in apprentice recruitment and significant levels of redundancies in many apprenticeship trades over the past three years has resulted in a dramatic fall off in the number of apprentices requiring education and training in the institutes of technology and colleges of further education. The requirement for Carpentry and Joinery provision has been particularly affected, having fallen from a high of 168 blocks nationally in 2008 to an expected national requirement for 15 blocks in 2012.</p>
            <p eId="para_3447">In light of the collapse in demand for this trade and following close consultations with the education providers and FÁS, the Higher Education Authority (HEA) has allocated Carpentry and Joinery provision to a reduced number of colleges on a regional cluster basis for the 2012/13 academic year. All institutes involved in the training of apprentices have access to the equipment needed to support high quality training and the decision to allocate provision on a regional basis was taken in order to ensure that Carpentry and Joinery provision remained available to apprentices in regions across the country.  In line with the commitment in the Government's Action Plan for Jobs, a review of the apprenticeship training model is being undertaken during 2012.</p>

            <p eId="para_3454">One of the main objectives of the School Transport Scheme is to ensure that, as far as possible, eligible children have a reasonable level of service while at the same time, ensuring that school transport vehicles are fully utilised in an efficient and cost effective manner.  In this regard, Bus Éireann generally plan and timetable school transport services for children who are in attendance for the full school day.</p>
            <p eId="para_3455">Children in infant classes may have a school day that is one hour shorter than the length of the normal school day.  This is a concession in the interests of young children and allows for a perceived inability on their part to sustain the work of the full day.  It is a matter for the Board of Management of a particular school to decide whether the concession should be applied in the case of the school or not. It is also a matter for the managerial authorities to arrange adequate supervision for children while they are on the school premises.  The annual charge for school transport is a contribution towards the overall cost and does not reflect the true cost of providing these services.</p>

            <p eId="para_3457">The question of enrolment in individual schools is the responsibility of the managerial authority of those schools. My Department's main responsibility is to ensure that schools in an area can, between them, cater for all pupils seeking places.  It is the responsibility of the managerial authorities of schools that are not in a position to admit all pupils seeking entry to implement an enrolment policy in accordance with the Education Act 1998. In this regard a board of management may deem it necessary to restrict enrolment to children from a particular age group or to children living in a particular area or on the basis of some other criterion.  The selection process and the enrolment policy on which it is based is matter for the individual school authority. In formulating an enrolment policy a school must, however, ensure it is lawful and applied fairly to all applicants.</p>
            <p eId="para_3458">The Deputy will be aware that in June last year, I launched a discussion paper on school enrolment. The document, "Discussion Paper on a Regulatory Framework for School Enrolment" contains suggestions on how to make the process of enrolling in schools more open, equitable and consistent. I have made it clear that the paper was not meant to be prescriptive; the purpose of the paper was to lead and provoke debate on enrolment policies and practices.  I invited education partners and interested parties to submit their views to my Department by the 28th of October last. The feedback from this consultation will help inform the nature and scope of a new regulatory framework for school enrolment.  I intend to bring legislative proposals to Government this year, the primary aim of which will be to ensure that every child is treated fairly and that every child has a place at school.</p>

            <p eId="para_3473">The curriculum in post-primary schools is devised on the basis that ICT is not a subject but rather a tool to be integrated into the teaching and learning across all subjects.  The National Council for Curriculum and Assessment has developed an ICT framework which sets out a structured approach to ICT in curriculum and assessment. This sets out the types of learning appropriate for students during the period of compulsory education, and provides a guide to teachers for embedding ICT across the curriculum. Therefore, it is not time bound.</p>
            <p eId="para_3474">The overall implementation of ICT in schools is supported by the National Centre for Technology in Education which provides for extensive training and guidance for schools on the integration of ICT into teaching and learning.  I am currently leading the reform of the Junior Cycle. A Framework for the revised Junior Cycle has been prepared. It contains 24 Statements of Learning which students should experience. One of the Statements of Learning aims to ensure that all students "use ICT effectively and ethically in learning and in life". In addition, there are six key skills identified. One of them is "managing information and thinking" and includes " using ICT to access, manage and share knowledge".  The reform will also allow for the introduction of optional school developed short courses of 100 hours duration. This will provide a new opportunity for schools to progress the provision of short courses to enhance students' ICT skills which will be embedded in all their learning. Such courses could include software programming and coding, if a school so chooses.</p>

            <from>Minister for Education and Skills (Deputy Ruairí Quinn)</from>
            <p eId="para_3476">I understand that the question relates to the provision of ICT funding for primary and post primary schools.</p>
            <p eId="para_3477">My Department funds the ICT in Schools Programme. The programme, which commenced in 1998, delivers strategic investment across the range of interconnected issues which need to be addressed in order to systematically integrate ICT into teaching and learning and promote the development of pupils' digital literacy.</p>
            <p eId="para_3478">In line with best practice internationally the programme addresses four key themes:</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_3479">internet access for schools (broadband since 2005),</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_3480">teacher professional development in ICT,</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_3481">ICT infrastructure deployment in schools,</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_3482">deployment of curriculum-relevant digital content and software for use in the classroom.</p>
            <p eId="para_3483">Between 2009 and 2011 inclusive, some €126m has been allocated under the programme, including €92m in ICT Infrastructure Grant funding between November 2009 and December 2010. The main priority under this scheme was the equipping of each classroom with a teaching computer and digital projector. Once the baseline is in place schools can allocate any remaining funding under the scheme to other ICT equipment and software for educational use. A number of key support measures were taken to help schools get best value in the use of these devolved grants — in particular, the inclusion of schools in national purchasing frameworks for desktops, laptops, digital projectors and printers, the delivery of a national series of elearning seminars for school leaders, and the provision of extensive guidance and training on the use of ICT in the classroom.  In relation to overall expenditure under the Programme, I have attached a breakdown of expenditure for 2011.</p>
            <p eId="para_3484">In relation to funding this year, €13.2 million has been earmarked for the ICT in Schools Programme. The increase in the 2012 allocation as compared with the 2011 outturn primarily reflects the ongoing rental costs for the 78 schools connected under the pilot project to provide high speed (100Mbit/s) broadband connections to schools.</p>
            <p eId="para_3485">The current allocation allows the programme to remain focused on maintaining priority services within reduced staffing and financial resources through 2012. The ICT in Schools programme continues to adapt to the new policy challenges and opportunities arising from major developments in curricular reform, digital publishing, digital content dissemination tools generally, cloud services, portable computing and student devices, and the deployment of high speed broadband at post-primary level.</p>

            <p eId="para_3519">In the school-year 2011/12, 59 Irish teachers (26 primary and 33 post-primary) were on secondment from their schools in Ireland and teaching in European Schools. Any variation in that number from year to year is small. The European Schools are a system of 14 nursery, primary and secondary schools established and maintained by the European Union and its Member States.</p>
            <p eId="para_3520">The schools serve the needs of children whose parents are officials of the EU Commission, European Parliament and other official European institutions. The schools have been established by an intergovernmental treaty — the Convention of the European Schools — to which Ireland is a signatory.</p>
            <p eId="para_3521">The Department is committed to fulfilling its obligations under the Convention of the European Schools. It supports the operation of the schools by arranging for the transfer of teachers from Ireland to fill teaching positions in the European Schools and by funding replacement teachers in schools in Ireland.</p>
            <p eId="para_3522">European posts are advertised and applications sought from interested teachers.  Selection is by interview. Secondment is for a maximum of nine years.</p>
            <p eId="para_3523">While they are on secondment, the salaries of the teachers are paid by the Department and supplemented by the Central Office of European Schools. Such teachers also receive an additional salary payment from the European Union Office of European schools.  Allowances to cover various expenses are also payable. On completion of their service in the European Schools, the teachers return to their schools in Ireland, although an Irish base school can recall a teacher before that, if it wants to. Throughout the period of secondment, the Department also pays for temporary replacement teachers.</p>
            <p eId="para_3524">The cost to the Department in 2011 was €16,000, comprising costs of advertising, interviewing, taster visits to the schools by the teachers and a guidance service.  It is expected that the cost to the Department in 2012 will be in the region of €25,000.</p>
            <p eId="para_3525">The arrangements for such secondment are set out at length in Departmental circular 0009/2007, which can be found on the website of my Department.</p>

            <p eId="para_3531">Due to competing demands on the Departments capital budget imposed by the need to prioritise the limited funding available for the provision of additional school accommodation to meet increasing demographic requirements it was not possible to include the project referred to by the Deputy in the 5 year construction programme announced in March.</p>
            <p eId="para_3532">School building projects, including the project referred to by the Deputy, which have not been included in the five year construction programme, but which were announced for initial inclusion in the building programme will continue to be progressed to final planning stages in anticipation of the possibility of further funds being available to the Department in future years.</p>

            <p eId="para_3534">As the Deputy will be aware, in June 2011 I announced that 20 new post-primary schools are to be established up to 2017 to cater for increasing demographics across a number of locations. This announcement included for the provision of a new post-primary school in Claregalway, County Galway to commence operation in September 2013.  The New Schools Establishment Group has recently submitted its report to me on the assessment of the applications received for patronage of new second level schools to be established in 2013 and 2014.  I am currently considering this report and I hope to be in a position shortly to announce my decisions on the patronage of the new schools to be established.</p>
            <p eId="para_3535">My Department is working closely with the relevant Local Authority in relation to identifying and acquiring a suitable site for the proposed school referred to by the Deputy. My Department is now considering what options are available locally to allow the school to commence operation, pending the delivery of a permanent accommodation solution. In relation to the permanent site, a number of site assessments have been carried out to date which did lead to discussions with a number of land owners. However, due to commercial sensitivities attaching to site acquisitions generally I am not in a position to comment further in relation to the site acquisition process at this time.</p>

        <b> Deputy Dessie Ellis</b>
         asked the 
        <b>Minister for Education and Skills</b>
         his plans to improve services to autistic children and their families in the Ballymun area of Dublin. 
        [34907/12]

          <speech by="#RuairiQuinn" as="#Minister_for_Education_and_Skills" eId="spk_727">
            <from>Minister for Education and Skills (Deputy Ruairí Quinn)</from>
            <p eId="para_12279">The Deputy will be aware of the Government's ongoing commitment to ensuring that all children with special educational needs, including those with autism, can have access to an education appropriate to their needs preferably in school settings through the primary and post primary school network. This facilitates access to individualised education programmes, fully qualified professional teachers, special needs assistants and the appropriate school curriculum.</p>
            <p eId="para_12280">Many children with autism are fully integrated into mainstream classes. The National Council for Special Education (NCSE) provides additional resource teaching hours and special needs assistant support to schools in respect of fully integrated enrolled students with autism.</p>
            <p eId="para_12281">Some students with autism require further support in school. The establishment of a network of autism-specific special classes in schools across the country to cater for these children with autism has been a key educational priority in recent years. My Department supports provision in mainstream schools, some 540 special classes for autism attached to mainstream and special schools and 18 special schools for children with autism throughout the State which cater for the educational needs of over 5,000 children with autism. These figures include 101 classes for autism in Co. Dublin. The NCSE will continue to establish more classes as required.</p>
            <p eId="para_12282">Children in these classes benefit from having a reduced pupil-teacher ratio of 6:1. Class teachers are required to be fully-qualified and have access through the Special Education Support Service to training in a range of autism-specific interventions, including Applied Behavioural Analysis (ABA), the Treatment and Education of Autistic and Related Communication Handicapped Children (TEACCH) and the Picture Exchange Communication System (PECS). A minimum of 2 special needs assistants are provided for each class. Other special needs assistant posts may be allocated in line with the needs of the enrolled children. These students have the option, where appropriate, of full or partial integration and interaction with other pupils. Funding is also provided for assistive technology and specialist equipment as required and special school transport arrangements may also be put in place.</p>
            <p eId="para_12283">My Department's home tuition scheme provides a grant to parents to facilitate the provision of education at home for children who, for a number of reasons such as chronic illness, are unable to attend school. The scheme was extended in recent years to facilitate tuition for children with special educational needs awaiting an educational placement and provide early education intervention for pre-school children who have been assessed as having autism. The grant provides for ten hours' home tuition per week for each child with autism aged between 2.5 and 3 years of age.</p>
            <p eId="para_12284">The Deputy will be aware that the NCSE is responsible, through its network of local Special Educational Needs Organisers (SENOs), for processing applications from primary, special and post primary schools for special needs supports on the basis of applications in respect of individual pupils. The SENOs operate within the policy outlined in my Department's circulars for allocating such support.</p>
            <p eId="para_12285">Each SENO works in an assigned local area with parents, schools, teachers, psychologists, health professionals and other staff who are involved in the provision of services in that area for children with special educational needs. All schools have contact details of their local SENO. It is also open to parents to contact their local SENO directly to discuss their child's special educational needs.</p>

            <p eId="para_12303">Changes to the Post Primary School Transport Scheme were announced in Budget 2011 and derive from recommendations in the Value for Money Review of the School Transport Scheme.</p>
            <p eId="para_12304">The main change to the current scheme means that from the 2012/13 school year, school transport eligibility for all pupils newly entering a post primary school will be determined by reference to the distance they reside from their nearest Post-Primary Education Centre having regard, as heretofore, to ethos and language.</p>

            <p eId="para_12309">It is my belief that a well planned Physical Education programme has a vitally important role to play in a broad and balanced curriculum for all students.</p>
            <p eId="para_12310">In accordance with the Rules and Programme for Secondary Schools, all second level schools should provide Physical Education as part of the curriculum. The junior cycle and senior cycle programme that each school plans and delivers should be based on my Department's approved syllabuses and the teaching hours should be registered on the school timetable. The Rules and Programme provide that a basic minimum of two hours per week is required to implement the programme.</p>
            <p eId="para_12311">As part of the revised Junior Cycle framework, there are 24 statements of learning which set out what students should learn in Junior Cycle. One of the statements of learning provides that, at the end of Junior Cycle, students should be able to participate in physical activity confidently and competently.</p>
            <p eId="para_12312">In addition, as part of the Junior Cycle Review there will be an opportunity for schools to provide short courses which can be assessed as part of the Junior Certificate. Short courses will generally be locally developed, of 100 hours duration and will be assessed by means of a portfolio. There will be scope under these arrangements for schools to extend the provision for sports and PE, including it as part of the Junior Certificate qualification, should they wish to do so.</p>

            <p eId="para_12319">I have already made clear to the House on a number of occasions that school communities should have no reason to feel that there will be a forced closure of their local school.  No school closes because it loses a teacher. Schools close because of a loss of pupils.  Small primary schools that have had to close in recent years are those that are no longer viable due to falling enrolments.  The enrolment in such schools had typically fallen below a total of 8 pupils for two consecutive school years.  The staffing of the school referred to by the Deputy is remaining unchanged at two mainstream classroom posts for the coming school year 2012/13.</p>
            <p eId="para_12320">The Government recognises that small schools are an important part of the social fabric of rural communities.  They will continue to be a feature of our education landscape. However, this does not mean that small schools can stand still or never have their staffing levels changed to something that is more affordable and sustainable for these difficult and challenging times.</p>
            <p eId="para_12321">A Value for Money examination of small schools has been carried out and I expect the report should be available after the summer recess. The review will take account of diversity of provision, ethos of schools, parental choice, the language of instruction, travel distances, transport costs and the impact of schools on dispersed rural communities. I hope that this report will foster constructive engagement both in the Oireachtas and among all interested parties in looking at the challenges ahead and how best to make provision for primary education in rural and dispersed communities. How best to sustain provision for widely dispersed and small Protestant communities will present as a particular challenge particularly in any locality where enrolment in their schools is declining to single figures and amalgamation is not an option because there is no other school nearby. The Government is intent in fostering pluralism in school provision. Supporting minority churches in maintaining their schools is part of that policy and will inform how the Government approaches the outcome of the Value for Money Study.</p>

            <p eId="para_12330">I wish to advise the Deputy that the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) is an independent agency with responsibility for determining the appropriate staffing levels in relation to the support of pupils with special educational needs in mainstream and special schools. The NCSE operates within my Department's policy in allocating this support.</p>
            <p eId="para_12331">Circular 0042/2011 provides information to schools regarding the staffing arrangements which apply in special schools in the current school year and for the 2012/13 school year.</p>
            <p eId="para_12332">The Circular sets out that, for the 2012/13 school year, schools will be staffed based on their pupil profiles and the disability category of the pupils enrolled as opposed to being based principally on school designation. It is intended that staffing levels will reflect the complexity of need that exists within schools rather than being determined solely by a school's designation, as many Special Schools now enrol students from disability categories other than from those provided for by their school designations.</p>
            <p eId="para_12333">The NCSE will, in future, suppress posts in schools which have excess teaching posts in order to create a post in a school which does not have excess posts and which has growing pupil numbers. The NCSE has identified that the school in question had a surplus teaching post in accordance with the school's pupil profile and therefore suppressed a post in the school.</p>
            <p eId="para_12334">The NCSE has confirmed that the school has an appropriate level of teaching staff to cater for all of the children enrolled in the school from September.</p>

            <p eId="para_12340">My Department is making a significant contribution in support of the prevention pillar of the National Drugs Strategy through funding projects in local drugs task force areas.</p>
            <p eId="para_12341">In the period 2007 to 2010, my Department provided funding for a significant number of projects in local drugs task force areas.  In the context of difficult fiscal circumstances, the global allocation available for these projects in 2010 was reduced by 32%, as compared to the allocation for 2009.</p>
            <p eId="para_12342">During 2010, my Department carried out a review of projects, a number of which overlapped significantly with projects in the Youth Work area funded by the then Office of the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs and also with the School Completion Programme funded by this Department's Social Inclusion Unit. The review, therefore, focused on whether the projects could more appropriately and more efficiently be funded through these funding streams. Following the review, 21 projects, by agreement and with appropriate funding, transferred to the then Office of the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, from January 2011. Also, two projects, with funding, merged with the School Completion Programme which, during 2011, became the responsibility of the new Department of Children and Youth Affairs. Five projects continue to receive allocations from my Department.</p>
            <p eId="para_12343">Having regard to the above explanation, my Department's expenditure for projects in the years 2007 to 2011 is as follows:</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_12344">2007 — €3,621,000,</p>

            <p eId="para_12351">The Deputy may be aware that an Anti-Bullying Forum was held on Thursday 17th May bringing together a range of experts, support groups and representatives of the schools sector including parents and students.</p>
            <p eId="para_12352">I was very pleased to open this important Forum and to provide an opportunity to explore with all the relevant stakeholders how best to tackle bullying in schools and to consider what changes or updating of existing practices and procedures are required to achieve this having regard to what is feasible to implement in the current financial climate.</p>
            <p eId="para_12353">The range of speakers on the day of the Forum included contributions from my Department, Professor Mona O'Moore of the Anti-Bullying Centre, Trinity College, representatives of the National Anti-Bullying Coalition (NABC), and contributors from the school sector from the various perspectives of school principal, parent and pupil. The Forum also gave other stakeholders an opportunity to give their views.</p>
            <p eId="para_12354">The proceedings of the Forum were broadcast live over the internet and recordings of the day's events can be now viewed by accessing the Anti-Bullying Forum webpage of my Department's website <i>www.education.ie</i>. The presentations of the various speakers can also be viewed and downloaded from this page.</p>
            <p eId="para_12355">As a follow on to holding the Forum itself, I invited the stakeholders and any other interested parties, including those unable to attend the event on the day, to submit their views on this important topic to my Department by 29th June 2012. I understand that the individual concerned has made a submission as have many other interested parties.  The Deputy will be aware that Social Personal and Health Education (SPHE) is a mandatory part of the curriculum in primary schools and in junior cycle since 2003. SPHE provides particular opportunities to foster the personal development, health and well-being of the child and to help him/her to create and maintain supportive relationships and become an active and responsible citizen in society.  SPHE aims to foster self-worth and self-confidence and places a particular emphasis on developing a sense of personal responsibility for one's own behaviour and actions.  The Deputy will also be aware that I recently established a working group to address the issue of tackling bullying in schools.  During the course of its work, the working group will be considering the outcomes from the Forum together with the submissions from stakeholders and other interested parties. This includes the submission received from the individual referred to by the Deputy.</p>

         asked the 
        <b>Minister for Education and Skills</b>
         if his attention has been drawn to recent reports that a university intends to provide loans to students parents in an arrangement with a bank; if he has any oversight in relation to this arrangement to ensure that students are protected from incurring long-term debt and interest; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

            <p eId="para_12359">I understand that this refers to a loan scheme arrangement agreed between the university and a bank in respect of the cost of the student contribution charge.</p>
            <p eId="para_12360">As the Deputy will be aware a new student contribution charge of €2,000 was introduced in higher education by the previous Government with effect from the 2011/2012 academic year. This charge replaced the previous student services charge and applies to all students who currently benefit under the "free fees" scheme. The charge is due to increase to €2,250 for the next academic year.</p>
            <p eId="para_12361">The Higher Education Authority (HEA) has written to higher education institutions requesting that they show flexibility and consideration to students awaiting a decision on their grant application and/or payment of grants for the current academic year.  At my Department's request the HEA have recently sent a reminder to institutions again requesting that flexibility be shown to students for the next academic year and to request that students be allowed pay the charge in two instalments if required.</p>
            <p eId="para_12362">The Higher Education institutions are autonomous institutions and my Department does not have any function in their day to day operational affairs, for which the Governing Bodies and the management staff of the institutions are responsible. The loan arrangements entered into is a matter for the university concerned and accordingly I do not have a role in this matter.</p>
            <p eId="para_12363">It should be noted that the charge is paid by the Exchequer in respect of students who qualify under my Department's student grant scheme. Tax relief is also available for second and subsequent siblings to help alleviate the cost for families.</p>

            <p eId="para_12365">This Government is committed to supporting the overall thrust of the 20 Year Strategy for the Irish Language 2010-2030, and to the delivery of the goals and targets proposed. As part of this, a thorough reform of the Irish curriculum and the way Irish is taught at primary and second level will be undertaken.</p>
            <p eId="para_12366">A revised Leaving Certificate curriculum in Irish began in all schools in September 2010 for first examination this June, 2012. The revised programme provides for an increase in the proportion of marks available for oral assessment to 40%, and is aimed at promoting a significant shift in emphasis towards Irish as a spoken language, where students can communicate and interact in a spontaneous way, and where Irish is spoken every day in schools. This revised programme should place greater emphasis and provide rewards to students who acquire proficiency in conversation skills.</p>
            <p eId="para_12367">The National Council for Curriculum and Assessment has been asked to review this syllabus in the light of the experiences of students in the first examination which happened this June.</p>
            <p eId="para_12368">The review of the Junior Cycle will allow not only full subjects but also short courses. Some of these short courses could be in different aspects of Irish, if a school made such a choice.</p>

            <p eId="para_12512">Ireland is committed under the EU-IMF programme to reducing the overall size of the public service. This is also a key element of the Programme for Government. Delivering this reduction will require continued implementation of the moratorium on recruitment with exceptions being limited to only essential posts and the utilisation of redeployment as the primary mechanism to fill posts which have been approved.

            <p eId="para_12516">Ministers and Ministers of State are entitled to the same allowances as Members of the Oireachtas with some exceptions.</p>
            <p eId="para_12517">As the Deputy will be aware, the legislation providing for Oireachtas expense allowances is exempt from taxation under section 836 of the Taxes Consolidation Act which was inserted into the Act by section 3(7) of the Oireachtas (Allowances to Members) and Ministerial and Parliamentary Offices Act 2009.</p>

            <p eId="para_12521">Ministers including Ministers of State may appoint two civilian drivers the salaries for whom are paid by the Minister's respective Department.</p>
            <p eId="para_12522">Ministers do not receive overnight payments while in Dublin. Ministers on official overnight business away from their home or headquarters may claim the vouched cost of a hotel room including tax and up to 15% in respect of any service charge. They may also claim an overnight subsistence allowance of €72.66.</p>
            <p eId="para_12523">Taxation is a matter for the Revenue Commissioners in the first instance however, I understand that where office holders and employees necessarily incur expenses of travel and subsistence relating to that travel in the performance of the duties of their office or employment, the reimbursement of such expenses may, in certain circumstances be made tax-free.</p>
            <p eId="para_12524">Where a Minister participates in a visit abroad an allowance of up to a maximum limit of €190.46 may be claimed to cover additional costs that may arise such as, for example, the purchase of a gift for the Minister's counterpart.</p>
            <p eId="para_12525">There are limits on what may be spent on official entertainment by Ministers and other civil servants. For Ministers the limit per person is €64 for dinner, €51 for lunch and €13 for a reception. These figures have not been amended since 2000.</p>
            <p eId="para_12526">I can confirm to the Deputy that apart from Oireachtas expenses which are provided to all Members the only expenses I have claimed for the period specified is mileage of €13,964.02.</p>

            <p eId="para_12536">In 2011, under a public consultation process, the OPW published on the national website for the Catchment Flood Risk Assessment and Management (CFRAM) Programme, <i>www.cfram.ie</i>, a national catalogue of draft maps as part of the Preliminary Flood Risk Assessment (PFRA). The publication of the PFRA maps is provided for in the 2010 Assessment and Management of Flood Risk Regulations (SI 122/2010). These maps form the first stage of the CFRAM Programme, which is designed to assess and map the country’s river systems to identify areas at risk of significant flooding.</p>
            <p eId="para_12537">The objective of the PFRA is to designate areas for further assessment (AFAs), where more detailed assessment on the extent and degree of flood risk is applied under the CFRAM Studies.</p>
            <p eId="para_12538">Swinford, Co. Mayo was indicated on the draft PFRA maps as a Probable Area for Further Assessment and, following completion of the PFRA in March 2012, Swinford has been included in the designated list of AFAs as part of the Western CFRAM Study.</p>
            <p eId="para_12539">As with the Historic Flood Hazard Mapping, the scale of the PFRA maps is only to a level of detail at townland or conurbation scale and is not accurate and does not apply at the individual property level.</p>
            <p eId="para_12540">At a recent meeting with the Irish Insurance Federation (IIF), the OPW indicated to that body that any use of the PFRA maps by insurance companies to assess and decide on flood risk at the level of individual properties was inappropriate. The OPW will be writing to the IIF shortly to affirm this point and to forward a copy of guidelines issued to local authorities on the use of the PFRA maps and seeking assurances from the industry that the practice will cease.</p>

        <b> Deputy Sean Fleming</b>
         asked the 
        <b>Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform</b>
         if he will investigate a protocol across the public service whereby when retired employees return to the public service as agency staff they are asked on a voluntary basis to take an abatement of their public service pension entitlement in a manner equivalent to the amount that would be applied if they were re-hired directly; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

            <p eId="para_12542">Agency staff are employed from time to time in the public sector to meet particular service needs.</p>
            <p eId="para_12543">In general, the agency will be retained on a specific contract by the public service body to carry out the tasks required.  In the light of that contract, the staff involved will be recruited and paid by the agency in the normal way.  In short, the staff are legally employees of that company rather than the public service body itself.</p>
            <p eId="para_12544">In some cases, these agency staff may be in receipt of a public service pension arising from previous employment either in that particular body or elsewhere in the public service.  However, as the employment relationship is between the agency and the individual employee rather between the individual and the public service body itself, there is no means of identifying employees in receipt of a public service pension and of applying the standard public service abatement rules.  As the use of agency staff by the public service is most common in the health system, I have asked my Department to raise the issue with the Department of Health and to request that an examination be carried out by that Department of how it might be dealt with in the light of the employment relationship I have outlined above. I agree with the principle involved in the Deputy's proposal.</p>

            <p eId="para_12587">I propose to take Questions Nos. 210 to 212, inclusive, together.</p>
            <p eId="para_12588">The Catchment Flood Risk Assessment and Management Studies (CFRAMs) are now underway with engineering consultancy firms appointed to undertake the studies in six catchment areas covering the whole country. The Eastern CFRAM, which covers Dublin City, is currently being progressed by the consultants.  The study will examine the following areas within the jurisdiction of Dublin City Council:</p>
            <p eId="para_12589">(1) Areas that flood from the following rivers:  Liffey; Camac; Poddle; Santry; Lower reach of Nanekin; Lower reach of Elm Park Stream; Furry Glen stream and the Zoo Stream.</p>
            <p eId="para_12590">(2)  Areas that flood from the coastline, including the Liffey Estuary and Dublin Bay. In addition to the above areas in Dublin City, the following areas will also be examined:  Clontarf; Lucan to Chapelizod; Raheny and Santry.  The study will also review the outputs of the Dodder and Tolka CFRAM studies which also cover parts of Dublin City Council's area.</p>
            <p eId="para_12591">To date in 2012, one funding application has been received from Dublin City Council under the Office of Public Work's (OPW) Minor Flood Mitigation Works Scheme.  The application sought funding of €225,000 to undertake works to alleviate flooding from the Camac River at Lady Lane, Carrickfoyle Terrace and Millbrook Terrace.  Following an assessment of the application, the funding sought was approved in May, 2012. The progression of the works is a matter for the Council.</p>
            <p eId="para_12592">In relation to the difficulties some people may be experiencing in obtaining insurance cover for flood risk, I and officials in the OPW have had discussions on this with the Irish Insurance Federation (IIF) and some of the larger insurance companies.   The focus of the discussions to date has been on agreeing a general format for providing information on flood defence works rather than looking at specific areas.</p>
            <p eId="para_12593">The industry has indicated to me that the incidence of households or businesses being refused cover or being charged excessive premiums is marginal and that where it arises the causes are complex with each case being assessed in light of the particular circumstances applying. The OPW and the IIF are keen to establish a sustainable means of sharing information on areas vulnerable to flooding and on identifying flood defence works carried out or funded by the OPW and the impact of those works in reducing the risk of flooding in areas where flooding previously occurred.  The OPW has provided some information to the IIF but work is ongoing to clarify a number of issues with a view to agreeing with the IIF a viable basis on which information can be provided.  There are complex technical issues involved concerning the design standards and risk levels of defence works and maintenance arrangements. My officials will continue to work with the IIF to finalise matters as soon as possible.</p>

            <p eId="para_12595">I am currently in the process of introducing a Microenterprise Loan Fund that will facilitate the growth and expansion of viable microenterprises from all industry sectors across the country, that have been refused access to credit from the banks. The Fund has a significant entrepreneurship focus to encourage all would-be entrepreneurs across the country who may be unemployed, but have the potential to generate employment for themselves and others.  It will form an important complementary element to funding supports provided by enterprise agencies or Local Area Partnerships, where credit is required for the sustainability of the project.  It will also add value to other Government schemes of support for entrepreneurs and unemployed persons, such as the Back to Work Allowance or the Seed Capital Scheme.</p>
            <p eId="para_12596">Support will be in the form of loans for up to €25,000, available to start-up, newly established, or growing microenterprises, with viable business propositions, that do not meet the conventional risk criteria applied by banks. The potential viability of the business proposal will be the dominant factor in all credit decisions.  The €10m allocation, supplemented by €15m borrowing from other sources in tranches of €5m over years 2, 3 and 4, of the life of the Fund will generate €40m in additional lending for microenterprises.  More detail on a variety of supports for companies is now available at <i>www.djei.ie</i>.</p>

            <p eId="para_12598">The Safety Health and Welfare at Work Act 2005 makes provision for the safety, health and welfare of persons at work, for the enforcement of the statutory provisions and the introduction of measures to encourage improvements in the safety and health of workers at work.  The Act imposes duties on employers, employees, and persons in control of places of work as well as general duties on designers, manufacturers, importers and suppliers or articles and substances. For any employer who undertakes work activity it is that employer's responsibility to ensure that they have a safety statement and risk assessment that addresses the relevant risks associated with their work.</p>
            <p eId="para_12599">Within the Act protective and preventative measures are identified. These are central to the proper management of health and safety to protect employees at their place of work. Section 19 of the Act requires every employer to identify the hazards in the place of work under his or her control, assess the risks presented by those hazards and to document this process in a written risk assessment. Under Section 20 of the Act every employer must prepare or cause to be prepared a Safety Statement based on the risk assessment carried out under Section 19 and specifying the manner in which the safety, health and welfare of  his or her employees is to be secured and managed. In relation to occupational health and safety, the legislation applies to all work enterprises and includes the self-employed.</p>
            <p eId="para_12600">Under the aforementioned 2005 Act, the Health and Safety Authority has a range of functions relating to occupational health and safety. In delivering its statutory mandate, the Authority has prioritised those sectors which are known to be the highest risk to employee safety and health. This risk based approach to its interventions is targeted to ensure that the standard of health and safety management is improved and appropriate controls implemented in these high risk sectors.   In addition, the Authority also prioritises serious occupational accidents for investigation, and all occupationally related complaints are addressed.</p>
            <p eId="para_12601">The relevant economic sector relating to the management of apartment complexes is that of ‘Real Estate' (NACE Code: L). An assessment of the accident and injury statistics for this economic sector as published in the Authority's "Summary of Workplace Injury, Illness and Fatality Statistics 2010-2011" indicated the following:</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_12602">The Real Estate Sector has the second lowest rate of injury resulting in any days lost, and the second lowest illness rate per 1,000 workers based on the most recent CSO figures (2010).</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_12603">There is a duty on employers to report workplace injury which results in an employee being unable to perform their normal work for more than three consecutive days. In 2011 the Authority received 6,956 such notifications, of these less than 0.1% related to the Real Estate Sector.</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_12604">An analysis of the fatal accident incidents from 2008-2011 shows that there were no fatalities recorded within this sector.</p>
            <p eId="para_12605">On this basis the work activity associated with the management of real estate cannot be assessed as high risk. In fact, the statistics would indicate that the sector is one of the lowest risk sectors and has not therefore been prioritised for proactive inspection within the Authority's programme of work.  However, the Authority also carries out "reactive" interventions based on accident notification or receipt of complaints. In 2011, the Authority received 37 such complaint contacts relating to employers involved in the management of real estate, all of which were addressed. In addressing these complaints the Authority had to engage with 24 employers through inspection or investigation. In this limited degree of interaction, 65% of employers had prepared a Safety Statement as required and 92% of the employers were aware of their duties under the legislation.</p>
            <p eId="para_12606">In conclusion, I should stress that it is for employers, employees and those in control of workplaces in the first instance to ensure that workplaces are safe and healthy for all workers. The Health and Safety Authority provides advice and assistance to all involved in workplace health and safety to help them meet their obligations. The Authority also undertakes investigations and enforcement actions where appropriate. If the Deputy has concerns regarding the health and safety aspect of any workplace, he or any constituent can make a complaint to the Authority's Workplace Contact Unit (tel: 1890 289 389, email: <i>wcu@hsa.ie</i>) and the Authority will examine the issues raised and determine the appropriateness of follow-up action.</p>

            <p eId="para_12608">Enterprise Ireland approved funding support in the form of repayable preference shares to the company in 2009, which was drawn down in 2010. The funding was provided as a contribution to the capital requirements of the company, to help it grow its business through increased exports as well as to sustain and create employment in Ireland. It was approved at a time when many viable Irish companies with robust business models were experiencing difficulties in accessing finance as a result of the economic environment. The support was approved following a comprehensive due diligence process, which included a detailed examination of the company's accounts and business plans at that time.</p>

            <p eId="para_12612">I propose to take Questions Nos. 216, 218 and 219 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_12613">The achievement of balanced regional growth continues to be a core objective of Government. Promoting entrepreneurship and facilitating the key infrastructural needs of Irish enterprise across all regions is vital to ensuring a vigorous pipeline of new business leaders, new business ideas and entrepreneurial activity.  Enterprise Ireland (EI) activity in Co. Kerry is focussed on the creation of new jobs through supporting entrepreneurs to set up new High Potential Start-Up Companies, on the retention and creation of new jobs in existing companies through support of company development plans, and in enhancing the innovation capability of Ireland at a national and regional level through support of research in companies and third level institutions.</p>
            <p eId="para_12614">There are 124 Enterprise Ireland client companies in Co. Kerry employing more than 3,000 people in full time jobs. The number of full time new jobs created in Enterprise Ireland client companies in Co Kerry 2011, exceeded jobs lost for the first time in the past decade.  This positive outcome in Co. Kerry in 2011 reflects the national picture, where employment in Irish exporting companies stabilised. In 2011, Enterprise Ireland paid almost €2.6m in financial support to its client companies in Co. Kerry.  Additionally, Enterprise Ireland has provided funding of over €2.2m, as well as other supports, for the development of incubation facilities at the Institute of Technology, Tralee. <i> </i>The Tom Crean Business Centre<i> </i>also<i> </i>  provides incubation space for Enterprise Ireland clients in the start-up phase of their business. Enterprise Ireland co-funded the support of a Development Manager for the Centre for two years.</p>
            <p eId="para_12615">The agency is also supporting the Institute of Technology and the Tom Crean Centre in the delivery of the<b><i>“New Frontiers”</i></b>   Programme, which is currently underway in the Institute of Technology, Tralee with nine local companies participating on the Programme. This programme provides companies with a package of supports to help accelerate their business development and to equip them with the skills and contacts that are needed to successfully start and grow an export driven company.  Enterprise Ireland has also approved funding totalling more than €1.7m towards the construction and development of several Community Enterprise Centres in Co. Kerry over the past number of years, including Killarney Technology Innovation Centre, Iveragh Coop Farmers Mart Society Ltd, and Kenmare Mart Enterprise Coop Society Ltd.  The figures in respect of jobs created in Enterprise Ireland client companies in Co. Kerry from 2008-2011 are set out in the table accompanying this reply. As the figures are compiled on an annualised basis, the figures for 2012 will be available in the early part of 2013.</p>

            <p eId="para_12629">I propose to take Questions Nos. 217, 220 and 221 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_12630">The Forfás Annual Employment Survey reports on job gains and losses in companies that are supported by the enterprise development agencies.  Data is compiled on an annualised basis.</p>
            <p eId="para_12631">The survey shows that in the four year period 2008 to 2011 a total of 332 jobs were created in IDA Ireland's client companies in County Kerry.  The number of jobs created in each of these years is shown in the attached tabular statement.  While corresponding data for 2012 will not be available until the end of the year, IDA Ireland has informed me that it currently has 12 client companies in County Kerry who employ almost 1,500 people.</p>
            <p eId="para_12632">One of the high level goals of IDA Ireland's Strategy document "<i>Horizon 2020</i>” is that, in the period 2010 to 2014, 50% of investments will be located in areas outside of Dublin and Cork.  The Strategy also highlights that IDA Ireland will work with its existing client companies to transform the existing foreign direct investment (FDI) base in order to develop, retain and grow employment in these companies.  There is intense and continual international competition to win FDI.  One of the challenges that IDA encounters in encouraging investment into regional locations is the desire of investors to locate in areas with large population bases, typically in excess of 1 million people.  Ireland has one such Metro Region, the Greater Dublin area.  In order to achieve balanced regional development IDA Ireland focuses on promoting Gateway locations within each Region as the areas of critical mass (population/skill base/infrastructure/utilities/business services etc.) and highlights the opportunities provided by Hub locations which are within commuting distances of these Gateways.  There are 7 Gateway locations outside of Dublin and Cork.</p>
            <p eId="para_12633">With regard to Co Kerry, IDA Ireland has explained that it markets the linked hub locations of Killarney in South Kerry and Tralee in North Kerry for new inward investment.  In addition, the agency promotes other locations as part of its marketing efforts in response to specific client requirements.  Whilst IDA Ireland seeks to influence the selection of a location, the final decision on where to locate is taken in all cases by the investor.</p>

These client companies exported goods and services to the value of almost €50 billion in 2010, representing 30% of national exports. The tabular statement, which is taken from the most recent Forfás Employment Survey, provides a breakdown of these jobs on a county basis. It is important to note that these figures, which are the only ones I have available on a county basis, relate only to agency-supported companies. Naturally other ICT companies and jobs may be located in these counties.</p>
            <p eId="para_12647">While the ICT sector was adversely affected by a number of high profile companies downsizing in the area of PC manufacturing over the past decade, the sector that we have today in Ireland is one based on advanced manufacturing in areas such as microelectronics, semiconductors and telecommunications equipment and devices. Indeed, ten of the top ICT companies in the world have substantial operations here.</p>
            <p eId="para_12648">The Government's Action Plan for Jobs has identified the ICT sector as having potential for further significant growth in job creation. The Action Plan acknowledges that, for Ireland to achieve its potential, its labour force must be appropriately skilled and our education system must remain responsive to the needs of the ICT sector as a whole. It calls for action to address the range of high level ICT skills recruitment difficulties identified in 2011 by Forfás through the work of the Expert Group on Future Skills.  The findings of this study and the resulting action plans are documented in the Joint Government-Industry ICT Action Plan, which the Minister for Education and Skills and I launched in January this year.  The Plan outlines a range of short, medium and long term measures to develop a sustainable domestic supply of high quality ICT graduates to support the further expansion and development of the ICT sector and support innovation and growth across other sectors of the economy.As part of the Plan, 750 places have been made available on new Higher Diploma Level 8 Conversion ICT Programmes which began rolling out in higher education institutions across the country from last March. Access is free of charge to participants who will obtain a level 8 Higher Diploma. Graduates of these programmes will be available for recruitment in early 2013. In addition, 530 people with a qualification at level 8 or Masters level in ICT are now due to graduate from the first phase of Springboard. A further 2,200 places on ICT programmes from certificate to Masters degree level are now open for applications as part of Springboard 2012.</p>
            <p eId="para_12649">The Action Plan for Jobs identifies a number of other challenges that must be addressed in order for Ireland to realise the potential for future growth in the ICT sector:</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_12650">Maintaining cost competitiveness in the midst of intensifying competition globally, especially in manufacturing, <i>vis-à-vis</i> low cost economies where more mature sectoral activities continue to be outsourced.</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_12651">The need to ensure ongoing availability of competitively priced high speed broadband networks.</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_12652">The limited scope for software SME's to engage in public procurement initiatives from which strong reference clients and partnerships can emerge.</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_12653">Supporting and fostering digital innovations and the emergence of digital start up companies.</p>
            <p eId="para_12654">The Action Plan identifies a range of actions to be taken in 2012 by my Department and its agencies; the Department of Education and Skills and its agencies; the Department of An Taoiseach; and, the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources to address these challenges. Implementation of these actions is ongoing and is being monitored on a quarterly basis.</p>

            <p eId="para_13815">The total of funds allocated by Enterprise Ireland (EI) in 2011 was €336m. Direct funding for enterprise development totalled €197m, with an additional €55m either administered on behalf of third parties, or disbursements to other state agencies. The net cost of operating the agency (i.e. the costs associated with providing services to client companies, and the administration of the organisation) was €84m in 2011 (this was a reduction of 6% over 2010).</p>
            <p eId="para_13816">Net operating costs relate to the pay and non-pay costs of the agency (see table 1 below), including the expenditure relevant to operating a client support network (effectively the business development executives which work with companies to assist them to grow sales and employment), a network of regional offices for service delivery, overseas offices which seek to promote internationalisation of Irish enterprises, and science and innovation support. Of the net operating costs, corporate services support (i.e. the costs associated with administration of the Agency) totalled €9.8m in 2011 (a reduction of 16% over 2010).</p>
            <p eId="para_13817">In relation to its regional, overseas, science and innovation and client development networks, Enterprise Ireland utilises skilled personnel with extensive expertise relevant to a range of areas including markets, sectors, technologies, business functions, and commercial assessment (often with industry specific experience). Enterprise Ireland, through the provision of a range of programmes and services, is aggressively supporting and incentivising companies to invest more, employ more, and know more in the context of winning sales overseas.</p>
            <p eId="para_13818">EI receives budgetary funding from the Exchequer reflecting national priorities in the support of industry and the development of the knowledge economy. Value for Money (VFM) and generating economic return are key principles in the work of the Agency, necessarily supported by effective targeting and performance monitoring.  Enterprise Ireland actively works with viable companies to help them to both sustain and create jobs.  A total of more than 141,000 people were employed in EI client companies at the end of 2011. Enterprise Ireland's Annual Report and Accounts 2011, which was published on 27th   June, highlighted that EI client companies achieved record levels of exports of €15.2bn in 2011. This exceeds the pre-recession record levels of 2008 and is the highest ever annual export gain achieved by Enterprise Ireland client companies.</p>

            <p eId="para_13848">The Action Plan for Jobs included a list of actions to be pursued for the Manufacturing sector.  One of the key actions was that a Manufacturing Development Forum<i/>  be established to assist the Government in identifying the needs of manufacturing enterprises and to progress a transformation agenda.  To this end I recently established a Manufacturing Development Forum whose membership comprises key industry players to help drive this process.<i/>There are also representatives from Enterprise Ireland, IDA Ireland and Forfás.

          <speech by="#RichardBruton" as="#Minister_for_Jobs,_Enterprise_and_Innovation" eId="spk_776">
            <from>Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation (Deputy Richard Bruton)</from>
            <p eId="para_13851">On 22 June Forfás published a study, <i>Key Skills for Enterprise to Trade Internationally</i>, which sets out the skills and talent needed to drive Ireland’s trade and export performance in both existing and emerging overseas markets. The study provides a detailed blueprint for adjustments to our education, training and professional development to align skills with the needs of exporting businesses. The report makes a range of specific recommendations to ensure that our education, training and professional development meets the needs of our exporting companies. It recommends boosting the supply of foreign language skills (both numbers and proficiency) at third level including German, French, Spanish and Italian as well as Mandarin Chinese, Russian and Arabic. It also highlights the need to increase formal international sales training at third level, including compulsory modules on international sales in business courses and the introduction of a degree and post-graduate diploma in international sales with foreign languages.</p>
            <p eId="para_13852">The study has identified 2,200 potential job opportunities arising within exporting companies which could be filled through tailored skills conversion courses, developed in partnership with industry — in the areas of ICT computing, customer sales and service support with foreign languages.  The Government's Action Plan for Jobs has identified the ICT sector as having potential for further significant growth in job creation. The Action Plan acknowledges that, for Ireland to achieve its potential, its labour force must be appropriately skilled and our education system must remain responsive to the needs of the ICT sector as a whole. It calls for action to address the range of high level ICT skills recruitment difficulties identified in 2011 by Forfás through the work of the Expert Group on Future Skills.</p>
            <p eId="para_13853">The findings of this study and the resulting action plans are documented in the Joint Government-Industry ICT Action Plan, which the Minister for Education and Skills and I launched in January this year.  The Plan outlines a range of short, medium and long term measures to develop a sustainable domestic supply of high quality ICT graduates to support the further expansion and development of the ICT sector and support innovation and growth across other sectors of the economy.  As part of the ICT Action Plan, 750 places have been made available on new Higher Diploma Level 8 Conversion ICT Programmes which began rolling out in higher education institutions across the country from last March. Access is free of charge to participants who will obtain a level 8 Higher Diploma. Graduates of these programmes will be available for recruitment in early 2013. In addition, 530 people with a qualification at level 8 or Masters level in ICT are now due to graduate from the first phase of Springboard. A further 2,200 places on ICT programmes from certificate to Masters degree level are now open for applications as part of Springboard 2012.</p>
            <p eId="para_13854">I understand from my colleague, the Minister for Education and Skills, that a number of other initiatives are being taken across the education sector to ensure that vacancies in the ICT sector can be filled by appropriately qualified personnel.  The Masters in Applied Software Technology (MAST), which is delivered by ICT Ireland Skillnet, aims to equip unemployed computing graduates and those from an engineering background with high-level skills in a sector which continues to experience difficulty filling vacancies. Delivery is by means of blended learning, mixing academic input from DIT, interspersed with in-company placements throughout the academic year.  The Masters level course commenced for the first time last September and is due to finish this August. I understand that the programme has been described as being a great success and due to the significant input of employers to the course and its work placement elements, a high job achievement rate following successful completion of the course is expected.</p>
            <p eId="para_13855">I am informed that FÁS plans to deliver up to 75,000 training places in 2012. To underpin its new training strategy, FÁS has reclassified and regrouped its existing course category framework into a career-themed approach to training (career training clusters), which will evolve on an on-going basis as new skills and occupations emerge. As part of that process, the current ‘computer applications' course category and the ‘computer hardware/networks/programming' category will be merged into the IT training cluster.  Under the Labour Market Education and Training Fund, which will be managed by FÁS and will provide up to 6,500 targeted training places, funding will be utilised to provide training and education solutions to the needs of both unemployed individuals and employers within the context of four themes, targeted at sectors where vacancies are likely to arise. One of these themes relates specifically to the IT Sector.</p>
            <p eId="para_13856">Furthermore, Skillnets, which is an enterprise-led body funded through the National Training Fund to provide companies with new opportunities to develop relevant, effective answers to their training and development needs, was set ambitious targets for 2011 to train 40,000 persons, of whom up to 8,000 were unemployed. Similar targets to 2011 have been set for 2012 which will target the long term unemployed.  In addition to all of the above it is important to point out that Irish employers also have access to the EU and EEA labour force in accordance with EU law on freedom of movement of labour.  Ireland remains a very successful centre for ICT operations with almost 97,000 people employed in ICT firms in Ireland.  In addition to the meeting the challenge posed by the high level of vacancies in the ICT sector, the Action Plan for Jobs identifies a number of other challenges that must be addressed in order for Ireland to realise the potential for future growth in the ICT sector.  Specific actions are outlined in the Plan, for implementation in 2012, to ensure that these challenges are addressed.</p>

            <p eId="para_13858">Ministers and Ministers of State are entitled to the same allowances as Members of the Oireachtas with the some exceptions. No additional untaxed allowances are paid to either of the Ministers of State or myself by my Department in respect of our official duties.As the Deputy will be aware, Oireachtas expense allowances are exempt from taxation under section 836 of the Taxes Consolidation Act (which was inserted into this Act by section 3(7) of the Oireachtas (Allowances to Members) and Ministerial and Parliamentary Offices Act 2009).</p>
            <p eId="para_13859">Ministers and Ministers of State do not receive the Travel and Accommodation Allowance provided to Members of the Oireachtas. However, Ministers and Ministers of State outside the Dublin area who maintain second homes because of their official duties can claim an income tax deduction in respect of maintaining that second home as well as the annual mortgage repayment.  The availability of this allowance is determined by the Revenue Commissioners.  Ministers are entitled to claim travel expenses for official business in line with guidelines set down by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform. The amounts paid by my Department in respect of such expenses from 9th March 2011 to date are set out in the table below.</p>

            <from>Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation (Deputy Richard Bruton)</from>
            <p eId="para_13880">Ireland remains a very open and welcoming country for non-Irish nationals in our Labour Force. Quarter 1 2012 labour market statistics show there are 274,000 non-Irish nationals in our labour force of just over 2 million.  Ireland remains a very attractive location for Foreign Direct Investment. Favourable demographics and consistent investment in education ensure a plentiful supply of highly qualified workers with excellent technical, language and customer services capabilities, as well as a reputation for flexibility and innovation.  In addition, Irish employers have access to the EU and EEA labour force in accordance with EU law on freedom of movement or Accession Treaties.</p>
            <p eId="para_13881">While there are currently no Government plans to introduce a special technology visa it is current Government policy to issue new employment permits in respect of jobs requiring key skills and where there is a recognised scarcity of suitably skilled workers. With regard to the specific issue of employment permits for specified highly skilled and strategically important occupations, where a skills shortage exists, Green Card employment permits may be issued. ICT professionals, professional engineers and technologists are specifically catered for under this scheme. The criteria required to meet the conditions of green cards are less than for other employment schemes.  The Department also operates an Intra-Company Transfer (ICT) scheme. This scheme is designed to facilitate the transfer of senior management, key personnel or trainees who are foreign nationals from an overseas branch of a multinational corporation to its Irish branch.</p>
            <p eId="para_13882">I should add that the Government is also guided by the Expert Group for Future Skills Needs and keeps its permit policy under review and can adapt to changing circumstances. The research undertaken by the Group, the Secretariat to which is provided by Forfás, indicates that the global ICT market is expected to grow by 5% between 2009 and 2014/15 with potential growth rate as high as 20% per annum over the next decade. In order to exploit these opportunities, however, it is crucial to ensure that Ireland's labour force is appropriately skilled. In this context the Group's report found that there are a range of skills and recruitment difficulties within the ICT sector with the result that, as at December 2011, there were approximately 1,800 vacancies in the sector. These vacancies arose mainly due to the lack of graduates with high-level ICT Honours Degrees and above which are required to fill such positions as Computer Software Engineers, ICT Network Specialists and Engineers, ICT Security Experts, ICT Telecommunications, ICT Project Managers and IT Sales and Marketing / Foreign Languages Skills Personnel. The report points out that this challenge is not unique to Ireland as such high level ICT skills are also in short supply globally.</p>
            <p eId="para_13883">In order to address these challenges from domestic sources I, along with my colleague, Deputy Ruairi Quinn, T.D., Minister for Education and Skills, subsequently launched the ICT Action Plan: Meeting the High Level ICT Skills Needs of Enterprise in Ireland. The Action Plan establishes an overreaching target of doubling the annual output from honours degree ICT undergraduate programmes to 2,000 graduates by 2018 and outlines a number of actions that will be implemented to ensure an increased output of appropriately skilled graduates in the medium term 2015-2018.</p>
            <p eId="para_13884">With regard to the points raised by the Deputy regarding research and development Ireland currently operates a scheme for admission of Third Country Researchers to Ireland. This arises from Ireland's implementation of Council Directive 2005/71/EC which was jointly transposed by the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation and the Department of Justice Equality and Law Reform in October, 2007.  The purpose of the Council Directive is to facilitate the admission of third country researchers to EU Member States for the purpose of carrying out research.   The mobility of researchers is one of the elements of the Europe 2020 Strategy and implementation of the European Research Area.  Ireland's ability to attract high quality researchers is a key element of our strategy for Science Technology and Innovation.</p>
            <p eId="para_13885">The Irish Universities Association's (IUA) — EURAXESS office manages the day to day administration of the scheme that enables the fast tracking of non-EU researchers and their families to Ireland.  The scheme has been very successful since it first commenced operation with, to date, over 1100 Hosting Agreements issued in respect of foreign researchers wishing to come to Ireland. Over 30 research organisations have so far been accredited by the Department with 60 countries currently being represented. These include the Irish universities, Institutes of Technology, other research institutions, and a number of private sector companies.</p>
            <p eId="para_13886">Science Foundation Ireland (SFI) includes among its portfolio of programmes a number of internationally focused programmes targeted at attracting top-class researchers to Ireland. This   investment helps Ireland to develop a scientific research base that is internationally recognised for its standards of excellence.  In addition, the Department of Justice has been open to accept applications under the Immigrant Investor Programme and the Start-up Entrepreneur Programme since 16 April of this year.  My officials in Enterprise Ireland provide assistance in relation to this scheme.</p>

            <p eId="para_13888">Turkey is a significant market for Irish goods and services. Merchandise exports to Turkey have been developing strongly in recent years and in 2011 were worth over €457 million. In 2010 our services exports increased by 23% over the previous year and were worth €374 million.   Trade Missions are a key instrument to promote growing trade opportunities in Turkey. In March of this year, Minister Costello led a delegation of 25 Enterprise Ireland companies to Istanbul and Ankara. Companies participating in this mission were drawn from sectors with particular growth potential in Turkey, in particular, ICT and telecoms, engineering, energy, financial services and life sciences. The trade mission also involved an intensive schedule of meetings with leaders of both public and private sector organisations, sectors that offer rich opportunities for Irish companies.</p>
            <p eId="para_13889">On a day to day basis, Enterprise Ireland actively supports Irish companies with a range of initiatives to build market awareness and accelerate sales growth into Turkey. The agency brokers relationships between Irish companies and key contacts in Turkey, and supports and encourages companies to recognise that market as an increasingly important destination for exports. In addition, Enterprise Ireland has built up an extensive network of local contacts and has developed a team of highly experienced pathfinders who work with their clients on a one to one basis to give specialised and company specific advice to individual exporters.</p>

            <p eId="para_13891">Job creation is at the top of the Government's agenda.  The Action Plan for Jobs outlines the Government's plan to rebuild the economy and create jobs. The Enterprise Development agencies will be at the forefront of implementing the Action Plan for Jobs and will ensure that local enterprises can maximise their contribution to economic and jobs growth.  In 2011, Enterprise Ireland paid over €5.4m in financial support to its client companies in South County Dublin and there were 12,641 people in full time employment in those companies.  The New Frontiers programme, which focuses on developing a person's entrepreneurial abilities and is co-ordinated by Enterprise Ireland, is providing €4.25 million in funding to enable the Institutes of Technology, including Tallaght IT, to deliver the programme at a local level. So far this year, 23 people participated in Phase 1 of New Frontiers at Tallaght IT and 15 applicants have recently been offered a place on Phase 2, which is due to commence on 18th   July next.  A new Community Enterprise Centre Development Programme was launched this year for the maintenance or establishment of a strong business development function in the Community Enterprise Centres that are funded by Enterprise Ireland.  Three Community Enterprise Centres in the Tallaght Area were successful in securing this funding in 2012.  These were Partas, Brookfield Enterprise Centre and Partas, Killinarden Enterprise Centre, both in Tallaght and Action Community and Enterprise, Bawnogue Enterprise Centre in Clondalkin.  Action Community and Enterprise also received support for the refurbishment and expansion of Neilstown Enterprise Centre, under the Community Enterprise Centre Scheme 2007/09.</p>
            <p eId="para_13892">The South Dublin County Enterprise Board provides support for small businesses with 10 employees or fewer in the start-up and expansion phases, to develop indigenous micro-enterprise potential and to stimulate economic activity and entrepreneurship at local level.  In 2011 the Board paid out €357,682 in grant assistance to 38 microenterprise projects in the county.  This year, the Board will continue to be actively involved in economic development in the area and will ensure that available funds are targeted to maximise entrepreneurial development.</p>
            <p eId="para_13893">Tallaght benefits from being part of Ireland's only Metro City Region and is well equipped to compete for potential foreign direct investment, with superb infrastructure facilities at City West and Grange Castle.  Announcements in 2012 include Xilinx and SAP in Citywest, Microsoft in Grange Castle, and Digital Realty Trust in Profile Park, Dublin.</p>
            <p eId="para_13894">I am confident that the measures outlined in the Action Plan for Jobs, together with the initiatives being pursued by the State Agencies will ensure the creation of employment opportunities for the Tallaght area.</p>

            <p eId="para_13896">I am aware of the concerns raised in the correspondence to the Deputy that transferring responsibility for the payment of employees' sick pay to employers will add to the cost of doing business.  I have received similar views from a number of Chambers of Commerce and individual business people on the matter.</p>
            <p eId="para_13897">The Government is concerned about the extent of dependence on State-funded sickness benefit schemes and we need to examine ways in which to reduce this.  The Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Joan Burton, who has policy responsibility for the sick pay scheme, held a consultative meeting earlier this year to discuss potential changes to the scheme in Ireland.   However, no decision has yet been taken on the matter.</p>
            <p eId="para_13898">Proposals for a statutory sick pay scheme would impact on competitiveness and employment.  The evidence of this impact will need to be weighed against the potential for savings in terms of reduced absence due to sickness.  I will therefore carefully scrutinise any proposals which develop from this consultation phase and their impact on jobs and competitiveness, and I will contribute fully to the Budgetary process within Government.</p>
            <p eId="para_13899">In the meantime, I am actively addressing a number of the specific cost issues outlined in the correspondence to the Deputy.  For example, the system of Employment Regulation Orders and Registered Employment Agreements — including the removal of the Sunday premia payments from the scope of EROs — is being reformed through the Industrial Relations (Amendment) (No. 3) Bill which is being progressed through the Oireachtas.  Upon enactment, the Bill will radically overhaul the system to make it fairer and more responsive to changing economic circumstances and labour market conditions.</p>
            <p eId="para_13900">Costs of professional services are being addressed through the Legal Services Bill and through actions to encourage professionals to supply price quotations to businesses in advance of providing services.  I have also been examining the potential for Government Departments and agencies to reduce or freeze their charges to business.  A number of Departments and agencies have agreed to reduce or freeze a range of charges arising from this exercise.  A range of additional measures are being taken across Government through the Action Plan for Jobs to improve the operating environment for business.</p>

            <p eId="para_13902">Employment Permit structures and procedures have been designed and maintained to  protect the Irish labour market while ensuring that key specific skills are available that will enable the Irish economy to expand and develop. Within this context Ireland still remains a very open and welcoming country for non-Irish nationals in our Labour Force. Quarter 1 2012 labour market statistics show there are 274,000 non-Irish nationals in our labour force of just over 2 million.  Favourable demographics and consistent investment in education ensure a plentiful supply of highly qualified workers with excellent technical, language and customer services capabilities, as well as a reputation for flexibility and innovation.  In addition, Irish employers have access to the EU and EEA labour force.</p>
            <p eId="para_13903">Under the terms of the Employment Permits Acts 2003 and 2006 all non EEA nationals seeking employment, including South African nationals, are required to hold a valid employment permit. In this regard 34 permits have issued to South African nationals in 2012. 201 such permits issued in 2010 and122 issued in 2011.</p>
            <p eId="para_13904">It is current Government policy to issue new employment permits only in respect of the following criteria:</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_13905">highly skilled, highly paid positions or;</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_13906">non-EEA nationals who are already legally resident in the State on valid employment permits or;</p>

            <p eId="para_13908">Furthermore permits are issued in respect of employment where it is established that a minimum salary of €30,000 per annum is on offer, based on a 39 hour week.

            <p eId="para_13939">The rate at which the County and City Enterprise Boards (CEBs) can provide feasibility grants to micro-enterprises is determined in the first instance by the location of the business entity i.e. whether the applicant is in the BMW region (60% rate applies) or the S&amp;E region (50% rate applies). The different rates that apply between the two regions have been set down by the European Commission under the respective co-funded Operational Programmes for the period 2007-2013.</p>
            <p eId="para_13940">In relation to FDI a different funding or grant aid regime applies. The grant limits are determined by the European Commission Regional Guidelines 2007 to 2013.  The Guidelines govern the areas in which Member States may grant regional aid, more commonly known as investment aid.  Investment aid is intended to promote the economic development of certain disadvantaged areas within the European Union in order to redress regional disparities.  The current Regional Aid Map for 2007-13 was drawn up in accordance with the Commission's Regional Aid Guidelines.</p>
            <p eId="para_13941">Following the expiry of transitional arrangements at the end of 2008, Kerry no longer qualifies for regional aid for large investment projects. However, it does continue to qualify for regional investment aid to SMEs at a rate of 20% for medium sized companies (50 to 249 employees) and 30% for small companies (under 50 employees).  The process of Member States agreeing the 2014-2021 Regional Aid Guidelines has begun. The Commission are due to forward proposals to Member States in the coming months documenting the structure and provisions that will form the basis of the revised Guidelines. For the 2014-2021 Regional Aid Map, economic data for all counties will once again be analysed afresh. My Department is actively engaged in this process in close consultation with stakeholders.</p>

            <p eId="para_13950">Health and Safety Authority (HSA) Mr. John Newham, Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation was appointed to the Board of the Health and Safety Authority on 10 April 2012. This appointment was a direct replacement for a former Principal Officer in the Department who retired from the Civil Service in February 2012.</p>
            <p eId="para_13951">Shannon Development. Mr. Stephen Curran, Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation was appointed to the Board of Shannon Development on 23 February 2012. This appointment was a direct replacement of Mr. Bob Keane, also a Civil Servant from my Department.</p>
            <p eId="para_13952">Forfás.  Mr. John Murphy, Secretary General of the Department was appointed to the Board of Forfás with effect from 18 January 2012.  The Industrial Development legislation provides that the Director General of Science Foundation Ireland (SFI) serves on the board of Forfás. Professor Mark Ferguson therefore became a member of the Forfás Board on taking up his position with SFI with effect from 18 January 2012. The SFI post is an ex officio appointment provided for in legislation. It has been the custom to appoint the Secretary General of the Department to the board of Forfás for reasons of policy cohesion and corporate governance.</p>
            <p eId="para_13953">National Standards Authority of Ireland Board. (NSAI). Ms Barbara O'Leary and Mr. Terry Landers were appointed to the Board of NSAI on 6 March 2012. Both appointments were publicly advertised and Ms O'Leary and Mr. Landers both applied through the expressions of interest process.  Two Staff Representatives, Ms Anne Clarke and Mr. Kierán Cox, were also appointed by Minister Bruton following an open election within the agency.</p>
            <p eId="para_13954">Competition Authority. While it does not have a typical board structure, the Competition Authority consists of a Chairperson and up to four other members who act as an executive board. The Competition Acts 2002 to 2010 set out the requirements pertaining to appointments to the Authority.  I re-appointed Mr. Declan Purcell as Chairperson of the Competition Authority on 1 July 2011 and following his retirement, I subsequently appointed Ms Isolde Goggin as Chairperson on 1 October 2011 following her selection by the Public Appointments Service (PAS) who publicly advertised this position.  I appointed Ms Noreen Mackey and Mr. David McFadden as temporary members of the Authority in July 2011 and I subsequently re-appointed both from 1 October. On 9 August 2011, I re-appointed Mr. Ciarán Quigley as a temporary member of the Authority. These temporary appointments were made in accordance with the Competition Acts 2002 to 2010 and did not require to be publicly advertised.</p>
            <p eId="para_13955">Advertisements for three full time members of the Competition Authority were published in June 2011 and following the completion of the PAS selection process for these posts I appointed Mr. Stephen Calkins and Mr. Gerald FitzGerald from December 2011 and Mr. Patrick Kenny from January 2011.</p>
            <p eId="para_13956">Irish Auditing and Accounting Supervisory Authority. Seven appointments were made to the Irish Auditing and Accounting Supervisory Authority (IAASA). Mr. Dave Martin and Mr. Kevin O'Donovan were both appointed as nominees of the Prescribed Accountancy Bodies on the 26 May 2011. Ms Sylvia McNeece of the Irish Pension Board, Ms Deirdre Behan of the Revenue Commissioners, Ms Mairead Devine of the Central Bank, Ms Marie Daly of the Irish Business and Employers Confederation and Mr. Sean Hawkshaw of the Irish Association of Investment Managers were all appointed as nominees of the Designated Bodies on the 3 January 2012. As these appointments were made in compliance with the Companies (Auditing and Accounting) Act 2003 it was not appropriate to advertise the posts.  One vacancy, recently advertised on the Public Appointments Service website, has not yet been filled.</p>
            <p eId="para_13957">National Consumer Agency. Ms Isolde Goggin was appointed to the Board of the National Consumer Agency in November 2011.</p>
            <p eId="para_13958">Ms Goggin's appointment as Chairperson of the Competition Authority and Chairperson designate of the new body which will be established on foot of the merger of the Competition Authority and the National Consumer Agency reflects the Government's commitment to the rationalisation of State agencies. Mr. Stephen Costello, Chairman and Mr. Robin O'Sullivan were both reappointed to the Agency with effect from 1 May 2012 and 6 May 2012 respectively.  Ms Colleen Savage and Mr. Eugene Gallagher were appointed to the Board of the National Consumer Agency on 6 May 2012. Both appointments were publicly advertised and Mr. Gallagher applied through the expressions of interest process.</p>
            <p eId="para_13959">PIAB. Two appointments were made to the Personal Injuries Assessment Board (PIAB) since March 2011. One was the re-appointment of Ms Ann Fitzgerald in her capacity as Chief Executive of the National Consumer Agency, which is a statutory position on the Board.</p>
            <p eId="para_13960">In the case of the second appointment, it was considered appropriate to have a representative from the Department on the Board and Ms Breda Power, Assistant Secretary, was appointed. Given the nature of this appointment, the post was not advertised.</p>
            <p eId="para_13961">Two vacancies on the Board which became vacant in April this year were advertised last month on the Public Appointments Service website (publicjobs.ie). No Appointments have yet been made in respect of these vacancies.</p>
            <p eId="para_13962">Science Foundation Ireland. Dr. Rita Colwell and Professor Martina Newell-McGloughlin were both reappointed to the Board of Science Foundation Ireland with effect from 26 July 2011. Dr. Colwell and Professor Newell-McGloughlin are internationally renowned scientific experts in the Life Sciences and Biotechnology sectors. Professor Mark Ferguson was appointed to the Board of Science Foundation Ireland on 16 January 2012 on commencement in the post of Director General of the Foundation. The Director General is appointed in an ex-officio capacity to the Science Foundation Ireland Board in accordance with the Industrial Development (Science Foundation Ireland) Act 2003.</p>
            <p eId="para_13963">InterTrade Ireland. The InterTradeIreland Board expired on 12 December 2011.  The Minister, Deputy Richard Bruton nominated four new members to that Board. These members included the following:</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_13964">Mr. Martin Cronin Chairman</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_13965">Mr. John Corbett</p>

            <p eId="para_13968">These four members were subsequently appointed to the Board on 13 December 2011 by the North South Ministerial Council.</p>
            <p eId="para_13969">Both Mr. Brendan Butler and Ms Patricia McKeown who served on the last Board were re-appointed on 13 December 2011.</p>
            <p eId="para_13970">IDA. I recently made the following appointments to the Board of the IDA:  Dermot Curran, Alan W. Gray, Peter Cassells and Mary Campbell. Ms Mary Campbell was identified following consultations with IDA Ireland to nominate a person with relevant financial expertise for my consideration for appointment to the Board.</p>
            <p eId="para_13971">Enterprise Ireland. There have been no new appointments to the Board of Enterprise Ireland since March 2011, however, the expression of interest campaign for Enterprise Ireland closed on 1 June.</p>
            <p eId="para_13972">A total of 12 Board vacancies have been advertised on the website of my Department and that of the Public Appointments Service since my appointment. I intend to shortly seek expressions of interest in respect of further Board vacancies that have arisen or are due to arise over the coming months. In this respect, my overriding focus is to find the best people for particular board appointments. In making appointments I will have regard to the expertise and experience of individuals, the balance of skills and attributes in terms of the overall composition of the board, the gender balance of the board and the availability and commitment of people to serve on the board.</p>

            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_13980">Mr. Martin Lynch — A former Principal Officer is the Irish Government representative and Deputy Chair of the Board of the European Chemicals Agency (ECHA) based in Helsinki, Finland.  He is engaged as an expert and is paid on a fee per day basis in respect of each Board meeting that he attends and also for attending meetings of the Board Sub-Committee which he chairs.

            <p eId="para_13989">Under the provisions of social welfare legislation, the 26-week period of core statutory maternity leave attracts a payment from this Department — subject to certain social insurance contribution conditions being fulfilled.

            <p eId="para_13990">The right to maternity leave is established under the Maternity Protection Act, 1994, legislation which is the responsibility of the Minister for Justice and Equality.

            <p eId="para_13999">On 1 October 2011, the community welfare service transferred from the Health Service Executive to the Department of Social Protection.  Former community welfare officers (CWOs) are known as ‘Designated Persons' for the purposes of the administration of the supplementary welfare allowance (SWA) scheme.</p>
            <p eId="para_14000">The purpose of the transfer was to provide a streamlined, consistent and enhanced service to the customer.  The process of integration is ongoing and significant progress has already been made with preparations for an integrated service almost complete in four offices and ten further offices due to be developed before the end of the year.  However, the assignment and integration of functions, and full transformation and integration of staff and skills is a programme of work which will take a number of years to complete.</p>
            <p eId="para_14001">The Department fully recognises the skills, competencies and experience of former Community Welfare Officers.  One of the projects underway as part of the transformation programme is to conduct an audit of skills and competencies so that the organisation can maximise its resources to meet requirements and address skill gaps and overlaps where they exist.</p>
            <p eId="para_14002">The supplementary welfare allowance (SWA) scheme is the safety net within the overall social welfare system in that it provides assistance to eligible people in the State whose means are insufficient to meet their needs and those of their dependants.</p>

            <p eId="para_14074">The €100 rate of jobseeker's allowance was introduced for claimants aged under 20 in April 2009, and this rate was applied to claimants aged up to 21 from December 2009.  The €100 rate does not apply to certain categories of claimant including:</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_14075">claimants with a qualified child;</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_14076">those transferring to Jobseeker's Allowance immediately after exhausting their entitlement to Jobseeker's Benefit;</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_14077">those making a claim for Jobseeker's Allowance where that claim is linked to a Jobseeker's Allowance claim made within the previous 12 months to which the maximum personal rate applied;</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_14078">those transferring directly to Jobseeker's Allowance from Disability Allowance;</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_14079">certain people who were in the care of the HSE during the period of 12 months before he or she reached the age of 18.</p>
            <p eId="para_14080">A rate of €144 applies to claimants aged 22-24.  The adoption of these measures reflected the need to encourage more young jobseekers to improve their skills by either pursuing further study or accessing a labour market programme.</p>
            <p eId="para_14081">Receiving the full adult rate of a jobseekers payment without a strong financial incentive to engage in education or training can lead to welfare dependency.  While many young people with low levels of education and training were able to get work in construction and other areas when the economy was doing well, they are likely to find it much harder to get work over the course of the next few years.  The measures encourage young jobseekers to improve their skills and remain active in the labour market in order to avoid the risk of becoming long-term unemployed and will help them to progress into sustainable employment on a long-term basis.  Where a person is in receipt of a rate of jobseeker's allowance described above and he or she participates in a course of education, training, Community Employment, Rural Social Scheme or Tús, the full normal rate of payment applicable to that course or scheme applies without any reduction for persons aged under 25.</p>
            <p eId="para_14082">I understand that Deputies have been contacted with regard to these measures following a campaign by Focus Ireland.  My officials met with Focus Ireland in May, 2012 in relation to their concerns.  These are being examined and further discussions are planned.</p>
            <p eId="para_14083">More generally, it may be noted that my Department's role with regard to persons who are homeless is mainly income maintenance.  Under the social welfare system, homeless people have entitlements to the full range of social welfare schemes, including supplementary welfare allowance and associated supplements, subject to the normal qualifying conditions.  My Department, through its work in the Homeless Persons Unit and the Asylum Seekers and New Communities Unit provides assistance to people in sourcing the most appropriate accommodation available.  In addition, prison and hospital in-reach services are provided to explore accommodation options and, where necessary, liaise with local authorities to identify and source the most appropriate accommodation available for those who are homeless or at risk of homelessness.  This ensures that where possible, people are diverted away from homeless services and towards community-based supports.</p>

            <p eId="para_14111">The timescale for determining applications is dependent, among other things, on the availability of the required information, such as details of the applicant's income, bank statements etc.  In addition, some aspects of the application are inevitably time consuming and delays can occur where investigations such as home visits or third party evidence are required.  Delays can also arise if the applicant is slow to respond to requests for additional information.</p>
            <p eId="para_14112">The provision of a prompt service is a major objective for the Department's staff dealing with applications.  However, this is tempered by the necessity to ensure that every case is fully investigated and that all cases are dealt with in a consistent and fair manner.  While statistics are not available on the numbers of applicants awaiting a decision on rent and mortgage interest supplement applications or the average length of time taken to assess these claims, I am satisfied that the Department's staff dealing with these applications make every effort to ensure claims are processed in an efficient manner.</p>

            <p eId="para_14221">The number of places available on CE has remained constant at 23,300 including supervisors.  The financial review of CE Schemes has now been completed.  The Department of Social Protection have contacted schemes to advise them of their revised material and training allocations.</p>
            <p eId="para_14222">The materials and training CE Budget has been increased by €9.5m from the original budget of approximately €11.0m following transfer from savings identified elsewhere in the DSP budget.  The new CE materials and training budget is thus €20.5m.</p>
            <p eId="para_14223">Under the revised arrangements, schemes will no longer be given universal amounts of financial support but will instead be provided with a specific level of support aimed at meeting the particular costs of CE Schemes, having regard to the overall level of funding available for CE nationally.  To date, significant savings have already been made to the overheads of CE projects in terms of annual insurance costs and audit fees.</p>
            <p eId="para_14224">To date there are no indications that any CE scheme will close as a result of the CE financial review.  However, in any year a number CE schemes may decide to close or amalgamate and in such cases the Department of Social Protection make every effort to secure alternative sponsors to ensure that the participants and the essential services that they deliver are maintained.  The matter will be kept under review and, notwithstanding the increased funding now available, should a limited number of CE sponsors withdraw from Community Employment, the Department will ensure that the participants and services are (so far as possible) supported.</p>

            <p eId="para_14249">As stated in reply to question No 347 on 3 July 2012, new arrangements relating to PRSI for public and civil servants came into operation with effect from 6 April 1995.  Public and civil servants who had been in employment before 6 April 1995 and continued to be so employed without a break in service were insured at the modified rate of PRSI contribution, Class D, whereas new entrants paid PRSI Class A.</p>
            <p eId="para_14250">Following on from the 6 April 1995 changes, a number of different departments and Boards applied the incorrect rate of PRSI in certain situations.  This resulted in an overpayment of PRSI contributions and an underpayment of pension contributions in respect of the employees concerned.</p>
            <p eId="para_14251">Where the incorrect class of PRSI has been paid the Department of Social Protection refunds the PRSI contributions where the conditions for refund are met.  When a PRSI refund is being calculated any benefits paid to the person on foot of the class A PRSI contributions are deducted from the amount of refund due.  There is no time limit in respect of the deduction of benefit from the refund due.</p>
            <p eId="para_14252">The position in relation to the person concerned is that her employer contacted the Department in November 2011 to clarify the correct PRSI contribution class for her employment.  It was confirmed that she had been paying the incorrect PRSI class since she was made permanent in 1999.  No refund is due to the individual concerned in this case as illness benefit paid out exceeds the amount of PRSI refund available.</p>
            <p eId="para_14253">As outlined above class D is the correct PRSI class payable in respect of the person concerned.  It is not possible to rescind this decision.</p>

            <p eId="para_14255">Childcare provision is a major government priority and one to which the Department of Social protection has made a significant response through the development and provision of a range of quality training and qualification measures on Community Employment. There are 2,200 places ring-fenced for childcare on Community Employment schemes. These places are delivered through dedicated CE childcare projects and through the allocation of places to childcare services as part of the approval process of CE schemes.  CE Schemes make an application to DSP on an annual basis for support under the Community Employment Programme.  The application provides details of the work to be undertaken by the scheme and how the scheme proposes to support and progress job seekers and other eligible groups for CE.  This application is then assessed by the CE Monitoring Committee against criteria laid down by my Department.   Nationally there are 276 schemes with ring-fenced places for childcare. There is no decrease in the number of Community Employment ring-fenced   places allocated in 2012.</p>
            <p eId="para_14256">A key element in the approval of all CE programmes, including childcare ring-fenced places,  is the requirement that such programmes do not displace current jobs or employees or that they are not used to fill vacancies. All applications for CE must be accompanied by letters from local Union representatives that such displacement or replacement is not occurring. The programme is managed by DSP at a regional and local level, subject to the availability of budget and the needs of participants and the community.</p>

            <p eId="para_14268">The person concerned was refused carers allowance on the ground that the care recipient is not so disabled as to require full time care and attention as prescribed in regulations. She was notified of this decision, the reason for it and of her right of review or appeal. Additional medical evidence was received and forwarded to the Department's medical assessor for further consideration. However, this information did not alter the opinion of the medical assessor and the decision of the deciding officer remained unchanged.</p>
            <p eId="para_14269">The person concerned appealed this decision to the Social Welfare Appeals Office and submitted further medical evidence in support of the appeal. An appeals officer, having fully considered all the evidence, disallowed the appeal. The decision of an appeals officer is final and may only be reviewed in the light of new evidence or new facts not already presented at the time of appeal.</p>

            <from>Minister for Social Protection (Deputy Joan Burton)</from>
            <p eId="para_14287">I want to take this opportunity to again explain why we are making changes to State pension provision. As Irish society has changed, pensions policy has evolved to reflect these changes. A key focus of mine has been to ensure that the State pension is sustainable in light of demographic changes and the associated increases in pension costs.</p>
            <p eId="para_14288">This is compounded by the wider need for sustainable public finances. So our primary consideration in making the changes we have made to reform pensions has been to ensure that retirement income remains adequate and is on a financially sound and sustainable footing</p>
            <p eId="para_14289">Under the pensions reform programme, the following reform measures are underway:</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_14290">With effect from April 2012, the number of paid contributions required has increased from 260 contributions to 520 paid contributions.</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_14291">While the current State pension age of 66 remains, the State pension (transition) which applies for one year for persons of age 65 will cease from 2014.</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_14292">Thereafter, State pension age will increase to 67 in 2021 and 68 in 2028.</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_14293">From September 2012, additional rates bands for State pension (transition) and State pension (contributory) will be introduced to more fairly reflect the attachment to the workforce by the claimant.</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_14294">The maximum rate will remain unchanged and the rate payable to people with an average of between 40 and 47 contributions per year will also remain unchanged.  However, those who have fewer contributions will receive a lower rate of pension.  This change moves somewhat closer to the total contribution approach where those who pay more, benefit more.  The new rate bands are outlined below:</p>
            <p eId="para_14295">In the future, a ‘total contributions approach' to State pension will be adopted to replace the current averaging system.   Under this system, the level of pension paid will be directly proportionate to the number of social insurance contributions made by a person over his or her working life.</p>
            <p eId="para_14296">The State pension is the bedrock of the Irish pension system, and these reforms are essential to address the challenges of increasing life expectancy and to ensure its sustainability.</p>
            <p eId="para_14297">All information relating to the changes that I have outlined here and the table are available on my Department's website.</p>

            <p eId="para_14381">Self-employed persons are liable for PRSI at the Class S rate of 4% which entitles them to access long-term benefits such as State pension (contributory) and widow's, widower's or surviving civil partner's pension (contributory).   Ordinary employees who have access to the full range of social insurance benefits pay Class A PRSI at the rate of 4%.  In addition, their employers make a PRSI contribution of 10.75% in respect of their employees, resulting in the payment of a combined 14.75% rate per employee under full-rate PRSI Class A.  (For employees earning less than €356 per week, the rate of employer's PRSI is 4.25%).</p>
            <p eId="para_14382">Any changes to the PRSI system to extend the full range of social insurance benefits to self-employed persons would have significant financial implications and would have to be considered in the context of a much more significant rise in the rate of contribution payable.   I established the Advisory Group on Tax and Social Welfare last year to meet the commitment made in the Programme for Government.   The Advisory Group will, inter alia, examine and report on issues involved in providing social insurance cover for self-employed persons in order to establish whether or not such cover is technically feasible and financially sustainable.</p>
            <p eId="para_14383">In addition, the Actuarial Review of the Social Insurance Fund which was completed in June 2012 also examined this matter.  The findings of this report are currently being examined.</p>
            <p eId="para_14384">Self-employed workers may establish eligibility to assistance-based payments such as jobseeker's allowance and disability allowance.  In the case of jobseeker's allowance they can apply for the means-tested jobseeker's allowance if their business ceases or if they are on low income as a result of a downturn in demand for their services.  In general, their means will take account of the level of earnings in the last twelve months in determining their expected income for the following year and, in the current climate, account is taken of the downward trend in the economy.  As in the case of all claimants for jobseeker's allowance or disability allowance, the means of husband/wife, civil partner or co-habitant will be taken into account in deciding on entitlement to a payment.</p>

            <p eId="para_14419">The staff in the claims area is mainly dedicated to processing new claims. The staff in that area is responsible for the end to end processing of new claims which includes examining entitlements, requesting outstanding information if necessary, completing medical referrals, deciding on claims, dealing with overlaps with other social welfare schemes and the issuing of any arrears. The claims area also encompasses an appeals/revised decisions team that deals with requests for reviews and/or appeals on new claims awarded and disallowed.</p>
            <p eId="para_14420">The staff in the payments/maintenance area deal with a variety of different maintenance roles and responsibilities relating to the approximately 51,300 carer's allowance claims that are in payment.  These functions include updating customer details (addresses, Post Office details, Bank account details, etc.), processing allowances such as free fuel, etc., adding and removing increases for qualified children, issuing of statements for tax and other purposes, dealing with terminations and control work. The payments / maintenance area also deals with general correspondence and document management, Parliamentary Questions and representations from TDs and man the TD enquiry phone lines. They also deal with routine control review work and manage overpayments and debt recovery.</p>
            <p eId="para_14421">The breakdown of staffing resources in each unit of the carer's allowance section is continuously reviewed.  The available staff resources are deployed flexibly within the section in accordance with work volumes and priority.  For this reason, it is not possible to give you a breakdown of the staffing numbers between the two sub-areas for previous years as such records are not maintained.  I can tell you that, at present, of a total of 82.2 staff members, 38.2 are assigned to the claims area and 44 to the payments/maintenance area.</p>
            <p eId="para_14422">In addition, both areas assign staff as required on a rota basis to deal with telephone enquiries from the general public, from other areas within the Department and from public bodies.</p>
            <p eId="para_14423">A major service delivery modernisation project is underway to improve the efficiency of administration of the carer's allowance scheme. This involves the deployment of information technology solutions and associated business process re-organisation.  Full deployment of the new system for carer's allowance was completed last month.  In tandem with the full implementation of the new system a comprehensive business process improvement exercise has recently commenced, the focus of which is to optimise performance and provide improved customer service.</p>

            <p eId="para_14428">Processing times vary across schemes because of both the volume of applications and the differing qualification criteria.  For example, means assessments are required for all of the social assistance schemes and customers must also satisfy the habitual residence condition.  In the case of the insurance based schemes, it may be necessary to ascertain details of foreign insurance records. It should also be noted that many factors outside the Department's control can impact upon claim processing times, e.g. the supply of relevant information by the customer, employers or other third parties.</p>
            <p eId="para_14429">The average processing time for claims decided in June 2012 was 1.7 weeks for jobseekers benefit, 4 weeks for jobseekers allowance and 14.9 weeks for one parent family payment. This is the average time nationally and there are fluctuations between offices.</p>

At the end of June, there were approximately 6,686<b> </b>new FIS applications and approximately 7,811<b> </b>renewal applications awaiting decision.

            <p eId="para_14445">At the end of June 2012 there were 6928 Invalidity Pension (IP) claims registered and awaiting decision.  Average time to award is currently 37 weeks, this includes the time taken to decide EU and bilateral cases which have a significantly longer processing time.</p>
            <p eId="para_14446">Since the introduction of the two year expiration of illness benefit there has been a significant increase in the number of IP claims received in the Department. A high percentage of these applicants are not suitable for the invalidity pension scheme as they are not assessed as being permanently incapable of work.</p>
            <p eId="para_14447">The processing time for individual IP claims may vary in accordance with their relative complexity in terms of the qualifying criteria.  In addition, factors outside the Department's control can have an impact, for example, insufficient information received from claimants at time of application and delays in claimants furnishing the information requested.</p>
            <p eId="para_14448">This Department is continually reviewing its processes in an effort to improve processing times and customer service.  Many improvements have already been introduced in IP section.  These improvements include the introduction of a new IT platform under the Department's service delivery model project which has led to further efficiencies in processing and an increase in the number of claims processed.  Additional temporary staff has been assigned to the IP area to help to reduce the backlog and waiting time. Overtime has been made available and is utilised on a judicious basis.</p>
            <p eId="para_14449">In June 2012, a business process improvement project was carried out which resulted in significant  changes to the operations in the section.  Staff have been reallocated from other duties to focus on claim processing, a phone bank has been introduced and processes have been streamlined to improve processing times.  Already improvements are being experienced but it will be a number of months before the backlog is reduced to an acceptable level.</p>

            <p eId="para_14454">There are currently approximately 11,000 statutory redundancy claims on hand.  These claims fall into different processing streams.</p>
            <p eId="para_14455">A new computerised system was introduced in October 2011.  On-line claims submitted correctly through this system which were received in April 2012 are currently being processed.  Manual claims submitted since October 2011 take longer to process due to the need to enter the information onto the new system.    The Department is currently processing such claims received in January 2012.</p>
            <p eId="para_14456">Claims submitted prior to the introduction of the new system require more clerical intervention and so take longer to process.  The Department has finalised the processing of the vast majority of redundancy lump sum claims in this category.  Redundancy rebate claims in this category which were received in September 2011 are currently being processed.</p>
            <p eId="para_14457">With regard to claims received via the Employment Appeals Tribunal the Department is currently processing claims received in March 2012.</p>
            <p eId="para_14458">There are currently 32 staff involved in processing statutory redundancy applications or, in full-time equivalent terms, 30.5 staff.  A number of months ago, the appointment of 10 temporary clerical officers was sanctioned specifically to target the processing of applications received prior to the implementation of the new system and it is expected that all of these claims will be finalised in the near future.</p>

            <from>Minister for Social Protection (Deputy Joan Burton)</from>
            <p eId="para_14460">The National Internship Scheme was launched  on 1 July 2011.  It provides internship opportunities of either 6 or 9 months for unemployed individuals at all skills levels.  The aim of JobBridge is to assist individuals in breaking the cycle where they are unable to get a job without experience.  It provides them with an opportunity to gain valuable experience, relevant knowledge and skills within a working environment.  The scheme is open to organisations in the private, public and community or voluntary sectors.  The Scheme has made significant progress to-date. 8,588 internship placements have commenced since the launch of the Scheme in July 2011.  There are currently 4,946 interns undertaking internship placements.  In addition, there are in excess of 2,100 internship posts currently advertised on the JobBridge website <i>www.jobbridge.ie</i>.</p>
            <p eId="para_14461">As you may appreciate, JobBridge staff receive a large volume of applications from Host Organisations.  However, I would point out that the average waiting time for processing of applications is one day from receipt of such applications.</p>
            <p eId="para_14462">Preliminary data from the interns who ended their placements in recent months indicates that 39% of those who have completed internships to-date have gone directly into employment with either their JobBridge Host Organisation or another company on the immediate completion of their internship.  It is also important to note that this does not take into account of interns who may have secured employment in the subsequent weeks or months after completing their internship.</p>
            <p eId="para_14463">The above represents very significant progress in a short period of time.  Further information on outcomes will be ascertained following the independent evaluation of the scheme which is currently being undertaken by Indecon International Economic Consultants.  This evaluation will assess the design, delivery and impact of the JobBridge Scheme.  It will provide details of the nature of the work experience of the participants; a measurement of the relevance of that experience to the labour market and progression into employment.</p>

            <p eId="para_14468">The purpose of the transfer of Community Welfare Service and staff to the Department from the HSE last October, was to provide a streamlined, consistent and enhanced service to the customer.  The process of integration is ongoing and significant progress has already been made with preparations for an integrated service almost complete in four offices and ten further offices due to be developed before the end of the year.  However, the assignment and integration of functions, and full transformation and integration of staff and skills is a programme of work which will take a number of years to complete.</p>
            <p eId="para_14469">The Department fully recognises the skills, competencies and experience of former CWOs.  One of the projects underway as part of the transformation programme is to conduct an audit of skills and competencies so that the organisation can maximise its resources to meet requirements and address skill gaps and overlaps where they exist.</p>
            <p eId="para_14470">With regard to Family Income Supplement (FIS), the average waiting time for new family income supplement (FIS) claims at the end of June was 19 weeks.  At the end of June, there were approximately 6,686 new FIS applications and approximately 7,811 renewal applications awaiting decision.  The volume of FIS claims on hands and the delays in processing are a consequence of continued strong claim intake.</p>
            <p eId="para_14471">The Department has introduced a number of measures to address the efficiency of claim processing for FIS in light of the current waiting times, including the assignment of temporary staff and the facility to assign overtime working where appropriate.  It is intended to commence in the near future a comprehensive business process improvement initiative in the FIS area, the focus of which will be to optimise performance and provide improved customer service.</p>
            <p eId="para_14472">The position is being closely monitored and kept under review by the Department.</p>

The new maximum rent limits came into force on 1 January 2012 and are in line with the most up to date market data available.  The purpose of the rent limit review is to ensure that maximum value for money for tenants and the taxpayer is achieved whilst at the same time ensuring that people on rent supplement are not priced out of the market for private rented accommodation.</p>

         the full list of allowances that are not subject to income tax and the rates applicable that are available to her and Ministers of State in her Department in respect of their official duties including allowances relating to periods when they are away from their offices, either within the State or abroad; the actual amounts claimed and paid since 9 March 2010 to her and Ministers of State; if these are currently under review; and if she will make a statement on the matter.

            <p eId="para_14503">Under the previous Government un-vouched expenses were paid to Ministers at a rate of €459.95 per fortnight.  This allowance ceased to be payable in 2010 and consequently, no tax free allowance of that nature is available to me nor have any been available to me since taking up my post as Minister.</p>
            <p eId="para_14504">As the Deputy will be aware, Oireachtas expense allowances are exempt from taxation under section 836 of the Taxes Consolidation Act. Ministers and Ministers of State are entitled to the same allowances as Members of the Oireachtas with the some exceptions.</p>
            <p eId="para_14505">Ministers do not receive the Travel and Accommodation Allowance provided to Members of the Oireachtas.  Since 1 May 2011 Cabinet Ministers with the exception of Taoiseach, Tánaiste and Minister for Justice and Law Reform now use their own cars on official business.  All Ministers are now paid for official mileage up to 96,540 kilometres or 60,000 miles per annum.  Ministers of State have used their own cars on official business since 1984.</p>
            <p eId="para_14506">Ministers do not receive overnight payments while in Dublin but when on official overnight business away from their home or headquarters may claim the vouched cost of a hotel room including tax and up to 15% in respect of any service charge.  They may also claim an overnight subsistence allowance of €72.66.</p>
            <p eId="para_14507">Where a Minister participates in a visit abroad an allowance of up to a maximum limit of €190.46 may be claimed to cover additional costs that may arise such as, for example, the purchase of a gift for the Minister's counterpart.</p>
            <p eId="para_14508">Taxation is a matter for the Revenue Commissioners in the first instance.  However, I understand that where office holders and employees necessarily incur expenses of travel and subsistence relating to that travel in the performance of the duties of their office or employment, the reimbursement of such expenses may, in certain circumstances be made tax-free.</p>

         the proposed increase in the minimum qualifying State pension age to 68, if she will specify the transitional arrangements that will be in place for persons who may, for example, have a contract of employment which specifies they must retire at 65 or who may have an income continuance plan under which payments cease on reaching the age of 65; and if she will make a statement on the matter.

            <p eId="para_14522">The Deputy will be aware of the sustainability issues regarding pensions in Ireland and the pension reform measures under way to try to address some of these issues including the raising of State pension age which has already been provided for in primary legislation.</p>
            <p eId="para_14523">While the current State pension age of 66 remains, the State pension (transition) which applies for one year for persons of age 65 will cease from 2014. Thereafter, State pension age will increase to 67 in 2021 and 68 in 2028.  A Steering Group, together with a number of subgroups, was established in my Department, to oversee the implementation of pension reforms.  The Steering Group has representation from the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation.  Officials of my Department are in on-going discussions with colleagues in the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation and the Department of Justice and Equality in relation to any implications arising as a result of the increase in State pension age.</p>
            <p eId="para_14524">A forum on retirement and working is currently being scheduled where these Departments will also engage with the social partners and other interest groups to further consider and identify the range of issues involved.</p>
            <p eId="para_14525">We will always continue to provide the normal supports to those who cannot, for whatever reason, continue working or find themselves in financial difficulty.  In this regard, the Deputy may wish to note that in 2011, almost half of those who received State pension were already on a social welfare payment before they reached pension age.  For those who are unable to work past age 65 or for those whose income continuance plans cease at age 65 and who have an income need, Social Welfare schemes will continue to be available for those who fulfil the eligibility criteria.</p>
            <p eId="para_14526">As Irish society has changed, pensions policy has evolved to reflect these changes.  A key focus of mine has been to ensure that the State pension is sustainable in light of demographic changes and the associated increases in pension costs. This challenge is compounded by the wider need for sustainable public finances.  Our primary consideration in making the changes we have made to reform pensions has been to ensure that the system is on a financially sound and sustainable footing.</p>

            <p eId="para_14548">Through ongoing business process improvement projects, the operational processes, procedures and the organisation of work in all scheme areas are continually reviewed to ensure that processing capability is maximised.  As part of the Department's programme of service delivery modernisation, a range of initiatives aimed at streamlining the processing of claims and improving claim processing times, supported by modern technology, have been implemented in recent years.  The State pension (non-contributory) scheme transferred to a new technology platform in 2011, and this will ensure that the scheme is operated more efficiently and that processing times will improve incrementally.</p>
            <p eId="para_14549">In addition, the staffing needs of the Department are regularly reviewed, having regard to workloads and the competing demands arising, to ensure that the best use is made of all available resources.  The Department will continue to source available staff to fill critical vacancies by way of redeployment, or transfer from within the Department and other Government Departments, taking account of the employment control framework (ECF) target, as determined by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.</p>
            <p eId="para_14550">I wish to assure the Deputies that prompt processing of claims remains a priority for me.</p>
            <p eId="para_14551">The information requested by the Deputies is set out in the following tables.</p>

            <p eId="para_14630">The Social Welfare Appeals Office has advised me that an appeal by the person concerned was registered in that office on 13th April 2012.  It is a statutory requirement of the appeals process that the relevant Departmental papers and comments by the Deciding Officer on the grounds of appeal be sought.  When received, the case in question will be referred to an Appeals Officer who will make a summary decision on the appeal based on documentary evidence presented or, if required, hold an oral hearing.</p>
            <p eId="para_14631">The Social Welfare Appeals Office functions independently of the Minister for Social Protection and of the Department and is responsible for determining appeals against decisions on social welfare entitlements.</p>

            <p eId="para_14633">The number of appeals on hands for all scheme types at the end of June 2012 is listed in Table 1.  At the end of June 2012 there were 4,122 appeals of Disability Allowance pending.</p>
            <p eId="para_14634">The current processing times for all scheme types are listed in Table 2.  Generally the vast majority of cases fall within average times but extenuating factors, often outside of the control of the Social Welfare Appeals Office, will cause greater delays in some cases.</p>
            <p eId="para_14635">In light of this, the attached table showing the current processing times (based on figures at the end of June 2012) shows the overall average for each scheme along with the average when the older appeals are excluded.</p>
            <p eId="para_14636">These processing times are calculated from the registration date of the appeal to the date of its finalisation.  They include all activities during this period including time spent in the Department for comments by the Deciding Officer on the grounds of appeal put forward by the appellant, and any further investigation, examination or assessment by the Department's Inspectors and Medical Assessors that is deemed necessary.  A considerable period of time is added to the process when an oral hearing is required because of the logistics involved in this process.</p>
            <p eId="para_14637">In an effort to reduce the processing times for all appeals, the Department has appointed 13 additional Appeals Officers since 2010.  In addition, a further 10 Appeals Officers, formerly employed by the Community Welfare Services (CWS) of the Health Services Executive joined the Office as part of the integration of the CWS appeals services into the Social Welfare Appeals Office, bringing the total number of Appeals Officers now serving in the Office to 40.  In addition to this the Office has improved its business processes and IT support.</p>
            <p eId="para_14638">There has been no change in the practice of giving updates on decisions of appeals to TDs.  TDs can request updates on progress of appeals by calling a dedicated phone line or by sending in a request for update to <i>TDREPS.Appeals@welfare.ie</i>.</p>
            <p eId="para_14639">I am assured by the Chief Appeals Officer that she is keeping the methods of operation by which the Social Welfare Appeals Office conducts its business under constant review, and that the processes are continuously being enhanced to reduce the backlogs in the Office and, overall, to reduce the processing times for dealing with appeals.</p>

            <p eId="para_14928">The purpose of the rent supplement scheme is to provide short-term income support, to eligible people living in private rented accommodation whose means are insufficient to meet their accommodation costs and who do not have accommodation available to them from any other source.  The aim is to provide short term assistance, and not to act as an alternative to the other social housing schemes operated by the Exchequer.  There are approximately 92,000 persons in receipt of rent supplement for which the Government has provided a sum of €436 million for 2012.</p>
            <p eId="para_14929">The revised rent limits are applicable to new rent supplement tenancies from January 2012 and existing tenancies on review.  Approximately 25,000 rent supplement claims have been awarded in 2012, representing over 27% of total claims in payment, indicating that accommodation can be secured within the new limits.</p>
            <p eId="para_14930">Where a claim is under review and the rent is above the maximum limit the customer is being asked to contact the landlord to renegotiate the rent.  Where a landlord does not agree to reduce the rent to the new rates departmental officials will discuss the options open to the tenant up to and including seeking alternative accommodation.  Departmental guidance to the officers administering rent supplement states that where negotiation with the landlord fails then rent supplement may continue to be paid for a period of up to thirteen weeks at the higher rate.  Officials administering the scheme advise that customers are securing alternative accommodation in such cases.  However, data on the numbers who have secured alternative accommodation is not available.</p>
            <p eId="para_14931">The Department is continuing to monitor on a weekly basis the availability of rental properties within the revised limits across the country.</p>

            <p eId="para_14941">The pension rights of scheme members are protected through trust law and by provisions in the Pensions Act 1990.

            <p eId="para_14942">In addition to the safeguards provided by trust law, the Pensions Act 1990 also provides for the regulation of pension schemes in Ireland.  Under the Act, defined benefit pension schemes must meet a minimum funding standard which requires that schemes maintain sufficient assets to enable them discharge accrued liabilities in the event of scheme winding up.</p>
            <p eId="para_14943">The Pensions Act 1990 also provides for the preservation of pension benefits for a member of a scheme whose service in relevant employment terminates before normal retirement age.  The payment of preserved pension benefit shall be payable in accordance with, and subject to, the rules of the scheme as at the date of the termination of the relevant employment.  In accordance with section 33 of the Act preserved benefit shall be revalued annually in line with the consumer price index.  Preserved benefits were revalued by 2.6 per cent for 2011.</p>
            <p eId="para_14944">While is not possible to comment on a particular scheme, the Government is aware of the financial challenge faced by many pension schemes.

There are approximately 92,000 persons in receipt of rent supplement for which the Government has provided a sum of €436 million for 2012.</p>
            <p eId="para_14953">The new maximum rent limits were set after an analysis of the most up to date market data available.  The emphasis of the rent limit review was to ensure that maximum value for money for tenants and the taxpayer was achieved whilst at the same time ensuring that people on rent supplement are not priced out of the market for private rented accommodation.</p>
            <p eId="para_14954">The revised limits are applicable to new rent supplement tenancies from January 2012 and existing tenancies on review.  Approximately 25,000 rent supplement claims have been awarded in 2012 indicating that accommodation can be secured within the new limits.  The Department is continuing to monitor rent levels throughout the country but at this stage there are no plans to revise the existing rent limits.</p>

            <p eId="para_14957">As the Deputy will be aware there is currently a moratorium on recruitment and promotion in the public service.  As an exception to the moratorium, the Department has been given a limited sanction, subject at all times to Employment Control Framework targets set by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, to fill critical vacancies by way of promotion in instances where all efforts to fill such vacancies by way of redeployment or transfer have been exhausted.</p>
            <p eId="para_14958">Competitions to establish appropriate promotional panels have been held in house, or run on behalf of the Department by the Public Appointments Service (PAS). In this regard, there are no direct costs incurred by the Department in relation to theses competitions. All competitions are conducted in accordance with the Code of Practice titled Appointment to Positions in the Civil Service and Public Service, published by the Commission for Public Service Appointments. A small number of complaints were received and they have been investigated in accordance with the Code of Practice.   In all cases where investigations have been completed, the complaints have not been upheld.</p>
            <p eId="para_14959">On foot of arbitration findings relating to the transfer of the Community Welfare Service from the Health Service Executive and the Employment Support Service from FÁS to the Department, competitions to establish panels in respect of these staff are to be arranged.  The panels to be established will run parallel to existing panels within the Department and will  provide for promotions on a pro rata basis as agreed. In light of the number of potential candidates, it is expected that one of the competitions will be facilitated shortly in house while 3 other competitions will require the assistance of the Public Appointment Service (PAS). Suitable dates for the competitions are currently being arranged with PAS.</p>
            <p eId="para_14960">Following the expiry date of the existing panels it will be necessary to seek sanction from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform to hold any further competitions.</p>

            <p eId="para_14962">The €100 rate of jobseeker's allowance was introduced for claimants aged under 20 in April 2009, and this rate was applied to claimants aged up to 21 from December 2009. The €100 rate does not apply certain categories of claimant including:</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_14963">claimants with a qualified child;</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_14964">those transferring to Jobseeker's Allowance immediately after exhausting their entitlement to Jobseeker's Benefit;</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_14965">those making a claim for Jobseeker's Allowance where that claim is linked to a Jobseeker's Allowance claim made within the previous 12 months to which the maximum personal rate applied;</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_14966">those transferring directly to Jobseeker's Allowance from Disability Allowance;</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_14967">certain people who were in the care of the HSE during the period of 12 months before he or she reached the age of 18.</p>
            <p eId="para_14968">A rate of €144 applies to claimants aged 22-24.  The adoption of these measures reflected the need to encourage more young jobseekers to improve their skills by either pursuing further study or accessing a labour market programme.</p>
            <p eId="para_14969">Receiving the full adult rate of a jobseekers payment without a strong financial incentive to engage in education or training can lead to welfare dependency.   While many young people with low levels of education and training were able to get work in construction and other areas when the economy was doing well, they are likely to find it much harder to get work over the course of the next few years.  The measures encourage young jobseekers to improve their skills and remain active in the labour market in order to avoid the risk of becoming long-term unemployed and will help them to progress into sustainable employment on a long-term basis. Where a person is in receipt of a rate of jobseeker's allowance described above and he or she participates in a course of education, training, community employment, rural social scheme or Tús, the full normal rate of payment applicable to that course or scheme applies without any reduction for persons aged under 25.</p>
            <p eId="para_14970">I understand that the Deputy has been contacted with regard to these measures following a campaign by Focus Ireland. Officials from the Department met with Focus Ireland in May 2012 in relation to their concerns. These are being examined and further discussions are planned.</p>
            <p eId="para_14971">More generally, it may be noted that the Department's role with regard to persons who are homeless is mainly income maintenance. Under the social welfare system, homeless people have entitlements to the full range of social welfare schemes, including supplementary welfare allowance and associated supplements, subject to the normal qualifying conditions.  The Department, through its work in the Homeless Persons Unit and the Asylum Seekers and New Communities Unit provides assistance to people in sourcing the most appropriate accommodation available.  In addition, prison and hospital in-reach services are provided to explore accommodation options and, where necessary, liaise with local authorities to identify and source the most appropriate accommodation available for those who are homeless or at risk of homelessness.  This ensures that where possible, people are diverted away from homeless services and towards community-based supports.</p>

            <p eId="para_14979">The Department is committed to ensuring that claims are processed as expeditiously as possible.  Processing times vary across schemes, depending on the differing qualification criteria.  Schemes that require a high level of documentary evidence from the customer, particularly in the case of illness-related schemes, can take longer to process. Similarly, means-tested payments can also require more detailed investigation and interaction with the applicant, thereby lengthening the decision making process.</p>
            <p eId="para_14980">As part of the Department's programme of service delivery modernisation, a range of initiatives aimed at streamlining the processing of claims, supported by modern technology, have been implemented in recent years.  Operational processes, procedures and the organisation of work are continually reviewed to ensure that processing capability is maximised.</p>
            <p eId="para_14981">Backlogs have built up in some scheme areas, specifically carers allowance and invalidity benefit and every effort is being made to speed up the processing of these claims.  In addition to the deployment of new systems, the Department is allocating additional resources in the form of overtime working and temporary staff to help reduce backlogs that have built up.  However, it is expected to be a number of months before the backlog is reduced to an acceptable level.</p>
            <p eId="para_14982">In an effort to reduce appeal processing times, the Department appointed 12 additional Appeals Officers since between 2010 and 2011. In addition, a further 10 Appeals Officers, formerly employed by the Community Welfare Service (CWS) of the Health Services Executive joined the Office as part of the integration of the CWS appeals services into the Social Welfare Appeals Office.  This brought the total number of Appeals Officers to 39. In addition to this, the Office has improved its business processes and IT support.</p>

The appropriate level of overall expenditure by my Department will be considered by the Government in the context of Budget 2013 and subsequent Budgets.

            <p eId="para_14986">Sustainable public finances are a pre-requisite for future economic stability and growth, as well as being a pre-requisite for maintaining and developing our social protection system. The Government's priority is to secure economic recovery, promote growth and employment and to enhance international credibility.  The Government's target is to return to the 3% General Government Deficit over a period of time as required by the Stability and Growth Pact.  To this end, the State must pursue a determined deficit reduction strategy.  Accordingly, there will be an on-going requirement to curtail expenditure in 2013 and in later years.  There are, therefore, considerable challenges ahead including the need to protect, as far as possible, the key income supports and services operated by my Department. These services and supports impact in some way on the lives of almost every single person in the State.  The scope and scale of this expenditure plays a key role in the wider economy and helps to partially offset the effect of the downturn.</p>

All outstanding PRSI was paid by the person concerned in November 2010 which was after her 66th birthday.

            <p eId="para_15004">The purpose of the rent supplement scheme is to provide short-term support to eligible people living in private rented accommodation whose means are insufficient to meet their accommodation costs and who do not have accommodation available to them from any other source. The overall aim is to provide short-term assistance and not to act as an alternative to the other social housing schemes operated by the Exchequer. There are currently approximately 92,000 persons in receipt of rent supplement for which the Government has provided €436 million in 2012.</p>
            <p eId="para_15005">Every claim for rent supplement is determined having regard to the particular circumstances of the applicant. Persons seeking a rent supplement must first satisfy the Department that they have a housing need which they are unable to meet from their own resources. In addition, the Department must be satisfied that the residence is reasonably suited to the residential and other needs of the claimant. The Department must also be satisfied that the rent payable is reasonable having regard to the nature, character and location of the residence.</p>
            <p eId="para_15006">Where parents have joint custody of a child, the needs of both parents to have adequate accommodation are taken into account when an application for a rent supplement is being determined, including any obligations placed by the courts. In such cases, documentation is normally required showing that a joint custody arrangement is in place and being availed of before a decision can be made.  The fact that one parent is in receipt of rent supplement would not, in itself, preclude the other parent from being entitled to assistance towards their rent.<b>  </b>  Statistics are not available on the outcome of decisions made in these circumstances.</p>

            <from>Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht (Deputy Jimmy Deenihan)</from>
            <p eId="para_15092">The Government has put in place a compensation scheme for those affected by the cessation of turf cutting on raised bog special areas of conservation. This entails payment of €1,500 per year, index linked, for 15 years or, where feasible, relocation of turf cutters to non-designated bogs where they can continue to cut turf. Those wishing to relocate can avail of the financial payment or the delivery of 15 tonnes of cut turf per annum while relocation sites are identified and prepared. The costs of acquiring and preparing relocation sites will be met by the State. An additional once-off payment of €500 for qualifying turf cutters will be provided where legal agreements are signed with me, as Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht.</p>
            <p eId="para_15093">Over 2,250 applications for compensation have been received under this scheme and some 840 payments have been made to date.</p>
            <p eId="para_15094">While turf contractors do not, generally speaking, own legal rights in terms of freehold ownership and/or turbary rights in raised bog special areas of conservation, the Peatlands Council provides a forum for contractors to put forward their ideas and views for consideration.  There may also be a potential role for contractors in the relocation of turf cutters to non-designated bogs and in restoration of sites.</p>
            <p eId="para_15095">Earlier this year, at the request of the Government, Mr. Conor Skehan, Chair of the Peatlands Council, convened a Peatlands Forum, under the chairmanship of Mr. Justice John Quirke, and involving my Department, the IFA, the Turf Cutters and Contractors Association, Bord na Móna, and representatives of turf cutting and environmental groups. This Forum allowed each community affected by the cessation of turf cutting to put forward their views on the issues and follow-up steps were identified for each bog. The report on the Forum from Justice Quirke also recommended that a national plan should be prepared to examine how the 53 raised bog special areas of conservation are to be protected. This recommendation was agreed to by Government and Dáil Éireann also gave unanimous support to a Private Members' Motion, which called for such a national plan to be put in place. On the 3rd of April last, a delegation led by Minister Hogan and I met with EU Environment Commissioner Potoènik in Brussels, where we secured the support of the European Commission for developing a National Raised Bog SAC Management Plan.</p>
            <p eId="para_15096">The Plan will be wide-ranging, looking at the practical aspects of conserving, restoring and managing the affected bogs and will allow solutions for turf-cutters to be explored in detail. In the context of such a Plan, it may be possible to bring some flexibility, within the terms of the Habitats Directive, that could allow limited cutting within a small number of sites. The Plan will be progressed both at local level for each site and at national level through the Peatlands Council.</p>

            <p eId="para_15106">One of the qualifying criteria for the cessation of turf cutting compensation scheme is that the claimant must have been cutting turf on the lands in question in the relevant five year period.

            <p eId="para_15111">As the Deputy will be aware, the Government's Public Service Reform Plan, which was published on 17 November last, included the following actions in respect of my Departmental remit:</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_15112">Combine the Irish Museum of Modern Art, the Crawford Art Gallery and the National Gallery of Ireland, while retaining separate identities;</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_15113">Merge the National Archives and the Irish Manuscripts Commission into the National Library while maintaining separate identities; and</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_15114">Examine the Board structure and the issue of shared services at the National Library and the National Museum.</p>
            <p eId="para_15115">The Plan also commits to a critical review of Culture Ireland with a view to its function being merged into my Department.</p>
            <p eId="para_15116">The National Cultural Institutions are vitally important components of Ireland's academic, cultural, documentary and archaeological heritage and each of the institutions has a unique and significant role to play. The National Cultural Institutions also play a very significant role in Ireland's cultural tourism product through their collections, staffing and contribution to scholarship.</p>
            <p eId="para_15117">Against this background, I am acutely aware that any proposals that change the current status of the institutions must ensure that their unique standing and role is reinforced. However, I am equally aware that the institutions face a number of challenges at this time. Clearly, the greatest challenges relate to resources and funding. In this context, it is very important that the institutions operate in the most effective and efficient way possible and are seen to provide value for money. It is my intention to ensure that our cultural institutions will emerge stronger with a more certain future following the review process, so that for the present and future generations they can continue as custodians of our past, the chroniclers of our present and the arbiter of our cultural future.</p>
            <p eId="para_15118">My Department has been examining the complex issues involved in these proposals.  This process has involved consultations with each of the institutions involved, as well as an examination of other models of governance internationally. I have also met with the Chairs of the Boards of the institutions. These consultations have taken place in a positive atmosphere and all concerned have seen this process as an opportunity to examine how the institutions can best address the considerable challenges that exist, while retaining and maintaining their unique and distinct identities.</p>
            <p eId="para_15119">I am currently consulting with the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform with a view to these matters being considered by Government in due course.</p>

            <p eId="para_15193">Ministers and Ministers of State are entitled to the same allowances as Members of the Oireachtas with the some exceptions. No additional untaxed allowances are paid by my Department to me or to the Minister of State in respect of our official duties.   As the Deputy will be aware, the legislation providing for Oireachtas expense allowances is exempt from taxation under section 836 of the Taxes Consolidation Act, which was inserted into that Act by section 3(7) of the Oireachtas (Allowances to Members) and Ministerial and Parliamentary Offices Act 2009.</p>
            <p eId="para_15194">Ministers do not receive the Travel and Accommodation Allowance provided to Members of the Oireachtas. However, Ministers outside the Dublin area who maintain second homes because of their official duties can claim an income tax deduction in maintaining that second home, as well as the annual mortgage repayment.  The availability of this allowance is determined by the Revenue Commissioners. Since 1 May 2011, Cabinet Ministers, with the exception of the Taoiseach, Tánaiste and Minister for Justice and Law Reform, now use their own cars on official business.  Ministers of State have used their own cars on official business since 1984. In this context, Ministers and Ministers of State can claim travel expenses for official business in line with guidelines set down by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform. The amounts claimed in respect of such expenses from 9th March 2011 to 30th   June 2012 are set out in the following table.</p>

            <from>Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht (Deputy Jimmy Deenihan)</from>
            <p eId="para_15204">Under the provisions of the Planning and Development Act 2000, as amended, regarding architectural heritage, each planning authority is required to include in its development plan a Record of Protected Structures (RPS), which includes all structures or parts of structures in their functional areas which, in their opinion, are of special architectural, historical, archaeological, artistic, cultural, scientific, social or technical interest. This record forms part of a planning authority's development plan. Inclusion on the RPS places a duty of care on the owners and occupiers of protected structures and gives planning authorities powers to deal with development proposals affecting them in order to safeguard their future.  Provisions for the notification of owners of the proposed inclusion of their property on the RPS are also detailed in Sections 12 and 55 of the 2000 Act.</p>
            <p eId="para_15205">My role in relation to protected structures is to ensure that there are appropriate legislative and policy frameworks in place in relation to the built heritage.  Operational issues are generally a matter for planning authorities under these frameworks.  My Department's Architectural Heritage Protection Guidelines for Planning Authorities (2011) provide statutory guidelines with regard to the implementation of Part IV (Architectural Heritage) of the Act.</p>
            <p eId="para_15206">My Department also has responsibility for the National Inventory for Architectural Heritage, which provides a basis for me to recommend structures to local authorities for protection.  The National Inventory of Architectural Heritage county survey for Monaghan is currently underway and I expect to make recommendations to Monaghan County Council within the next 12 months for inclusion of structures to their RPS based on this survey.</p>
            <p eId="para_15207">For the information of the Deputy, the list of structures included in the RPS for County Monaghan are detailed at Appendix 5 to the Monaghan County Development Plan 2007-2013 in effect since 17 April 2007.</p>

            <p eId="para_15301">I am advised by Inland Fisheries Ireland (IFI), that the presence of low volumes of algal growth on resistivity strips does not cause a pronounced attenuation of the electrical signal nor does it adversely affect a counters operation.  The build-up of such algal material is common on all in-stream structures.  The routine maintenance of fish counters usually includes the removal of such material when and where feasible, however this is more for health and safety reasons for the staff involved (weir access/prevention of slips and falls) rather than for operational ones.</p>
            <p eId="para_15302">The River Maine fish counter suffered a number of episodic flood events in 2011 and it was these events that caused the counter to malfunction.  The counter is currently operational and counting salmon.  Some further upgrades are planned which should prevent flood events causing counter outages in the future.</p>

The scheme operates on a rules basis.  The grant offer, once accepted, remains valid for six months from the date of issue.  All grant works along with a BER must be completed and paperwork received by SEAI within the six month grant offer period.  A reminder is sent to every applicant two months before the expiry of the grant offer.<b>  </b>  In the specific case noted the position remains that payment cannot be made on the grant application measure(s) concerned as the BER was published outside the six month timeframe.  The case has been unsuccessfully appealed by the applicant on two prior occasions.  In both instances the SEAI found a lack of mitigating circumstances to warrant payment of the grant.</p>

The Regulation required that all Member States prepare a national Eel Management Plan (EMP).  Ireland's plan was approved by the European Commission in July, 2009.</p>
            <p eId="para_15324">Bye-laws, Conservation of Eel Fishing Bye-law No. C.S. 303, 2009 and Conservation of Eel Fishing (Prohibition On Issue Of Licences) Bye-law No. 858, 2009, were signed by the then Minister in 2009 prohibiting the capture of eels.  There was no provision for compensation for those who previously engaged in this fishery on a commercial basis.</p>
            <p eId="para_15325">The then Central and Regional Fisheries Boards (now Inland Fisheries Ireland — IFI) engaged with the eel fishermen representatives to investigate possible diversification schemes; however, no specific funding was identified for diversification.  I understand that a number of former eel fishermen have been contracted by the ESB to undertake Trap and Transport operations to mitigate the impact of hydropower schemes as part of the eel management plan.</p>
            <p eId="para_15326">There is no property right attaching to public eel licences and consequently the issue of compensation does not arise, given that the closure of the fishery was applied for conservation reasons under the Fisheries Acts.  Given that context and having regard to National economic circumstances, no provision has been made for compensation payments.</p>
            <p eId="para_15327">The National EMP is currently being updated following the provision of three additional years of scientific research and monitoring of the status of eels stocks.  The latest independent Standing Scientific Committee report on eels is available on the IFI website and a link to this web page is also available on my Department's website.  IFI's three-year eel monitoring report is also available online.</p>
            <p eId="para_15328">Ireland's EMP Implementation report, which details progress on Ireland's 2009 EMP, is due to be submitted to the EU shortly. In relation to the information contained in these reports and prior to consideration of the continuation of existing measures, a public consultation period has been undertaken.  The closing date for receipt of submissions to be considered as part of the review of eel plans for Ireland was set as Monday 2nd July 2012.  However, on foot of presentations made to stakeholders as part of the consultation, I extended the closing date to 11th   July to facilitate the receipt of submissions from as many stakeholders as possible. Submissions made during the public consultation period, which included a number of public meetings/seminars, will be considered in formulating proposals for the management of the eel fishery for the coming years.  Three public meetings on the EMPs have been held in Clonmel, County Tipperary on 19th June, in Athlone, County Westmeath on 20th June and in Carrick on Shannon, County Leitrim on 21st June.  Copies of all relevant documents (EU Report, Scientific Report and Monitoring Report) were available at the public meetings and on IFI's website (<i>www.fisheriesireland.ie</i>) or through the link on my Department’s website (<i>www.dcenr.gov.ie</i>).</p>

            <p eId="para_15335">The person to whom the Deputy refers is in receipt of a broadband service through the National Broadband Scheme (NBS).</p>
            <p eId="para_15336">By way of background, my Department entered into a contract with 3, a Hutchison Whampoa company, for the delivery of the NBS in late December 2008, following the conclusion of a competitive dialogue procurement process.  The objective of the NBS is to deliver broadband to certain target areas in Ireland in which broadband services were deemed at the time to be insufficient.  Since October 2010, broadband services are available in all of the 1,028 Electoral Divisions (ED) designated to be covered under the Scheme.</p>
            <p eId="para_15337">A further Government initiative, namely the Rural Broadband Scheme (RBS), was launched last year in recognition of the fact that despite the widespread availability of broadband throughout Ireland, there still remained individual premises that were unable to receive broadband provision, due to technical difficulties such as line of sight issues.  This Scheme, which is being rolled out this year, is aimed at making a basic broadband service available to those individual un-served premises in rural non-NBS areas who wish to avail of such services.  Since the person to whom the Deputy refers resides in a designated NBS area, they are not eligible for consideration under the RBS.</p>
            <p eId="para_15338">With regard to service quality under the NBS, my Department has well-established monitoring arrangements in place to ensure that the NBS delivers the minimum specified service or better to all users.  Under the NBS contract, specific service level agreement (SLA) standards are in place, which define the service and support levels to be provided by 3 to NBS subscribers.  The NBS contract imposes a service credit regime on 3, with financial consequences in the event that minimum specification service levels are not met.  It also provides that where NBS customers do not receive the minimum guaranteed service as set out in the terms and conditions of their contract, they are entitled to service rebates. My Department liaises very closely with 3 to ensure that any issues relating to service performance, which are brought to its attention are addressed as quickly as possible.  It operates a dedicated NBS mailbox, which NBS customers who have fully utilised 3's established complaints process can contact by email at <i>nationalbroadbandscheme@dcenr.gov.ie</i> with any comments or complaints they may have about their NBS service.</p>
            <p eId="para_15339">The individual concerned has not previously contacted my Department in relation to any complaints relating to their NBS service but my officials have now made contact with them and are liaising with 3 on their behalf to assist in the speedy resolution of these service issues.</p>

            <from>Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources (Deputy Pat Rabbitte)</from>
            <p eId="para_15342">I propose to take Questions Nos. 416 and 420 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_15343">I am very much aware of the challenges digital switchover brings, in particular for households that are reliant on the existing free to air analogue TV network.  The necessary assistance and support for everyone but in particular for those households who need to make the switch to digital is being provided through a substantial national information campaign.  In addition there is a community outreach programme aimed at providing local assistance to meet the needs of the most vulnerable in society.  As I have stated in reply to previous questions, I do not propose to introduce grant schemes for this purpose.</p>
            <p eId="para_15344">The Outreach programme is managed by the Wheel and has been working to address the particular information and assistance needs of vulnerable households as they prepare to go digital.  The aim of the Outreach Programme is to ensure that all vulnerable households are made aware of the switchover and that no TV viewers are left without a TV service once analogue TV switches off on 24 October.  Local help is available through local Champions and information on these champions is available from the Departments dedicated website <i>www.goingdigital.ie</i>.</p>
            <p eId="para_15345">Experience from other European countries indicates that the cost of set top boxes and other digital receivers reduces as the date for digital switchover approaches, and as competition increases in the market.  There is clear evidence that this is now happening in Ireland with affordable set top boxes on the market, as well as a wide range of suitable digital televisions.  A small SAORVIEW TV costs approximately €120 and SAORVIEW set top boxes are now retailing from €60 or less.  SAORSAT set top boxes are now available from around €90.</p>
            <p eId="para_15346">RTÉ through its subsidiary company RTÉNL has built, owns and controls the SAORVIEW TV network and is responsible for the roll-out, coverage and operation of that network.  This is in accordance with Part 8 of the Broadcasting Act 2009, which provides that the development of the RTÉ network is an operational matter for RTÉ and, therefore, not one in which I, as Minister, have a function.  Specifically, the Act requires RTÉ to provide digital coverage to the same extent as analogue coverage i.e. 98% population coverage.  SAORVIEW will actually reach in excess of 98% population coverage so by itself exceeds RTÉ's legislative obligations for a national digital TV network to replace the analogue TV network which is switching off on 24 October.</p>
            <p eId="para_15347">The development and provision of the SAORSAT satellite platform was undertaken by RTÉ on its own initiative and is not a matter in which I have a function.  RTÉ has introduced SAORSAT to provide a free to air TV service to the circa 2% of the population who cannot receive SAORVIEW.  With the launch of SAORSAT, Ireland has 100% coverage of RTÉ and TG4 for the first time in the history of the State and everyone can chose to migrate to a free to air Digital TV service either through SAORVIEW or SAORSAT.  I commend RTÉ for this initiative.</p>
            <p eId="para_15348">Ireland is not the only country to have introduced a national TV network on both a terrestrial and satellite platform.  Many countries including the UK have developed their digital networks on both the traditional terrestrial platform and also over satellite.  The reason for this is simple.  It is technically, practically and financially impossible to provide 100% coverage using a terrestrial TV platform. On 21st June I hosted a special digital switchover briefing session to which all Oireachtas members were invited.  At this meeting SAORVIEW and RTÉNL joined us and delivered clear and concise information to those who attended in relation to the monies spent by RTÉNL in rolling out SAORVIEW and SAORSAT, coverage issues and the costs for TV households.  During this meeting they also announced their intention to rollout some additional transmitter sites at Carlingford, Dingle and Ennistymon; Glenties and Clonmany in Donegal, areas of West Cork such as Leap, Bandon, Timoleague, Rosscarbery, Drimoleague, and Mount Gabriel, Kilmacthomas in Waterford and Ballina, County Tipperary.  RTÉ expects that the new sites will be on air in early October.  Information on these sites is available from SAORVIEW and RTÉNL.</p>

            <from>Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources (Deputy Pat Rabbitte)</from>
            <p eId="para_15354">The telecommunications market throughout Ireland has been liberalised since 1999 and thus the delivery of broadband services in any particular region is a matter, in the first instance, for private sector commercial operators who are regulated by the independent regulator, the Commission for Communications Regulation (ComReg).   Information regarding broadband services on a county basis is available using ComReg's callcosts service, accessible at <i>www.callcosts.ie</i>, which also allows users to compare the costs of home phone, broadband, mobile and combined packages.</p>
            <p eId="para_15355">My Department has interevened in the open market on occassions where the open market has failed to deliver adequate communications network capacity in particular areas or regions.  The Metropolitan Areas Networks (MANs) programme is one such intervention, which provides optic fibre networks in designated towns.  They are operated on the Department's behalf by e|net.  The installation of telecommunications ducting in Tuam, capable of supporting an optical fibre telecommunications network, is almost complete.  The ducting was installed in parallel with a major water distribution and drainage project in the town to take advantage of savings on construction costs.  I have asked my officials to liaise directly with e|net to discuss the potential benefits of completing this infrastructure and bringing it into use.</p>
            <p eId="para_15356">The Government also accepts that the widespread availability of high speed broadband is a key requirement to delivering future economic and social development.  This is reflected in a commitment in the Programme for Government to co-invest with the private sector and commercial Semi State sector to provide next generation broadband customer access to every home and business in the State.</p>
            <p eId="para_15357">The report of the Next Generation Broadband Taskforce (NGBT), which I launched on 2 May last and responses to a public consultation which I commenced at the same event, will have an important role to play in this regard.  The public consultation closed in early June and more than 50 responses were received.  Building on the NGBT report and the public consultation responses received, it is my intention to bring proposals for a National Broadband Plan to Government shortly with a view to agreeing a comprehensive set of policy actions to underpin the provision of high speed services on a national basis.</p>

            <p eId="para_15360">From the information that has become available since this issued was raised, I am informed that Reendonegan Lake was created in and around the late 1950s and was stocked as a put and take fishery by the Inland Fisheries Trust.  When originally created the lake had the ability to discharge to the sea with non-return valves which allowed freshwater to exit the lake but prevented the saltwater from re-entering.  It was primarily fresh-water with some salt water influences around the end closest to the sea.  In or around March 2011 following some works to alleviate a gravel build-up on the seaward side of the outfall undertaken by the local interests — the entire outfall gave way and allowed the sea to tidally enter the lake.  The lake is currently salt water.  I have asked Inland Fisheries Ireland to assess the feasibility and practicalities of restoring the barrage — including the appropriate consents, co-operation and agreement of the local interest groups including the Rowing Club and adjacent landowners and costs and revert to me with a plan of action over the next few months.</p>

            <p eId="para_15382">I wish to advise the Deputy that on the 3rd of June 2011 I invited Expressions of Interest from persons wishing to be considered for appointment to vacancies on State Boards under the aegis of my Department, which were expected to occur up to the end of 2011.  On 9th February 2012 I invited further expressions of interest from persons wishing to serve on any of the Boards under the aegis of my Department.  The Deputy will appreciate that appointments to State Boards are made in accordance with the relevant governing statute and the Minister is not obliged to make appointments from tendered expressions of interest but has the discretion to do so if he or she considers it appropriate.</p>
            <p eId="para_15383">There have been 37 appointments made to State Boards under the aegis of my Department since the 9th of March 2011.  The Chairperson appointed to the Board of TG4 has appeared before the Joint Oireachtas Committee.  The following table sets out details of all appointments.</p>

            <p eId="para_15444">A statutory assessment of housing need is carried out every three years by all housing authorities. The Housing Agency's Housing Needs Assessment 2008 and 2011 reports break down the categories of housing need, including in respect of homelessness, for all 88 housing authorities nationwide.  These are available on my Department's website at <i>www.e</i>
                            <i>nviron.ie</i>.</p>
            <p eId="para_15445">However, as the Housing Needs Assessment only counts homeless persons where an application has been made to a housing authority, it was decided in September 2011 that details on the extent of homelessness in the Dublin region, where numbers are most pronounced, would be reviewed and updated using the now fully operational Pathway Accommodation &amp; Support System, PASS, and crosschecked against each of the Dublin local authorities housing management data systems to give an accurate figure of the known homeless population in Dublin.</p>
            <p eId="para_15446">Following extensive cross checking and quality control to remove duplications and ensure accuracy of all data entries the confirmed extent of homelessness in the Dublin region as at September 2011 was 1,891 persons.  PASS, which commenced operation in the Dublin region in 2011, is being extended nationally on a phased basis with work under way in other regions.  It is intended that the PASS system will be operational across the entire country by end 2012.  The PASS system will in future provide good quality and timely data on homelessness nationally as an evidence base for all homelessness services.</p>
            <p eId="para_15447">My Department's role in relation to homelessness involves the provision of a national framework of policy, legislation and funding to underpin the role of housing authorities in addressing homelessness at local level.  Statutory responsibility in relation to the provision of accommodation for homeless persons rests with the housing authorities and the purposes for which housing authorities may incur expenditure in addressing homelessness are prescribed in section 10 of the Housing Act 1988.</p>
            <p eId="para_15448">Funding is used to support emergency, transitional and long-term accommodation of homeless persons, as well as prevention, assessment, placement, outreach and day services.  The throughput of persons - single instance and also repeat presentations to a variety of agencies - receiving assistance and support with emergency homeless accommodation is not collected nationally.  Therefore, my Department does not have information on the number of persons aged 18 to 25 years or their length of stay in emergency homeless accommodation.</p>

These Regulations, which received the positive approval of both Houses of the Oireachtas, include requirements such as:</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_15451">(a) publication of a notice of intention to apply for a licence;</p>

            <p eId="para_15463">The regulations also provide that a local authority may consult any other body, not being a prescribed body, in relation to an application where it considers it appropriate, and that the local authority may take whatever measures it considers necessary, including the convening of meetings or taking of oral submissions, to seek the views of any person in regard to the application.</p>
            <p eId="para_15464">Section 231 provides that where an application is made in accordance with the regulations, the local authority may decide to grant the licence, grant the licence subject to such conditions as it considers appropriate or refuse the licence. Conditions subject to which a licence is granted may relate to, inter alia, the following:</p>
            <p class="indent_3" eId="para_15465">(i) securing the safety of persons at the place in connection with the  event;</p>
            <p class="indent_3" eId="para_15466">(ii) the provision of adequate facilities for the health and welfare of   persons at the place in connection with the event;</p>

            <p class="indent_3" eId="para_15468">(iii) the display of notices for persons attending the event as to their obligations and conduct at the event.</p>
            <p eId="para_15469">Following events at the recent concert in the Phoenix Park, I anticipate that the relevant licensing authority, Dublin City Council, will be reviewing this event, in consultation with the promoters and other bodies as appropriate, to see what lessons should be learned and whether changes to the licensing system are necessary.  My Department will be in contact with the council in this regard.</p>

            <p eId="para_15752">For the purposes of implementing Axes 3 and 4 (LEADER) of the Rural Development Programme 2007-13 (RDP), the following areas are excluded:</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_15753">The City Council boundaries of Dublin, Cork, Galway, Waterford and Limerick.</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_15754">The Borough Council boundaries of Kilkenny, Sligo and Wexford.</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_15755">The Town Council boundaries of Athlone, Ballina, Castlebar, Cavan, Dundalk, Ennis, Killarney, Letterkenny, Mallow, Monaghan, Mullingar, Tralee, Tuam and Tullamore.</p>
            <p eId="para_15756">During negotiations in respect of the RDP, the European Commission indicated that the OECD definition of rural areas should be used to define the rural areas that would be covered by the Programme.  The OECD defines rural areas as those with a population density of less than 150 persons per square kilometre.  However, it was considered, in the Irish context, that a more appropriate course of action would be to remove the urban areas defined as hubs and gateways in the National Spatial Strategy from coverage under the Programme.</p>
            <p eId="para_15757">The use of this definition, rather than a population density calculation, ensures that Axes 3 and 4 RDP funding is available to a more significant number of rural areas, which would otherwise not receive funding under the Programme.  This approach was adopted following detailed negotiations with the European Commission and is the best possible outcome in relation to Programme coverage. The positive impact on rural areas outweighs any potential loss in hubs and gateways and, in overall terms, the level of investment resulting from the RDP is a significant boost to the country as a whole.</p>
            <p eId="para_15758">In very exceptional circumstances, and with the prior written approval of the Department projects may be eligible in hub towns, where the service is being delivered to the rural population in their homes/area.  Furthermore, such projects are only allowed where it is not feasible or technically possible to provide the service in the rural area. One of the aims of the RDP is to encourage the development of such facilities in the areas covered by the Programme. In the case of this project, no rationale or evidence was provided that supported the determination that it was not feasible or technically possible to situate the facility in an area covered by the RDP.</p>

            <p eId="para_15760">On foot of the recommendations of the Keane Report on mortgage arrears, the Government launched a mortgage to rent scheme on a pilot basis in February 2012. This scheme was extended nationally in June 2012, targeting those low income families whose mortgage situation is unsustainable and where there is little or no prospect of a significant change in circumstances in the foreseeable future.  The scheme ensures that the family remains in their home, while ownership is transferred to an approved housing body who in turn rent it to the original owners.</p>
            <p eId="para_15761">Householders seeking to avail of the mortgage to rent scheme must meet the following criteria:</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_15762">have had their mortgage deemed unsustainable under a Mortgage Arrears Resolution Process as provided for under the Central Bank's Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears;</p>

            <p eId="para_15767">More than sixty cases are currently being processed under this scheme, with an expected take-up of approximately one hundred families in 2012.</p>
            <p eId="para_15768">The scheme will run for a period of three years, after which it will be reviewed.</p>

            <from>Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government (Deputy Phil Hogan)</from>
            <p eId="para_15783">The Local Government (Household Charge) Act 2011 provides the legislative basis for the household charge.  Under the Act, an owner of a residential property on the liability date of 1 January 2012 is liable to pay the household charge, unless otherwise exempted or entitled to claim a waiver.  The household charge is on a self-assessment basis and it is a matter for an owner of a residential property on the liability date to determine if he or she has a liability and, if so, to declare that liability and pay the household charge.</p>
            <p eId="para_15784">Section 4(4)(b) and section 4(6) of the Act provide that a waiver from the charge applies in 2012 and 2013 to properties in certain unfinished housing estates specified in a list prescribed by the Minister.  As part of the process of preparing the National Housing Development Survey 2011, published by my Department in October 2011, local authorities provided details of all unfinished housing developments in their areas. Unfinished housing developments were divided into four categories as follows:</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_15785">Category one, where the development is still being actively completed by the developer, or where no serious public safety issues exist;</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_15786">Category two, where a receiver has been appointed;</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_15787">Category three, where a receiver has not been appointed and the developer is still in place but effectively inactive; and</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_15788">Category four, where the development has been effectively abandoned and is posing serious problems for residents.</p>
            <p eId="para_15789">Other relevant factors for the purposes of the categorisation process include, <i>inter alia</i>:</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_15790">the state of completion of roads, footpaths, public lighting facilities, piped water and sewerage facilities and open spaces or similar amenities within the development;</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_15791">the extent to which the development complies with the terms of applicable planning permission;</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_15792">the extent to which it complies with the provisions of the Building Control Acts 1990 and 2007;</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_15793">the provisions of the Local Government (Sanitary Services) Act 1964 as they pertain to dangerous places and dangerous structures within the meaning of the Act;</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_15794">the extent to which facilities within the development have been taken in charge by the local authority concerned; and</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_15795">where there is an agreement regarding the maintenance of such facilities, the extent to which this agreement has been complied with.</p>
            <p eId="para_15796">In some cases a local authority may have found that conditions in respect of a certain phase of a development were relatively good and that, for example, no serious public safety issues could be identified. This phase of the development may have been categorised under category 1 or 2. Conversely, safety issues may have been identified in another phase of the same overall development, or development in that second phase may have been abandoned altogether, implying a category 3 or 4 identification for that phase.</p>
            <p eId="para_15797">This categorisation formed the basis for the list of those unfinished developments eligible for a waiver on the annual household charge.</p>
            <p eId="para_15798">Only households in developments in categories three and four are eligible for the waiver from payment of the household charge. The list of developments in which households are eligible for the waiver in 2012 is set out under the Local Government (Household Charge) Regulations 2012 and forms the complete list of such developments for this year.  A revised list of estates will be prescribed for 2013 after which time the waiver for unfinished housing developments will end.</p>
            <p eId="para_15799">Throughout this period it is anticipated that the numbers of categories 3 and 4 developments will decrease as my Department continues to work with local authorities and other stakeholders to resolve outstanding issues, including through the Public Safety Initiative.</p>

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government (Deputy Jan O’Sullivan)</from>
            <p eId="para_16071">Exchequer allocations for 2012 in respect of the Housing Adaptation Grant Schemes for Older People and People with a Disability, totalling some €54.2 million, were notified to local authorities on 28 February.  To date some €22.3 million of this has been drawn down by local authorities, facilitating the payment of over 4,300 grants.  In assessing the demand for grants each year local authorities are requested to set out the amount of matching funding being provided to meet the authority's 20% share of the grant payments. Collectively local authorities indicated that some €18.65 million in matching funds is available in 2012. This is more than adequate to meet the own resources contribution and is significantly greater than the €15.4 million contribution by local authorities to the grant schemes in 2011.</p>
            <p eId="para_16072">I will make every effort to ensure that funding for the suite of grants continues to receive priority in 2013, notwithstanding the constraints on the public capital programme. My Department will be contacting local authorities later this year to ascertain the position with regard to funding requirements for 2013 and the amount of available matching funding to support the grant schemes.</p>

            <p eId="para_16074">The Local Government (Charges) Act 2009, as amended, broadened the revenue base of local authorities through the introduction of the charge on non-principal private residences (NPPR).  The charge is set at €200 and is being levied and collected by local authorities.  The Act places the onus on an owner of a residential property which is situated in the State to assess his or her liability for the charge in the first instance.</p>
            <p eId="para_16075">The Act defines "residential property" as a "... building that is situated in the State and that is occupied, or suitable for occupation, as a separate dwelling . . . " There are a number of indicators as to what makes a property suitable for occupation for the purposes of determining liability for the NPPR charge.  These include the structure of the property, whether or not it has a roof, whether or not it is so affected by dampness as to render it unsuitable for habitation, and whether or not it has sanitary facilities, including a water closet and water supply.  A property that is not suitable for occupation should not be regarded as a residential property within the meaning of the Act.</p>
            <p eId="para_16076">There is no provision in the legislation to opt out or "de-register".  The Act places the onus on an owner of a residential property to assess his or her liability to the charge on the liability date and, if liable, to declare that liability and to pay the charge in respect of that property by the due date.  If a property does not meet the criteria for the charge, there is no liability.</p>
            <p eId="para_16077">The Act places collection of the charge under the care and management of the relevant local authority.</p>

            <p eId="para_16086">I propose to take Questions Nos. 452 to 454, inclusive, together.</p>
            <p eId="para_16087">Legal proceedings in relation to various aspects of the situation at Priory Hall remain before the courts and it would be inappropriate to anticipate the outcome of those proceedings at this stage.</p>
            <p eId="para_16088">The recent adjournment of the appeal by Dublin City Council against an order of the High Court in relation to the accommodation and ancillary charges of vacated residents to allow for a conciliation process chaired by Mr. Justice Finnegan provides an appropriate context for the parties concerned to work together towards identifying a way forward in relation to this complex problem.  The outcome of this process is awaited and it is important that all concerned afford Mr. Justice Finnegan the opportunity to complete the task which he has agreed to undertake.</p>
            <p eId="para_16089">Dublin City Council has made significant efforts to provide for the needs of residents to date and will continue to work proactively on their behalf towards achieving the much needed resolution of the issues at Priory Hall.  Annual Fire Prevention Statistics are published on my Department's website <i>www.environ.ie</i>.  The statistical returns for 2009, the most recent year for which returns are currently available, show that 12 prosecutions took place in that year alone. It is the case that the legal proceedings at Priory Hall arose from enforcement action undertaken under the Fire Service Acts of 1981 and 2003.  This is in complete contrast to the situations at Belmayne and The Laurels where the respective parties concerned have both faced up to their responsibilities and are cooperating fully with the relevant local authorities in relation to planning and executing the necessary remediation works, and bearing the full costs of such works together with the costs of alternative temporary relocation for affected residents.</p>
            <p eId="para_16090">Local authorities have extensive powers of inspection and enforcement under the Building Control Acts, the Fire Services Acts and the Planning and Development Acts and have already used such powers on a number of occasions in recent times where concerns in relation to a number of developments have arisen.  While neither I, nor my Department, have any direct role in relation to such inspection and enforcement activity, I urge local authorities to continue to use all of the powers currently available to them to address issues of building standards compliance, including in relation to fire safety, on behalf of affected residents in buildings where concerns arise.</p>

            <from>Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government (Deputy Phil Hogan)</from>
            <p eId="para_16092">On 3 July 2012 Dublin Fire Brigade, as the relevant Fire Authority, was notified that construction defects giving rise to fire safety concerns had come to attention in relation to a development at Dundrum View, also known as the Laurels, in Dublin 16.  The development consists of three apartment blocks with a total of 80 apartments, 68 of which are let to private tenants.</p>
            <p eId="para_16093">It is understood that the concerns came to light while repairs were being carried out to the development, which led to the receiver in charge of the development becoming aware that the development as constructed was not in compliance with the relevant Fire Safety Certificate.</p>
            <p eId="para_16094">It is understood that the receiver, acting responsibly in consultation with fire consultants, has undertaken to revert to the Fire Authority with proposals to arrive at a workable and manageable solution for necessary remediation works.  The receiver has also confirmed that the residents will be moved to alternative accommodation pending and during remediation works.  While this is obviously a stressful and distressing situation for the residents it is understood that they will not be required to meet rent or utility charges while in temporary accommodation, which is expected to be for a period of at least three months.</p>
            <p eId="para_16095">The statutory responsibility for compliance with the Building Regulations rests with designers, builders and building owners. In this context the party with legal responsibility for the development at Dundrum View has acted responsibly by declaring the problem to the Fire Authority on the understanding that it will be remediated to the satisfaction of the Fire Authority with the costs being fully met by the receiver.</p>
            <p eId="para_16096">The Chief Fire Officer has engaged, and will continue to engage, in detailed discussions with each of the other parties involved in the process, namely Dun Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council as Building Control Authority, the receiver and their consultants, with the objective of ensuring that all necessary remedial action can be taken in the shortest possible timeframe.  I have also asked my Department to continue to liaise with Dun Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council in relation to the evolving situation at Dundrum View.</p>
            <p eId="para_16097">In relation to the proposed Building Control (Amendment) Regulations which will provide for mandatory certification of compliance with the requirements of the Building Regulations and for the submission of drawings demonstrating how the building concerned has been designed and built to comply with all parts of the Building Regulations, including Part B (Fire Safety), the position is that the proposed regulations were released for public consultation earlier this year.  The public consultation period has now concluded and my Department is currently reviewing the submissions received with a view to having a definitive set of Building Control (Amendment) Regulations agreed and signed into law in the coming months.</p>
            <p eId="para_16098">Mandatory certification and the submission of drawings are key reforms which I believe will have the capacity to improve the quality of buildings and will lead to a further strengthening of the regulatory regime.</p>

            <p eId="para_16121">The Water Services Investment Programme 2010-2013, provides for the development of a comprehensive range of new water services infrastructure in County Kerry.  The Programme includes contracts under construction and to commence to the value of over €92 million in Kerry during the period of the Programme.  However, the Castleisland Sewerage Scheme was not amongst the priority contracts and schemes selected for inclusion in the current Programme.</p>
            <p eId="para_16122">The Programme aims to prioritise projects that target environmental compliance issues and support economic and employment growth.  A key input to the development of the Programme was the assessment of needs prepared by local authorities, including Kerry County Council, in response to my Department's request to the authorities in 2009 to review and prioritise their proposals for new capital works in their areas.  These were subsequently appraised in the Department in the context of the funds available and key criteria that complemented those used by the authorities. Inevitably, through this process, certain projects that had been proposed had to give way to others that were more strategically important at that time.</p>

            <p eId="para_16129">Local authorities have long been the lenders of last resort servicing the housing loans needs of less affluent members of society. In the present economic circumstances it is to be anticipated that the ability of some borrowers to service housing loans may become restricted and that a number of loans may fall into arrears. Section 34 of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009 provides local authorities with powers to deal flexibly with distressed borrowers, and they have demonstrated sensitivity over the years in dealing with such cases. In March 2010 my Department issued guidelines to local authorities, based upon the Central Bank's first Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears, which continued the tradition of handling arrears in a manner that is sympathetic to the needs of the particular household, while also protecting the position of the local authority concerned.</p>
            <p eId="para_16130">To reflect the content of the Central Bank's revised Code of Conduct — which replaced the previous code from 1 January 2011 and was informed by the deliberations of the Expert Group on Mortgage Arrears and Personal Debt — my Department recently issued updated guidance to local authorities in consultation with the County and City Managers Association. This will further enable local authorities to provide a range of flexible repayment options for households in difficulty.</p>
            <p eId="para_16131">In particular, the introduction of a Mortgage Arrears Resolution Process (MARP), which closely mirrors the suite of options available in the commercial sector, will present borrowers in difficulty with a range of alternative payment agreements, which can be accessed to ease the particular circumstances of each case. This process will feature a standard set of options including, in cases of certain unsustainable mortgages, the facility of mortgage-to-rent. Local authorities have been restructuring loans for some time using their own internal practices. The introduction of these revised guidelines will standardise the approach across the whole sector, introduce a systematic structure to this area and provide borrowers with a transparent and accessible model for arrears resolution.</p>
            <p eId="para_16132">I expect that the adoption of these revised guidelines will serve simultaneously to help resolve mortgage difficulties for both local authorities and their borrowers.</p>

            <from>Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government (Deputy Phil Hogan)</from>
            <p eId="para_16141">The ban on the marketing, sale and distribution of bituminous fuel (or ‘smoky coal ban' as it is commonly known) was first introduced in Dublin in 1990 in response to severe episodes of winter smog that resulted from the widespread use of smoky coal for residential heating.  The ban proved effective in reducing particulate matter and sulphur dioxide levels and was subsequently extended to other urban areas. The ban   now applies in twenty towns and cities around the country.</p>
            <p eId="para_16142">Inhalation of particles can increase the risk or severity of cardiovascular disease and respiratory illness.  Air quality monitoring carried out by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) shows that the ban has reduced pollutant emissions very significantly in areas where it has been applied.  Reductions of black smoke emissions range from a minimum of 45% in the smaller cities and towns to a high of 70% in Dublin. This has resulted in greatly improved ambient air quality in these areas with consequent health benefits.  Research has indicated that the ban in Dublin in 1990 resulted in up to 350 fewer deaths from winter mortality, with an estimated value of these benefits in monetary terms put at over €20 million.  The EPA has recommended the extension of the ban to all urban areas in order to deliver further improvements to air quality.</p>
            <p eId="para_16143">In April 2012, my Department undertook a public consultation to inform and assist a review of the smoky coal ban regulations to ensure that they remain fit for purpose in safeguarding air quality by limiting harmful emissions of air pollutants arising from the use of residential fuels.  A total of 49 submissions were received, including submissions from the industry representative Solid Fuel Trade Group (SFTG) as well as individual fuel suppliers.</p>
            <p eId="para_16144">On 9 July, following the review of submissions received under the public consultation process, I announced the extension of the ban to the use of smoky coal within ban areas to complement the existing ban on the marketing, sale and distribution and amendments to the boundaries of existing ban areas to take account of recent population growth and development.  In addition, the ban will be extended to six new towns with populations greater than 15,000 people, as per Census 2011, with effect from May 2013: these towns are Greystones, Letterkenny, Mullingar, Navan, Newbridge and Portlaoise.  Wicklow Town will also be included among the new towns subject to the ban, following requests from Wicklow County Council and local representatives.    The lead-in period for these new towns will allow local authorities and fuel retailers time to familiarise themselves with the new regulatory requirements in preparation for the switch-over to smokeless fuels.</p>
            <p eId="para_16145">My Department is currently consulting with relevant local authorities to finalise the proposed boundaries for the ban areas in these new towns.  The boundaries will be based on Census 2011 data and will also include appropriate areas in the vicinity of these towns where the premises of solid fuel retailers supplying the local residential market are located. This will ensure that the provisions of the ban are applied evenly to all local retailers and will support the effective implementation of the ban.  A set of maps showing the new ban areas is being prepared and will shortly be made available to the public to view and download on my Department's website, <i>www.environ.ie</i>.</p>

            <p eId="para_16150">Under section 159 of the Local Government Act 2001, each City and County Manager is responsible for staffing and organisational arrangements necessary for carrying out the functions of the local authorities for which he or she is responsible. Under the terms of the on-going moratorium each local authority must seek sanction from my Department to fill any vacancies. My Department works closely with local authorities to ensure that critical posts are filled while overall numbers reductions are achieved in line with budgetary and employment control constraints.</p>
            <p eId="para_16151">My Department provides capital funding towards approved refurbishment and renovation, and new library projects carried out by local authorities, subject to availability of resources.</p>

         his plans to address youth homelessness in view of the fact that many young persons once they turn 18 years find their income is too low for them to move into private accommodation and away from emergency accommodation, to live in self sustainable conditions which support their determination to gain income and job security; his further plans to help young persons move away from homelessness and emergency accommodation towards gaining housing security and job security; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

            <p eId="para_16155">Responsibility for welfare payments is a matter for my colleague the Minister for Social Protection.</p>
            <p eId="para_16156">My Department's role in relation to homelessness involves the provision of a national framework of policy, legislation and funding to underpin the role of housing authorities in addressing homelessness at local or regional level.  Statutory responsibility in relation to the provision of accommodation and related services for homeless persons rests with the housing authorities and the implementation of the homeless strategy at local and regional level is being carried out through the framework of statutory homelessness action plans adopted by housing authorities.</p>
            <p eId="para_16157">The Programme for Government is committed to reviewing and updating the national adult Homeless Strategy including a specific focus on youth homelessness, and to implementing a housing led approach to homelessness. Work is now almost complete on updating the strategy and the review will take account of demands on existing housing, assess how best to continue providing services and seek to ensure more effective prevention strategies.</p>
            <p eId="para_16158">There is no single solution to increasing the level of social housing supply for the homeless, and maximising delivery will require flexible and diverse approaches. The initial emphasis will necessarily be on the Dublin region, where homeless numbers are most acute, by moving away from the current over reliance on emergency accommodation provision to a more permanent accommodation solution.  This is to be achieved through a number of measures including:</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_16159">directly linking the provision of funding with specific targets and outcomes;</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_16160">making better use of the existing available accommodation units in the local authorities and in the voluntary sector;</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_16161">additional social housing provision through acquisitions and remedial works/upgrading of vacant local authority housing stock and a leasing programme;</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_16162">ongoing engagement with NAMA to secure properties;</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_16163">targeted use of the Rental Accommodation Scheme (RAS);</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_16164">an enhanced role for the private rental sector;</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_16165">better co-ordination with the voluntary and cooperative housing sector; and</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_16166">the establishment of Homeless Action Teams across all regions.</p>
            <p eId="para_16167">My Department's current funding provision for the running costs of homeless accommodation and related services for 2012 is €50 million, which, together with 10% provided from housing authorities' own resources, brings the total available funding to €55.55 million in 2012. This level of funding means that there will be no reduction in the provision of essential frontline support services.</p>
            <p eId="para_16168">Responsibility for the new Youth Homeless Strategy rests primarily with the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs in view of the HSEfor the care and welfare of children and young people (up to age 18) who can no longer remain at home.  I intend to work closely with Minister Fitzgerald in the interests of joined up service provision and proper care and discharge procedures to ensure that 18 year olds moving on from child-care services have appropriate follow-up care and accommodation arrangements in place to prevent homelessness.</p>

Progress, in the context of the legal "winding up" process, is currently ongoing.   Local Action Groups in contiguous geographical areas have been engaged to implement an interim system to facilitate grant payment to projects that were at an advanced stage of development. Many of these project files have now been sent to the relevant Local Action Groups who are contacting the promoters directly to facilitate payment going forward. I can confirm that the file for the project referred to in the question is with my Department, as, following a project review, a letter was issued to the promoter on 12 August 2011 indicating that the project is ineligible under the rules of the Rural Development Programme 2007-13.

            <p eId="para_16172">The Local Government (Charges) Act 2009, as amended, broadened the revenue base of local authorities through the introduction of the charge on non-principal private residences (NPPR).  The charge is set at €200 and is being levied and collected by local authorities.  The Act places the onus on an owner of a residential property which is situated in the State to assess his or her liability for the charge in the first instance.</p>
            <p eId="para_16173">The Local Government (Charges) Act 2009, as amended, exempts certain types of property and owners from the charge.  The most important exemption under the Act is for a person's sole or main residence.  However, any one individual can have only one such residence.   Where a property is not occupied by the owner, it falls liable for the levy, even if it is the only property that person owns.</p>

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government (Deputy Jan O’Sullivan)</from>
            <p eId="para_16179">I am chairing the National Co-ordination Committee on Unfinished Housing Developments (NCC) to oversee implementation of the Report of the Advisory Group on Unfinished Housing Developments, together with the Government's response to the recommendations. The NCC includes representatives from the Irish Banking Federation, local authorities, the Housing and Sustainable Communities Agency, NAMA and the construction sector and real progress is being made with regard to the public safety works required to improve the living conditions of existing residents on some unfinished estates.</p>
            <p eId="para_16180">As part of the work of the NCC, my Department initiated a pilot project for the resolution of sites using the Site Resolution Plan (SRP) process, and issued a working template in order to establish best practice in this area. I intend that the process, which is pivotal to the resolution of problem sites, will be used more extensively in the coming year. Ultimately, the initiation of the SRP process in respect of a particular development is a matter for the local authority concerned. However, progress by local authorities in ensuring that developers complete and/or resolve unfinished housing developments is continuing, by means of quarterly status reports to the NCC.</p>
            <p eId="para_16181">SRPs are a key tool in resolving issues associated with unfinished housing developments. Such plans enable developers to work with local authorities, financial institutions, NAMA and residents in determining how best to pursue resolution of problematic sites. The process also entails working with stakeholders in identifying the best long-term solution for developments in terms of their configuration, use of vacant buildings and ownership.  Such solutions should also take account of the best interests of residents.The first Annual Progress Report of the NCC, published by my Department on 5 July, confirmed that, through the use of the SRP process, 211 estates have now been completed and issues are now resolved. On a further 523 estates, plans are now in place and in many of these cases work has commenced and significant progress will be achieved over the coming months. I anticipate that this progress will be reflected in the 2012 National Housing Development Survey now underway. Details of individual Site Resolution Plans are kept by the individual local authorities concerned, and my Department does not collate information in this regard.</p>
            <p eId="para_16182">In addition, under the Public Safety Initiative, my Department has made allocations totalling some €3.21 million to 21 local authorities from the funding made available to address immediate public safety issues in 2011. The types of works that have been approved to date include the fencing off of unsecured and hazardous areas, capping of pipes, installation of street lighting and other works to secure sites.</p>
            <p eId="para_16183">A provision of €2m has been made for 2012 and my Department will be making further allocations as applications are received from local authorities and assessed. To date, a total of €1.726 million has been drawn down by local authorities.</p>

The project was assessed using the relevant system and approval was given for a grant amount of €200,000.</p>
            <p eId="para_16186">EU State Aid rules dictate that any project which involves economic activity can only be funded to a maximum of €200,000, known as the de minimis limit. This project was considered under the Basic Services measure of the Rural Development Programme 2007-13 (RDP) which has a State Aid exemption for projects that do not involve economic activity and allows the RDP to fund such projects to a maximum grant of €500,000. The Ballroom of Romance project involves a significant level of economic activity and as such does not conform to the State Aid exemption for this measure. In this context it was not possible to approve the €485,349.37 funding requested.</p>
            <p eId="para_16187">The Local Development Company in this instance, Leitrim Local Development, has notified the Department of its intention to appeal this decision. When it is received the appeal will be dealt with in due course.</p>

            <p eId="para_16203">I propose to take Questions Nos. 480 to 483, inclusive, together.</p>
            <p eId="para_16204">Policy and guidance in relation to Public Private Partnerships generally are matters for the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform.</p>
            <p eId="para_16205">Local authorities are independent statutory bodies, with democratically elected councils and their own management system. Section 63(3) of the Local Government Act 2001 provides that, subject to law, a local authority is independent in the performance of its functions. The Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government's role in relation to local authorities is primarily to provide the policy, financial and legislative framework within which local authorities perform their functions. Local authorities may enter into and implement Public Private Partnerships pursuant to the State Authorities (Public Private Partnership Arrangements) Act 2002.  As with other public authorities, local authority actions are subject to review by way of audit, by the Ombudsman in accordance with the relevant statutory requirements and by the courts.</p>
            <p eId="para_16206">Where development is proposed to be carried out on behalf of or in partnership with a local authority in its own functional area pursuant to a contract with the authority, for example by way of Public Private Partnership, section 179 of the Planning and Development Act 2000 and Part 8 of the Planning and Development Regulations 2001 apply, under which the development must be approved by the elected members, following a public consultation process. Where, however, the development would require environmental impact assessment or appropriate assessment, it must be submitted to An Bord Pleanála for approval under section 175 or section 177AE, respectively, of the 2000 Act. Neither the approval given by the elected members under Part 8 of the Regulations nor the approval given by the Board under section 175 or section 177AE normally contains a time limit, so the question of the extension of the duration of the approval would not arise.</p>
            <p eId="para_16207">Part VIII of the 2000 Act provides that the enforcement of planning control is a matter for individual local planning authorities. Under section 30 of the 2000 Act, the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government is specifically precluded from exercising any power or control in relation to any particular case, including an enforcement matter, with which a planning authority or An Bord Pleanála is or may be concerned.</p>

            <p eId="para_16209">On 6 July 2012, I issued a notice of intent to issue a Direction, together with a draft Direction, to Clare County Council relating to the South Clare Local Area Plan 2012-2018 as adopted by the elected members on 11 June 2012.  I formed the provisional opinion to issue such notice on the basis that the Planning Authority had ignored or not taken account of a submission made on my behalf in April 2012 in respect of the proposed material alterations to the draft Local Area Plan and that the Plan is not in compliance with the requirements of section 19, 20 and 177V of the Planning and Development Act 2000 (as amended).</p>
            <p eId="para_16210">Directive 92/43/EC on the conservation of natural habitats and wild fauna and flora (Habitats Directive) has been fully transposed into Irish law by means of the Planning and Development (Amendment) Act 2010, as amended, and by the European Communities (Birds and Natural Habitats) Regulations 2011.  Clare County Council as the competent authority, as appropriate, for the purposes of Part XAB of the Planning and Development (Amendment) Act 2010, published in September 2011 a Natura Impact Report (or Habitats Directive Assessment) for the purposes of Article 6 of the Directive on the implications of the draft South Clare Local Area Plan 2012-2018 on any Natura 2000 sites.  In addition, the Council published, in March 2012, a Natura Impact Report for the proposed material alterations to the draft Plan.  The Habitats Directive Assessment undertaken by Clare County Council, as the competent authority, on the proposed material alteration of the site in question, required that the lands remain zoned as per the draft South Clare Local Area Plan 2012-2018.  Both reports are available to download from the Council's website <i> www.clarecoco.ie.</i>

            <p eId="para_16263">To take account of the current housing market conditions, the Government's housing policy statement, published in June 2011, announced the standing down of all affordable housing schemes in the context of a full review of Part V of the Planning and Development Act 2000. That review is now underway and it is expected to conclude later in the year. Any future changes to legislation governing affordable housing schemes will be informed by the review. The claw-back provision is intended to prevent short-term profit taking on the resale of the house to the detriment of the objectives of the schemes. However, where a person is selling and the clawback amount payable would reduce the proceeds of resale below the initial price actually paid, the legislation provides for the amount of the clawback payable to be reduced to the extent necessary to avoid that result.</p>

            <p eId="para_16270">I propose to take Questions Nos. 489 and 490 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_16271">The Dormant Accounts legislation allows for the disbursal of Dormant Accounts funding under the following themes:</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_16272">To improve the quality of life and reduce isolation for people who are economically or socially disadvantaged (Category A — Economic and Social Disadvantage)</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_16273">To improve opportunities for individuals who are economically or socially disadvantaged to overcome the impediments arising from such disadvantage through deriving appropriate benefit from education (Category B — Educational Disadvantage);</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_16274">To enhance the potential for persons with a disability to play a more active role in society and increase their level of independence (Category C — Supports for people with Disabilities).</p>
            <p eId="para_16275">These categories remain the focus under the Dormant Accounts (Amendment) Act, 2012, signed into law on 11 July 2012.</p>
            <p eId="para_16276">Given the special nature of dormant accounts funds which effectively are made up of private citizens' money, not Exchequer funding, there is a legitimate public expectation that the disbursement process should be transparent and equitable. The 2012 Act strengthens Government and Oireachtas oversight of the area, while at the same time simplifying administrative arrangements and the associated processes in respect of grants awarded from the Dormant Accounts Fund.  Details of proposed schemes, actions plans, the listing of all approved measures and projects, and the annual report will be laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas. Particular care is taken in the new legislation to ensure Oireachtas/public scrutiny of these processes, and ongoing reviews will be available to the public.</p>
            <p eId="para_16277">Given its focus, as set down in the legislation, a significant proportion of the funding disbursed to date from the Fund has been channelled through community and voluntary groups with a particular focus on socially excluded communities. This is in addition to the other supports provided by my Department to that sector annually through other programmes and schemes.  The intention has always been to provide for a broad and balanced range of potential beneficiaries from dormant accounts disbursements and this remains the focus under the new Act.</p>

            <p eId="para_16321">Section 28 of the Radiological Protection Act 1991 provides for the appointment of inspectors by RPII for the purposes of the Act. Section 29 sets out the powers of those appointed inspectors. In particular, Section 29(3)(a) provides that in pursuance of those powers the inspector has the power, inter alia, to enter at all times any building, land or other place, aircraft, marine vessel, lorry or other vehicle. There is no requirement for a search warrant.</p>
            <p eId="para_16322">Section 252 of the Planning and Development Act 2000 provides members of the Board of An Bord Pleanála and inspectors authorised by the Board under the section power to enter land in connection with the carrying out of functions under the Act. All of the Board's inspectors, and consultants engaged by the Board on casework, are appointed by the Board to be authorised persons under Section 252.</p>
            <p eId="para_16323">Section 13 of the Environmental Protection Agency Act 1992 provides that an authorised person may enter a premises at reasonable times, for purposes connected with that Act. Where that premises is a private dwelling, 24 hours written notice must be provided or the consent of the occupier must be received. Where an authorised person in the exercise of his powers under this section is prevented from entering any premises, or where he has reason to believe that evidence related to a suspected offence under this Act may be removed or destroyed, the authorised person or the person by whom he was appointed may apply to the District Court for a warrant authorising such entry. The Environmental Protection Agency also has powers of entry under the Water Pollution Act 1977, European Communities (Good Agricultural Practice for protection of Waters) Regulations 2010, the Dumping at Sea Act 1996 and the Water Services Acts 2007 and 2012.</p>
            <p eId="para_16324">Section 111 of the Residential Tenancies Act 2004 provides that a mediator, adjudicator or member of the Rent Tribunal or the Private Residential Tenancies Board dealing with a dispute under Part 6 of the Act may enter and inspect a dwelling to which the dispute relates for the purposes of their functions under that Part. There is no provision for making an application for a search warrant under the section.</p>

            <p eId="para_16326">The Rental Accommodation Scheme (RAS) is an initiative to cater for the accommodation needs of certain persons in receipt of rent supplement, normally for more than 18 months and who are assessed as having a long-term housing need. Since 1 April 2011 formal legislative recognition has been given to the scheme.</p>
            <p eId="para_16327">Data supplied quarterly to my Department by the Department of Social Protection enable local authorities to identify all those persons in receipt of rent supplement for 18 months or more who are eligible to transfer to RAS. At the end of March 2012 there were 53,935 individuals on rent supplement for 18 months or longer.</p>
            <p eId="para_16328">While the list of individuals who are on rent supplement for more than 18 months is the main source of transfers to RAS, housing authorities seeking to source additional accommodation use a range of methods to encourage landlords to provide accommodation including local advertising and direct contact.</p>

This latter was not among the material lodged with Boston College and is subject to other arrangements. The material lodged with Boston College is of a general nature.</p>

            <p eId="para_16535">Notwithstanding this, the Deputy will be aware that under the Garda Síochána Acts 2005 — 2007, the Commissioner is required to submit, before November of each year, a policing plan for the forthcoming year.  Any proposals for the closure of Garda stations or the altering of Regional or Divisional boundaries must be set out in that plan. While the Policing Plan for 2013 has not yet been submitted to me, I expect that it will contain measures to address the ongoing issue of rationalisation of the Garda station network. It would therefore be premature to speculate on specific measures which this might involve.</p>
            <p eId="para_16536">In making his assessments on these matters the Garda Commissioner has asked each  Divisional Officer to assess the level of activity in each Garda Station in their area. It must be stressed that the key objective of any station closure is to promote the more efficient and effective deployment of resources rather than secure specific cash saving.</p>
            <p eId="para_16537">The Deputy will also be aware that the Commissioner is responsible for the detailed allocation of resources, including personnel, throughout the organisation and I have no function in the matter. This allocation of resources is constantly monitored in the context of crime trends, policing needs and other operational strategies in place on a District, Divisional and Regional level to ensure optimum use is made of Garda resources and the best possible Garda service is provided to the public. Kildare Garda Division and indeed the area referred to by the Deputy will be subject to this same level of monitoring to ensure that optimum use is made of Garda resources and the best possible Garda service is provided to the public.</p>

            <p eId="para_16543">I can inform the Deputy that on 19 June 2012 I published a report on the criminal justice aspects of the cash for gold trade which was prepared by my Department. I have stated that while the relevant criminal justice law is adequate to deal with the transactions in question, it is arguably inconsistent that there are rules and regulations that apply to pawnbrokers for the protection of the public and that similar rules do not apply to cash for gold outlets.</p>
            <p eId="para_16544">I have formally requested the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Justice, Equality and Defence to consider the content of the report, that it considers holding hearings on the issues raised in the report, that it obtains the views of all relevant interested parties and that it makes such report and recommendations to the Houses of the Oireachtas and to Government as it deems proportionate and appropriate in the public interest.</p>

            <p eId="para_16704">I propose to take Questions Nos. 513 and 514 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_16705">The procedure attached to the Convention on the Elimination of All forms of Violence against Women asks State Parties to submit a bi-annual report, although the examining CEDAW Committee only has the capacity to review fewer than 25 reports each year.  There are 187 Parties to the Convention.  As a result, a number of State Parties submit combined reports covering two and three reporting periods to alleviate the work load of the examining committee and their own work load.</p>
            <p eId="para_16706">My Department is working on the next report to CEDAW at present but has also been undertaking a comprehensive review of the implementation of the National Women's Strategy 2007 — 2016 which is providing invaluable information for incorporation into the CEDAW report and which is approaching completion.</p>
            <p eId="para_16707">Preparation of the CEDAW Report requires us to address all aspects of women's human rights, in an "all of Government" context.  In preparing the CEDAW Report, and in completing the Review of the National Women's Strategy, consultation takes place with civil society, including representatives of the trade unions, the employers' organisations, the community and voluntary sector and the National Women's Council of Ireland.  A further consultation with civil society will take place before the final report is completed.  It is also open to civil society to submit shadow reports.</p>
            <p eId="para_16708">The Department continues to work on this wide-reaching task and will invite the Department of Foreign Affairs to submit the next combined CEDAW Report to the Secretary General of the United Nations at the earliest opportunity.</p>

            <from>Minister for Justice and Equality (Deputy Alan Shatter)</from>
            <p eId="para_16710">The Reception and Integration Agency (RIA) of my Department is charged with responsibility for the accommodation of asylum seekers while their applications for protection are being processed.  Currently, there are over 5,000 persons accommodated in 37 RIA centres located throughout the State.</p>
            <p eId="para_16711">I should firstly say that the correspondence supplied seems be only part of a longer piece from the Newbridge Asylum Support Group and relates to recent issues in the Eyre Powell Asylum Accommodation Centre in Newbridge which is under contract to RIA for the accommodation of asylum seekers.</p>
            <p eId="para_16712">Before dealing with the broader issues raised here, I want to explain that on 10 April, 2012 a detailed written complaint listing 12 areas of concern, signed by a number of residents, was sent to the manager of the Eyre Powell centre through the aforementioned support group. The concerns revolved around food, hygiene and the attitude of management towards residents. The complaint was simultaneously copied to, among others, the media, local TD's, various official bodies and other NGOs.</p>
            <p eId="para_16713">RIA is confident that the independent company contracted to carry out inspections, QTS, which won the contract following an open tender competition, has carried out its functions properly.  I am informed by RIA that some of the issues raised by the residents in their letter of 10 April, 2012 had already been highlighted by QTS and that steps were already in train to address them. Following receipt of the complaint of 10 April, RIA issued a notice to residents acknowledging their complaints and said that they would be fully investigated.  Subsequently, in addition to inspections by RIA, the centre was subject to two inspections by QTS, which focussed in particular on the operation of the kitchen and dining area as well as on general safety and health standards at the centre. On 5 July, 2012 the most senior official in RIA wrote to the residents of the centre informing them of the outcomes of the engagement which had taken place. These outcomes centred on improvements in cleaning and food provision in the centre. The notice recorded the positive feedback from residents and the improved atmosphere in the centre.</p>
            <p eId="para_16714">In relation to the broader issues raised by this case, the rights of residents in RIA centres are, put simply, protected in three ways:</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_16715">(a) RIA's House Rules and Procedures which set out the type and standard of service that an asylum seeker should expect whilst residing in direct provision accommodation. The Rules set out the entitlements and obligations placed on centre management and on residents and, in the event that these aren't being met, a complaints procedure to be invoked by either party. This complaints system is considered by RIA to be broadly in line with the guidelines set out by the Office of the Ombudsman for ‘internal complaints systems'.</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_16716">(b) Over and above the House Rules themselves, the interests of asylum seekers are protected through regular ‘clinics' in centres where residents can speak directly to RIA headquarters staff without local centre management being present.</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_16717">(c) Inspections take place in centres, by RIA staff and by QTS, to ensure that centres are adhering to their contractual obligations.  It cannot be emphasised enough that all inspections are unannounced.  Inspections are not to be confused with ordinary day-to-day visits to centres by RIA staff in connection with operational, health or educational matters where management would know of their arrival in advance.</p>
            <p eId="para_16718">Issues of concern are also brought to the attention of RIA by representatives of statutory or voluntary agencies working with asylum seekers, as was the case here.</p>
            <p eId="para_16719">The thrust of the various processes described above is that problems, which inevitably arise in a system as complex and diverse as the Direct Provision system, are ‘surfaced' quickly and dealt with.  What is intended is a continuous interaction between residents and management with a mutually supported aim of maintaining and improving standards. I am not convinced that visiting committees can add to this objective.  It would be mistaken to draw an analogy between asylum accommodation centres and prisons. The latter are places of detention and the circumstances which require visiting committees there are not present in the former. The various processes described above are intended to empower individual asylum seekers.  Whilst local support groups are entitled to interact with residents, it is neither appropriate nor effective in the long run that residents are encouraged to believe that any issues they may have with centre management can only be intermediated through such groups.</p>
            <p eId="para_16720">As a learning organisation, RIA believes that there is always room for improvement. RIA accepts that issues arising in the centre were neither surfaced nor addressed as quickly as they might have been.  As a consequence, RIA in its notice to residents on 5 July, 2012 reiterated the importance of using the House Rules complaints system and stressed the benefits of raising issues one-to-one with RIA staff during clinics.  RIA has already improved the presentation of its advance ‘clinic' notices in centres encouraging residents to raise confidentially issues of concern.  The problems which arose at this centre reinforced the need for another development which was already under way.  That is, QTS has been asked to redesign the template form used by RIA staff in their inspections and to provide more detailed guidelines and training for its completion by RIA staff in respect of each inspection.  This latter development has two purposes: firstly, to train RIA staff to identify more accurately issues of concern and, secondly, to allow RIA by the end of this year, or early next year, to publish completed inspection processes for each centre directly to its website —<i>www.ria.gov.ie</i>.</p>

            <p eId="para_16722">I am advised by the Citizenship Division of the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service (INIS) that an application for a certificate of naturalisation was received from the person referred to by the Deputy in October, 2010.</p>
            <p eId="para_16723">The application is currently being processed with a view to establishing whether the applicant meets the statutory conditions for the granting of naturalisation, such as good character and lawful residence.</p>
            <p eId="para_16724">It is recognised that all applicants for citizenship would wish to have a decision on their application without delay.  Considerable resources are deployed to process applications and these resources together with the necessary administrative arrangements are kept under review.</p>
            <p eId="para_16725">As well as being a significant event in the life of its recipient, the granting of Irish citizenship through naturalisation as provided for in law is also a major step for the State which confers certain rights and entitlements not only within the State but also at European Union level and it is important that appropriate procedures are in place to preserve the integrity of the process.</p>
            <p eId="para_16726">Queries in relation to the status of individual immigration cases may be made directly to INIS by e-mail using the Oireachtas Mail facility which has been specifically established for this purpose. This service enables up to date information on such cases to be obtained without the need to seek information by way of the Parliamentary Questions process. The Deputy may consider using the e-mail service except in cases where the response from INIS is, in the Deputy's view, inadequate or too long awaited</p>

            <p eId="para_16730">I propose to take Questions Nos. 517, 518 and 520 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_16731">I want to assure the Deputy that I share the widespread public concern at the disturbing incidents at the recent Phoenix Park concert. Since there have been relatively trouble free events held at that venue in the past, it therefore important to scrutinise whether there were particular circumstances surrounding this concert which may have given rise to difficulties.</p>
            <p eId="para_16732">I am informed by the Garda authorities that in preparing for the concerts which took place over the weekend of 5 to 8 July, a series of planning meetings took place between a range of stakeholders, including An Garda Síochána and the concert organisers from early in 2012. The meetings involved site inspections, major emergency planning, training and other issues. A full operational policing plan and event management plans were prepared by An Garda Síochána and the organisers. Traffic management plans were also prepared for each event, details of which were circulated for the information of all road users.</p>
            <p eId="para_16733">An Garda Síochána is reviewing what happened at the concerts, including the implementation of the plans which had been in place.  An initial meeting was held with the concert organisers last week and it was agreed that both organisations will carry out a more in depth review regarding all aspects of the event. The fact is that the arrangements which were in place on the Saturday night did not prevent the type of behaviour which took place.</p>
            <p eId="para_16734">The Garda Commissioner has undertaken to let me have a report following that review and I can assure the Deputy that I am determined any lessons will be taken fully into account in future planning and risk management of such events.</p>
            <p eId="para_16735">I am further informed by my colleague, the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport that the Railway Procurement Agency, Dublin Bus, Iarnród Éireann, Bus Éireann and Veolia regularly liaise with An Garda Síochána in relation to transport planning and associated security issues for all major upcoming events. In addition, the companies divert resources including private security to supplement normal staffing levels as appropriate.</p>

Since the Authority was established, it has adopted a phased approach to the licensing of the sector and currently licences approx. 750 contractors and over 27,000 individuals in a range of sectors including the Door Supervisor (Licensed Premises) and Security Guard (Static) sectors.</p>
            <p eId="para_16738">The Authority propose to licence contractors working in the event security area later this year.  Licensing of individuals working in the sector would then follow.

            <p eId="para_16740">I can inform the Deputy that legislation on the use of knives and similar weapons is robust and heavy penalties are already in place for breaches of the law.  Following the enactment of the Criminal Justice (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009, there is now a maximum penalty of five years for possessing a knife in a public place without good reason or lawful authority.  An Garda Síochána also has an extended power of search without warrant in relation to knives and offensive weapons.  While no further legislative changes are planned at this time, the matter is being kept under continuous review.</p>
            <p eId="para_16741">At an operational level, An Garda Síochána pro-actively targets public disorder and anti-social behaviour, including knife related crime.  In this regard it is worth noting that the number of incidents recorded by the Gardaí in which a knife was used fell from 1,855 in 2010 to 1,637 in 2011 and has remained broadly at that level to date in 2012 (883 such incidents to 11 July 2012).  Areas identified as public order hot-spots by local Garda Management are the subject of additional foot and mobile patrols.  Incidents of public disorder and anti-social behaviour reported to the Garda authorities are the subject of investigation and are dealt appropriately in accordance with the law.  It should be noted, however, that a substantial proportion of all knife crime occurs in domestic settings and often with a degree of spontaneity which greatly increases the challenges for policing and enforcement.</p>

In that regard, I am informed by the Garda authorities that, to date in 2012, there have been four recorded incidents of burglary in the townlands corresponding to the area referred to by the Deputy as compared to a total of six such incidents in 2011.</p>
            <p eId="para_16756">The Deputy will be aware that the Garda Commissioner has put in place a wide range of measures aimed at tackling gangs involved in burglaries. These measures are encompassed in <i>Operation Fiacla</i>, which is particularly focused on identifying and targeting mobile gangs involved in burglaries around the country so as to disrupt their activities and bring them before the Courts. Specific burglary related initiatives are being implemented in each Garda Region in support of <i>Operation Fiacla.  </i>In the area referred to by the Deputy, the regional burglary initiative <i>Operation Obair</i>  continues to be conducted, including by means of an increase in the number of checkpoints and crime patrols in the area.</p>
            <p eId="para_16757">The Deputy will also be aware that the National Crime Prevention Unit (NCPU) and Crime Prevention Officers at Divisional level provide advice, information and support to organisations, businesses and individuals aimed at reducing burglary crime and the opportunity to commit burglary.  These specially trained officers are skilled at identifying environmental design risks and advise on ways to reduce opportunities to commit burglary and other property crime.</p>
            <p eId="para_16758">Furthermore, during 2012, the national ‘Garda Supporting Safer Communities Campaign' will continue to highlight key issues, in particular burglary prevention. The first such campaign was launched by the Garda Commissioner on 2 May and a second campaign will take place in September.</p>
            <p eId="para_16759">I share the Deputy's concerns about the incidence of burglary and therefore welcome the fact that the Garda authorities are taking robust measures to respond to this type of criminality.</p>

            <p eId="para_16767">The number of persons that have applied for a Certificate of Naturalisation under section 15A of the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act, 1956 as amended for the period from 29 November 2005 to 30 June 2012 is approximately 7,300. This section refers to the circumstances in which spouses of Irish citizens may become naturalised.</p>
            <p eId="para_16768">In the period in question the approximate number of applications approved, including a small number lodged before the 29 November 2005, is approximately 4,300, the number deemed to be ineligible was 400 and the total number refused was 160. The number of applications awaiting decision is some 2,800, almost 80% of which were lodged in 2011 and 2012 to date.</p>
            <p eId="para_16769">The Deputy will appreciate that naturalisation applications must be processed in a way which preserves the necessary checks and balances to ensure that citizenship is not undervalued and is given only to persons who satisfy the necessary qualifying criteria. The processing procedures, which I am satisfied are necessary to maintain the integrity of the naturalisation process, have been developed and refined over a number of years.</p>
            <p eId="para_16770">The procedures employed to assess an applicant for naturalisation include an initial examination upon receipt of each application to determine if the statutory application is completed fully. Incomplete application forms are returned to the applicant for further attention. Valid applications are then examined to determine if the applicant meets the statutory criteria set out in the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act such as good character and lawful residence, and, as appropriate, enquiries are made with the relevant Departments and agencies to establish if the applicant meets the requirements for the granting of naturalisation. Once these processes are completed, the application is submitted to me for a decision which I make in my absolute discretion by assessing the entirety of the information available to me.</p>

The Court is now in a position to deal with offenders from a much wider area including offenders who are resident in all areas of Dublin city north of the river Liffey and to offenders receiving treatment in the Castle Street Drug Treatment Centre which provides services to people residing in Dublin 2, 4, 6 and 8.  This welcome initiative was undertaken with cooperation from the Health Services Executive in the provision of vital testing and treatment support services.  An evaluation of the potential for further expansion of the programme forms part of the ongoing review.  Therefore no decisions will be taken regarding further expansion until the report currently being prepared has been considered in full.</p>

            <p eId="para_16797">I am informed by the Garda authorities that policing measures are in place to address the difficulties referred to by the Deputy. These include the designation of certain areas as hotspots for such criminality and additional high visibility patrols being directed by local Garda management. Incidents of public disorder and other anti-social behaviour are dealt with by way of juvenile or adult caution, fixed charge penalty notice or by initiating criminal proceedings.</p>
            <p eId="para_16798">In particular, a high visibility policing initiative has recently been reintroduced by Assistant Commissioner Dublin Metropolitan Region, including within the Dublin city catchment area. Dedicated high visibility patrols are conducted in key thoroughfares at strategic times, as dictated by crime trends and foot fall for these areas. These measures will be subject to close monitoring by local Garda management and will be continually reviewed to ensure they target prevailing trends.</p>
            <p eId="para_16799">In addition, I am also informed that there are a number of specific initiatives in place in the Temple Bar area. These include Operation Pier involving the deployment of plain-clothes Garda personnel as well as high visibility uniform personnel from the local Community Policing Unit, supplemented by additional patrols conducted by District and Division uniform personnel. The initiative has had a significant impact in combating and reducing incidents of public order and anti-social behaviour in the area.</p>
            <p eId="para_16800">The Garda authorities use a collaborative approach in addressing anti-social behaviour issues in the area including ongoing liaison with local business associations and other stakeholders.</p>
            <p eId="para_16801">The Gardaí also make effective use of CCTV in the city centre, with 44 CCTV cameras, monitored by Garda personnel from the Garda Camera Office on O'Connell Street, and a further 33 CCTV cameras monitored from Pearse Street Garda Station on a 24 hour basis. CCTV systems have proved to be of significant assistance to the Garda Authorities in the prevention and detection of incidents of crime since their introduction.</p>

            <p eId="para_16808">The Community Return Programme is an incentivised scheme introduced in line with the recommendations of the Thornton Hall Project Review Group which provides for earned temporary release for offenders who pose no threat to the community, to engagement in supervised community service work.  The type of work involved is intended to assist the community and the scheme is involved with a large number of charitable organisations and local community groups. The work takes place in a supervised group setting and involves practical tasks such as painting, gardening or graffiti removal.</p>
            <p eId="para_16809">The scheme is applicable to suitably assessed prisoners who are serving sentences of between one and eight years. Those participating are granted reviewable temporary release having served at least 50% of their sentence.</p>
            <p eId="para_16810">The following factors are taken into account in considering the suitability of a prisoner for temporary release to participate in the scheme:</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_16811">the nature and gravity of the offence to which the sentence being served by the person relates;</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_16812">the sentence concerned and any recommendation made by the Court in relation to the sentence imposed;</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_16813">the potential threat to the safety and security of the public should the person be released;</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_16814">the person's previous criminal record;</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_16815">the risk that the person might commit an offence during any period of temporary release;</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_16816">the risk of the person failing to comply with any of the conditions of temporary release;</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_16817">the extent of the prisoner's engagement with therapeutic services while in custody and the likelihood of period of temporary release enhancing his/her reintegration prospects; and</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_16818">conduct while in custody.</p>
            <p eId="para_16819">As announced with the launch of its new three year strategic plan, the Prison Service, in conjunction with the Probation Service, intends to increase the number of prisoners benefitting from this structured form of release over the course of the next three years. The Prison Service will work towards the placement of 400 prisoners per annum serving sentences of 1 to 8 years.  It is envisaged that there would be no more than 150 prisoners participating in this scheme at any one time and all prisoners will be carefully assessed before being approved for the scheme.</p>
            <p eId="para_16820">There have to date been 220 participants on the scheme with 87 offenders currently engaged in community service work. 105 offenders have already completed the programme successfully with a small percentage of prisoners returned to custody for non-compliance. The reports to date from the Community Site Supervisors have been very positive and many of the participants have been commended for their work ethic, punctuality and commitment.  Initial feedback from the participants has also been positive with many commenting on the supports and structure that it gives them on their release and how it has assisted in their transition back into the community.</p>

            <from>Minister for Justice and Equality (Deputy Alan Shatter)</from>
            <p eId="para_16822">I have been informed by the Irish Prison Service that the number of prisoners in custody on 14 June 2012 was 4,493 while the numbers in custody on 22 June, 2011 was 4,433.</p>
            <p eId="para_16823">As the Deputy will appreciate, the Irish Prison Service must accept all prisoners committed by the Courts into its custody and does not have the option of refusing committals.  It should be noted that this is the busiest time of the year for committals prior to the courts being in recess for the summer.</p>
            <p eId="para_16824">The average number of prisoners in custody in Ireland has risen in the last 5 years, from 3,321 during 2007 to 4,389 during 2011, an increase of over 32%. Likewise the total number of committals to prison has also risen sharply during the same period, from 11,934 in 2007 to 17,318 in 2011 — an increase of over 45%.</p>
            <p eId="para_16825">Rising prisoner numbers have placed enormous strain on the prison system across the board from accommodation to the provision of services including work training/education, healthcare and drug treatment services. During this period, as a result of the increase in the prison population, a number of prisons  are operating well in excess of their stated bed capacities.</p>
            <p eId="para_16826">There does appear, however, to be a stabilising or levelling off in the increase in prisoner numbers being committed annually with 2011 recording only a 0.8% increase on the previous year. This compares to increases of 13.6%, 13.8% and 11.4% respectively year on year for 2008, 2009 and 2010.</p>
            <p eId="para_16827">As outlined in the recently published Irish Prison Service Three Year Strategic Plan, it is intended to align the capacity of our prisons in line with the guidelines laid down by the Inspector of Prisons by 2014 in so far as this is compatible with public safety and the integrity of the criminal justice system. In 2012 and the first quarter of 2013 priority will be given to reducing the chronic overcrowding in Mountjoy, Cork, Limerick Prisons and the Dóchas Centre.</p>
            <p eId="para_16828">Significant investment has taken place in our prison estate in recent years with in excess of 900 new prison spaces having been constructed and brought into use since 2007.  A new accommodation block at the Midlands prison which will provide a potential 300 additional spaces as well as additional work training and education facilities is due to become operational in late 2012.</p>
            <p eId="para_16829">I am also committed to pursuing alternatives to custody.  In conjunction with the Probation Service, the Irish Prison Service has commenced the roll out of the Community Return Programme, an incentivised scheme for earned temporary release under which offenders who pose no threat to the community are offered early temporary release in return for supervised community service. On 16 July 2012, 220 prisoners had participated in the scheme with 105 having completed their required periods of community service.</p>

            <p eId="para_16832">I am currently preparing amendments to the Fines Act 2010 to give effect to the commitment in the Programme for Government to introduce attachment of earnings to improve the collection of fines and reduce the number of persons committed to prison for the non-payment of fines.  The introduction of attachment of earnings requires that the architecture of the Fines Act is reviewed to ensure that all the various elements work together harmoniously.  Work on this review is well advanced, and any necessary amendments to the 2010 Act will be dealt with, along with the introduction of attachment of earnings, in a Fines (Amendment) Bill that I hope to have enacted during 2013.</p>

            <p eId="para_16860">The Irish Prison Service has committed in its Three Year Strategic Plan 2012-2015 to develop and implement a strategy which will seek to end the detention of 16 and 17 year old boys in St Patrick's Institution and relocate this cohort of offenders into appropriate child-friendly facilities by December, 2013.  Progress has already been made as regards 16 year old male offenders and shortly there will be no such offenders held in St. Patrick's Institution.</p>
            <p eId="para_16861">The Prison Service is working in partnership with relevant key agencies to achieve this goal.  Partner agencies include the Department of Children and Youth Affairs/Irish Youth Justice Service (IYJS), the Probation Service and the Health Service Executive.</p>
            <p eId="para_16862">It is envisaged that the following actions will be taken as part of the Strategy:</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_16863">In the period up to the end of 2013, the Irish Prison Service, in co-ordination with other relevant agencies, will risk assess and profile boys currently in detention and all new committals to St. Patrick's.</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_16864">For boys remaining in St. Patrick's, the Irish Prison Service will work with their partners and other agencies to ensure that their regime is age-appropriate and that best practice is observed.</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_16865">The Irish Prison Service will work closely with IYJS to ensure early development of the necessary facilities with a view to moving to end the detention of 17 year olds in St. Patrick's as soon as possible.</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_16866">The Irish Prison Service will set up an oversight group with their partners and additional external representation to oversee implementation of these plans and monitor progress.</p>
            <p eId="para_16867">Over the lifetime of the Strategy, the Prison Service will also review the overall approach taken to the placement of 18-21 year olds.</p>

            <p eId="para_16869">I am advised by the Director General that the recently published Irish Prison Service Strategic Plan 2012-2015 contains a commitment to develop a specific action plan to address the particular needs of women offenders.</p>
            <p eId="para_16870">The strategic plan for women offenders and those at risk of coming into custody is being prepared in collaboration with the Probation Service and will address the issues highlighted by the Deputy including diversion from custody as well as measures that could be adopted to improve the outcomes for those women for whom the courts determine that a custodial sentence is warranted due to the nature of the offence.  The Irish Prison Service recognises the important role that the statutory and voluntary sector plays in assisting women offenders re-integrate back into society and recently held a multi-agency meeting with the various service providers to draw on this knowledge and  expertise in relation to the development of its strategic plan and also to explore how co-operation across the various agencies might be improved and strengthened in the interest of women offenders.</p>
            <p eId="para_16871">Both the Probation Service and the Irish Prison Service are committed to developing a new strategy for the sentence management of women offenders. This commitment is reflected in both organisation's 3 year Strategy Statements. A joint Steering Group has met and has charged a subgroup to draw up an implementation strategy which will be presented by the end of August. All matters, including open prison facilities and residential therapeutic centres, are available for consideration by the Steering Group.</p>

            <p eId="para_16881">I am to advise the Deputy that the status of each and every prisoner subject to a restricted regime within the prison system is regularly reviewed.  Prisoners who have been removed from general association because of their being a significant threat to the maintenance of good order (Rule 62 of the Prison Rules 2007) are subject to regular reviews during which the reason or reasons for their removal from general association are provided to the prisoner. The prisoners are allowed an opportunity to express their views, which are also recorded, and are then taken into consideration. There is no limit on the period for which a prisoner can be held under rule 62 of the Prison Rules 2007. However the Director General is required to consider the facts associated with these cases every 7 days and must give approval if this type of restricted regime is to continue.</p>
            <p eId="para_16882">Persons under protective custody (Rule 63) must be interviewed and reviewed by prison management each month. The findings and comments of the prisoners are recorded each and every month along with the decision of the Governor and the reasons why this Rule is being applied.  The Deputy will appreciate the overriding responsibility that the Prison Service has in relation to the provision of safe and secure custody and that there are a small number of prisoners who must serve their sentence or part thereof without contact from other prisoners for very specific reasons.</p>

            <p eId="para_16888">All prescription drugs dispensed in the Irish Prison Service are prescribed as appropriate by the clinician, following clinical assessment, and the responsibility for prescribing lies with the medical practitioner/dentist.  To ensure the safe, appropriate and cost-effective use of medication, the Irish Prison Service Drug and Therapeutics Committee reviews current medication policies and develops new up-to-date guidance and policies on the use of prescribed medication in the Irish Prison Service.  The recently revised Irish Prison Service Drug Treatment Clinical Policy includes policies and guidance on the use of prescription drugs in the treatment of addiction and related conditions.</p>
            <p eId="para_16889">All Irish Prison Service policies are prepared with reference to published national and international expert guidance and advice, including, inter alia, advice from the Department of Health and Children, the Pharmaceutical Society of Ireland, the Irish Medicines Board, the National Medicines Information Centre, the National Institute for Clinical Excellence, The Cochrane Library and the British National Formulary.</p>
            <p eId="para_16890">The prescribing of benzodiazepines in the Irish Prison Service is limited to situations where the use of such medication is deemed clinically necessary, for short term treatment of specific conditions, as per national guidelines (Ref Benzodiazepines: Good Practice Guidelines for Clinicians, DoHC 2002).  As the requirement for benzodiazepines varies according to the clinical needs of an ever-changing prison population, it is not possible to give an exact number of patients in prison currently prescribed benzodiazepines.</p>
            <p eId="para_16891">The Irish Prison Service aims to provide a level of healthcare equivalent to that available to those entitled to General Medical Services in the community. Therefore all medicines available in the community via the community drugs schemes are available, as prescribed, to patients in prison.  In addition, all specialist, hospital only prescriptions (such  as medication for the treatment of Hepatitis C or Human Immunodeficiency  Virus), are available and supplied as clinically indicated to patients in  prison.</p>

            <p eId="para_16893">There are a range of drug rehabilitation programmes available for prisoners which involve a significant multidimensional input by a diverse range of general and specialist services provided both by the Irish Prison Service and visiting statutory and non-statutory organisations. The programmes seek to reduce the demand for drugs within the prison system through education, treatment and rehabilitation services for drug-addicted prisoners. Particular initiatives include, inter alia, the provision of detoxification, methadone maintenance, education programmes, addiction counselling and drug therapy programmes.</p>
            <p eId="para_16894">The delivery of these services is being achieved in partnership with community based services and has brought a significant improvement in the range, quality and availability of drug treatment services in the prisons.  It is the policy of the Irish Prison Service that where a person committed to prison gives a history of opiate use and tests positive for opioids, they are offered a medically assisted symptomatic detoxification, if clinically indicated. There is no waiting list for a detox as there is no dependency on community place availability.</p>
            <p eId="para_16895">There is no waiting period for methadone maintenance. The Irish Prison Service ensures the seamless transition of prisoners established on drug treatment from our care into community drug treatment settings as agreed in the protocol developed with the HSE. If the prisoner is on a community programme prior to committal to prison, the maintenance programme is continued during the prison term. Prior to a patient being commenced on methadone maintenance in prison, a drug treatment place in the community must be secured to ensure continuation of treatment upon release. Methadone substitution treatment is available in 9 of the 14 prisons and places of detention (accommodating over 80% of the prison population).</p>
            <p eId="para_16896">Merchants Quay Ireland are contracted to provide addiction counselling services in prisons and deliver approximately 1,500 prisoner contacts per month. The service is delivered by 21 counsellors.  In 2011, there were 2,792 referrals to the service. There are currently approximately 200 on waiting lists across the system awaiting assessment and treatment.  All those referred are assessed initially by a counsellor to identify the person's addiction and agree a treatment plan.</p>
            <p eId="para_16897">There are currently Drug Free Units in Mountjoy Prison, Wheatfield Prison, Cloverhill Prison and St. Patrick's Institution. In addition, the Training Unit, Arbour Hill, Loughan House and Shelton Abbey are regarded as drug free institutions.  As part of the enhancement of the drug treatment services in prisons a standard Drug Free Programme has been developed for implementation in all closed prisons (with the exception of Arbour Hill). This programme will support any prisoner who is drug free, has drug free status and/or is stable on methadone. It is intended that by the end of 2012 all closed prisons will operate this Programme in dedicated drug free areas.</p>

            <p eId="para_16905">The DTSS allows one checkup annually and permits two fillings annually.  Additional routine fillings are approved if the patient has a significant medical history. Emergency care is provided for, which allows for extraction and repair of dentures.   Where other treatment which falls outside the scope of the DTSS is required arrangements are in place where such a case can be reviewed and adjudicated by a consultant dental clinician.</p>

No. 252 of 2007) provides that the Governor shall ensure that, where the prison doctor so advises, special provision is made in relation to the dietary needs of a prisoner who suffers from a medical condition the treatment, prevention or alleviation of the symptoms of which necessitates adherence to a special diet.  The Irish Prison Service operates a 28 day menu cycle which was reviewed and updated in October 2011. The menu provides a wide variety of wholesome and nutritious food and drink each day, properly prepared and well presented. All prisoners, in particular those with medical needs, are encouraged to make healthy choices from the menu provided.</p>

            <p eId="para_16909">All deaths in custody are the subject of a Garda investigation and an inquest held in a Coroner's Court.  The cause of death is determined by a jury on the basis of the information presented to the Coroner's Court.  The Inspector of Prisons, Judge Michael Reilly has recently been given responsibility to also investigate all deaths in custody. Such investigations will apply to prisoners who are in the custody of the Irish Prison Service, whether or not the death actually occurs within the prison walls, and to prisoners who have recently been let out on temporary release.</p>
            <p eId="para_16910">Furthermore, the circumstances of each death in custody are also examined by a suicide prevention group in each institution.  The groups are chaired by Governors and include representatives from various services, i.e. Doctors, Psychiatrists, Psychologists, Chaplains, Probation Officers, Education and Prison staff. They are required to meet quarterly or more often if necessary. Their examinations cover fully the background and circumstances of each death.  Their objective is to identify, where possible, measures which might be implemented to contribute to a reduction in the risk of deaths in the future.</p>
            <p eId="para_16911">There were 6 deaths in custody in 2011 and 4 to date in 2012. Of the 10 deaths since 2011, the cause of death has been determined as death by misadventure in 2 cases. Inquests are pending in the remaining 8 cases. A breakdown by prison is set out in the table below.</p>

Common reasons for prisoner movements include court appearances, disruptive behaviour, conflict with other prisoners, to assist family contact, to participate in a particular training or educational course, to assist in reintegration or to alleviate overcrowding. Factors taken into account include length of sentence, nature of offence, medical needs, drug dependency, behaviour while in custody, the age of the prisoner, previous criminal record, engagement with the various services and the availability of accommodation.</p>

            <p eId="para_16991">On foot of this review it is proposed that three different levels of daily gratuity be introduced, with the rates being paid dependent on behaviour and level of engagement in structured activities and sentence plans.  Under the proposal prisoners who are well behaved and engage actively with services should not see any substantive reduction in their gratuity payments.  It is also proposed to regularise the payment of working gratuities across the prison estate and only activities where prisoners provide services, which would otherwise result in a cost to the prison service, such as catering and laundry, would qualify for the payment.  I expect that the new scheme will be finalised shortly.</p>

            <p eId="para_16995">I propose to take Questions Nos. 570 and 571 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_16996">The number of visitors excluded from visits or offered a screened visit in 2011 was 306.  Section 36(9) of the Prison Rules makes provision for the Governor, where he or she believes it to be necessary in order to: (a) prevent the entry into the prison of controlled drugs or other prohibited articles or substances, (b) prevent a conspiracy to commit a criminal offence, or (c) otherwise maintain good order and safe and secure custody, may refuse to permit a visit to a prisoner by a person or persons.</p>
            <p eId="para_16997">Some of our prisons, e.g. Cloverhill and St Patrick's have screened visits facilities as the norm and others, e.g. Cork and Mountjoy may provide "open visits".  There is no automatic right to an open visit and the Governor may insist on screened visits on occasions for security reasons.  Reasons why screened visits may be applied include previous attempts to retrieve contraband, evidence of drug misuse, previous attempts by the visitor to pass contraband and/or positive indications on the visitor by the drug dogs.  These triggers could reasonably lead the Governor to believe there would be a risk in relation to contraband if an open visit was to take place.</p>
            <p eId="para_16998">Any visitor who is refused a visit or is subject to screened visits has the option of appealing the decision to the Governor of the prison.  The Governor ultimately makes the final decision on any visitor access to the prison as referred to above.  The number of prisoners who had visits withdrawn as punishment in 2011 was 1,252.  However, it is not possible to provide a further breakdown specific to family visits.</p>

            <p eId="para_17002">The Irish Prison Service training, higher education programmes, policies and procedures are designed to increase prison personnel's understanding of human behaviour, familiarise them with the interactions and processes of different groups within society in order to ensure that they share and promote the core values espoused in the Irish Prison Service mission and vision statements.  To further strengthen this approach the Irish Prison Service is currently drafting a Dignity at Work Charter and a prison wide dignity and respect awareness programme for all prison personnel.  The programme highlights the requirement to treat all members of the prison community, including visitors, prisoners' families, staff and management with dignity, respect, courtesy and in a professional manner.</p>

            <p eId="para_17013">I have been advised that the Irish Prison Service does not specifically record details from prisoners regarding their number of children. It has been estimated, however, that approximately 200,000 adult family and friend visits to prisoners take place every year and about 80,000 children visits. Based on these estimates, and the age profile of prisoners, the number of children who have a parent in custody is likely to be a substantial figure.</p>

            <from>Minister for Justice and Equality (Deputy Alan Shatter)</from>
            <p eId="para_17028">It is, of course, inevitable that at any given time there will be a significant number of warrants awaiting execution. Unavoidably, even in the most straightforward cases there must be some lapse of time between the issue of a warrant by the court and its execution by An Garda Síochána. Apart from the huge volume of warrants which are issued, there can be a multiplicity of reasons why warrants can take time to execute and, in some cases, they can prove ultimately unenforceable. It is the case that many individuals can be subject to multiple warrants and a number of the subjects of the warrants are taking every step open to them to try to avoid arrest through moving from address to address and so on.</p>
            <p eId="para_17029">While it is clearly important that An Garda Síochána take all possible action to ensure that warrants are executed as quickly as possible, it should be borne in mind that the vast majority of warrants do not relate to violent or the more serious categories of offence. In fact, most of the warrants which are recorded as unexecuted are penal warrants, which relate to the payment of fines with imprisonment arising as a consequence of failure to pay. 93% of penal warrants are associated with Road Traffic Acts, public order and theft offences.</p>
            <p eId="para_17030">Moreover, I have been assured by the Garda Commissioner that An Garda Síochána give priority to the execution of warrants in respect of serious crime and will continue to do so.</p>
            <p eId="para_17031">I have been advised in respect of executed warrants that 46% were executed within three months, 70% within 6 months, 87% within 12 months and 13% after 12 months.</p>
            <p eId="para_17032">Subject to the caveats I mention below, I am informed that on 13 July 2012 PULSE recorded 124,209 bench, penal and committal warrants as unexecuted. For comparison purposes, I am advised that in May 2008 a similar number of warrants were recorded by PULSE as unexecuted: 117,756. It seems clear, therefore, that despite the constraints under which An Garda Síochána have had to operate arising from the difficult economic circumstances, the situation in relation to unexecuted warrants has not deteriorated.</p>
            <p eId="para_17033">In relation to the figures provided by An Garda Síochána, I should say that I have been advised that they are operational and liable to change.</p>
            <p eId="para_17034">Of its nature, the figure for outstanding warrants recorded by PULSE at any given time reflects an accumulation of old warrants which has arisen over the years. I set out below a separate table which shows warrants outstanding for the years 2000 to 2011. It will be clear from that table that the vast majority of unexecuted warrants relate to 2010 and before. Warrants will continue to show on PULSE until such time as they are recorded as being finally disposed of and, given that some of the warrants in question are outstanding for many years, I am concerned that the total figure for outstanding warrants as shown on PULSE may not be a reliable indicator of the number of ‘live' warrants which are enforceable which are on hand.</p>
            <p eId="para_17035">In the circumstances, I have asked the Garda Commissioner to consider whether there may be a better way of maintaining statistics which gives a more realistic indication in relation to any backlog of warrants that arises. I have also asked him to report to me again in six months time on the situation in relation to unexecuted warrants and indicated that if he has any recommendations in relation to legislative or administrative action open to me as Minister which would assist in this area I will, of course, consider them.</p>
            <p eId="para_17036">While genuine difficulties can arise where it does not prove possible to enforce a warrant, it is obviously important that systems are in place to ensure that warrants are enforced as quickly as possible. I have been advised by the Garda Commissioner that at present there is an Inspector in each Garda District in the Dublin Metropolitan Region and each Division outside the DMR tasked with managing the execution of warrants, and other issues relating to them. In addition, specific members of the Force are tasked with their execution. An Garda Síochána continually liaises with other agencies, including Government Departments, to locate individuals sought on warrant. This has resulted in the provision of addresses, other than those provided on the warrants, for many persons sought. In particular, Garda warrants personnel regularly liaise with the Irish Prison Service and the Courts Service to ensure the timely exchange of relevant information regarding persons sought for the service of warrants.</p>
            <p eId="para_17037">I am also advised that there is a warrants working group in place which facilitates liaison between the various stakeholders, including the Court Service and the Prison Service and which works to identify, address and prevent difficulties in the warrants process. The work of the group is ongoing and relevant recommendations for the improvement of systems are being implemented on an ongoing basis.</p>
            <p eId="para_17038">The Garda Commissioner has assured me that both he and his senior management team are closely monitoring the situation with a view to ensuring that warrants are executed as expeditiously as possible.</p>
            <p eId="para_17039">There seems little doubt that the outstanding warrants figures for previous years reflected partly the situation which then obtained in relation to the use of imprisonment in cases of non-payment of fines, a practice which I think most people now regard as highly undesirable. Since the commencement of section 14 of the Fines Act 2010, a Court is now obliged to take into account the means of the person before imposing a fine. This measure combined with other provisions such as the use of community service, payment by instalment and use of attachment of earnings should, when fully operational, have very beneficial effects on the number of warrants which the Gardaí are called on to enforce.</p>

          <speech by="#AlanShatter" as="#Minister_for_Justice_and_Equality" eId="spk_1072">
            <from>Minister for Justice and Equality (Deputy Alan Shatter)</from>
            <p eId="para_17225">I propose to take Questions Nos. 584 to 590, inclusive, together.</p>
            <p eId="para_17226">The number of applications processed for the period from 1 January to 31 December 2011 was approximately 15,000. The number approved was approximately 13,000 and refused was approximately 600. In addition, almost 1,200 applications were deemed to be ineligible.</p>
            <p eId="para_17227">The primary aim since I was appointed Minister in March 2011 has been to reduce the large volume of cases on hand as swiftly as possible which has now been achieved in the majority of cases and I am confident that significant inroads will also be made with the remaining cases by year end. I can also inform the Deputy that from June 2012, in the generality of cases i.e. around 70%, persons applying for a certificate of naturalisation will be given a decision on their application within six months.</p>
            <p eId="para_17228">For the information of the Deputy the situation in March 2011 was that there were over 22,000 cases on hand and applications were taking an average time of over two years to process and many were waiting 3 to 4 years. Through the measures I introduced enormous progress has been made, notwithstanding a substantial increase in the volume of valid applications received in 2011, during which a total of 18,500 valid applications were received compared to 12,500 in 2010.  As stated above, approximately 15,000 valid applications were determined in 2011. By contrast, in 2010, a decision was reached in just under 7,800 cases. In 2012 to date, I have made a decision in approximately 15,600 cases.</p>
            <p eId="para_17229">The Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act, 1956, as amended, provides that the Minister may decide to grant or refuse an application in his absolute discretion on a case by case basis by assessing the entirety of the available information. Where an application is refused the applicant is generally given reasons for that decision insofar as the explanation given cannot be interpreted as a fettering of the absolute discretion given to the Minister in the Act. I would make the general comment that this issue has been tested before the Courts and found to be in accordance with the law. The Deputy will therefore appreciate that it would be inappropriate for me to provide the information sought in respect of the reasons for refusing applications for naturalisation. In any event, I am advised by the Citizenship Division of my Department that the retrieval and compilation of this and other information requested by the Deputy for the period in question would necessitate a disproportionate use of time and resources which could not be justified in circumstances where the priority is to deal with the cases on hand.</p>

            <p eId="para_17239">The Deputy will be aware that under the Garda Síochána Acts 2005-2007, the Commissioner is required to submit, before November of each year, a policing plan for the forthcoming year.  Any proposals for the closure of Garda stations or the altering of Regional or Divisional boundaries must be set out in that plan. While the Policing Plan for 2013 has not yet been submitted to me, I expect that it will contain measures to address the ongoing issue of rationalisation of the Garda station network. It would therefore be premature to speculate on specific measures which this might involve.</p>
            <p eId="para_17240">In making his assessments on these matters the Garda Commissioner has asked each Divisional Officer to assess the level of activity in each Garda Station in their area. It must be stressed that the key objective of any station closure is to promote the more efficient and effective deployment of resources rather than secure specific cash saving.</p>
            <p eId="para_17241">The Deputy will also be aware that the Commissioner is responsible for the detailed allocation of resources, including personnel, throughout the organisation and I have no function in the matter. This allocation of resources is constantly monitored in the context of crime trends, policing needs and other operational strategies in place on a District, Divisional and Regional level to ensure optimum use is made of Garda resources and the best possible Garda service is provided to the public. Kerry Garda Division will be subject to this same level of monitoring to ensure that optimum use is made of Garda resources and the best possible Garda service is provided to the public.</p>

            <p eId="para_17256">I propose to take Questions Nos. 601 and 602 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_17257">I would refer the Deputy to my reply to Questions Nos. 504 and 505 of 3 July 2012 which was as follows:</p>
            <p class="indent_2" eId="para_17258">"The coroner is an independent officer charged with the investigation of certain reportable deaths. The primary public expression of that investigation is the inquest which seeks factually to discover the circumstances of the person's death. It provides  accessibility to the deceased's family and affords a sufficient element of public scrutiny.</p>
            <p class="indent_2" eId="para_17259">In a case such as the Deputy mentions as potentially arising, I am satisfied that the inquest meets the State's obligations under the European Convention on Human Rights, and in particular Article 2 of the Convention.</p>
            <p class="indent_2" eId="para_17260">I would also mention in this regard, the Coroners (Amendment) Act 2005, which ended the restriction on the coroner from summoning more than 2 medical witnesses to give evidence at an inquest, increased sanctions on witnesses and jurors who failed to attend or cooperate at an inquest and increased powers of compellability for the coroner in regard to the attendance of witnesses and jurors at an inquest.</p>
            <p class="indent_2" eId="para_17261">The Coroners Bill 2007 is before the Seanad having been restored to the Order Paper on my initiative. The Bill is in the course of being reviewed in my Department with a view, among other matters, to making it as cost-effective as possible. The Bill, as published, provides for the comprehensive reform of the existing legislation and structures relating to coroners and provides for the establishment of a new Coroner Service.</p>
            <p class="indent_2" eId="para_17262">The Bill incorporates many of the recommendations made by the Coroners Review Group in 2000 and the Coroners Rules Committee in 2003. It also has regard to developments since in terms of jurisprudence both in our own courts and the European Court of Human Rights and to ongoing reform of coroner services in other common law jurisdictions.</p>
            <p class="indent_2" eId="para_17263">The Civil Law (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2011 provided for some early reforms in coronial matters."</p>
            <p eId="para_17264">I have nothing further to add to that reply.</p>

            <p eId="para_17284">The purpose of the Equality Tribunal is to deal with all complaints of discrimination in employment and access to goods and services under the terms of equality legislation.  Reform of the workplace relations institutions will involve the Equality Tribunal in a merger with the Labour Relations Commission, Employment Appeals Tribunal (EAT) (first instance functions) and National Employment Rights Authority to form a single agency for dealing with first instance complaints. The Labour Court will deal with all appeals (including those currently dealt with by the EAT).</p>
            <p eId="para_17285">The aim is to deliver a world-class Workplace Relations service and framework that serves the needs of employers and employees and provides maximum value for money. This is a reform that I fully support.  The drafting of legislation to give effect to this merger and related practical implementation issues, such as staffing, are as the Deputy will be aware a matter for my colleague, the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation who is currently considering the staffing requirement of the bodies. As is the norm, existing staff of the Equality Tribunal will transfer with the Tribunal to the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation.</p>
            <p eId="para_17286">The Deputy will be aware that the radical streamlining of State bodies is a key deliverable of the Public Service Reform Plan,which was published in November 2011. While the reforms will deliver savings to the taxpayer, the real benefits lie in the simplification of the administrative landscape, thereby ensuring greater effectiveness, less duplication of effort and more coherent and better quality public service delivery.</p>

However, in order to be of assistance in the matter I have had enquiries made with the Tribunal.</p>
            <p eId="para_17289">I am informed that, during 2011, the overall amount awarded by the Tribunal in compensation was significantly in excess of the budget for the year and that a payment liability was carried forward to 2012.  I am further informed that, as result, some amounts awarded in 2011 are currently being paid during 2012 and that such payments are processed chronologically by date of acceptance of the award.</p>
            <p eId="para_17290">I understand that the Tribunal has put in place arrangements in respect of payments in order to best manage its resources and to make compensation available in 2012 to the greatest possible number of victims. Arising from these arrangements the payment of awards will proceed on a phased basis in chronological order by date of acceptance during the year. I also understand form the Tribunal that payment of the award referred to by the Deputy will take place during the last quarter of 2012.</p>
            <p eId="para_17291">While the Tribunal regrets any inconvenience caused by these arrangements to the person referred to by the Deputy, the Tribunal has indicated that the above-mentioned arrangements will in fact allow payment of that person's award to proceed during the current financial year, which would not otherwise be the case.</p>

            <p eId="para_17330">The Deputy's question concerns the disclosure, to parents, of information relating to persons on the sex offenders' register.</p>
            <p eId="para_17331">In exceptional circumstances, the provision of appropriate information to the public is already possible. This includes the disclosure of such information to parents. Currently, this is done on an administrative basis but, subject to Government approval, I intend to put these arrangements on a statutory footing.</p>
            <p eId="para_17332">Our primary objective has to be to minimise the risk posed to the public. The High Level Group which produced and published a discussion document on sex offenders was of the view that, if the Gardai have reason to believe a particular high risk sex offender poses a real and immediate danger, they should be free to tell individuals who need to know. Disclosure in such circumstances is perfectly reasonable.</p>
            <p eId="para_17333">However, giving the general public unrestricted access to names and addresses on the sex offenders' register would be likely to be counter-productive. That kind of access would drive offenders underground and make it more difficult to monitor and supervise them. This was the universal view of those who responded to the discussion document and participated in the public forum on the management of sex offenders.</p>
            <p eId="para_17334">General access to the register would also raise issues concerning the rights of persons who have completed their sentences and pose no future threat to society.</p>
            <p eId="para_17335">My Department has been conducting a wide-ranging examination of the law on sexual offences. Arising from the review, l expect to seek Government approval for legislative proposals, including amendments to the Sex Offenders Act 2001 to provide a statutory basis for necessary disclosure, in the coming months.</p>

         the number of persons registered with the Garda who must comply with Part 2 of the Sex Offenders Act 2001; the number actually complying with Part 2 of the Act of 2001; the steps being taken to trace those who are not in compliance with the Act; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

            <p eId="para_17337">The Sex Offenders Act 2001 contains a comprehensive series of provisions aimed at protecting children and other persons.  Part 2 of the Act makes persons convicted of a range of sexual offences subject to notification requirements.  The provisions of the Act also extend to any offenders convicted abroad of the same range of sexual offences who enter the State.</p>
            <p eId="para_17338">All offenders subject to the notification requirements are monitored by the Sex Offender Management and Intelligence Unit (SOMIU) at the Garda National Bureau of Criminal Investigation. The Unit is supported by Garda Inspectors nominated in each Garda Division throughout the State.  I am informed that the nominated Inspector in each Division has access to all necessary resources within his/her Division to assist him/her in carrying out his/her duties.</p>
            <p eId="para_17339">Where An Garda Síochána becomes aware that an offender subject to the notification requirements has breached those requirements, appropriate action is taken, including circulation through PULSE of their information, as well as inquiries to identify their current whereabouts.  I am confident that the appropriate level of monitoring is carried out by An Garda Síochána and that all breaches of the requirements which come to notice are pursued.</p>
            <p eId="para_17340">In this regard, I am informed by the Garda authorities that, to 12 July, 2012, there were 1,204 persons subject to the requirements of Part 2 of the Act.  I am further informed that there have been 33 prosecutions for offences contrary to Part 2 of the Act to date in 2012.</p>
            <p eId="para_17341">I am also informed that when the Garda authorities become aware that a convicted sex offender has left or is intending to leave the State, the Sex Offender Management and Intelligence Unit ensures that the relevant law enforcement agency in the country of destination is advised via Interpol.</p>

            <p eId="para_17536">Doxycycline is licensed for use by the Irish Medicine Board. The choice of chemoprophylaxis medication depends on the risk of malaria in the destination, resistance to particular drugs, the profile of the traveller (contra-indications, underlying health conditions, purpose of travel), the duration of travel and finally adherence issues. Doxycycline has to be taken in the absence of dairy products. It has a daily dosage regime. While it can cause minor but troublesome, mainly gastrointestinal side effects, it can also produce sun-sensitivity skin rashes (akin to severe sun burn) in some individuals.  This is particularly significant when used in very sunny climes. For this reason it is not recommended for first line use by the Defence Forces in sub-Saharan Africa.  It is the anti-malaria chemoprophylaxis of first choice by the Defence Forces in some geographic regions, e.g. Afghanistan.  Information is currently being compiled on the number of tablets issued and I will forward this collated information to the Deputy when it becomes available.</p>

            <p eId="para_17542">The Ministerial Air Transport Service (MATS) is primarily provided by the Gulfstream IV and Learjet 45 aircraft, which were specifically acquired for that purpose. The CASA maritime patrol aircraft have been used infrequently for Ministerial Air Transport missions where no MATS aircraft has been available for operational or technical reasons. Helicopters have also been used on occasion for Ministerial Air Transport in situations where, for operational reasons, fixed wing aircraft may not have been available or suitable for a particular mission.</p>
            <p eId="para_17543">Details of usage of the Ministerial Air Transport Service for 2011 to date in 2012 are set out in the tabular statement attached, and include details of the requesting Minister(s), dates of travel, mission route and Ministerial time on board.</p>
            <p eId="para_17544">My Department follows the normal practice in the aviation business of costing aircraft by reference to the cost per flying hour under each of two headings:</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_17545">The direct cost, which includes costs which are additional to those associated with having the aircraft and which only arise when the aircraft is flown including maintenance, fuel and support services such as catering costs, cleaning services and airport handling charges.</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_17546">The total cost, which is the direct cost plus the costs associated with having the aircraft including depreciation and personnel costs.</p>
            <p eId="para_17547">Details of the hourly costs under each heading, which are applicable to both 2011 and 2012, for each aircraft are contained in the tabular statement below:</p>

Separately, in the course of an investigation the Military Police may enter or search premises that are the property of the Department of Defence.  No search warrant is required for a search by Military Police personnel of such premises.  In addition, the Naval Service has powers to unilaterally intervene at sea.

            <p eId="para_18031">The State Boards under the aegis of the Department of Defence are the Civil Defence Board and the Army Pensions Board.  The Civil Defence Act 2002 provides that the Board shall consist of at least eight but not more than fourteen members who shall be appointed by the Minister for Defence. Legislation is currently being drafted to dissolve the Civil Defence Board and transfer the functions of the Board back into the Department of Defence. I appointed the current Board as an interim measure from 2011. In this context, none of the positions were advertised, nor was the chairperson interviewed by an Oireachtas committee.</p>
            <p eId="para_18032">Membership of the interim Board appointed from 2011 is set out in the following table:</p>

The two ordinary members must be qualified medical practitioners of whom one must be an officer of the Army Medical Corps.  The chairman and the non military ordinary member are appointed by the Minister for Defence with the concurrence of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform.

As the Army Pensions Act 1927 specifies that one of the ordinary members must be an officer of the Army Medical Corps, this position could not be advertised on the Department's website. Details of Commandant Lagun's appointment to the Army Pensions Board were published in the Iris Oifigiúl.  All appointments to Boards under the aegis of my Department are in accordance with the relevant legislation or regulations.</p>

          <speech by="#SimonCoveney" as="#Minister_for_Agriculture,_Food_and_the_Marine" eId="spk_1111">
            <from>Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine (Deputy Simon Coveney)</from>
            <p eId="para_18104">I propose to take Questions Nos. 640 and 669 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_18105">Since their publication, the EU Commission's proposals for reform of the CAP have undergone detailed examination at Council Working Groups, the Special Committee on Agriculture and the Council of Agriculture Ministers. At last month's Agriculture Council, the Danish Presidency presented a progress report outlining the current status of the negotiations. The Cyprus Presidency has continued the negotiating process with debates at the Agriculture Council earlier this week on rural development and market support issues.  Negotiations on the new Multiannual Financial Framework (MFF) for the EU budget for the period 2014 to 2020 are being progressed in parallel, primarily through the General Affairs Council, although the final decisions will be taken by the European Council. Many of the CAP issues, including the key issue of distribution of funds between Member States, are being discussed in the MFF negotiations and will ultimately be agreed as part of these negotiations.  These proposals are also being discussed in the European Parliament and draft reports from EP rapporteurs on each of the Commission's proposals have recently issued.  These will be the subject of substantial discussion and amendment over the coming months and there will be ongoing contact at informal level between the Presidency, Commission and Council as they are developing their positions.</p>
            <p eId="para_18106">My key concerns as regards the reform proposals arise in four areas.  These are the overall CAP funding, the method for distributing CAP funds between Member States, the method for distributing direct payment funds within Member States and the overarching need for simplification in the reformed CAP.</p>
            <p eId="para_18107">On the budget, the funding proposals in the MFF maintain CAP spending at current levels in nominal terms post-2013. The agriculture heading is the one showing the greatest restraint, and in my view the amount proposed by the Commission is the minimum required. However, there are continuing, and intense, pressures for reductions in the proposed overall EU budget, with obvious implications for proposed CAP allocations. The Irish Government will continue to resist any pressure for reductions in the CAP budget.</p>
            <p eId="para_18108">As to the allocation of CAP funds between Member States, the current Commission proposals for Direct Payments in Pillar 1 take a pragmatic approach to redistribution and are broadly satisfactory albeit with some loss to Ireland, estimated at around 1.4%.  The Commission has yet to table a specific proposal for allocation of pillar 2 (rural development) funds.  I have concerns that the basis on which they propose to do so could reduce our allocation.  However I am vigorously defending our Pillar 2 funds, and will continue to do.</p>
            <p eId="para_18109">As to the distribution of direct payments within Member States, the Commission proposal is to gradually move towards a system of uniform per hectare payments, or flat rates, by 2019, in each Member State or region of a Member State.  Many Member States already have such flat rates or are evolving towards them. I recognise that we cannot continue to base our payments on outdated historic production references. Nevertheless, I have major difficulties with the pace and extent of convergence in the Commission's proposal.</p>
            <p eId="para_18110">Under a national flat rate, although the overall allocation to Ireland would not change, around 76,000 Irish farmers would gain an average of 86% on their current payments, while around 57,000 would lose an average of 33%. These are average percentages, and some of the gains and losses would be far larger than this. For example, in the extreme case of those on very high payments of over €1000 per hectare, the loss would be well over 70%.  In general the losses would be incurred by more productive farmers. This would have undesirable consequences at a time when Ireland is trying to encourage sustainable intensification in the agrifood sector, as we strive to achieve the objectives in the Food Harvest 2020 strategy.</p>
            <p eId="para_18111">I have accordingly been pressing for the maximum possible flexibility to be given to Member States to design payment models that suit their own farming conditions I also want a more gradual, back-loaded transition process. The ‘approximation' approach, by which all payments could gradually move towards, but not fully to, the average, is one alternative that I believe should be considered in this regard. The Commission's "pragmatic" proposal for redistribution between Member States is, in effect, an approximation approach and provides a useful precedent. Modelling in my Department suggests that the application of this system to the distribution of funds between farmers in Ireland would lead to much smaller gains and losses to individual farmers than a flat rate system. However the precise level of transfers depends on the details of the methodology used.</p>
            <p eId="para_18112">I have been very active in seeking allies for this position, and I have been making significant progress, particularly with a group of Member States with somewhat similar concerns.  However, it should also be understood that a majority of Member States have no difficulty with the idea of flat rate payments, although they have concerns about other aspects of the proposals.</p>
            <p eId="para_18113">The negotiation process on CAP is a complex and difficult one, but all of my efforts are focused on achieving the best possible outcome for Ireland. These efforts will be continued over the coming months as the process evolves, and will further intensify during our Presidency in 2013.</p>

            <p eId="para_18115">Under the EU Regulations governing the Agri-environment Options Scheme (AEOS) and other area-based payment schemes, a comprehensive administrative check, including cross-checks with the Land Parcel Identification System, must be completed before any payment can issue.</p>
            <p eId="para_18116">Payments under the AEOS 2010 scheme in respect of the 2011 scheme year are issuing on an ongoing basis and all applications that which have cleared the administrative checking process have been paid. A total of 5,443 participants (66% of the applicants of the applicants remaining in the scheme) have now received their full entitlement for the 2011 scheme year. A further 177 applicants have received their 75% payment in respect of 2011 and the balancing payment will issue at the earliest opportunity. The issues arising on unpaid cases relate, in the main, to invalid capital investment claim details submitted by applicants. My Department continues to process the outstanding cases an ongoing basis in correspondence and contact with the scheme participants and payments will continue as outstanding queries are resolved.</p>
            <p eId="para_18117">Payments under the AEOS 2011 scheme are also subject to the comprehensive administrative checks. This process has now been completed and I expect payments to commence very shortly. Every effort is being made to ensure that participants receive their initial payments under the scheme as quickly as possible. In the event of any queries arising from these checks my Department will be in direct contact with the applicants concerned as soon as possible. Payments to both AEOS 2010 and 2011 scheme participants in respect of 2012 will commence later in the year.</p>

            <p eId="para_18133">Background</p>
            <p eId="para_18134">The EU Sugar Regime underwent a radical reform in 2005 and Greencore, the holder of the entire Irish sugar quota availed of the sugar restructuring scheme, dismantled all its facilities and ceased production in 2006. Post reform production is now concentrated in 18 Member States. The present regime runs from 1 September 2006 to the 30 September 2015.</p>
            <p eId="para_18135">The total compensation package negotiated in the context of the reform of the EU sugar regime was worth a total of €353million to Ireland. This sum was made up of €220million to beet growers, €6 million to machinery contractors and €127 million to Greencore. The beet growers' share was made up of restructuring aid of €53 million, diversification aid of €44 million and €123 million via the Single Farm Payment. All elements of the Restructuring Scheme have now been implemented, not just within Ireland but across the EU.</p>
            <p eId="para_18136">Current Position</p>
            <p eId="para_18137">There is no mechanism under the current EU Regulations which would allow for the re-instatement of the sugar quota for the growing of sugar beet in Ireland for the production of sugar. In 2011 I met with two separate groups who had conducted feasibility studies, into the possibility of establishing a sugar/bioethanol facility here. At both meetings, I stated that any venture to develop a combined sugar/bioethanol production facility would have to be a commercial proposition, financed in total by investors and interested parties and make sound economic sense in order to be viable. I also further suggested to both groups the desirability of there being only one single proposition in play, as both studies had indicated a potential for only one such viable project and both groups had appeared to accept the reasonableness of this position at the time.</p>
            <p eId="para_18138">I have strongly supported the abolition of sugar quotas from 30 September 2015, as part of the ongoing CAP reform discussions and at each Council of Ministers meeting since October 2011, which has addressed this issue, I have intervened to fully support the Commission proposals for full quota abolition.  During the course of Commissioner Ciolos's visit to Dublin in January 2012, I informed him of the growing momentum in Ireland for the revival of the sugar industry.</p>
            <p eId="para_18139">I also informed the Commissioner that while Ireland supports quota abolition in 2015, if the regime continues beyond that date, Ireland does not want to be deprived in the interim period of the option to recommence production <i>.</i>   I am actively involved in CAP reform negotiations concerning the EU sugar regime, which are continuing.</p>

Following the appeal decision the outcome of the inspection has been amended on the Department's systems and payment issued to the person named on the 9th of July 2012.</p>

The application for the grant (<i>Form 3</i>) was received on 10th July 2012 and this has not been fully processed yet. On the Form 3, the applicant’s forestry company declared that there is poor growth with trees in one of the plots; that plot equals about 20% of the plantation area. On this basis, an inspection will be undertaken by the Forest Service to ensure that the plantation is up to the standard required under the scheme. Payments cannot be made until the plantation has been deemed up to the required standard. It is expected that the inspection will be carried out by the Forest Service in the coming weeks.</p>

         his views on the implications for herds contiguous of a TB risk breakdown whereby neighbours of a person who has two or more reactors are now also restricted from trading unless they themselves had a herd test in the previous four months; if he has any plans to extend the period to six months in order that normal trading will continue; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

            <from>Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine (Deputy Simon Coveney)</from>
            <p eId="para_18180">The bovine TB eradication programme includes a comprehensive range of measures aimed at eradicating TB from the cattle population in Ireland through testing and the control of cattle movements in order to prevent the spread of disease. More specifically, the programme provides for the mandatory annual testing of all cattle in the national herd, the implementation of a range of supplementary tests and the restriction of herds where TB is disclosed or suspected.</p>
            <p eId="para_18181">With regard to restrictions on holdings which adjoin a holding containing a herd which has disclosed TB, my Department has implemented what is known as a Contiguous testing programme for the past 30 years. Under this programme, herdowners whose herds are adjoining a holding where a high risk TB breakdown has been disclosed, usually involving more than one reactor, are required to have their herd tested if it has not been tested within the preceding 4 months.</p>
            <p eId="para_18182">The eradication programme is reviewed on an ongoing basis by my Department in light of experience and research. Following a review conducted on the programme last year, my Department introduced a number of changes in order to ensure that the programme addressed all potential sources of infection and to prevent the spread of disease from infected herds to clear herds. These changes, which were made following a number of consultation meetings with the farming organisations, are, firstly, based on research which demonstrates  that there are increased risks attached to the movement of certain animals and, secondly, are designed to protect clear herds from buying in high risk animals.</p>
            <p eId="para_18183">With regard to the changes to the arrangements relating to the testing of neighbouring or contiguous herds, I would like to emphasise that the only change which my Department has made is that herds adjoining a high risk breakdown are now being trade restricted, except to slaughter, pending a TB test. They will, however, be permitted to buy in cattle for a short period while awaiting a test. Previously, such herds were permitted to sell cattle on the open market prior to carrying out the test and research had shown that this posed a risk to clear herds. Research has shown the TB risk relating to animals that move out of herds which have been identified as contiguous to a herd experiencing an active high risk TB breakdown is almost 3 times greater than the risk in the case of herds tested on a round test. The objective of the restriction is to protect clear herds from buying in infected animals from these herds and thereby avoid the situation where a clear herd that buys in infected cattle is required to carry out a minimum of 2 herd tests and is restricted for 4 months.</p>
            <p eId="para_18184">I have clarified that herd owners will be contacted by my Department prior to restriction and only those herds which, on a case by case consideration, are identified as genuinely relevant to the breakdown will be restricted. Those farmers whose herds are restricted can minimise any impact by arranging to have their herds tested as soon as possible. Any herd which tests clear will be immediately de-restricted.</p>
            <p eId="para_18185">With regard to the four month testing interval, the choice of four months as the benchmark period under this programme is not new and has been part of the contiguous testing programme for the past 30 years. The four month period is related to the time interval from when an animal may be exposed to infection and the expectation that a test will give a positive result, if the animal is infected. In line with the new procedures relating to overdue tests, it is open to herd owners who have a genuine reason for delaying the contiguous test to get in contact with my Department and the test can be deferred for up to one month without penalty. I would also emphasise that staff in my regional offices will always be available to discuss, with any affected herd owner, the particular circumstances relating to their herd. I would finally underline that the primary objective of the initiative is to reduce the risk that farmer purchasers of animals will unknowingly buy a potentially infected animal from a higher risk herd.</p>
            <p eId="para_18186">Finally, I believe that the restriction on contiguous herds pending a test should have a very limited effect on trade in cattle. In effect, it is only those herds in which TB is disclosed that will be restricted for any significant period of time.</p>

            <p eId="para_18188">The delay in the processing of aquaculture licences largely arises because the majority of areas for which aquaculture licences are sought are located in Special Areas of Conservation under the EU Habitats Directive and/or Special Protection Areas under the EU Birds Directive (Natura 2000 sites).  An additional factor is that all aquaculture applications now undergo Environmental Impact pre-screening assessment which requires significant input from my Department's scientific and technical advisors.</p>
            <p eId="para_18189">All applications in ‘Natura 2000 areas' are required to be appropriately assessed for the purpose of environmental compliance with the EU Habitats/Birds Directives.  My Department, in conjunction with the Marine Institute and the National Parks and Wildlife Service (NPWS) of the Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, is engaged in a comprehensive programme to gather the necessary baseline data appropriate to the conservation objectives of ‘Natura 2000' areas.  This data collection programme is substantially complete.  Analysis of the data, together with the setting of appropriate conservation objectives by the NPWS, will enable all new, renewal and review applications to be appropriately assessed for the purpose of ensuring compliance with the EU Birds and Habitats Directives.  This work represents a significant financial, administrative and scientific investment by the State in resolving this issue.  The Appropriate Assessment of aquaculture applications is being dealt with on a bay-by-bay basis.</p>
            <p eId="para_18190">My Department continues to make every effort to expedite the determination of all aquaculture applications having regard to the complexities of each case and the need to comply fully with all national and EU legislation.</p>

The person named subsequently appealed this decision. His appeal was unsuccessful and the initial decision was upheld. He subsequently lodged a further appeal to the Agriculture Appeals Office, which partly allowed his appeal. However, the Department requested a review and the review officer overruled the original decision and reinstated the 100% penalty. The person named has been advised that he may appeal the decision of the Agriculture Appeals Office to the Office of the Ombudsman, 18 Lower Leeson Street, Dublin 2.</p>

            <p eId="para_18260">In general, cattle may only be moved under a movement permit issued by my Department from a TB restricted herd direct to a slaughter plant. However, a movement permit may be issued, in exceptional cases, for the movement of non-infected cattle to another pre-identified and assessed holding where there are sound animal welfare reasons for such movement e.g. where there are insufficient facilities or feed for the remaining animals, particularly calves, which cannot be disposed of in accordance with the normal trading pattern of the herdowner. In practice, such movements are extremely rare and are only permitted where the Department is satisfied that it will not have a detrimental impact on surrounding farms, livestock and livelihood.</p>
            <p eId="para_18261">The specific case for which details were supplied by the Deputy was initially allowed in 2011 and has since been used to relieve stress on facilities, feed or resources for other similar cases.  The farm to which calves move is restricted.  The calves are confined to one fragment of the farm that is bounded by a canal at one side, by roads and by housing on the others and is therefore not contiguous to and does not pose a risk to any livestock.  They are required to pass two tests before the herd is declared officially TB free.  While the calves are then eligible for sale on the open market, the practice is that they subsequently only move to other fragments of the same holding or to another fattening holding for finishing or slaughter.</p>
            <p eId="para_18262">My Department is satisfied that a full evaluation of the process has been conducted and that any movement permits issued under these exceptional circumstances have not posed a risk to the neighbouring herds of the person concerned or to the farming community generally.</p>

            <p eId="para_18268">The tax changes in Budget 2012 encourage partnership formation and incentivise inter-generational land transfer. I believe they will be of real benefit to young farmers and towards developing the sector and the economy generally.</p>
            <p eId="para_18269">One of the most significant new measures introduced in Budget 2012 was the new stock relief incentive to encourage farm partnerships. Subject to EU State Aid approval, the current rate of 25% stock relief for registered farm partnerships, will increase to 50%, and, for certain young trained farmers entering such partnerships, a rate of 100% stock relief will be available.  This new incentive will run until December 2015. I support farm partnerships because I believe that collaboration through partnership can bring more innovative and energetic young prospective farmers into farming while improving farm structures and production levels. Encouraging farm partnerships will also support the dairy herd expansion required over the coming years and enable Irish farmers to avail of the opportunity presented by the abolition of EU milk quotas in March 2015.</p>
            <p eId="para_18270">Budget 2012 also reduced the stamp duty rate on agricultural land from 6% to 2%, with immediate effect. In addition, half the rate (1%) will be applicable on transfers to close relatives until the end of 2014.  This change should stimulate a stagnant land market — currently only 0.5% of total agricultural land is offered for sale annually — and ensure that land transfers to more active producers.  It will also promote inter-generational transfer, as the cost of lifetime transfer to transferees who do not qualify for the young trained farmer stamp duty relief has reduced considerably.  This measure is designed to give younger, progressive, commercial farmers a greater opportunity to purchase land and help make the farm more competitive.</p>
            <p eId="para_18271">The retirement relief available on Capital Gains Tax was also restructured to encourage farmers around the normal retirement age, who have successors, to transfer their land and holdings to young, innovative, ambitious, prospective farmers.  This restructuring will also encourage farmers with no successors to sell some of their land before normal retirement age.  This measure will encourage an improvement in the age profile of farmers, and should ensure that farmland is put to more productive use.</p>
            <p eId="para_18272">There are also a variety of measures operated by my Department on an ongoing basis which encourage young persons to commit to full-time farming.  These include the scheme for new entrants to dairying under the CAP Health Check, the dairy efficiency programme and the newly established Beef Technology Adoption Programme.  The roll-out of the discussion groups, in particular, give beef and dairy farmers access to a range of additional management and financial skills and supports which encourage significant efficiency gains.</p>

            <p eId="para_18274">My commitment to agri-environmental schemes are evident in the funding of €243m which has been provided to meet commitments under Rural Environment Protection Scheme (REPS) and the Agri-environment Options Scheme (AEOS) in 2012. The commitment is also clear from the fact that despite serious budgetary pressures, I re-opened the AEOS to new entrants last year. Strict budgetary constraints remain in place and, as a result, the management of the limited resources represents a very challenging situation involving difficult choices.</p>

            <p eId="para_18288">The Government is committed to reforming the public service to achieve greater efficiencies in the delivery of services. The ‘Public Service Agreement 2010-2014' aims to create a smaller and more integrated public service and requires all public service organisations to do more with less. New structures are envisaged to facilitate greater staff mobility and to promote sharing of services. Reallocation of work and redeployment of staff will be an essential part of this process. In addition, each sector of the Public Service has been requested to establish its own Strategic Workforce Action Plan to help deploy staffing resources more optimally, especially in the context of planned reductions in public service numbers.</p>
            <p eId="para_18289">Public service bodies are also subject to the moratorium on recruitment and restrictions on staff numbers under the Employment Control Framework (ECF) process. This requires bodies to assess and plan for current and ongoing staffing requirements within existing resources. Additional resources can only be considered in limited circumstances and in compliance with Government targets to reduce staff numbers.</p>
            <p eId="para_18290">Teagasc has statutory responsibility to deliver research, education and advisory services to the agrifood sector. Despite reductions in numbers, they retain a staff complement of almost 1,200 staff including advisors, teachers, research scientists and administrators. They have been granted a number of exemptions under the moratorium to recruit permanent staff including, for example, 10 research scientists and 6 teachers in the agricultural colleges. Sanction has also been granted for Teagasc to recruit over 80 fixed term research contractors to work on essential research projects. A number of fixed term advisors have also been recruited to work on Joint Industry Funded Advisory Programmes such as Better Farm.</p>

I understand that a number of other Member States have also made similar requests. I am both particularly mindful of the importance of the Single Payment to individual farmers and also of the benefit to the wider rural community and, in light of ongoing general financial difficulties, but particularly the recent very unseasonable weather, I have decided to approach the Commissioner, as indicated.</p>
            <p eId="para_18293">In a bilateral meeting with the Commissioner yesterday I addressed the issue of advance payment in view of the effects of the weather on farming and asked if the Commission would consider going beyond the 50% to a 70% advance.

            <p eId="para_18295">The pigmeat sector in Ireland has remained resilient in recent years in the face of considerable difficulties. Production increased by over 17% between 2008 and 2011. The sector remains the third largest individual component of the agrifood industry and supports approximately 7,000 jobs, many of which are in rural communities. Production, prices and exports increased significantly in 2011, and growth has continued in 2012 to date. Robust domestic demand coupled with a strong performance in export markets, should help ensure progress in the coming years.</p>

            <p eId="para_18315">The UK has consistently been the largest export market for Irish pigmeat, accounting for more than 40% of export volume and over 60% in value. Trade to Continental Europe has remained strong notwithstanding the current economic climate, with over a quarter of volume and almost one fifth in value terms destined for this market. France, Germany and Italy are the largest individual Continental markets. Third Country trade has grown considerably in recent years, with volumes to China, Russia Japan and the USA increasing significantly. Improved access to these markets, together with growing demand, resulted in almost one-third of volume and a fifth in value being sold internationally in 2011.</p>
            <p eId="para_18316">In addition, over 600,000 pigs are exported live, with the majority of these destined for the UK. This trade is valued at approximately €60 million.</p>
            <p eId="para_18317">Pigmeat remains the most consumed meat worldwide with demand expected to continue to increase in the medium term. This will continue to present opportunities for Irish producers. Bord Bia continues, through its marketing and promotional activities, and through the pigmeat quality assurance scheme, to consolidate the position of Irish pigmeat on the domestic market and to expand its presence on EU and third country markets.</p>

            <from>Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine (Deputy Simon Coveney)</from>
            <p eId="para_18320">I propose to take Questions Nos. 683 and 684 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_18321">The pig sector accounts for approximately 6% of the overall agrifood industry and is the third largest individual component of the agrifood sector. Output, prices and exports have continued the growth of recent years to date in 2012.    The ‘ <i>Food Harvest 2020 Report</i>’, published in July 2010, sets out the vision for the future of the food industry including the pig sector and targets a 50% increase in the value of output by 2020. I am confident that, given the appropriate supports and expertise, this target will be achieved.</p>
            <p eId="para_18322">One of the primary issues for the sector at present concerns new EU Animal Welfare rules which set down new standards in relation to the housing of sows. These are due to come into force on 1 January 2013. A significant number of producers have undertaken the necessary work required in order to upgrade their facilities in order to comply with the new rules. In March 2012, Teagasc estimated that approximately 36% of pig units, housing some 44% of the sow population were presently compliant with the provisions.  I have been clear in my view that a fully compliant pig sector is an essential regulatory and competitive requirement with effect from 1st January 2013.</p>
            <p eId="para_18323">To facilitate compliance with the requirements, an on-farm investment aid scheme (TAMS) — the Sow Housing Welfare Scheme was introduced under Ireland's Rural Development Programme 2007-2013. I have recently announced a number of enhancements to this scheme which will further assist farmers in completing the necessary investment works. The investment ceiling has been increased to €500,000 per pig producer for the first sow house. In addition, an investment ceiling of €300,000 will now be available for each of the next three houses. The maximum grant rate of 40% of investment remains unchanged. I have provided a total of €13 million for this scheme with €4 million already committed and I welcome applications from pig producers before the 31 October application deadline for this funding.</p>
            <p eId="para_18324">I should add that this scheme is in addition to earlier Sow Welfare Schemes which delivered over €6 million to successful applicants.</p>
            <p eId="para_18325">With regard to financial support available to the pig industry, Enterprise Ireland operates various programmes relating to company development. Included among these are Research and Development and Innovation Funding. Through a mix of funding, advice and expertise, Enterprise Ireland works with companies planning or engaging in R&amp;D. Assistance for product development is also available through the Teagasc National Food Centre in Ashtown, Dublin 15. A number of businesses within the pig sector have availed of these programmes in recent years.</p>

            <p eId="para_18390">The Family Support Agency provides support for families under the Family Resource Centre (FRC) Programme. The aim is to combat disadvantage and improve the functioning of the family unit. Key services provided by FRCs include:</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_18391">Information, advice and support for groups and families at local level.</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_18392">Assistance to community groups (such as training and the shared use of facilities).</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_18393">Education courses and training opportunities.</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_18394">Childcare facilities for those attending courses provided by the FRC.</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_18395">After-school clubs.</p>
            <p eId="para_18396">A key role for FRCs is in providing information and advice. In 2010, over 136,000 people were advised directly by an FRC and a further 56,000 people were referred onwards to other information providers. The VEC's and the Money Advice and Budgeting Service (MABS) were the services to which people were most frequently referred.</p>
            <p eId="para_18397">FRCs have a broad range of involvement with children and young people and work closely with many local schools. The range of interventions include early childhood care and education, initiatives to retain children and young people in school, breakfast clubs, homework clubs, youth cafés, community based youth work, facilities and services for young people, work with particular target groups of vulnerable young people and work on issues of particular concern/risk to young people e.g. alcohol and drugs prevention, etc.</p>
            <p eId="para_18398">The Agency also provides funding to voluntary and community organisations providing marriage, relationship, child and bereavement counselling services. Some 600 organisations are funded each year. These services aim to support people deal with difficulties they are experiencing in their relationships, to help children whose lives have been affected by parental separation and to support families who have experienced the death of a family member. Over 20,000 individual counselling sessions were delivered within FRCs in 2010.</p>
            <p eId="para_18399">Looking to the future, the Family Support Agency will, along with the HSE's Children and Family Services, form an integral part of the new Child and Family Support Agency, due to be established in 2013. Plans for the transition to this new entity are well under way. I believe this will provide for greater integration of these complementary services, with their shared aims of supporting parents and families and ensuring the welfare and protection of children are adequately safeguarded.</p>

            <p eId="para_18401">The Family Support Agency, under my Department, operates the Family Resource Centre Programme. The aim of the Family Resource Centre Programme is to combat disadvantage and improve the functioning of the family unit. The programme funds 107 family resource centres throughout the country. It emphasises involving local communities in tackling the problems they face, and creating successful partnerships between voluntary and statutory agencies at community level.</p>
            <p eId="para_18402">A number of Community Savings Schemes operate within the family resource centre structure. These schemes are managed by local voluntary committees, and are staffed by volunteers. At present there are over 1,500 people availing of 6 savings schemes located within centres based in Kilkenny, Wexford and Limerick.</p>
            <p eId="para_18403">Community Savings Schemes operate on a not-for-profit basis and do not offer credit to clients. They promote the practice of saving as a low-cost and low-risk alternative to accessing credit.  The Schemes offer an opportunity for families to prepare themselves in advance for the costs associated with expensive family events such as Christmas, back to school, Holy Communions, etc. They represent a welcome alternative to moneylenders and other expensive credit options.</p>
            <p eId="para_18404">The schemes encourage families to be pro-active in their approach to budgeting for foreseen and unexpected events. To advance the practice of saving, rather than borrowing, a special emphasis is placed on promoting the involvement of children and young people.</p>

          <speech by="#FrancesFitzgerald" as="#Minister_for_Children_and_Youth_Affairs" eId="spk_1158">
            <from>Minister for Children and Youth Affairs (Deputy Frances Fitzgerald)</from>
            <p eId="para_18406">Under EU telecoms rules agreed in 2009, the 116000 number is reserved in all EU member states for a missing children hotline. My Department established and is leading a cross-sectoral Project Team, including representatives of my own Department, the Department of Justice and Equality, ComReg and An Garda Síochána to advance this matter. Following cross departmental consultation and an examination of the issues involved by the Project team, Comreg, which has responsibility for allocation of this number in Ireland, has now allocated the number to the ISPCC. The ISPCC has recently been successful in securing EU Daphne funding to support the establishment of the line.</p>
            <p eId="para_18407">It is envisaged that a phased implementation of the 116000 line will commence in 2012. In the interim, a holding response is currently heard if an individual rings the 116000 number. The number advises callers wishing to report a missing child to contact An Garda Síochána and advises children seeking assistance to contact the ISPCC.</p>
            <p eId="para_18408">Once operational, the line will:</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_18409">(1) Provide emotional support to children who are missing, their family and others responsible for the missing child.</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_18410">(2) Offer guidance and advice to the callers regarding a missing child.</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_18411">(3) Report risk cases (where identifying information has been received) to the Garda/HSE as per Children First Guidance.</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_18412">(4) Support the Garda Investigation where appropriate.</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_18413">(5) Redirect calls outside the scope of the line.</p>
            <p eId="para_18414">It is important to note that the 116000 number is not an emergency number. Emergency calls should always be directed to the 999/112 number in the first instance, where the relevant emergency responses, including the recently launched Garda Missing Children Amber Alert mechanism, may be activated. The establishment of the 116000 line will, however, be of valuable support and assistance to families of missing children and to missing children themselves.</p>

            <p eId="para_18420">I propose to take Questions Nos. 693 to 697, inclusive, together.</p>
            <p eId="para_18421">Under the Child Care (Pre-School Services) (No. 2) Regulations 2006 the requirements for an adult practitioner in pre-school services are set out at Part II, Article 5 of the Regulations.</p>
            <p eId="para_18422">Nearly all pre-school services in the State are now participating in the Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE) programme, which provides a free pre-school year to all eligible children in the year before they commence primary school. This programme requires that staff members acting as pre-school year leaders hold a childcare qualification equivalent to FETAC Level 5 on the National Framework of Qualifications of Ireland (NFQ).  A higher capitation rate is available to sessional playschool services participating in the ECCE programme in which all childcare workers have qualification levels above the minimum requirements for the programme. Staff working with children under the ECCE programme, as pre-school assistants, are not required to hold an educational qualification.</p>
            <p eId="para_18423">Pobal, which administers the childcare support programmes on behalf, of my Department compiles an Annual Survey of the Early Years Sectors which provide information in relation to the level of qualifications of practitioners in the childcare sector.  According to Pobal's Annual Survey of the Early Years Sector 2011 there are in the region of 4,300 childcare services participating in the ECCE programme and approximately 3,280 of these services responded to the survey.  Of this number, some 2,920 provided information on the level of training/qualifications of some 17,000 staff working with children. The results, which did not distinguish between those working with children enrolled for the ECCE programme and other children in the childcare service, show that 96% of these services have a least one staff member qualified to FETAC Level 5 or higher, 75.2% have at least one member qualified to FETAC Level 6 or higher and 34% have a least one member qualified to HETAC Level 7 or higher.  The number of services with one staff member qualified to HETAC Level 8 and above and HETAC Level 9 and above is 22.3% and 3.2% respectively. As the Deputy is aware my Department has commenced work on Ireland's first-ever Early Years Strategy and in the terms of reference, as approved by Government, I expressly included the need to consider "a robust system of regulation and inspection", for the new Early Years Strategy. Part of this will include improving access to quality reliable information on services and performance.  I have asked the recently established Expert Advisory Group to prioritise a review of this matter.</p>
            <p eId="para_18424">It is expected that in time a register of staff qualifications will be developed and providers should encourage staff to record the relevant details of their qualifications there.</p>

It is taking account of all managed movement into, around, and out of the Department including retirement, recruitment, promotion, secondment, transfers and redeployment opportunities. As part of this process, specific skills in the area of legal, financial, research, economic, change management and human resources have already been identified as requiring development.

            <from>Minister for Children and Youth Affairs (Deputy Frances Fitzgerald)</from>
            <p eId="para_18445">I propose to take Questions Nos. 702 to 709, inclusive, together.</p>
            <p eId="para_18446">The Government currently supports the provision of early childhood care and education through three support programmes — the Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE) programme, the Community Childcare Subvention (CCS) programme and the Childcare Education and Training Support (CETS) programme. These programmes are implemented by my Department.</p>
            <p eId="para_18447">The Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE) programme is a universal programme to which all children have access when they are in the qualifying age range of 3 years 2 months and 4 years and 7 months at 1 September in the year that they enrol for the programme. In the region of 4,300 preschool services are providing the free preschool provision.</p>
            <p eId="para_18448">The Community Childcare Subvention (CCS) programme provides funding to community childcare services to enable them to charge reduced childcare rates to low income and disadvantaged families. The Childcare Education and Training Support (CETS) programme provides free childcare places in both community and commercial services to qualifying FÁS and Vocational Educational Committees (VECs) trainees and students. There is no specific funding targeted at the 0 to 3 years age group and children of all age categories, whose parents qualify under these programmes, are eligible to enrol. In the region of 2,400 childcare services are participating in the CCS and CETS programmes.</p>
            <p eId="para_18449">The staff/child ratios are governed by the Child Care (Preschool Services) (No. 2) Regulations 2006. These currently require that, where children are in the ECCE age cohort, there should be a ratio of no more than 1:10. It has been decided to increase this ratio to a maximum of 1:11 from September 2012. Other ratios apply to different age groups availing of different levels of service, as outlined in the Regulations. The introduction of universal preschool provision in January 2010 and with it the requirements that preschool leaders have to have a minimum of a full award at FETAC Level 5 on the National Framework of Qualifications has acted as a major impetus for early years practitioners to acquire qualifications.  To assist staff to achieve the full requirement in advance of the September 2012 deadline, arrangements were put in place by my Department to provide a subsidised on-line training initiative. A subsidy of €50 per module was provided which reduced the cost per module to €125.</p>
            <p eId="para_18450">It is also my objective to incrementally develop the ECCE programme over the term of this Government as resources permit. A key element of this is the implementation of the Workforce Development Plan by the Early Education Policy Unit of the Department of Education and Skills, which is co-located in my Department.</p>
            <p eId="para_18451">The Workforce Development Plan identified different distinct groups including new entrants to the workforce who wish to become appropriately qualified for specific occupational roles and responsibilities, and unqualified practitioners in the current workforce who want to achieve a Level 5 award. For new entrants to the workforce the publication of Common Award Standards at NFQ Levels 4, 5 and 6 is a welcome development. Programmes of learning developed to meet these new award standards will incorporate national practice frameworks and will reflect national policy objectives, thereby ensuring that graduates of these programmes are fully prepared to enter the workforce. Training providers have begun to develop new programmes to meet these award standards and, subject to validation by FETAC, the first of these, the FETAC Level 5 Major Award in Early Childhood Care and Education, will come on stream shortly through the VECs. As the Deputy may be aware the Department of Children and Youth Affairs was established on 3 June 2011. In relation to 2011 and the specific information requested by the Deputy, my Department's total spend on childcare related programmes as per the out-turn on Voted Expenditure was €248.8 million, which is 0.16 per cent of total GDP for that year, which was €156.4 billion. This expenditure total (and percentage of GDP) does not include expenditure under other early intervention programmes or by other Departments on early years' programmes and services and therefore does not represent the full extent of state expenditure. The number of children supported by the programmes administered by my Department is in the region of 100,000, of which some 320 children were identified as having special needs and were supported under the ECCE programme.</p>
            <p eId="para_18452">In 2012, Ireland's GDP is expected to be some €159 billion and my Department's total spend on childcare related programmes is expected to be €256.8 million, which is again 0.16 per cent of the expected total GDP. The number of children supported by the programmes is expected to increase in the school year 2012/2013 with an estimated 3,000 additional children qualifying in the eligible cohort for the ECCE programme and also additional parents becoming eligible under the CCS programme. In any given academic year, experience has shown that between 300 and 350 children with special needs are supported under the ECCE programme.</p>

            <p eId="para_18480">The Family Support Agency, under my Department, operates the Family Resource Centre Programme. The aim of the Family Resource Centre Programme is to combat disadvantage and improve the functioning of the family unit. The programme funds 107 family resource centres throughout the country. It emphasises involving local communities in tackling the problems they face, and creating successful partnerships between voluntary and statutory agencies at community level.</p>
            <p eId="para_18481">A key objective of the Department of Children and Youth Affairs is the improvement of outcomes for children. Family resource centres have an important role to play in harnessing local community efforts to support this objective. On 5 December 2011, the Government announced the funding levels being made available to my Department in 2012.  The Family Support Agency, like all other State bodies, was asked to make savings across all the programmes which it administers. The Agency is required to achieve savings of 5% per annum on the costs of the Family Resource Centre Programme, over the years 2012 to 2014.</p>
            <p eId="para_18482">The Family Support Agency wrote to the family resources centres, advising them of the reduction in funding and the need to plan for change. The Agency is acutely aware of the challenges that the reduction in funding presents. It did not stipulate how centres should apply the reduction in funding, but asked the centres to focus in particular on addressing the scope for greater efficiencies to include reducing the day-to-day administration and overhead costs associated with the running of the centres. The objective of this is to continue to support, as far as possible, the services that the centres provide to local families and groups. The Agency advised the centres to engage with and seek every assistance from the two regional support agencies that provide support and training to them.</p>
            <p eId="para_18483">In 2012 an allocation of €26.465m has been made available to the Family Support Agency to fund its services for families.  This includes funding of over €15m for the Family Resource Centre Programme.</p>

            <p eId="para_18493">Under the regulations, the National Children and Family Office of the Health Service Executive (HSE) is responsible generally for inspecting preschool services with the objective of securing the health, safety and welfare of children attending them.  Pre-school inspection teams appointed by the Executive have responsibility for the notification and inspection procedures in relation to childcare services that are statutorily required to notify under the Regulations.  These teams also provide an advisory service to these childcare services in order to assist them in achieving and maintaining the appropriate standard.

A prescriber may prescribe a medicine which he/she believes is best suited to meet the individual needs of the patient concerned. The Health (Pricing and Supply of Medical Goods) Bill sets out provisions for the interchangeability of medicines. The Bill contains a provision whereby a prescriber can exempt a prescribed medicine from being substituted for another brand of that medicine for clinical reasons.</p>

            <p eId="para_18522">The HSE has reviewed the proposal of the Irish Society of Hearing Aid Audiologists (ISHAA). Due to the costs involved, it is not possible for the HSE to agree to fund the proposal. The HSE is open to discussions with ISHAA on any further issues which it wishes to discuss.</p>
            <p eId="para_18523">The HSE's Audiology Clinical Care Programme is working on a number of concurrent initiatives to reduce waiting lists. The initiatives include a revalidation of the national waiting lists in 2012 and the development of standardised policies and procedures for referrals to services and collation of activity data.  Merging and re-organisation of services across community and acute care into a single managerial and clinical structure with high quality clinical leadership will lead to more efficient use of staff resources. The HSE is at present actively recruiting  for five clinical lead posts including a National Clinical Lead. In addition, the HSE is sponsoring ten MSc in Audiology students to study in the UK and it is hoped that they will be ready to join the workforce in September 2013.</p>

The SDU is working closely with its partner agencies — mainly the HSE and the NTPF.</p>
            <p eId="para_18526">As a priority, public hospitals were instructed to ensure that, by the end of 2011, they had no patients waiting more than 12 months for treatment.

            <p eId="para_18529">The HSE has no statutory obligation to provide patient transport, other than emergency transport.  The cost to the health service of providing non-emergency patient transport, in particular for outpatient (OPD) appointments, has been escalating in recent years and non-essential provision has been identified as an area suitable for budgetary control.  Accordingly, criteria have been restricted considerably in recent times and a uniform approach is being rolled out across the health regions.</p>
            <p eId="para_18530">In general, patients are expected to make their own way to and from hospital and OPD appointments, using private or scheduled public transport. The exceptions are for dialysis, cancer (radiotherapy and chemotherapy) and post-operative transplant patients. In these cases, the patient's appointment should be directly related to the treatment. Transport may also be provided where, in the clinician's view, the patient would be unable to make the journey without clinical assistance or where the patient must be transported on a stretcher.</p>
            <p eId="para_18531">Where transport has been withdrawn, having previously been provided, this may be as a result of the Local Health Office (LHO) beginning to implement the national criteria. If a patient feels there is a genuine case for provision, then they should approach the LHO. If they feel there is a genuine clinical reason for transport to be provided, their clinician should make a case for it.</p>
            <p eId="para_18532">Under the supplementary welfare allowance (SWA) scheme, the Department of Social Protection may make a single payment to help meet essential, once-off, exceptional expenditure, which a person could not reasonably be expected to meet out of their weekly income. These payments are known as Exceptional Needs Payments (ENPs).  The amount paid, if any, is assessed by Departmental staff (former Community Welfare Officers) on a case by case basis, depending on the nature of each particular exceptional need and the type of assistance required.  There is no automatic entitlement to such payments i.e. the fact that a person is dependent on a social welfare or HSE payment does not necessarily mean that they will qualify for an ENP.</p>

            <p eId="para_18546">The only available data concerning administrative costs in health services is to be found in the System of Health Accounts (SHA) data collected by the OECD. As Ireland currently does not supply data in this format it is impossible to compare Ireland with other countries' data, and indeed, there is no data available from this source in relation to either the UK or Australia. The SHA data focuses on General Government spending on different functions of care. One of these functions of care is "Health administration and health insurance". This is defined as activities of private insurers and central and local authorities and social security. Included are the planning, management, regulation, and collection of funds and handling of claims of the delivery system. Public administrative costs borne by health care providers such as patient records and hospital management are allocated to the providing institutions, not to general administrations.  Due to the diverse definitions of administrative costs, it is neither possible nor appropriate to attempt to compare this figure with other jurisdictions.</p>

            <p eId="para_18562">The Special Delivery Unit (SDU) is working  to unblock access to acute services by  improving the flow of patients through the system, and by streamlining waiting lists, including the management of  referrals from GPs by hospitals.  The SDU is working closely with its partner agencies — mainly the HSE and the NTPF.  As a priority, public hospitals were instructed to ensure that, by the end of 2011, they had no patients waiting more than 12 months for treatment.  I can confirm that the vast majority of hospitals achieved this objective.  During 2012, the SDU will support hospitals in the delivery of a 9 month maximum wait time for inpatient or daycase surgery.  As this is a service matter, it has been referred to the HSE for direct reply. Should the patient's general practitioner consider that the patient's condition warrants an earlier appointment, he/she would be in the best position to take the matter up with the consultant and hospital involved.</p>

            <p eId="para_18566">I propose to take Questions Nos. 738, 739 and 764 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_18567">Section 11 of the General Medical Services (GMS) GP Capitation Contract, which was introduced in 1989, provides that the medical practitioner shall provide for eligible persons, on behalf of the Health Service Executive, all proper and necessary treatment of a kind usually undertaken by a general practitioner and not requiring special skill or experience of a degree or kind which general practitioners cannot reasonably be expected to possess.  General Practitioners (GPs) who hold General Medical Services (GMS) contracts with the HSE must not seek or accept money from medical card or GP visit card holders for services covered under the GMS contract. In circumstances where the taking of blood is necessary to either:</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_18568">(a)  assist in the process of diagnosing a patient; or</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_18569">(b)  monitor a diagnosed condition;</p>
            <p eId="para_18570">the GP may not charge the patient if they are eligible for free GMS services.  At my request, the HSE has written to all GMS GPs reminding them of their obligations under their contract in respect of services such as phlebotomy and advised them that charges should not be applied for such services.</p>
            <p eId="para_18571">The HSE is encouraging eligible patients who believe they have been inappropriately charged by a GP for routine phlebotomy services to seek a refund from the GP in question.  Alternatively, they may wish to follow up with the HSE and the matter will be fully investigated.  Formal complaints will be dealt with through the HSE's Consumer Affairs Service.  It is appreciated that because of the nature of the GP/patient relationship, it may be difficult for patients to make such complaints.  Where public representatives are made aware of GPs charging GMS patients in error, they may wish to notify the HSE directly.</p>
            <p eId="para_18572">The Programme for Government provides for the introduction of a new GMS GP contract with an increased emphasis on the management of chronic conditions, such as diabetes and cardiovascular conditions.  It is envisaged that the new contract, when finalised, will focus on prevention and will include a requirement for GPs to provide care as part of integrated multidisciplinary Primary Care Teams.  Officials in my Department are in consultation with the HSE with a view to drawing up a new contract.  The appropriate arrangements in relation to phlebotomy services and other such services will be considered as part of the new contract.</p>

            <p eId="para_18585">The draft protocol for CF patients bed numbers has been agreed.  In this regard, 20 single en suite rooms in the new wing will be dedicated for inpatient Cystic Fibrosis care and a further 10 single en suite rooms dedicated for day case Cystic Fibrosis care.  The number of Cystic Fibrosis in-patients at St Vincent's University Hospital is expected to vary between 20 and 34.  In this respect, 20 inpatient beds are a minimum and not a maximum, and the number of beds with appropriately trained staff can accommodate up to 34 in-patients.  When the beds are not required for Cystic Fibrosis they will be used for other in-patients with a clearly agreed protocol that there will always be beds available for patients with Cystic Fibrosis who require admission.  St. Vincent's University Hospital is currently  equipping the facility and that it will become operational on a phased basis between now and September, with the first transfer of inpatients expected to commence at the end of July or early August.</p>

The Food Pyramid is the education tool used by the Department of Health for educating consumers about healthy eating.

            <p eId="para_18598">I propose to take Questions Nos. 749, 762, 800 and 863 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_18599">Day services for adults with disabilities provide a network of support for over 25,000 people who have a wide spectrum of need, ranging from those with severe and profound disabilities who are likely to need long-term specialist service provision to people with lower support needs and greater potential for community participation and inclusion.  The HSE, through its Occupational Guidance Service, works with schools, service providers, service users and families to identify the needs of young people with disabilities who are due to complete their second level education.   The aim is to address the needs of individuals in the following ways:</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_18600">Health-funded rehabilitative training;</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_18601">Health-funded day services;</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_18602">FÁS-funded vocational training;</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_18603">Approval to extend education placement for a specified time.</p>
            <p eId="para_18604">The HSE has received requests for 669 places for school leavers and 394 places in respect of those who have completed their rehabilitative training in 2012; to date 514 school leavers and 321 RT progressions have been matched with a suitable service.  This year, disability services are required to cater for demographic pressures such as new services for school leavers from within their existing budgets.  In previous years demographic funding was provided to meet this need. 2012 budgets have been reduced by 3.7% and the moratorium on staff recruitment gives rise to additional challenges in service provision.</p>
            <p eId="para_18605">Each year a number of young people will only require a place on a part-time basis.  However, in terms of current capacity within the system, it has only been feasible to offer a part-time place to some young people who require a full-time service.  The HSE Managers and Disability Agencies are currently finalising the numbers in this context and the associated cost for those still requiring either a full-time or a part-time place.  Service providers and the HSE have come together under the auspices of National Consultative Forum to identify how the needs of individuals who require day and rehabilitative training places can be responded to within available resources.</p>
            <p eId="para_18606">The National Consultative Forum recognises that the key to ensuring that available resources for people with disabilities are used to best effect is through constructive collaboration between non-statutory providers and the HSE.  There are already many excellent examples of collaborative working between service providers and the HSE in innovatively responding to the needs of individuals.</p>
            <p eId="para_18607">The HSE and disability service providers have commenced the process of notifying families if a place is available or if the individual is to be placed on a waiting list.  As part of the communication plan letters were issued to parents/guardians from the 10th July, either confirming the provision of a service or advising that work is ongoing in relation to identifying a service. HSE Managers and Disability Agencies are currently finalising this process.  Where a service has yet to be identified parents/guardians are being advised that:</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_18608">The young person would be placed on a waiting list;</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_18609">Parents/Guardians would be kept informed of progress; and</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_18610">The HSE and Disability Agency understood that this was a challenging time for families and would continue to explore all available options.</p>
            <p eId="para_18611">Every effort is being made to achieve an equitable and sustainable outcome to address the current difficulties in providing an appropriate service to each individual.   However, the Health Service as a whole has to operate within the parameters of funding available to it and given the current economic environment this has become a major challenge for all stakeholders, including the HSE, voluntary service providers, services users and their families.</p>

            <p eId="para_18618">I propose to take Questions Nos. 752, 753, 773 and 840 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_18619">The Health and Social Care Professionals Council, established in 2007 and the 12 registration boards being established under the Health and Social Care Professionals Act 2005 (the Act), will be responsible for protecting the public by regulating health and social care professionals in Ireland.  The object of the Council is to protect the public by promoting high standards of professional conduct and professional education, training and competence among the registrants of the following 12 health and social care professions designated under the Act: clinical biochemists, dietitians, medical scientists, occupational therapists, orthoptists, physiotherapists, podiatrists, psychologists, radiographers, social care workers, social workers and speech and language therapists.  In time, only registrants will be entitled to use these titles.  The regulation of the 12 professions designated under the Act is being implemented on a phased basis and currently 2 registration boards have been established.  These are the Social Workers Registration Board and the Radiographers Registration Board.  It is intended that the remaining 10 registration boards and their registers will be established by end 2014.</p>
            <p eId="para_18620">While the proposed system of statutory registration applies, in the first instance, to 12 health and social care professions, the legislation empowers the Minister for Health to include, if he considers it appropriate and in the public interest to do so, additional health and social care professions in the regulatory system over time, as appropriate.  Section 4 of the Act  provides a definition of a health and social care profession and also sets out the factors governing the subsequent addition of any further professions into the regulatory system at a later date, including:</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_18621">(a) The extent to which the profession has a defined scope of practice and applies a distinct body of knowledge;</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_18622">(b) The extent to which the profession has established itself, including whether there is at least one professional body representing a significant proportion of the profession's practitioners;</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_18623">(c) The existence of defined routes of entry into the profession and of independently assessed entry qualifications;</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_18624">(d) The profession's commitment to continuous professional development;</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_18625">(e) The degree of risk to the health, safety or welfare of the public from incompetent, unethical or impaired practice of the profession;</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_18626">(f) Any other factors that the Minister for Health considers relevant.</p>
            <p eId="para_18627">My Department's priority is to develop statutory registration for the 12 professions designated under the Act.  The extension of statutory registration arrangements under the Act for other health and social care professionals will not be considered until after regulatory frameworks in respect of the 12 designated professions are fully in place.</p>
            <p eId="para_18628">Questions relating to the recognition of creative arts therapies in the public health services, the need for such services and the direct employment of creative arts therapists are matters for the Health Service Executive in the first instance.  Any proposals relating to grade and pay levels would, of course, require the approval of my Department and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.</p>

The SDU is working closely with its partner agencies, mainly the HSE and the NTPF.  As a priority, public hospitals were instructed to ensure that by the end of 2011, they had no patients waiting more than 12 months for treatment.  I can confirm that the vast majority of hospitals achieved this objective.  During 2012, the SDU will support hospitals in the delivery of a nine-month maximum wait time for inpatient or daycase surgery.

            <p eId="para_18683">I am determined to address the issues leading to unacceptable delays in patients receiving treatment in our hospitals. I have established the Special Delivery Unit (SDU), which is working to unblock access to acute services by improving the flow of patients through the system and by streamlining waiting lists, including the management of GP referrals by hospitals. The SDU is working closely with its partner agencies — mainly the HSE and the National Treatment Purchase Fund. (NTPF).</p>
            <p eId="para_18684">As an initial priority, public hospitals were instructed to ensure that, by the end of 2011, they had no patients waiting more than 12 months for treatment.  I can confirm that 95% of hospitals achieved this objective.  During 2012, the SDU will support hospitals in achieving a 9 month maximum waiting time for inpatient and daycase surgery.</p>
            <p eId="para_18685">Very significant progress had been made on the SDU initiatives on unscheduled care in emergency departments (EDs).  Between January 1 2012 and July 13 2012, 9232 fewer patients waited on trolleys when compared with the same period in 2011.  This is a significant number of patients whose experience of our EDs was markedly improved.  Similarly, new targets for access to diagnostics and outpatient appointments, which the SDU is currently focusing on, will be key to the overall improvement of hospital services in Ireland.   The impact of staff reductions from this year and previous years presents a significant challenge for the health system in delivering services.  Employment numbers must be reduced to approximately 102,000 by the end of this year, in line with the Government's commitment to reduce public expenditure. Therefore, replacement will only occur in critical areas.</p>
            <p eId="para_18686">There has, however, been considerable redeployment in the health sector under the Public Service Agreement. This includes staff flexibility in continuing to deliver services during and after retirements. The Health Sector Action Plan for 2012, under the Public Service Agreement, includes provision for further use of redeployment in the health sector.</p>

            <p eId="para_18688">I have recently been made aware of the proposal referred to by the Deputy and I understand it has been examined by HSE South in the context of the overall reconfiguration of mental health services generally in the Waterford/Wexford area.   The main focus of Waterford/Wexford Mental Health Services is to provide community based services which are appropriate and accessible in line with <i>A Vision for Change,</i>  the national mental health strategy.  Funding for the Waterford/Wexford Mental Health Services is targeted towards the delivery of service objectives on foot of significant service reconfiguration which includes the closure of the old psychiatric hospitals and the provision of a wide range of community based mental health services.  Funding for complementary services is, if deemed appropriate,  provided through lottery grants and private fund raising as well as through Section 39 grants for registered charities.  The Waterford/Wexford Mental Health Service is not currently in a position to fund this initiative.</p>

            <p eId="para_18775">Yondelis® or trabectedin was licensed by the European Medicines Agency in September 2007.  It is an orphan drug and the licence was granted under the "exceptional circumstances" clause.  This happens when the applicant for a licence cannot provide comprehensive data on the efficacy and safety of the medicine for which authorisation is being sought, due to the rarity of the condition it is intended for, limited scientific knowledge in the area concerned, or ethical considerations involved in the collection of such data.</p>
            <p eId="para_18776">Yondelis® trabectedin is indicated for the treatment of patients with advanced soft tissue sarcoma.

The original licence for soft tissue sarcoma was granted in Ireland in 2007, and the licence for ovarian cancer was granted in 2009, with pricing approval being given by the HSE for this drug in January, 2008.</p>

            <p eId="para_18789">I welcome the Report of the Risk Review Group which I received from the Pharmaceutical Society of Ireland (PSI) last week.  The Risk Review Group was established by the PSI to independently review and report on the underdosing of some patients with seasonal influenza vaccine in 2011/12.  The findings and recommendations have implications not just for pharmacists but for the health sector generally, including other healthcare professionals who are also involved in vaccinations.  The PSI Council has set in place a number of measures to give effect to the recommendations contained in the Risk Review Group's report that are within the jurisdiction of the PSI in advance of the commencement of the 2012-13 Winter Influenza Season.</p>
            <p eId="para_18790">With regard to the training, the PSI Council has revised and updated the accreditation standards for Seasonal Influenza Vaccination Training Programmes for pharmacists to take account of recommendations in the Risk Review Group's Report and to reflect evolving thinking on formal learning and recent Council decisions, including the establishment in March 2012 of the Core Competency Framework for Pharmacists.  The Council of the PSI has also agreed that all pharmacists who were trained for the purposes of the 2011-12 Winter Influenza Season must undertake a course of refresher training if they wish to provide a vaccination service to the public for the Winter 2012-13 season.</p>
            <p eId="para_18791">Almost 1500 pharmacists successfully completed the training programme provided last year which was approved by the PSI Council on the basis of the accreditation of that training programme by the School of Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences in Trinity College Dublin.  This accreditation was valid until 31st   August 2012, therefore a new accreditation process must be put in place for this season.  The recommendations of the Risk Review Group's report have also been taken into account and it is important to build on the experiences of last year and ensure that pharmacists are both competent and confident to provide a potentially expanded service this year.  In any event, every year there are likely to be new aspects where pharmacists, as with any other healthcare professional, will need to refresh or increase their knowledge and skills.</p>
            <p eId="para_18792">As this is refresher training to build on last year's skills development, the refresher training will focus on enhancing practical techniques, including administration of vaccine and adrenaline to all patient cohorts, and ensuring pharmacists are confident and prepared for fuller participation in this year's campaign, as pharmacists will be starting to offer the service much earlier than last year and, due to greater public awareness, to a potentially greatly expanded patient cohort. In addition, there will a valuable element of peer-supported learning where pharmacists can share and learn from each other's experiences in establishing and implementing a vaccination service in a pharmacy.  It is intended that much background or required preparatory work could be done, potentially in an online environment, so that the ‘live' session can focus on the practical skills, peer-learning and reflection on integrating the vaccine service into the pharmacy's practice.</p>
            <p eId="para_18793">Any pharmacist who did not undertake training last year will have to complete a full training programme approved by the PSI Council. Training provider(s) will, in the coming weeks, be working with an accrediting body approved by the PSI to develop courses of training (both refresher and full programmes) which meet the required standards.  Council has also put in place a process to identify an accrediting body for the purposes of undertaking a review of seasonal influenza vaccination training programme(s) for pharmacists with a view to accrediting such programme(s) for the 2012-13 Winter Influenza Season.  This process is close to completion and it is expected that the decision to designate an accrediting body will be made by the PSI over the coming days.</p>
            <p eId="para_18794">The PSI has also revised its guidance for pharmacists on the provision of a vaccination service for the 2012-2013 season.  The guidance has been edited and revised in line with the recommendations of the Risk Review Group's report and updated to more fully the reflect the legislative position that permit pharmacists to vaccinate all persons, subject to fulfilling certain required conditions, and to include reference to the importance of having systems in place to deal with issues such as error reporting and infection control.  This revised guidance will also inform the content to be delivered as part of the new and the refresher courses of training.  In order to ensure a full vaccination service to the public in community pharmacies, the PSI Council has prioritised the development, accreditation and delivery of training to those registered pharmacists who were trained for the 2011-12 winter flu season.</p>
            <p eId="para_18795">The Risk Review Group's findings support initiatives to maximise seasonal influenza vaccination uptake.  It has concluded that measures to increase uptake should be strongly encouraged and facilitated, including the increased accessibility provided through pharmacist participation.  Vaccinations by pharmacists will again be happening this year and this report is a valuable learning tool in this process for all stakeholders.</p>

Additional funding is being provided this year out of the special €35m announced in the budget for mental health to advance implementation of <i>Reach Out</i>, our national strategy in this area.  Mental Health promotion is also part of the Social Personal and Health Education (SPHE) programme in our schools.<i/>

            <p eId="para_18876">The Health Service Executive, the Department of Education and Skills and the Department of Health have over recent months been working together to develop specific guidelines for schools in Ireland on mental health promotion and suicide prevention and this work is at an advanced stage.  It is vital that we ensure that any resource or programme which is aimed at children and young people is in line with these guidelines.  In this context, have sent a copy of the programme on bullying and suicide referred to by the Deputy to the Director of the National Office for Suicide Prevention for consideration.</p>

            <p eId="para_18878">In February of this year I established the Health Insurance Consultative Forum which comprises representatives from the country's main health insurance companies, the Health Insurance Authority and the Department of Health.</p>
            <p eId="para_18879">This Forum has been established with a focus on generating ideas which would help address health insurance costs. The insurers have agreed to work cooperatively in driving down costs related to health insurance.  Bilateral meetings have taken place with each insurer where they have brought forward their own ideas for cost savings in the market.  These ideas are the subject of ongoing deliberation and policy analysis within the Department.</p>
            <p eId="para_18880">The Forum also facilitates participating parties to consider certain issues related to the implementation of Universal Health Insurance (UHI). The future delivery of health services under UHI will require competing insurance companies driving efficient, cost effective delivery of high quality health care.  The Forum will allow the insurance companies consult with my Department on many significant changes on the road to the full implementation of UHI.</p>

In order to establish this staffing requirement, a detailed gap analysis of the present composition of 185 Community Mental Health Teams was undertaken.  The specific need in relation to each team in all of the four main regions was identified as quickly as possible after the Service Plan was decided.

            <p eId="para_18917">Of the 414 posts involved <i>, </i>the HSE has had to convert 31 of these in the Dublin Mid-Leinster region to nursing that will be assigned in the immediate term to acute in-patient services.  However, it is intended that this will be done in the context of introducing a nursing floor for the acute in-patient and community services in that region consistent with the provision of safe services in line with <i>A Vision for Change</i> as well as<i> </i>  the Mental Health Commission Quality Framework for Mental Health Services and the roll out of the clinical care programmes.   The recruitment process for the 414 posts which will take some time to complete has already commenced and the majority of the appointments are expected to be made during the summer months.</p>

I have referred the questions to them for direct reply regarding their functions.  However, I have agreed with the IAA that they will fund the flight costs of those self-financing students in Florida who have an existing contract with PTCW and who wish to leave the USA.  I will also give consideration to a bonding/insurance scheme in future to provide financial protection for students of flight training organisations; however, such a scheme would most likely be on a voluntary basis.</p>

        <b> Deputy Aengus Ó Snodaigh</b>
         asked the 
        <b>Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport</b>
         the steps he has taken to address the situation Irish students undergoing pilot training find themselves in with the collapse of Pilot Training College considering that the State, through the Irish Aviation Authority, licensed Pilot Training College as a fit and proper organisation to provide the education and ensure continuity of training rather than dashing hopes of any young people caught up in the fallout.

            <p eId="para_18970">The Pilot Training College Waterford (PTCW) is a privately owned and operated flight training college. The Irish Aviation Authority (IAA) has responsibility for approving and overseeing flight training organisations in Ireland so I have referred the questions to them for direct reply in relation to their functions in this regard. However, I would like to note that I have agreed with the IAA that the IAA will fund the flight costs of those self-financing students in Florida who have an existing contract with PTCW and who wish to leave the USA.  I will also give consideration to a bonding /insurance scheme in future to provide financial protection for students of flight training organisations; however, such a scheme would most likely be on a voluntary basis.</p>
            <p eId="para_18971">The IAA is also endeavouring to ensure that the students affected will be able to avail of alternative training arrangements. It has also indicated that it will strive to facilitate the crediting of all flight and ground training carried out to date in Florida towards the students' final qualifications.  I am not in a position to comment on Enterprise Ireland's involvement with the company as the role of the  agency is not within my remit.</p>

            <p eId="para_18975">As part of the Croke Park Agreement, the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport engaged a specialist International maritime transport management consultancy, Fisher Associates, to undertake value for money reviews of services provided by the Irish Coast Guard and the Marine Survey Office.  The reports call for a comprehensive integrated programme of work to enhance maritime safety and emergency response services.  The issues that have been identified are serious and have to be addressed, including significantly enhancing Coast Guard oil pollution response capacity and volunteer training and management.</p>
            <p eId="para_18976">I have informed the Government that my Department will consider the matters raised in the reports and prepare an action plan. I intend to present this action plan to Government in October. I have also made it clear that I do not propose to accept or reject any of the recommendations proposed by the Fishers Reports at this stage.  In preparing the plan my Department will assess each recommendation and will prioritise actions to address the deficiencies. That process will call for tough decisions to be made. However, it is important to recognise that resources available to the maritime services are very limited and they have to be deployed on a prioritised basis and as effectively and efficiently as possible to address the most urgent needs.</p>

            <p eId="para_18978">Since 2008, €168,000 has been spent on capital works and building maintenance projects at the Marine Rescue co-ordination station at Malin Head.  In addition, new communications systems are currently being installed in the Malin Head station, which has been closed since May, as part of a general upgrading of communications infrastructure in the Coast Guard. It is expected that the upgrade work will be complete next month and the Malin station will reopen at that time. This work will cost in the region of €100,000 and covers communications architecture and associated preparatory work to enable the equipment to be installed. It also includes refurbishment and a general clean up of the station.</p>
            <p eId="para_18979">The work on enhancing the communications infrastructure in the three Coast Guard rescue co-ordination stations is essential for the on-going operation and maintenance of the service. Very old equipment that has passed its operating life has to be replaced now irrespective of any decisions that might be taken in the future regarding the operation of any of the stations.</p>

            <p eId="para_18983">I have noted the concerns expressed regarding the cost incurred by accommodation providers in their choice of booking engines. Ultimately,however,a decision to use a booking engine is a commercial choice for the provider.  In this regard, accommodation providers will usually take into account the commission rates on rooms sold and the market exposure and flow of business that the booking engines may deliver.  It is true that more and more tourists are using the internet to book their holidays and that is why Fáilte Ireland has a suite of supports available to accommodation providers.  The purpose of these supports is to allow them to take maximum advantage of the market exposure afforded by the internet to drive business, including through their own websites and through social media.</p>

            <p eId="para_18987">DLRCC/Mount Merrion Youth FC Ltd. was provisionally allocated a grant of €200,000 towards pitch development under the 2006 Sports Capital Programme.  The letter of provisional offer stated that all relevant documentation should be submitted to the Department for approval at the earliest possible date and a substantial amount of work on the project should be completed to facilitate the draw down of the grant by 30 September 2007.

In the April 2008 letter the Council further advised that they would "consider the provision of an all weather pitch ..... at some stage in the future".  In April 2009 the Department wrote to DLRCC advising that as it was not in a position to comply with the Guidelines, Terms and Conditions of the Programme, the grant allocation was withdrawn.

            <p eId="para_19078">The Government's programme for the funding of capital projects to 2016 is set out in the "<i>Medium Term Exchequer Framework 2012-16</i>”.  Due to the overall reduction in funding for transport infrastructure the priority to 2016 is to protect investment made to date and to maintain safety standards.  The limited funding available over and above this priority will only be provided for projects which are affordable, meet overall transport objectives and deliver the best return in terms of economic recovery and job creation. Moreover the ability to operate profitably and without the need of any subsidy would also be a key consideration for any new rail projects or extensions.  Furthermore, the AECOM/Goodbody “<i>2030 Rail Network Strategy Review”</i> carried out for Iarnród Éireann examined the potential for new and re-opened lines and it did not recommend the development of a rail link between Sligo and Derry or between Donegal and Derry. Likewise its predecessor, the “<i>Strategic Rail Review”</i> in 2003 did not recommend such a rail link.</p>
            <p eId="para_19079">The development of a rail line between Sligo and Derry would require new rail lines to connect with the rail network in Northern Ireland. It should be noted that the Northern Ireland Executive has no proposals to provide such new rail lines.  In the circumstances there are no plans to develop a new rail link between Sligo and Derry and consequently the question of EU co-funding does not arise in this instance. My Department will keep the potential use of Projects Bonds under consideration in the event that an appropriate project together with the required  Exchequer contribution becomes available.</p>

            <p eId="para_19094">Motor cyclists represent a disproportionate number of road fatalities compared to the number of motor cycles registered.  While the trend is continuing downwards, in 2010 motor cyclists were the third highest category of road user fatalities at 17, behind car users with 130 road fatalities and pedestrians with 44 road fatalities.  To date in 2012, 10 motor cyclists and 2 pillion passengers have been killed on Irish roads.  According to recent OECD figures, a motor cyclist is two to three times more likely to be killed in Ireland than in other European countries.  In terms of fatality rates per 10,000 registered motorcycles, Ireland was found to have the second highest rate amongst the twenty countries compared.</p>
            <p eId="para_19095">The Review of the Irish Penalty Points System recommends that, in order to effect a targeted reduction in the number of motor cyclist road fatalities, further research into specific penalties for motor cyclists may be merited.  I have referred the Review to the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Transport and Communications for its comments.  Once I have received the Committee's input I will consider the adjustment of penalty points further.</p>
