        <speech by="#BrianHayes" eId="spk_3">
          <from>Mr. B. Hayes</from>
          <p eId="para_11">Is it any wonder that fewer than 20% of people who have been raped or sexually assaulted in this country report that crime to the Garda when the level of treatment and support given to them is so shocking?  I refer to the case highlighted yesterday by the Dublin Rape Crisis Centre where two women who were sexually assaulted in the Sligo area had to travel to Dublin some weeks ago in the clothes in which they were raped because there was no local sexual assault unit that could forensically deal with them so that the evidence taken could be subsequently used in a court case.</p>
          <p eId="para_12">This is a serious matter.  There are four sexual assault units in the country in Letterkenny, Cork, Waterford and Dublin.  A report earlier this year supported by the Government suggested that we should have six units, with the two additional units going to the Leader's area, the midlands, and the other to Galway.  This would provide a geographical spread so that people who are sexually abused can have quick access to a centre where evidence can be collated and they may receive treatment.  However, since the report was issued, nothing has happened.  We have had no work on either the midlands or the Galway sexual assault units.  We could upgrade the four existing units and establish the two new units at a cost of €2.8 million, but nothing has happened.</p>
          <p eId="para_13">I ask the Leader to organise a debate on this issue.  We need to send out a strong signal to people who are raped or sexually abused that treatment is available for them, the State will take their claims seriously, support will be provided and forensic evidence will be used in court cases where they have the courage to take on their attacker in open court.  This is an issue on which the Seanad should take a lead.  We must ensure that the Health Service Executive, HSE, through the Department of Health and Children, takes the issue seriously and immediately establishes the two additional units that would go a long way towards helping those — mostly women but some men also — who have been attacked and abused in this way.  I urge the Leader to organise a debate on the matter.</p>
          <p eId="para_14">I hope we have now learned the lessons from the early 1980s which my party and the principal party opposite did not learn when we went down the route of supporting a constitutional change on abortion.  Yesterday, that disastrous decision had an impact in the courts on the issue of frozen embryos.  I ask the Leader to organise a debate with the Minister of Health and Children so that we can determine the Government's current policy with regard to introducing regulations and legislation governing human fertility treatment.  We need to arrive at a consensus on legislation.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#JoeOToole" eId="spk_4">
          <from>Mr. O’Toole</from>
          <p eId="para_15">The High Court came to a very sensible conclusion on the issue to which Senator Brian Hayes referred.</p>
          <p eId="para_16">In the aftermath of this morning's revelations on nursing homes, we have become utterly confused about the issue.  Some of us debated the issue last night, yet we are no clearer this morning whether differences exist between public and private homes in terms of scrutiny.  Several nursing homes have been told they cannot accept further patients, even though it is apparently all right for them to cater for their current residents.  It is not just a matter of hiring more staff; they simply cannot accept any more residents.  The most appalling aspect of this illogical matter is that the owner of one of the nursing homes said he knew nothing about it because it had never been brought to his attention.  He only heard about the matter through the media, which suggests that major problems exist with communications.</p>
          <p eId="para_17">I have previously raised the question of how the inspectorate might do its work.  I do not believe a single type of inspectorate will be able to do all that we require of it.  Checklists can be followed with regard to members of staff, levels of amenity and support and physical facilities but a serious issue arises in terms of medicine and how residents are looked after when, for example, they suffer bed sores.  This morning, I listened to a doctor discuss that issue.  Where would a regulator fit into that structure?  I recognise the difficulties that exist in addressing the matter and, as Senator Brian Hayes correctly noted, we have all made mistakes in the past 30 years.  However, given that we are now trying to correct our mistakes, it would be useful to hold a discussion on what is being planned so that we can have an input.</p>
          <p eId="para_18">In terms of where we are going, several questions arise.  How are the public and private sectors connected in the nursing home issue?  How will an inspectorate work, what will it inspect and how will it relate to local medical people or a regulator?  What will be the regulator's role in looking after elderly people in nursing homes?  Nobody seems to have the answers to these questions and, while I accept that people are doing their best to address them, they should not imagine they have all the necessary wisdom in their own heads.  An open discussion would be worthwhile in terms of progressing solutions to the problem.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#BrendanRyan" eId="spk_5">
          <from>Mr. Ryan</from>
          <p eId="para_19">A connection may be made between the differing views on the sanctity of <i>in vitro</i> embryos at one end of life and the treatment of elderly people at the other end.  It sometimes appears, when we encounter complicated issues, that nobody is prepared to legislate.</p>
          <p eId="para_20">With regard to embryonic research, Ireland is probably the country in Europe where the most horrendous experiments could be conducted without any legal protection.  That the views of Members may differ with regard to matters for which it is appropriate to legislate does not detract from the fact that some legislation is better than no legislation and that not to legislate is an act of political abdication.  I do not care what court cases are ongoing because, if draft legislation is not prepared in the meantime, we will face a situation in which the most unscrupulous commercial operators will be able to acquire embryos in Ireland which are not protected by any law and experiment on them however they choose without any legal implications.</p>
          <p eId="para_21">Introducing legislation will be painful and will probably resurrect all the old issues.  Senator Ross and I are the last survivors of the political era of the 1980s when all those dreadful and demeaning issues last arose.  One of the few people who managed to preserve his dignity and the quality of debate through that most emotional of times was Senator Hanafin's father.  I do not want to make political points but the Government cannot leave the matter unregulated merely because it is awkward or difficult.</p>
          <p eId="para_22">I do not have much sympathy for the Health Service Executive on the issue of nursing homes.  It had ample notice on the extent of the problems in that regard but was reluctant to publicise its decisions.  We have learned the names of the nursing homes sanctioned by the HSE not because it wished them to be known but because somebody in RTE uncovered the information.  Of the nursing homes which were instructed to take no further patients, one was opened with much ceremony by the Minister for Health and Children less than a year ago.  The problem can be solved if the HSE comes clean but its website is patchy and does not set out all the reports.  We need genuine openness from the HSE because an odour of cover-up emanates from the matter.</p>
          <p eId="para_23">I would like to learn whether fee paying schools, both those in which teachers' salaries are paid by the State and unsubsidised schools, are subject to the school inspection regime and, if so, whether any have been inspected.  I will raise the issue of fee paying schools on another occasion because it is anomalous that the State pays the salaries of teachers in schools which socially select people for positions of privilege.</p>

          <from>Mr. Bannon</from>
          <p eId="para_25">Ireland has one of the highest levels of radon gas emissions in Europe.  Every year, up to 200 Irish people die from lung cancers caused by radon gas.  We must promote awareness among local authorities on this issue.  We should be concerned that the numbers of deaths from radon gas in Ireland are above the global average and that 91,000 Irish homes are at risk.  The problem has been highlighted in the media and by the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland on several occasions, yet the Government has done nothing to address it.  I urge the Leader to facilitate a debate on this issue.  Radon gas accounts for 13% of lung cancer deaths per year in Ireland, yet the Government has stood idly by despite the billions of euro in tax revenue it could use to deal with the issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_26">I support Senator Ryan and others in the call for a debate on the nursing homes scandal and the abuse of the elderly therein.  By delaying the debate, we are prolonging the agony of some elderly people in nursing homes.  This needs to be addressed urgently.  I was disappointed that the Government delayed the debate and did not accept Fine Gael's proposal to have it yesterday.  I hope it will see fit to hold it next week.</p>

          <p eId="para_29">A couple of weeks ago, I raised the question of the ongoing reorganisation of community and Leader organisations and the various companies involved in community work and enterprise development in the regions.  Some discussions on this matter have been initiated by the Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, Deputy Ó Cuív, and it would be opportune if he were invited to the House to outline briefly his proposals in this regard and their impact on the organisations and their beneficiaries.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ShaneRoss" eId="spk_11">
          <from>Mr. Ross</from>
          <p eId="para_30">On 20 December, there will be much fanfare and transport triumph when the port tunnel is opened in Dublin.  We should debate road infrastructure and traffic congestion in Dublin.  When the tunnel is opened, it will only transfer a problem from one area of Dublin to the M50.  An extra 9,500 vehicles will be forced to use the motorway every day.</p>
          <p eId="para_31">The position on infrastructure is chronic.  If, as the Taoiseach said in the Dáil yesterday, the Government is to do and can do absolutely nothing about it, we are in a critical situation.  Anybody who wants evidence of this should consider the serious warnings given by the US Chamber of Commerce in its recent submission on the national development plan.  The submission contained some alarming quotations that nobody seems to have noticed.  Many executives of US companies are now suggesting that their companies locate anywhere but in Ireland because access to the airports is appalling and infrastructure presents real difficulties.  They cannot move around at all and are therefore urging their companies not to locate in this country.</p>
          <p eId="para_32">If we debate this matter, the Taoiseach or relevant Minister may reply that we should consider the announcement by Google this week of 800 new jobs at Grand Canal Dock.  However, the significant point about Google's decision, which represents a serious warning, is that it decided to come to Dublin despite its being offered immensely attractive grants to go anywhere else.  I conjecture, on the basis of what the US Chamber of Commerce said, that Google would not go anywhere else because it cannot get anywhere else.  It is becoming the case that multinational investment in Ireland, regardless of one's views thereon, will cease very rapidly if we do not do something about transport infrastructure.  The problem is this serious for the economy.</p>

        <speech by="#LabhrasOMurchu" eId="spk_12">
          <from>Labhrás Ó Murchú</from>
          <p eId="para_33">From time to time, those of us who watch television see examples of the two extremes at which medical practitioners use their skills.  On the one hand, they offer extreme makeovers to people who are unhappy with wrinkles or the shape of their nose or ears while, on the other, they are prepared to do something for youths from undeveloped countries whose faces have been taken over by malignant tumours.  I watched a programme on this last night and was shocked by the condition of such young people and overwhelmed by the charity displayed by the surgeons.</p>
          <p eId="para_34">I say this in the context of the court judgment on the frozen embryos, which issue has been raised this morning.  There is a vacuum and it is wrong to believe it will not be filled by practitioners who may not have the same medical ethics as the charitable surgeons in the undeveloped countries.  Senator Ryan is quite right in saying the door is now open to horrific experimentation.</p>
          <p eId="para_35">This is a fundamental issue for most people in Ireland.  A debate in the House is not the correct approach but some steps should be taken in a very ordered manner, within our system, to ensure that we achieve some sanity and clarification in this area.</p>
          <p eId="para_36">In most debates on the pro-life issue, each individual, regardless of the side he or she takes, believes deep down that we must protect the sacredness of human life.  This is the most fundamental aspect of the issue.  I ask that we do not let the months go by without addressing it because the aforementioned vacuum is serious.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#FeargalBrowne" eId="spk_13">
          <from>Mr. Browne</from>
          <p eId="para_37">I repeat the call for a debate early next week on the nursing home reports.  The issue is very confusing.  We read on RTE's website today that only ten of the Twenty-six Counties are covered by the inspection reports.  It is stated that a home that opened only a year ago has already failed to meet the required standards.  That RTE only gained access to this information by default does not inspire confidence in those entering the system.</p>
          <p eId="para_38">Some of the stories about Leas Cross and other nursing homes were truly shocking and none of us would have believed them only for the shocking footage shown on the "Prime Time" programme.  It is vital that we have a debate on the care of the elderly in nursing homes early next week.</p>
          <p eId="para_39">I call for an urgent debate on tolling.  I am very confused as to what is happening at the toll station on the M50.  I saw the headline stating there are to be no tolls, but it now appears the barriers will be removed although tolling will continue.  We must ask serious questions in this regard.  If National Toll Roads is paid off a sum in the region of €600 million, will it represent good value for money for the taxpayer?  If, for the same cost, a second bridge were built to compete directly with the existing toll bridge, thus offering motorists a choice, would it represent better value for money?  The buy-out will have a considerable impact on infrastructural projects nationwide because the €600 million to be paid to National Toll Roads will not be available for them.</p>
          <p eId="para_40">A much fairer system would be to apply a charge to fuel such that the more one uses, the more one pays.  This could lead to the abolition of motor taxation and address the crazy circumstances whereby toll stations have been placed on all the motorways.  The Leader will be more familiar with this than anyone else because the Kinnegad motorway presents problems.  Problems also arise in Fermoy and motorists are not using the new motorways because of tolling.  We need a serious debate on tolling.</p>

          <from>Mr. Hanafin</from>
          <p eId="para_41">I, too, call for a debate on legislation pertaining to the protection of life.  I was glad to hear this morning that a direct link was made between care for the elderly and care for the embryo.  The approach required is holistic and it is a question of value.  Regardless of whether the Houses decide to protect life in legislation, it is still precious.  This is the important point.  Can we, amidst the confusion, satisfactorily protect life, which is precious?  I hope we can do so in the weeks and months ahead.</p>

          <from>Dr. Henry</from>
          <p eId="para_42">I support Senator Brian Hayes's call for a debate on the lack of provision of sexual assault units throughout the country.  Having been involved in the establishment of the first such unit in the Rotunda Hospital more than 20 years ago, I know how important it is to make facilities available as near at hand as possible.  If we really want to do something about the conviction rates on foot of rape and sexual assault, we have to be able to collect forensic evidence.  This cannot be done properly if we are dragging people around the country.  The most important issue in preventing any crime is fear of detection on the part of the would-be perpetrator.</p>
          <p eId="para_43">Several court cases have been alluded to this morning.  I would like to speak about a court decision that gave me great joy in the past few days.  I refer to the High Court's ruling that little Irish children whose parents came from abroad are entitled to the care, comfort and companionship of their parents.  A stay has been put on the deportation of such people.  I am sure many other Senators will welcome the ruling in question.</p>

          <p eId="para_45">The rural transport initiative has been pursued on a pilot basis for a number of years.  Its pilot status will come to an end next year.  I am sure extra funding will be made available when it is initiated on a mainstream basis next year.  I would like the House to debate the extension of the rural transport initiative in the evenings and at night.  I am familiar with the work that is being done in this regard in two of the 34 groups nationally, in north Connemara and south-east Galway.  People on the radio and elsewhere in the media are talking about the fact that it is difficult for people to get to restaurants and pubs in the evening.  Rural Ireland is particularly affected by this problem.  It would not take much more funding to extend the scheme to later in the day.  I was glad to hear yesterday that Bus Éireann is involved in talks with an integrated rural group in County Galway.  It is proposed to get Bus Éireann involved in the rural transport initiative in that area.  There is a role for business people, including publicans, in this regard.  Perhaps the public and private sectors can co-operate to offer transport services to people who feel socially excluded.  The rural transport initiative is all about preventing social exclusion.  It aims to ensure people can avail of transport facilities in areas where taxis and buses, for example, are not available.  I hope we can debate this matter as soon as possible.</p>

          <p eId="para_46">I join my colleague, Senator Bannon, in calling for a debate on radon gas.  According to the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland, 13% of lung cancer deaths in this country can be attributed to radon — more than 200 people die as a result of it every year.  The World Health Organisation has stated that the rate in Ireland is much greater than the global rate.  This serious matter should be discussed in the House.</p>
          <p eId="para_47">The Government's policy on nursing homes and the proposed inspectorate is a shambles.  The attitude of the Government and the Health Service Executive to what has happened is similar to what one would expect from Pontius Pilate.

          <p eId="para_48">I join Senators in calling for a debate in the House on the national transport network.  There seems to be some confusion about the tolling of the M50.  It would be important to have such a debate here.  Those who have suggested that the toll on the M50 should be ended are worried about the impact that would have on the roll-out of the roads programme.  The toll in question should be maintained to pay for the upgrade work, thereby allowing the Government to continue to invest in the various transport networks throughout the country.  If there is gridlock on the M50, that does not mean people in the rest of Ireland should suffer.  There is gridlock in many provincial towns throughout the country, such as Ennis.  The problems there are about to be resolved, thankfully, as the Ennis bypass is about to be opened.  Further work is required on the western seaboard to develop a proper road network along the Atlantic corridor.  When such a network has been delivered and developed, it will be possible for international companies like Google to invest in the west of Ireland.  We should have a debate on this matter because it is timely and important for problems in other parts of the country to be highlighted.  While the problems on the M50 are often in the headlines, the various problems of gridlock in rural Ireland do not tend to make the newspapers, unfortunately.  Members of this House have an opportunity to make such points, thankfully.</p>

A report last year recommended that two further units should be developed, in the midlands and in Galway.  We need to put in place a network of services to assist people who have been sexually abused or raped.  Such people should be able to make their way to these facilities to make their cases and to get ready for the courts.  I understand that it is a matter for the Health Service Executive.  I agree with Senator Hayes.  I am familiar with the figure of €2.8 million that was mentioned by the Senator.  The current range of services could be upgraded and the two new facilities which are needed could be developed if €3 million were made available.  I will raise this important matter in another context.  I appreciate Senator Hayes's decision to raise it in the House.  Issues of this nature tend to disappear from the public headlines from time to time, until horrific cases arise.  It is important we ascertain the current position in this regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_54">Senator Brian Hayes also spoke about the manner in which various political parties took different paths about a certain issue in the 1980s.  While I agree with him that we should provide for regulations in respect of assisted human reproduction, it would be difficult to formulate such regulations. <i>In vitro</i> fertilisation, which has given hope to many people, has produced some great results.  People sometimes tell me that <i>in vitro</i> fertilisation worked successfully for them and that their lives are much happier as a consequence.  There are dangers if it is not regulated, however.  I agree with Senator O’Toole’s comment that the High Court case came to “a very sensible conclusion” this week.  I do not think the Supreme Court will change the decision.  The High Court came to a satisfactory conclusion on the matter.  We will have to wait to see whether the decision will be appealed.  Senator Ryan said there is room for exploitation as a result of the vacuum that has been created in this regard.  If we do not regulate this area, unscrupulous people might move in to purchase a very valuable commodity.  We do not know what they would do with it.  It is important the Government should get working on this matter.  As in all matters relating to sex, conception and reproduction, the road will not be easily marked out and not everyone will agree with the conclusions reached.  We can expect a repeat of the level of declamation, etc., which we encountered on the last occasion.</p>
          <p eId="para_55">Senator O'Toole asked for a full debate on nursing homes next week.  While we would like to provide for such a debate, we cannot get a grip on the issue at present because the Minister of State, Deputy Seán Power, who is responsible for the care of the elderly, is on business in Iceland.  We have made it clear that such a debate is needed.</p>
          <p eId="para_56">Senator Ryan spoke about the two ends of life.  It is dramatic that we are talking about the care of the elderly and, in the case of embryonic research, the care of the very young.  He said that there is no legal regime and that it must be regulated.  The nursing home which opened only last year now seems to be in trouble.  Senator O'Toole made the point that they can supposedly care for those they have but they cannot open their doors to any more people, which is something of a contradiction.  If they can adequately care for those they have, then I do not know.  There are many questions to which we want answers.</p>
          <p eId="para_57">Senator Ulick Burke brought up the matter of fee paying schools yesterday.  Senator Ryan asked whether the fee paying schools which do not receive payments to teachers are open to the education audit.  I do not know but I will inquire about it and get back to him.</p>
          <p eId="para_58">Senator Mansergh stated that we should have a debate on the Estimates next week and I agree with that.  Senator Bannon spoke about radon gas.  Around ten years ago, the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland gave a home assessment kit to everybody who wanted one.  Many people availed of that offer.  All new homes must be fitted with preventative measures and schools have also been methodically checked.  However, that leaves those houses that are not new and the Senator wants a debate on the matter.  He also wants a debate on nursing homes.  We all want that but it is fanciful to think that just because we are going to have a debate on this issue, the lot of many people will somehow improve.  We will have a debate on the issue and it is a matter of getting the relevant Minister to come to the House.</p>
          <p eId="para_59">Senator Daly called on the Minister, Deputy Ó Cuív, to outline his proposals for rationalisation and reorganisation of local community supports, all of which are doing much good but some of which seem to overlap.  The Minister is determined to carry out a re-organisation of those.</p>
          <p eId="para_60">Senator Ross spoke about the American Chamber of Commerce which has suggested that US companies locate anywhere but Ireland because it is so difficult to get around.  That is serious because its statements will go back to the US and influential business people will read them.  However, they will also see that we have a good tax regime in this country and that their companies are well looked after.  I agree with the Senator that the infrastructure issue is a serious matter for this country.</p>
          <p eId="para_61">Senator Ó Murchú spoke about cosmetic surgery and about surgery for young people from underdeveloped countries whose faces were scarred by malignant tumours.  Both he and Senator Ryan pointed out that the door is now open for experimentation.  He said that in this House pro-life debates were well conducted.  It is all about tolerance as people have different points of view and it is right that we should listen to them.  Senator Hanafin called for legislation on the elderly and for legislation on embryonic research.</p>
          <p eId="para_62">Senator Henry spoke about a lack of debate on sexual assault units and would like to see more of them put in place.  She welcomed the judgment in the courts about those young children who may now stay.  I hope that decision will be implemented.</p>
          <p eId="para_63">Senator Kitt also spoke about radon<b> </b>gas.  He essentially wanted to talk about rural transport.  The initiative about which he spoke could be the key to the problem whereby many people in rural Ireland cannot move out of their homes in the late evening.  Of all the things I did in political life, the rural transport initiative was one of the best.  It was really good because I thought of it myself.  The idea did not come to me from the Civil Service.</p>

          <p eId="para_70">Senator Moylan raised an important issue, namely, the register of electors.  We all got our draft register and I think that all the activity about it has led to these problems being exposed.  There are a large number of deletions and additions, but there are many questions to be answered about the register.  Tomorrow week, 25 November, is the final date.  The Minister has spoken about a rolling register, which I thought was a good idea.  It means one can keep on adding the names as people hand them in.  Between April and August we gathered 800 names which we duly sent in to the county council, yet none of them is on the register.  They have vanished without a trace.</p>

        <speech by="#MaryCoughlan" as="#Minister_for_Agriculture_and_Food" eId="spk_33">
          <from>Minister for Agriculture and Food (Mary Coughlan)</from>
          <p eId="para_73">Tá lúcháir orm a bheith anseo idTithe an Oireachtais le cur os comhair na Seanadóirí cad atá ceadaithe anois.  Tá súil agam go mbeidh díospóireacht bhreá againn.</p>
          <p eId="para_74">I thank the Cathaoirleach for the invitation to address this House on the agricultural chapter of the social partnership agreement, which I am happy to say the farming pillar recently endorsed.</p>
          <p eId="para_75">We often hear talk of the demise of farming or that agrifood is felt to be waning as an industry.  I fail to see how that sector, of which farming is such a vital component, delivering 9% of gross domestic product, GDP, and employing, directly and indirectly, almost 9% of the labour force, could be seen in such a light.  The lesson to be learnt from Irish economic expansion and growth in the last decade is that the health of the economy is not measured by the strength of one industry or segment.  It is that mix and balance, with no over-reliance on one area or product, that has allowed our country to continue to grow and develop and to succeed even in more difficult economic circumstances.  Farming and food have a vital role to play in that regard, not only economically but also in a social context.  Agriculture will always have a special place in the life of this country.</p>
          <p eId="para_76">An important factor in the growth of the economy and in our development as a society has been the existence of the partnership process.  Together, the various pillars of society have, since 1987, worked by consensus to form a series of focused and strategic agreements contributing to lower taxes, the slashing of the unemployment rate, a sharp reduction in inflation and interest rates, and the achievement of sectoral harmony.  The farming pillar has been there from the beginning and has contributed positively.  The partnership process and the economic stability it has fostered have in turn served farming well.</p>
          <p eId="para_77">I acknowledge the contribution of the farm organisations to farming and to the wider nation.  These organisations give the farming community a voice and a presence in national life, and have shown themselves to be both resilient and resourceful in protecting the interests of farmers, the agriculture sector and rural areas.  They have also been able, through the partnership process, to look beyond their own interests in taking a wider view of the economy and society.</p>
          <p eId="para_78">The partnership process is designed as a framework where the well-being of the country can be reviewed and where common goals can be agreed.  The stability of the overall economy is as important to farming as any other sector.  I know that farmers have the same interest in, for example, the health services, education and infrastructure as other economic groups.  The partnership process provides us with a mechanism that avoids a return to the days where each sectional group fought alone in an adversarial system under which pay increases were secured without regard for their inflationary consequences.  The past 19 years have shown that a consensual system, where regard is paid to the national good, competitiveness, social inclusion and the maximum level of employment, has resulted in gains to all sectors of society.</p>
          <p eId="para_79">The new social partnership agreement, Towards 2016, is the most ambitious and complex yet and has taken a considerable time to negotiate.  This is not surprising.  Each of the social partnership agreements has had a particular focus and has contained significant innovations.  In this respect, Towards 2016 develops a framework to address key social challenges that individuals face at each stage of life.  This means a greater focus on the needs of children, young adults, people of working age, older people and people with disabilities.  To allow for long-term policies to be put in place, Towards 2016 has a unique ten-year framework.</p>
          <p eId="para_80">The shared overall goal of Towards 2016 is to realise its objectives by enhancing the complementary relationship between social and economic prosperity and by developing a vibrant, knowledge-based economy where economic development is environmentally sustainable and internationally competitive.  The major economic, infrastructural, social and environmental issues require a longer-term focus and a coherent and joined-up policy approach.</p>
          <p eId="para_81">The approach to which I refer is very much in line with the commitments laid out in the agriculture chapter of Towards 2016, where the overriding objective is the sustainable development of a competitive farming and consumer focused agrifood business that contributes to a vibrant rural economy and society.  A large range of actions are set out, including enhancement of the sector's research and development capacity, broadening agricultural activity in the area of alternative enterprises, the production of public goods and the promotion of structural change.  All these are linked to the overarching need for the development of competitive capacity.</p>
          <p eId="para_82">One of the key elements of the agreement of the agricultural element of the partnership agreement has been the Government's willingness to provide a major increase in funding for agriculture from Exchequer resources.  This has not only made up for the inevitable decline in EU funding due to Ireland's enormous economic performance, but has also provided the finance for the very significant enhancement of some major schemes which support the development of the sector.</p>
          <p eId="para_83">National Exchequer funding for the farm schemes under the rural development programme will be €4.7 billion for the period 2007 to 2013.  To put the figure in perspective, this is an increase of 135% from the €2 billion in Exchequer funds provided for the same schemes in the current round, 2000 to 2006.  The total funding for the agricultural measures is €6.8 billion, including €2.1 billion from the EU and modulation.</p>
          <p eId="para_84">The new draft rural development programme reflects the commitments contained in the partnership agreement and will cover both agricultural and non-agricultural measures.  In line with the EU rural development framework, the measures in the programme will address competitiveness and sustainability.</p>
          <p eId="para_85">The main features and expected outcomes are that the numbers in the rural environment protection scheme are expected to increase from 54,500 to 64,000 and the average payment to each eligible participant will increase from €6,170 in 2006 to €7,220 in 2007, a rise of 17%.  The average compensatory allowance payment will increase from €2,297 — excluding modulation — to €2,481 and 102,000 applicants will benefit from this 8% increase.  The average forestry premium will rise from €332 per hectare to €382, an increase of 15%.  A total of €250 million is being allocated for a new measure to encourage quality breeding and high welfare standards in the suckler herd.  This will help to ensure high quality input for the beef industry and enhance marketability on the increasingly discerning European market.  There will be enhanced support for the structural reform measures, namely, early retirement and installation aid.  In the case of early retirement, the maximum pension will rise to €15,000 per annum while the installation aid will also be at this level, an increase of 55%.  These measures will assist improvement in the age structure and size of farms, which will assist considerably in restructuring the agricultural sector to allow our youngest, most ambitious and productive farmers to increase their levels of efficiency and output.  The changes to the early retirement scheme will benefit both current and future participants.  As regards the last point, more than 2,800 participants in the current scheme will receive an average increase of 12% or €1,485 per annum.  Under the new scheme, the expected average payment will be €13,500 as against €12,733 now.</p>
          <p eId="para_86">On-farm investment support will cover energy crops, general farm modernisation and specific areas such as dairy hygiene and horticulture.  Such support will assist investments aimed at market orientation and competitiveness.</p>
          <p eId="para_87">Public consultation and a strategic environmental assessment are in progress on the proposed programme.  The aim is to have it with the European Commission before the end of the year.</p>
          <p eId="para_88">The question that is often asked is how this funding will link with the goals and aims of agricultural policy.  I recall not so long ago, at the launch of the agri-vision action plan, that people asked from where the money to implement the plan would come.  The short and simple answer is that interlinking of the action plan with the commitments in the partnership agreement and the massive funding provided for the rural development plan means that the Government will deliver on the actions set out in the agri-vision plan.</p>
          <p eId="para_89">The commitments on the agrifood sector set out in the partnership agreement are part of the Government's positive vision for the future of the sector.  The vision underlines the fact that delivering safe, high quality, nutritious food, produced in a sustainable manner, to well-informed consumers in high-value markets is the optimum road for the future of the Irish food industry and, therefore, for our farmers.</p>
          <p eId="para_90">The agri-vision plan states that we must focus on three key points, namely, competitiveness, innovation and consumer-focused marketing.  I emphasise competitiveness because the agrifood sector exports the majority of that which it produces.  Competitiveness is not optional for such an export-oriented sector.  It is the primary objective on which this plan is based.</p>
          <p eId="para_91">Closely related to that is the importance of innovation<b>.  </b>The modern food industry is a highly sophisticated knowledge-based sector in which technological progress and product innovation is unremitting.  Crucially, meeting the consumer’s expectations on product, presentation and price is critical to continuing success.</p>
          <p eId="para_92">Our vision for success, as articulated in the agri-vision action plan, is, therefore, focused on the objective of ensuring that the Irish agrifood sector compares with the best in the EU and in the world in terms of knowledge base, competitiveness, innovation and marketing.  It is very important that this same vision should be clearly reflected in the partnership agreement, underlining the commitment of all sections of the industry to this forward looking agenda.</p>
          <p eId="para_93">A major purpose of this approach is to respond to the changed agenda for agriculture brought about by an altered EU policy environment.  The need for market responsiveness is now top of the agenda, with an increased emphasis on competitiveness and innovation.  However, the plan and the partnership agreement also set out the specific policies needed to move further away from the simple production-led system of the past to one which has an increasingly competitive, market-driven approach and which respects the need for sustainability.  I will now outline some examples of the type of policies and schemes that will help encourage the drive for greater levels of competitiveness.</p>
          <p eId="para_94">A new animal welfare, recording and breeding scheme for suckler herds is included in the recently published draft rural development programme, which will be submitted for EU approval later this year.  The objective of this scheme is to encourage and underpin the adoption of high standards of animal welfare and to improve the quality of breeding cattle in our beef sector.  A budget of €250 million has been allocated to the scheme with annual payments of €80 per cow, payable over five years, available to suckler cow farmers who undertake to comply with the animal welfare measures set out.</p>
          <p eId="para_95">A capital investment support scheme was also announced last week, directed towards improving efficiency and competitiveness in both the beef and sheepmeat primary processing sectors.  The support package, amounting to €50 million, should trigger overall investment of some €120 million.  Enterprise Ireland will manage the scheme and evaluate the suitability of investment projects submitted for grant assistance.  Specific details will be announced shortly.  This is additional to the €300 million dairy processing capital investment programme which is referred to in the partnership agreement, and to which I will return presently.</p>
          <p eId="para_96">Limitations in the ability of the milk quota restructuring scheme to meet the demands of active milk producers around the country led me to announce, in March of this year, my intention to change the means through which milk quota is transferred.  Following a six-month consultation process with the farm organisations, including discussions in partnership, I announced details of the new milk quota trading scheme which will operate for the 2007-08 milk quota year.</p>
          <p eId="para_97">The new trading scheme is composed of two elements — a priority pool and a market pool.  The priority pool, comprising 30% of the quota offered for sale, will be made available to priority categories — successors, lost leases, young farmers and category 1 producers with quota of up to 350,000 litres — at a maximum price of 12 cent per litre.  The market pool, through which the remaining 70% of quota will be traded, will run as an exchange.  Market cooling measures are an important feature of the new scheme.  Two schemes will be run in the first year, the first as early as possible in January and the second in March 2007.  A review of all aspects of the scheme, involving all stakeholders, will be carried out after each exchange.</p>
          <p eId="para_98">Surprisingly, some sellers appear to believe their freedom to trade quota is being restricted as a result of this new trading scheme.  The new system will afford buyers and sellers far greater freedom to determine the volume and price of quota they wish to buy and sell than was the case under the old milk quota restructuring scheme.  Rather than being restricted, sellers are being provided with the opportunity to obtain a better price for their quota than would have been the case had I continued to implement the milk quota restructuring scheme for a further year.  Part of the rationale of the scheme was to encourage those wishing to exit the sector for personal or family reasons to do so while securing a market return rather than the fixed price available in the old scheme.</p>
          <p eId="para_99">The objective of the new dairy processing investment fund is to support capital investment related to the processing of dairy products.  It is stimulating the necessary investment in the Irish dairy sector to ensure the long-term competitiveness and viability of the dairy industry in Ireland.  The fund, consisting of some €300 million in the next three years, will include €100 million of Government grant assistance and is dedicated exclusively to investment in dairy processing.  I have done so because I believe fundamentally that this sector needs a confidence boost at this time, which is a period of great adjustment and an appropriate time for the Government to extend its support in the most pragmatic and tangible way.  The closing date for applications to the fund is 23 November next.  I hope the dairy industry will take the opportunities presented by the fund in an innovative and modern way.  We must move together in building a new future for the dairy processing industry.</p>
          <p eId="para_100">Efficiency and innovation, driven by sound scientific knowledge, will be essential to enable the food industry to meet future consumer demands in an increasingly competitive global market.  With this in mind, the Department and related State agencies are investing considerable resources in agriculture and food research with a view to considerably enhancing our research and development capability.</p>
          <p eId="para_101">I have referred to just a few of the measures contained in the agriculture chapter of the partnership agreement, which is a very comprehensive document and includes actions on all the main farming sectors, as well as on the development of the food industry.  It also includes important measures on animal health, including a 50% reduction in disease levies, and includes commitments to continuing high levels of service to farmers by the Department.  The strong focus on the future in the document is further underlined in the sections on "renewable energy", "enhancing the environment" and "measures to encourage structural change".</p>
          <p eId="para_102">People have asked about the continuing relevance of social partnership and what it actually achieves.  We should reflect on the words of the Taoiseach when he stated:</p>
          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_103">Social partnership has helped to maintain a strategic focus on key national priorities, and has created and sustained the conditions for remarkable employment growth, fiscal stability, restructuring of the economy to respond to new challenges and opportunities, a dramatic improvement in living standards through both lower taxes and lower inflation, and a culture of dialogue, which has served the social partners, but more importantly, the people of this country very well.</p>
          <p eId="para_104">This is what partnership is about.</p>
          <p eId="para_105">The agricultural undertakings set out in partnership are clear evidence of the Government's commitment to farmers and rural life in Ireland.  The unprecedented increase in Exchequer funding has the dual aim of improving the levels of competitiveness in the agriculture, food and forestry sectors and helping to ensure increasing levels of respect and enhancement for the environment.  It is fully in line with the EU rural development framework and is consistent with the Government's vision for the future of farming and the agri-food sector in Ireland, as set out in the Agri Vision 2015 action plan.  The huge Exchequer commitment contained in the partnership agreement is concrete recognition of the need to fully resource and implement the action points set out in that plan.  That should be acknowledged by all.</p>

          <from>Mr. Coonan</from>
          <p eId="para_106">I welcome the Minister to the House and welcome the opportunity to debate the farm partnership package.  While I welcome elements of the package, my complaint is that it does not go far enough.  The package reminds me of the "Off the Rails" programme.  If the programme makers picked out a fellow like me on Grafton Street, dolled me up, gave me a makeover and then put me out in weather conditions such as we experienced yesterday, after half an hour one would begin to see the real package emerge.</p>

        <speech by="#NoelCoonan" eId="spk_36">
          <from>Mr. Coonan</from>
          <p eId="para_108">The farm package is well produced, polished and presented and will run over a lifetime of seven years.  However, when one divides the package among the many thousands of farmers who are hoping to survive as a result of it, the Minister will be seen to be talking in small monetary terms.</p>
          <p eId="para_109">I agree with the Minister that farming and food have a vital role to play, not only economically but also in a social context.  Farming is the lifeblood of rural Ireland.  We are all obliged to do our best to keep rural Ireland alive and to ensure that the agricultural industry prospers and flourishes.  Numerous reforms are continually challenging the agricultural sector — I refer to a Teagasc report which states that the reform of the WTO means Irish agricultural income will fall by in excess of €200 million per annum.  When that figure is multiplied by seven years, the Minister's figures of billions of euro become much smaller.  We must remember that the modulation fund is provided by farmers themselves.  They earned it and it is part of the agreement to which they signed up.</p>
          <p eId="para_110">Elements of the package are undoubtedly welcome.  I appeal to the Minister to improve the package and I intend to suggest ways by which she can achieve this.  Why is the package not index linked?  The Minister has not dealt with the issue of inflation in any way.  When inflation is taken into account, the grant increases are minimal in key farm schemes such as REPS, the installation aid for the elderly scheme and the farm retirement scheme.  The crisis in farming is worse than ever.  In 2005, according to Teagasc, average farm income was €15,557, taking into account the impact of the initial single farm payment, which had an effect on incomes.  According to Teagasc, in 1995 the average industrial wage was €30,000 while the average farming wage was half that amount.  Government stealth taxes that year amounted to €4,000 while input costs for farmers amounted to approximately €15,000, meaning farmers lost almost €4,000.</p>
          <p eId="para_111">Worse still, the figures for 2004 are shocking.  The average income for farmers that year was €6,500.  The harsh reality is that farmers' income will be wiped out by record increases in inflation between 2006 and 2013 because the Minister has failed to index agricultural schemes.  The Ulster Bank predicts inflation of approximately 4% this year compared with 2.5% last year, which is the highest rate since 2002.  The partnership deal contains no mechanism to counter the effect of prolonged and increased inflation.  On the basis of my dealings with farmers, banks and co-operatives, debt has built up secretly within the farming community.  Further increases in interest rates and production costs will have a serious impact on farmers.  Charges for services essential to the farming community have increased significantly.  I refer to the increases in the cost of electricity, water, interest rates and health insurance.</p>
          <p eId="para_112">I am disappointed the Minister failed to address the issue of farm consolidation in this package, given there is an urgent need to attract young people into farming.  Recent figures issued by the Central Statistics Office confirm that, on average, our farmers are the oldest in Europe, with only 13% under the age of 35.  While the increase in installation aid is welcome, it is not enough because it falls well short of the money being spent by the State on creating jobs sponsored by IDA Ireland.</p>
          <p eId="para_113">A level playing pitch should be provided.  Young persons must be encouraged to stay in farming to prevent rural depopulation, maintain jobs and increase standards.  The Government and the Minister have failed miserably to address land purchases by farmers, especially where they must consolidate their holdings as a result of CPOs.  They must pay 20% capital gains tax on top of 9% stamp duty and that is not fair.  Farmers lose almost one-third of the cost of the land in tax.  I have no problem with CGT but it is a problem for farmers who are forced to sell their land.  It is particularly crippling for young farmers who wish to consolidate their holdings and the Minister has continued to ignore this issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_114">The drift from the land is proceeding at an alarming rate.  In 1994, 141,000 people were employed in the agriculture industry, which represented 12% of the workforce, but by 2004 this number had fallen to 113,000 or 6% of the workforce.  That does not include beet growers, whom the Minister did not mention.  Normally, at this time of the year, they look forward to the disposal of their crop and collecting their cash but this year they will have no cash, no crop and no compensation.</p>
          <p eId="para_115">The 3,800 growers have been treated disgracefully by the Government.  The assistant director of Teagasc states in today's edition of <i>The Irish Times</i> that, “Many serious farmers, along with career guidance teachers, are discouraging their sons and daughters from planning a full-time career in farming and encouraging them to pursue a non-agricultural qualification”.  This is very serious.</p>
          <p eId="para_116">The Minister takes pride in the early retirement scheme but it is also not index linked.  She stated farmers receive approximately €15,000 per annum.  The Minister for Finance stated he will make provision for an increase of up to €250 in the old age pension in the budget but even if the pension only exceeds €200 per week following the increase, the proposed increase by the Minister for Agriculture and Food under the farm retirement scheme will only match that and, in the years ahead, it will fall behind, again because it is not index linked.  This major problem with the farm retirement scheme has been articulated over a number of years but it has fallen on deaf ears.</p>
          <p eId="para_117">The Minister stated she will deliver on the REPS action plan but she did not deliver under REPS 3.  The Government failed to reach its target of 70,000 participants under REPS 3 with only 48,000 farmers taking the scheme up.  The scheme has presented many problems, for example, how it affects those entering milk partnerships.  The milk quota system broke down last March when the Minister dangled a carrot of big money in front of the farming community.  This had a negative effect, as farmers held out, but there is no guarantee her new system will work.</p>
          <p eId="para_118">Turning to the nitrates directive, many farmers face significant capital costs because of the cross compliance requirements under the directive.  The partnership package does not go far enough.  When local authorities undertook various sewerage schemes, they received at least 75% of the cost in grants and, in many cases, they received 100% funding.  Farmers should be given similar grants.  They are being forced to bury money in concrete but where will they generate repayment capacity?</p>
          <p eId="para_119">Farming income is declining at an alarming rate and hidden debt is a major problem.  In addition, wintering systems have not been approved under the Minister's programme.  For example, farmers in north Tipperary cannot secure planning permission for such systems because the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government has not laid down adequate guidelines to enable the planners to grant permission.  A recent conference outlined how effective and worthwhile these systems can be.</p>
          <p eId="para_120">The aim should be to ensure a farmer's income matches the average industrial wage but, unfortunately, the current package means farmers' incomes will continue to decline.  Under the farm charter, the Minister made a commitment that no notice inspections would not take place and farmers would receive a minimum of 14 days notice.</p>

It is grossly unfair to the farming community and such inspections would not take place in any other walk of life.  Recently a farmer attended a hospital in Dublin for an appointment, for which he had to wait more than 12 months, and while he was in the waiting room, he received a telephone call from an inspector who said he would be at his farm within half an hour.

          <p eId="para_134">That is per hectare, which works out at approximately €18 per acre.  While the beet industry was being decimated in recent years, we had an opportunity to promote the production of bio-fuels and to help tillage farmers, but the Government dithered and has displayed a lack of confidence in the system.</p>
          <p eId="para_135">Many elements in the package are welcome, but it needs fine tuning and a more positive approach and presentation, namely, it must be examined from the farmers' point of view.  When the farming partners sat down with the Minister to negotiate the package, the deal succeeded in driving a wedge between farming organisations.  Those who stayed in the talks are disappointed with what they got.  It seems that to get most of what one wanted, the best tactic would have been to get up and leave.  From a farming point of view, this is negative.</p>
          <p eId="para_136">Of everything outlined in the package, the most welcome element is the increase in the suckler herd allocation, but the matter of suckler herds creates another difficulty for farmers that the Minister undertook to address, that is, bureaucratic red tape.  The amount of documentation involved has driven farmers mad.  Senator Moylan is laughing, but he agrees with me in his heart.  Similar to a Deputy, a farmer needs not just a secretary, but also a researcher because of this form-filling bureaucracy.  For the sake of farmers and to keep them in rural Ireland, the Minister must deal with some of these issues and, by taking on board our suggestions, make this a great package.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#DrMartinMansergh" eId="spk_49">
          <from>Dr. Mansergh</from>
          <p eId="para_137">I welcome the Minister and her report.  One County Tipperary Senator succeeds another, but while I appreciate that Senator Coonan was playing devil's advocate, it should be pointed out that the farming organisations backed the package.  I accept they did not do so easily, but they are satisfied with what they have been given.</p>
          <p eId="para_138">I congratulate the Minister on her widely praised stewardship of the Department of Agriculture and Food.  Since 1997 and previous periods when the Government parties were in office, there has been a consistently supportive framework for farmers.  They are confident that the Government is basically on their side and will cope with problems that arise, some of which are unforeseen.</p>
          <p eId="para_139">The key backdrop to this situation is the European funding until 2013, negotiated in 2003.  The World Trade Organisation negotiations were of concern, particularly in light of the distrust of EU Commissioner Mandelson, given the well known hostility of Britain and its Labour Party to the agricultural sector.  That battle was fought and won by the Minister and her European allies and the issue will not return to the agenda in the near future.  The notion that European agriculture should be sacrificed for the sake of clerical jobs in London was offensive.</p>
          <p eId="para_140">The Minister outlined the benefits of social partnership.  While one organisation was involved in 1987, others have since come on board.  Previously, the stark divisions between trade unions and farming organisations were not to the benefit or credit of either grouping.  The Minister stated that farmers "have also been able, through the partnership process, to look beyond their own interests in taking a wider view of the economy and society".  The same could be said of trade unionists, employers and the voluntary sector.</p>
          <p eId="para_141">Apart from long-term plans and commitments, partnership is a way of working through difficult problems.  An obvious example this year was the nitrates directive, a matter that has reached a satisfactory conclusion.  This week, the required derogation was confirmed.  This is not to say that there will be no other problems to work through, particularly in respect of pig farmers.  In the Minister's speech, she mentioned the restructuring of milk quotas and how the matter will be worked through with farming organisations.</p>
          <p eId="para_142">The farming, agrifood and agricultural services sectors are important to our economy and large tracts of the country outside the main cities.  While its relevant importance may have declined due to the strong expansion of other sectors of the economy, this does not imply an absolute decline.  If one examines the statistics, there is no evidence of such.</p>
          <p eId="para_143">I am sometimes asked on doorsteps about whether farmers still have political clout, my answer to which is an emphatic "Yes".  Farmers have lobbying organisations that are second to none, a fact brought home to me when I was a member of the delegation to the European Council in Berlin in 1999.  Only one organisation was present in force, namely, the Irish Farmers' Association.  It is not entirely coincidental that the issue on which the Taoiseach battled through the night was funding for farming until 2006.  The trade unions, employers and the Construction Industry Federation were not present.  If we had slipped and lost €5 billion in Structural and Cohesion Funds, would anyone have noticed?  The farmers would have noticed if we had dropped that amount and there would have been a huge row.</p>
          <p eId="para_144">In connection with the sometimes discussed topic of Seanad reform, I hope that the agricultural panel will continue to exist with its nominating bodies after any reshaping.  It is part of the legitimate influence over the political system exercised by the farming sector.</p>
          <p eId="para_145">The single farm payment is fixed, as Senator Coonan pointed out.  Therefore, ways and means had to be found to further boost farm incomes and they are in this package.  Inflation, in the low single figures, is a fraction of what it used to be.  Once upon a time farmers complained about the enormous interest rates they had to pay, 10% to 14%.  Thanks to being in the euro zone, even interest rate rises will leave rates very low.</p>
          <p eId="para_146">The increase in funding which the Minister is providing is very impressive.  One of the differences between now and ten or 20 years ago is that in the 1970s and 1980s, we were almost entirely dependent on European funding for farming and the Exchequer could not afford to do very much.  Now, because of the good management of the economy and social partnership the Exchequer is able to provide substantial funding additional to what comes from Europe.  There is no question of our not availing of European schemes because we cannot afford to increase our input.</p>
          <p eId="para_147">There are some interesting and exciting schemes, such as REPS 4, which is now being discussed.  I am very attracted by the idea of a provision of €25,000 to conserve old farm buildings, of which there are some very attractive examples around the country.  They are not commercial or economically viable but add to the appearance of the countryside and are environmentally sustainable.</p>
          <p eId="para_148">Everything nowadays, not just farming and industry but household waste, must be done on an environmentally sustainable basis.  REPS is a very good way of boosting farm income, providing money for investment and engendering acceptable environmental standards.  I plead with the Minister to do what she can to facilitate earth and slurry lagoons because they are economically beneficial from the point of view of farming and, in most parts of the country if not all, are environmentally sustainable.  The suckler cow premium is very welcome and I look forward to the further enhancement of the biomass sector which is both energy efficient and environmentally friendly and also has relevance for agriculture.</p>
          <p eId="para_149">The Minister's predecessor, Deputy Walsh, has just become chairman of Horse Racing Ireland and that is a very important industry.  I hope the budget will clarify what will replace the stallion fee exemption.</p>

          <p eId="para_156">There is a problem with relative income and the fact that larger scale production is necessary to provide an income comparable to other sectors.  However, a distinction must be made between farm income and farm household income.  There are relatively few younger farmers whose spouses do not also work and provide income.  There is nothing wrong with small and medium-sized farmers supplementing their income by taking up part-time work.  Indeed, it may help to make their farms more viable.  I agree that rollover relief for capital gains tax should be considered in the budget, both for consolidation and road projects.  I would also like the social welfare system be more inclusive from the point of view of farmers.</p>
          <p eId="para_157">When farmers come to decide which way they will vote next year they will look at worrying policies such the Green Party's total opposition to live exports.  Deputy Boyle suggested an individual tax on carbon emissions for every household.  I am sure that will be greeted with delight by the electorate.  The Labour Party continues to attack the idea of third level grants for farmers by taking into account land, an idea which has been rejected firmly by the Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Hanafin.</p>

          <from>Mr. J. Phelan</from>
          <p eId="para_168">The last Government of which Fine Gael and the Labour Party were members was very supportive of agriculture, which is acknowledged by virtually everyone involved in the industry.  The former Deputy, Mr. Ivan Yates, was the best Minister for Agriculture there has been in a number of years.  Notwithstanding that, the current Minister is doing a reasonable job and I am pleased she is present today.  She is as good a Minister for Agriculture as Fianna Fáil has ever produced, which is about as high a compliment as I am able to pay her.</p>
          <p eId="para_169">I am pleased the Minister is present to discuss the national agreement, in particular the emphasis on the farming pillar.  We debated a Private Members' motion at the time the other pillars to the national agreement had been agreed.  I remember making the point that it was premature to debate the national agreement when the agriculture end had not been finalised.  Nevertheless, we are present today to discuss the agreement that has been reached.  There is much good news in the agreement but a number of outstanding areas where serious problems for farmers still reside.  The reason for the delay was the fact that a number of organisations left the talks because of the nitrates directive and an attempt, not so much by the Minister for Agriculture and Food herself but her colleague, the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Roche, to bully farmers into a particular course of action.  That situation is not as fraught as it was when the farming organisations walked out.</p>
          <p eId="para_170">I do not accept Senator Mansergh assertion that the problems with the nitrates directive have been resolved.  The deadline for slurry-spreading under the directive was 16 October and the farmers spent that week spreading slurry.  It was a dreadful week for that activity but in the following two weeks there were perfect weather conditions.  The problems forecast by everyone who said one could not farm by dates but only by following weather and ground conditions came to pass.  Far from being sorted, the problems still exist.</p>
          <p eId="para_171">Senator Coonan and others mentioned the failure of the agreement to take account of inflation.  They are correct; there is no index linking.  Senator Mansergh and the Minister referred to the farm retirement scheme.  I wrote to the Minister about this recently.  A number of people who joined that scheme several years now find themselves with severely reduced pensions in real terms due to the huge increase in the cost of living in the intervening years.  These people will not get any succour from this agreement, in terms of their farm retirement pension being index linked in future.  That is unacceptable, particularly at a time when the Government takes every opportunity to crow about how much it is putting into pensions.</p>
          <p eId="para_172">This is a significant body of people who entered in good faith into an agreement a number of years ago to retire.  Everybody involved in agriculture wanted such an agreement to be put in place.  A large number of older people were involved in farming and the objective was to get more young people involved.  However, these retired farmers have been put at a severe disadvantage because their pensions are not index linked.</p>
          <p eId="para_173">Other speakers have mentioned the issue of land purchase and farm consolidation.  It is interesting that the changes announced in the budget two years ago have been a spectacular failure.  Only two farmers in the first year and 12 last year took advantage of the changes announced by the Minister for Finance, Deputy Cowen.  Those changes should be loosened up in the forthcoming budget so more people who need to consolidate their holdings will be able to avail of that scheme.  A total of 14 farmers taking it up over the course of two years is most unsatisfactory.</p>
          <p eId="para_174">Reference has been made to the compulsory purchase of land and the issue of capital gains tax.  This affects my constituency as the Dublin to Waterford road goes through Carlow and Kilkenny and the Cork to Dublin route goes through part of the constituency.  Effectively, if a farmer is forced to sell ten acres of land, the Government is robbing two acres of it.  The farmer is an unwilling vendor but must pay 20% of whatever he receives in capital gains tax.  That is the real effect of the policy.  In addition there is 9% stamp duty on it.</p>
          <p eId="para_175">The Minister of State at the Department of Finance was the leader of one of the farming organisations at the time the agreement on roll-over relief was reached.  It is disgraceful that, as soon as he got his feet under the table in the Department of Finance, in the next budget the roll-over relief scheme was dropped.  I have stated in the debates on every budget since then and in every discussion the House has had on agriculture that a new and improved version of the roll-over relief scheme must be introduced.  These major roads are being built throughout the country.  Farmers who are determined to stay in the industry and want a future in farming will be interested in purchasing land that is put up for sale.  However, because a huge number of farmers are affected by the building of the new roads, the cost of land that is put up for sale in their area will go through the roof.  It is necessary to re-examine roll-over relief, particularly with regard to people who are unwilling vendors of land for public infrastructure.</p>
          <p eId="para_176">Dairy quota reform has also been raised in this debate.  The Government has made a mess of this issue.  In fact, it was the Minister's initial, ill-informed rumblings about quota when she was appointed that led to the cost of quota, particularly in my constituency, rising dramatically.  Many people spent a great deal of money on milk quota as a result.  The Minister and Senator Mansergh referred to working through the problems with the farming organisations.  Perhaps that will happen but a considerable number of people have been burnt due to the bungling on this issue.  In fairness, this bungling was not just by the Minister but also by her predecessor.  Nothing has yet been resolved on this issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_177">I agree with Senator Mansergh with regard to stallion fees.  There is a need for the introduction of a new scheme to ensure the importance and value of the horse breeding industry are protected into the future.  I would support such a measure.</p>
          <p eId="para_178">The sugar industry should be mentioned.  There is little solace in this agreement for farmers who were affected by the effective wipe-out of this farming sector, something that has never previously happened in this country.  The Government and, more significantly, Greencore had a part to play in the downfall of the industry.  The amount of the compensation package for producers is not sufficient.  Greencore is also unhappy about the share it received but it will reap a rich dividend in terms of the value of the sites that were effectively handed over to it by the State when the sugar industry was privatised.</p>
          <p eId="para_179">I am not particularly worried about Greencore.  However, the value of the compensation awarded to the producers is not enough.  It is also unacceptable that the producers' compensation will be taxed and I urge the Minister to do something about that.  The initial allocation of compensation to the growers should have been far more significant.</p>

          <from>Mr. Scanlon</from>
          <p eId="para_180">I welcome the ratification of the new social partnership agreement, Towards 2016, by the farming organisations represented in the social partnership process.  We should acknowledge the work done on this by the Minister and by farming organisations such as the IFA, the ICMSA, ICOS and Macra na Feirme.  The outcome of several months of negotiations is a package of measures which aims to ensure a strong, viable and competitive agriculture sector in Ireland in the future.  This is particularly important in the context of a ten year social partnership framework.</p>
          <p eId="para_181">The conclusion of Towards 2016 once again demonstrates the value of the partnership process in securing consensus.  While it was inevitable in the negotiations that not every demand would be met, the package of measures agreed on shows that participation in social partnership is the best way to secure an outcome that takes account of everybody's interests.  A few days ago the Taoiseach spoke about the benefits of social partnership.  He described how 400,000 working days were lost in 1990 due to strikes and disputes in this country in a workforce of 1 million.  Last year, in a workforce of over 2 million, 27,000 working days were lost as a result of disputes.  That demonstrates the benefit of social partnership and what it has done for this country.</p>
          <p eId="para_182">The agriculture chapter of Towards 2016 envisages building on the Government's AgriVision 2015 plan for the sector.  Recognising the significant challenges currently facing the sector, it aims to secure the sustainable development of a competitive farming and consumer focused agri-food sector which contributes to a vibrant rural economy and society.  In this regard, it contains significant commitments regarding the next phase of the agricultural elements of the rural development programme.</p>
          <p eId="para_183">I welcome the announcement of a package of measures worth €6.8 billion for farmers for the period 2007-13.  These measures relate to the agricultural elements of the rural development programme, which has been central to the partnership negotiations on agriculture over the past few months.  The Minister set out the final position of the Government on the funding of these measures at a meeting with the four social partner farming organisations.  Funding for the rural development proposals involves a major commitment on the part of the Government.  Of the €6.8 billion, Exchequer funding for the farming measures in the next seven years will be €4.7 billion.  That is a substantial contribution.  Compared with the €2 billion in the current round, it equates to a 135% increase.  The proposals will also attract €2.1 billion from European Union and modulation funding.</p>
          <p eId="para_184">The major elements of these proposals include a 17% increase in payments under the rural environmental protection scheme, which will be very beneficial.  The announcement on the nitrates directive in the past few days means many more farmers will be able to avail of REPS, which is to be welcomed.  An 8% increase in disadvantaged area scheme payments will benefit 100,000 farmers.  There will be a 15% increase in forestry premium rates.  A 55% increase in installation aid rates brings that figure to €15,000 a year but, as we said last night, young farmers who want to qualify for the farm pollution grant have to apply before the end of this year.  If they do it might exclude them from the extra installation aid, which comes on stream after 1 January 2007.  The Minister might examine that area.  There is also a new scheme for the suckler herd, which is welcome.</p>
          <p eId="para_185">The €6.8 billion package is clear evidence of this Government's commitment to farmers and to rural life in Ireland.  This unprecedented increase in Exchequer funding has a dual aim.  It will assist competitiveness in the agricultural food and forestry sector and it will help to ensure respect and enhancement of the environment.  It is fully in line with the EU rural development framework and is fully consistent with its vision for the future of farming and the agri-food sector here as set out in the Agri-Vision 2015 action plan.  The additional Exchequer funding is concrete recognition of the pledges set out in that plan.  It is important we all work together to ensure that plan gets the requisite EU approval and is implemented early in 2007.</p>
          <p eId="para_186">On the beef sector, people often ask about the relevance of farming to this economy but figures I read last night indicate that beef production in the overall Irish economy continues to be extremely valuable, with 2005 exports valued at almost €1.4 billion, or nearly one fifth of total agri-food exports.  Total slaughterings to the end of last month are up 100,000 a head, representing an 8% increase on the same period last year.  Cattle prices for the period up to the end of October 2006 were up 12% on average relative to the same period in 2005.  That is an increase in incomes, which is welcome but also needed.</p>
          <p eId="para_187">The growth in exports of beef to EU markets continues with shipments in 2006 expected to reach almost 490,000 tonnes, which builds on the previous record of 450,000 tonnes set last year.  That will leave more than 90% of total exports going into the high value EU markets compared to just 50% as recently as 2000.</p>
          <p eId="para_188">Live cattle exports for the first ten months were at 220,000, an increase of 43% on the same period last year.  I agree with Senator Mansergh's statement that the attitude of the Green Party to live exports is worrying because exporting those cattle is an important issue for farmers, particularly those in the north west who produce these weanlings.  We must not let anything happen to that trade and we must support it.  I recognise the work done by the Minister to ensure those exporters get all the help they require to export those cattle.  What will we do with 250,000 cattle every year over the next seven or eight years if we cannot export them?</p>
          <p eId="para_189">On the beef quality assurance scheme, the Government allocated €1.9 million to fund up to 14,000 farm audits this year to add to the 5,000 audits funded by the industry last year.  One of the most important aspects is the introduction of a mandatory country of origin labelling on beef in the restaurant and catering sector in July 2006.  This represents a major step forward in improving transparency for the consumer.</p>
          <p eId="para_190">The Food Safety Authority is in the process of enforcing this important legislation by regulations, which are being drafted, to extend these labelling rules to all meat and it is hoped these can be submitted for EU approval in the near future.  That is very important because there is no doubt beef from questionable sources was coming into the country on an increasingly larger scale.  I understand the Food Safety Authority is carrying out checks and it is important checks are done.  I was told by an official at a meeting of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Agriculture and Food that a test can now be done on cooked meat to indicate whether it is from Ireland.  More work should be done in that regard and restaurant owners and caterers should be told beef can be traced even if it is cooked.</p>
          <p eId="para_191">I wish the Minister well and thank her for the job she is doing.  There is no doubt farmers are satisfied with the job she is doing on their behalf.</p>

        <speech by="#PatMoylan" eId="spk_67">
          <from>Mr. Moylan</from>
          <p eId="para_192">I welcome the Minister, Deputy Coughlan, and her officials to the House.  I want to tell her how pleased the farming community is with her as Minister for Agriculture and Food.  That has been recognised by all sides of this House.  I am of the opinion that many of the farming organisations and farmers did not realise how much the Minister has delivered for them since she came to office.  That is genuinely felt by the farming community.</p>
          <p eId="para_193">The number of announcements that have been delivered through the post in the past three or four months on improvements the Minister has made for farmers and farming organisations speaks volumes about her work and that of her officials.  I am aware the Minster depends on her officials to help her and work with her, and that is welcome.</p>
          <p eId="para_194">On grant aid for farmers, in the past I worked with farmers on farm developments throughout the country.  They strove to put in place proper housing with very little grant aid.  Many of them developed their farms at that time without any grant aid.  In some parts of the country the Minister is now giving 70% grant aid and 60% in other parts.  From talking to farmers I am aware they are concerned about getting the work done and getting planning permission.  I know the Minister has worked extremely hard to help them in every way possible but some problems may require her direct intervention in the coming months.</p>
          <p eId="para_195">Animal housing is very important in terms of animal welfare.  In the past, many farmers thought they had done a good job in putting up their slatted housing and getting their cattle indoors but they are now in a position to provide rubber matting on those slats for even greater comfort.  As one travels the country one can see that farm housing is now on a par or better than what some of the residents of rural Ireland lived in during the 1960s.</p>
          <p eId="para_196">I have strong view on slurry storage tanks, which I believe should be covered.  Senator Mansergh commented earlier on lagoons but I do not agree with him.  In the 1960s and early 1970s, many farmers built similar types of lagoons but in the 1980s and 1990s they covered many of them and provided housing for their stock.  They were not a success because unless one takes on a huge cost, there is a risk to underground water sources.  I have strong views on that.</p>
          <p eId="para_197">There has been much talk about rural development and REPS.  Many improvements in farming practice have resulted from REPS.  The Minister spoke recently about spending €3 billion on these schemes and a 17% increase in payments, which must be a major encouragement for the 1.8 million farmers from disadvantaged areas involved.</p>

          <p eId="para_199">I listened carefully to what the Opposition had to say on the developments that have taken place and Senator Coonan spoke about the Minister not doing enough.  I remember well when the previous coalition was in Government, the Minister at the time, Mr. Yates, made promises about what he would deliver and described how hard he fought and how he was on his knees at Dublin Airport.  It was discovered afterwards he was somewhere else.</p>

        </speech>
        <speech by="#PatMoylan" eId="spk_72">
          <from>Mr. Moylan</from>
          <p eId="para_202">I wish to mention improvements.  I recognise the grant aid provided by the Minister for Agriculture and Food and the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government for the farmers in the Shannon basin area, the callows, who are protecting the corncrake.  The Ministers came to an agreement with the IFA on aid for that area which shows we are prepared to protect our environment and wildlife.</p>
          <p eId="para_203">We must welcome grant aid for the suckler herd, which encourages proper farming practice and conditions.  There may well be some areas on which people disagree, for example, dehorning or debudding of calves.  Some farmers say the three-week period is too short and it should be extended to five or six weeks.  However, the job must be done within a fixed timeframe.</p>
          <p eId="para_204">I also commend the grant aid for the replacement of breeding stock which will encourage farmers to develop proper breeding stock.  Many farmers have stock they would like to replace and the grant aid will be welcome.  Aid for training is also welcome as training in the farming area must be ongoing.</p>
          <p eId="para_205">With regard to dry stock, I hope the Minister will give attention to the sheep sector.  There may well be a need for assistance in this area.  Unless farmers were very early with their lambs over recent years, their gains were trimmed.</p>

          <from>Mr. Moylan</from>
          <p eId="para_207">I disagree.  Some help should be provided.</p>
          <p eId="para_208">The Minister mentioned the transport regulations which are welcome.  We must have regulations in this area.  It is right and proper that farmers should use proper trailers with slurry control tanks and properly weigh loading stock.  For too long farmers queued up for marts with inadequate trailers which destroyed streets in our towns and villages.  The new transport regulations should work well.</p>
          <p eId="para_209">The Minister deserves credit on the nitrates derogation.  Not too long ago, people said it would not nor could not happen, but she has delivered on it.  The agreement will help and allow more farmers to go into REPS.  With regard to slurry spreading, I have sympathy with farmers on the closing date.  We mentioned wet weather, but the weather could have stayed wet for longer and farmers could have had full tanks that they could not have spread.  This would have left them without the option of taking in extra stock or of keeping their stock indoors.  When farmers get used to the new dates, they will make a better effort and contractors will ensure they spread the slurry when the silage is cut.  Over the next year or so, farmers should come on side in this regard, although over the first year or two there may be some problems.  In the event of a farmer erring by a day or two, the heavy hand should not be used.</p>
          <p eId="para_210">I support the retirement scheme.  There was a problem with the first retirement scheme introduced because after a few years, it was of little use to farmers.  With regard to the farmers who took up that scheme and allowed their sons or daughters to take over the running of their farms, they are now at a stage where their holding is due to transfer to their sons or daughters.  It is very important that some tax incentive is put in place to assist in these transfers.  I compliment farmers who took the decision to allow their sons or daughters to take over their farms.  Great credit is due to them.  More farmers will now take this option because of the improved pensions.  Land values have gone through the roof and this may lead to some capital gains problems.  We should look at this issue carefully where a transfer is being made directly to a son, daughter or relative.</p>
          <p eId="para_211">On the issue of the beet growers, they now have the opportunity to go into tillage.  Those who sowed corn, barley or wheat this year did well as nothing has been left unused.  Prices are high and anybody who went into grain this year could have made good money.  I believe the beet farmers will move into this area.</p>
          <p eId="para_212">We welcome the improvements in grant aid for agriculture.  Farming must be competitive and we must encourage more young farmers into the industry.  The production of top quality produce is essential for development and a continued future for farming.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#BrendanDaly" eId="spk_75">
          <from>Mr. Daly</from>
          <p eId="para_213">I wish to record the appreciation of the farming community in my area for the work the Minister has done since she took up office.  I recall occasions we stayed up all night debating agriculture issues in the House because agriculture is such a controversial and involved area that occupies the minds of politicians and farmers.  It is strange to see so little attention being paid to the agriculture industry in the Oireachtas now.  This is an indication of the success of the Minister and her Department in dealing with farming issues.</p>
          <p eId="para_214">The proposals put forward by the Minister, which have been recently endorsed by farming organisations, are a good package for the agriculture industry and the farming community in particular.  At a meeting in my area of some of the leaders of farming organisations, farmers and some Members of the European Parliament recently, the focus was more on World Trade Organisation discussions and such issues than on local issues in this country.</p>
          <p eId="para_215">There are some issues to which I would like to draw the Minister's attention and I have written to her about some of them.  Some representations have been made to me about difficulties in getting planners to undertake REPS 3 forms.  Some people had not applied before the deadline of the end of October and there was a belief that the deadline would be extended to the end of November.  I am aware of the problems that exist in that regard but I ask that a degree of latitude would be allowed to applicants who encountered difficulties in finding planners who would undertake the necessary work.  I am unsure whether that matter can be addressed on a national basis.  The problem has been raised with me by two people but its extent may be greater.</p>
          <p eId="para_216">Small dairy farmers in west County Clare increasingly have to work outside the farm because they no longer have the capacity to earn sufficient income from milk.  Many derive the bulk of their income from employment in places such as the Moneypoint electricity generation station and combine that work with farming as a sideline activity.  Nevertheless, a number of farmers in the area remain heavily involved in milk production and are concerned about falling prices.  I have been told that substantial quantities of Northern Irish milk is being dumped here, thereby depressing the market and putting further pressure on small dairy farmers, many of whom are my constituents.  I am unsure of the extent of the dumping and, while I would presume it should not occur within the common market, the Minister might shed light on the matter.  Milk imported from Northern Ireland is cheaper by approximately 20 cent per litre.</p>
          <p eId="para_217">I will not rehearse the list of measures, the agreement is an excellent arrangement for the farming community and has been endorsed by its leadership.  However, certain minor issues continue to affect people, such as capital gains tax on lands sold for road widening or other purposes.  Recently, we received a delegation from farming organisations regarding changes pertaining to retirement.  On behalf of the farming community in my constituency, I commend the Minister and her staff on the magnificent work they are doing.  I wish her well in future negotiations and offer my support as she defends farmers' interests in the WTO.</p>

        <speech by="#MaryCoughlan" as="#Minister_for_Agriculture_and_Food" eId="spk_76">
          <from>Minister for Agriculture and Food (Mary Coughlan)</from>
          <p eId="para_218">I thank the Senators who have spoken on this debate and wish to reflect on some of the key issues raised.  A number of schemes are not permitted to be index linked under EU rules, including the single farm payment and the farm retirement scheme.  I gave my consideration to the issues raised in a report on early retirement produced by Deputy Wilkinson on behalf of the Joint Committee on Agriculture and Food.  The report recommended greater involvement at a technical level between the Departments of Social and Family Affairs and Agriculture and Food, so that we could avoid overpayments where people reached pension aged and qualified for State pensions.  It also recommended that we increase the amounts available under the early retirement schemes and increase the new early retirement scheme in order to balance it with the installation aid increase, a measure which younger farmers have vociferously supported.</p>
          <p eId="para_219">The issue of farm consolidation has been of major concern and I thank the Minister of Finance for his support in committing a significant level of Exchequer funding to this agreement.  He has worked with me to examine the issues which have arisen from farm consolidation, long-term leasing and taxation policies.  Measures have already been introduced in this regard in the previous budget and we will continue to work towards our targets through the forthcoming budget.  I am sure the Estimates announced by the Minister this afternoon will be music the ears of the Opposition.  I can predict, without a shadow of a doubt, further increases in my own Vote for the farming sector.  These increases are indicative of the esteem which this Government has for farming.</p>
          <p eId="para_220">Fine Gael Senators spoke about crises such as a drift from farming and a lack of interest in the sector.  The European Commissioner for Agriculture and Rural Development gave an answer to this in the Dáil when she said that if we continued to use this type of language, it would not be surprising that people will continue to lose interest in farming because we are being negative rather than supportive.</p>

          <from>Mr. Coonan</from>
          <p eId="para_221">The Minister should direct her remarks to the assistant director of Teagasc and read a report on the matter in <i>The Irish Times</i> today.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#MaryCoughlan" eId="spk_78" as="#Minister_for_Agriculture_and_Food">
          <from>Mary Coughlan</from>
          <p eId="para_222">I am glad to learn the Senator reads <i>The Irish Times</i>.  According to Teagasc, the average farm income in 2005 was €18,000 rather than €15,000.  The average age of Irish farmers is 11% below the EU average of 35 years.  Although there has been a move away from land in the European farming sector in general, we have done comparatively well in this country.</p>
          <p eId="para_223">I did not refer in particular to the sheep sector because it is difficult to focus in every sector.  Under the stewardship of the former Secretary General of my Department, I established a group to consider and make recommendations on the needs of the sector.  I have accepted the recommendations put forward and the implementation group is now making proposals on developing the sector.  I acknowledge that the sector is undergoing difficulties but farmers appreciate the importance of REPS and the fact that we renegotiated arrangements for designated areas.  The sector needs to look for new markets and qualities.  We must ascertain why we are superb in the summer months but cannot compete in shoulder areas, even though our competitors in Scotland and Wales can do so.  I intend to drive reforms in that respect.</p>
          <p eId="para_224">The issues of roll-over relief taxation, CPO, land consolidation and long-term leasing are being addressed on an ongoing basis.  However, as with many other tax incentives, some have abused the opportunities afforded to them.  The Minister for Finance has undertaken a review of tax incentives and reliefs, including those obtaining in the farming sector.  While he has expressed concerns on abuses, he has also acknowledged the difficulties that arise in terms of land prices, the need to facilitate young people and the transfer of activity from older members of society to the next generation.</p>
          <p eId="para_225">The ongoing WTO negotiations will become more difficult in the context of the outcome of the recent elections in the United States of America.  Before the election, I met the Democratic Party spokesman on agriculture and found his views to be more trenchant than those of the Republican Party, which leads me to believe that any legislation on farming will be watered down and that it will be difficult to reach an agreement under the WTO.  We are also concerned that a Mercosur agreement will be reached which would not be beneficial to Ireland and, therefore, we will be expressing our worries in the context of a move towards such an agreement.  As Senators will be aware, former Commissioner Fischler did not agree to the Mercosur deal which was on the table previously.  The current proposals are also totally unacceptable.</p>
          <p eId="para_226">Perhaps we should have all ensured that the nitrates directive and the associated plan were brought to fruition much earlier.  That said, there was much consultation and hard work, not only involving departmental officials and the Commission, but also me and the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Roche.  We have achieved as satisfactory an outcome as could have been obtained.</p>
          <p eId="para_227">I have reflected on the farm waste management scheme, which recognises the relevant costs.  We have introduced standard costings and the Minister for Finance has supported me in ensuring there is a roll-over clause in the scheme.  The scheme must close on the last day of this year, no matter what happens.  However, I have stipulated that a letter of intent for planning permission is sufficient to allow people continue in the scheme.  They can forward their plans and planning permission in March 2007.</p>
          <p eId="para_228">Our work on the farm waste management scheme has reflected the needs of the farmer on the basis of economic cost.  The derogation is very beneficial and included among REPS farmers will be those who have obtained one.  This will be very important to the farmers, including the dairy farmers in County Clare and elsewhere.  The current approach to farming encompasses environmental issues and recognises the cost of addressing them.  This is why the package is so important.  The 17% increase in the REPS allocation is a seismic support for farmers and will result in a great increase in the number involved in the farming enterprises.</p>
          <p eId="para_229">I am legally curtailed from speaking on the sugar beet issue because, as Senators will know, the issue is <i>sub judice</i>.  However, we must look towards bio-fuels.  Much work has been done on addressing our energy needs and a new Green Paper on energy has been produced by the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government.  The Cabinet is working to ensure that we put together a package in this regard.  I, as Minister for Agriculture and Food, must acknowledge the reduction in grain production in Ireland and that a balance must be struck between producing crops for energy and for food.  This will cause a great deal of anxiety for some and ensure higher prices for the farmer.  It may result in consequential increases in the cost of food which will, in itself, cause difficulties for some of our competitors.  Our feedstock requirement for livestock will increase, thus causing a rotation effect.  We must therefore be very careful about how we approach the production of food crops and energy crops.  I am working towards a new incentive and initiative in this regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_230">It is unlike me to be political but, lest I forget I am a politician, I must say, without a doubt, that Fianna Fáil and the Government, including me as Minister, have taken on board a vision for agriculture based on innovation, the consumer and quality.  We have increased our market share and have centres of excellence, including Teagasc and Bord Bia.  I have increased funding for research and development to €100 million.  This is the current position on food and food quality.</p>
          <p eId="para_231">The Minister of State, Deputy Brendan Smith, is considering innovative ways of working with the food sector, the State agencies and the chief executives of small and large companies and of linking this work to research and development to produce a roadmap for the agrifood and drinks sector for the coming 15 years.  He secured an increase of 15% in forestry grants and is considering new opportunities pertaining to biomass and wood products.  He is working with farmers to develop a sector that will be very important.  This process is not without its difficulties and concerns but is vital to rural economies.  It is linked to real rural policy, rural employment and the question of addressing global warming.</p>
          <p eId="para_232">As a team, we are working very closely with the farmers and have seen results.  We have implemented the agri-vision programme, which I launched some months ago.  We have invested in farming and are working to achieve quality and put in place support mechanisms.  When people have to make choices, they will note that the Government has delivered.  It will continue to develop the sector and produce a roadmap for successful farming in the agrifood sector.  Perhaps people should reflect on what Fine Gael did when in Government.  It stopped live export whereas I allowed it again, and it abolished the farm waste management scheme whereas I quadrupled the money being made available in this regard.  There was a crisis concerning the suckler cow herd but Fianna Fáil, while Deputy Walsh was Minister for Agriculture and Food, increased the herd to 1 million.  I will sustain the quality of the herd.</p>
          <p eId="para_233">I have outlined Fine Gael's record.  If it gets into power and works with the Labour Party, God help us.</p>

I agree in respect of organic food, labelling and consumer foods but not in respect of the proposals that would destroy rural life.

          <from>Minister of State at the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs (Mr. N. Ahern)</from>
          <p eId="para_237">I am pleased have an opportunity this afternoon to update the Members of the Seanad on the efforts we are making to combat the misuse of drugs in society.  Given that all jurisdictions have difficulties in coping with this problem, which is encountered throughout the world, it is hardly surprising that Ireland has problems in this regard.  We are dealing with the misuse of drugs in a concerted, planned and integrated manner on several fronts.  Considerable progress is being made under the national drugs strategy, for example.  I will outline the Government's plans to disrupt drug misuse in Ireland and to alleviate the problems caused by drugs.  We should state honestly that there are no quick and easy answers.  There is no magic wand.  No single action will solve this problem overnight.  Ireland's drug problem is part of a worldwide problem.  All we can do is try to manage it as best we can.</p>
          <p eId="para_238">The national drugs strategy, which covers the years between 2001 and 2008, demonstrates the Government's commitment to addressing the problem of drug use in a proactive and decisive way.  The strategy places a balanced and complimentary focus on reducing drug-related harm, continuing efforts to disrupt the operation of the drug market and increasing the focus on the rehabilitation of problem drug users, which are particularly important policy goals.  There have been encouraging signs of progress in recent years in areas like drug seizures and the expansion of treatment services.  Preventative services aimed at young people who are at risk have been rolled out through the work of the young people's facilities and services fund.  The research outcome study in Ireland, which evaluated the effectiveness of heroin treatment, recently issued some positive findings.  It is important to recognise that progress has been made in the past few years through a process of co-operation and partnership.  While that process can be difficult at times, we must focus on the fact that it is more beneficial to work together in a united way than to utilise a fragmented approach, especially when we are dealing with a problem as pervasive as drug misuse.  The co-operation, work and involvement of many agencies and communities throughout the country are important in dealing with this problem.</p>
          <p eId="para_239">Our policies need to be flexible because the nature of this country's drugs problem is constantly evolving — the increased use of cocaine is a case in point.  I am confident the problem of cocaine use is being addressed by the implementation of the actions in the national drugs strategy.  When I recognised the need for an overview of this emerging threat, I sought a joint briefing paper from the National Advisory Committee on Drugs and the national drugs strategy team.  I am awaiting responses from the relevant agencies and Departments, such as the Health Service Executive and the Garda Síochána, about how the recommendations of the joint briefing paper might be progressed.  I envisage that the matter will be followed up further in December, at the next meeting of the interdepartmental group on drugs.  I am determined we will continue to emphasise that cocaine is a dangerous drug which drastically affects physical and mental health and causes social and economic harm to individuals and society.  Like the Tánaiste and Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, I stress that the use of cocaine directly contributes to the illegal drugs industry and the crime and violence associated with it.</p>
          <p eId="para_240">Six local drugs task force area projects which are specifically aimed at cocaine have been allocated funding of €420,000 in 2006 under the emerging needs fund.  Five of the projects, which focus on the provision of direct community-based services for cocaine users, are located within existing services.  The sixth project is supporting the development of an information booklet.  The purpose of the emerging needs fund is to address the changing demands in local drugs task force areas, which is what the communities have requested.  I approved 67 projects under the fund, but I am disappointed that just six of them deal specifically with cocaine.  When I initiated the fund, I thought that communities and local drugs task forces would propose many projects relating to cocaine, but just six such projects have emerged.</p>
          <p eId="para_241">I have launched four pilot cocaine treatment projects, which will examine various ways of treating cocaine use, and a training initiative, which will focus on frontline workers.  I have provided funding of approximately €400,000 to support these initiatives.  While the projects are at varying stages of progress, preliminary evaluation reports will be available on most of them shortly.  It is hoped the results of the evaluations will lead to the formulation of effective actions aimed at tackling cocaine misuse.  Next month's meeting in Belfast of the British-Irish Council sectoral group on the misuse of drugs, which I will chair, will consider the challenges presented by problem cocaine use.</p>
          <p eId="para_242">There may be some validity in the accusation that a great deal of the treatment being provided under the national drug strategy relates to heroin.  If one considers the problems which originally led to the establishment of the local drugs task forces, one will find that many of them related to the misuse of heroin in disadvantaged areas.  Many of the services which are currently offered have evolved from that background.  The charge that is sometimes made — that our services and treatment facilities are very opiate orientated and we are not taking other drugs into account — probably has some validity.  If one is being counselled for a problem relating to a specific drug, one should be able to receive counselling in respect of other drugs if one needs it.  If workers are upskilled, they should be able to deal with problems relating to ecstasy and cocaine as well as to heroin.  I do not doubt that some of the people who are using cocaine at present are traditional heroin users.  Some of them are polydrug users — they will use different drugs from week to week.  They will use anything that is available to them, including alcohol.  The third category is made up of the so-called recreational users.  We must examine this group to see how we can treat the people involved because they represent a different cohort.  They would not normally seek what they see as traditional drug treatment services.</p>
          <p eId="para_243">The strategy addresses the problem of drug misuse across a number of pillars, namely, supply reduction, prevention, treatment and research, with a fifth pillar on rehabilitation now added to bring more focus on this important aspect of the work.  The overall strategy is being implemented across a range of Departments and agencies in conjunction with the community and voluntary sectors, all co-ordinated by my Department.  We have made considerable progress in implementing the 100 actions set out in the strategy.  This was borne out by the mid-term review that took place last year.</p>
          <p eId="para_244">As indicated, rehabilitation emerged as a central issue during the consultation process of that review.  The conclusion was that, although there had been significant improvements in treatment provision and while a great deal of work was already being done with respect to rehabilitation, a more focused approach was needed on this element of the strategy.  Arising from the review, rehabilitation was made the fifth pillar of the strategy and a working group on drug rehabilitation, chaired by my Department, was established to develop an integrated rehabilitation provision.  The group has taken a holistic view of rehabilitation and while it recognises the importance of clients being activated and prepared to fulfil their role in the push towards rehabilitation, it sees the empowering of recovering problem drug users as a key aim of the process so that they can re-engage with society in a manner consistent with their needs and expectations.</p>
          <p eId="para_245">The view was expressed that we were putting people on methadone and I will speak about the success of that later.  Many felt that methadone treatment is only a short-term measure and that we needed to pull the rehabilitation services together and provide a continuum of care.  In this way, people could progress from one level of rehabilitation to another.  Their education, employment and housing needs should be brought together so that we could stabilise them, wean them off methadone and get them back to making a useful contribution to their families and to society.</p>
          <p eId="para_246">Some of the key recommendations of the working group are likely to focus on ensuring that actions 47, 48 and 50 of the national drugs strategy are met.  These actions largely relate to providing a continuum of care for clients through planned progression paths for each problem drug user while ensuring that quality standards are achieved in the services provided.  The group is also likely to deal with wider supports needed by recovering problem drug users in areas such as community employment schemes, education, housing and child care while recognising the need to involve the families of problem drug users in the process.  I expect the working group to complete its report shortly with a view to beginning the implementation of its recommendations in 2007.  The Health Service Executive has also set up a working group specifically dealing with residential treatment and rehabilitation for substance users.  This group, on which my Department is represented, is examining the residential rehabilitation requirements of substance misuse, including alcohol, and it will report as early as possible next year.</p>
          <p eId="para_247">The national drugs strategy team and the drugs task forces, local and regional, have played a very important role in tackling the drug problem.  Many services and facilities have been established in recent years through the local drugs task force system.  Since 1997, almost €125 million has been allocated to support this work across the 14 local drugs task force areas.  More than 450 community-based projects have been established, employing more than 300 staff.  They deliver services such as advice and support for drug misusers and their families, treatment, outreach and crisis intervention services, as well as drug training programmes for community groups.  The focus of the local drugs task force plans is on the development of community-based initiatives to link in with the programmes and services already being delivered or planned by the statutory agencies.  Under the emerging needs fund I allocated €4 million to 67 projects over the past 15 months.</p>
          <p eId="para_248">The creation of the regional drugs task forces, covering all parts of the country outside the 14 local drugs task force areas, is further proof that we are delivering on the commitments in the programme for Government.  An initial total allocation of €5 million was approved in 2006 to the ten regional drugs task forces to begin implementation of the plans they drew up and submitted to us. It is envisaged that the funding will be increased on an incremental basis to achieve the full roll-out of the plans.  This is estimated to cost around €14 million annually, but it may take them about three years to implement their plans fully.  Meanwhile, nine of the ten regional drugs task forces now have full-time co-ordinators in place and the rate of progress is increasing.  The national drugs strategy team has been working closely with the regional drugs task forces to get their programmes up and running.  A total of 68 projects have been initiated in 2006.  It is envisaged that around 80 projects will be in progress by the end of the year.  The projects involved range from prevention initiatives and work with youth to treatment services and outreach work.</p>
          <p eId="para_249">With respect to supply reduction, I acknowledge the work of the Garda Síochána and the Customs and Excise service of the Office of the Revenue Commissioners<b> </b>on their considerable successes.  The strategy specifies a number of challenging supply reduction targets for the Garda Síochána through drug seizures, and these targets are being met.  Garda strategies for dealing with drug offences are designed to undermine the activities of organised criminal networks involved in the trafficking and distribution of illicit drugs.  These strategies include gathering intelligence on individuals and organisations involved in the distribution of drugs, conducting targeted operations on criminal networks based on intelligence gathered as well as working in collaboration with other law enforcement agencies, both within and outside the jurisdiction, to address the national and international aspects of drug trafficking and distribution.</p>
          <p eId="para_250">I have also overseen the Government's investment in facilities and services aimed at diverting young people away from drug misuse through the young people's facilities and services fund.  This fund was established by the Government in 1998 to assist in the development of youth facilities, including sport, recreational facilities and services in disadvantaged areas where a significant drug problem exists or has the potential to develop.  We have spent more than €100 million on 460 facility and services projects, employing 325 people.  Between the local drugs task force projects and young people's projects, about 650 jobs have been created that did not exist nine years ago.  Those people are doing a great deal of work and I am sorry we did not ask these community people nine years ago how many youth and project workers were needed.  I think they would have said that 20 or 30 people were needed and not 650.  A massive investment has been made by the State in those areas.  Most of the 650 people employed are in the Dublin area and they provide a range of services.  We will have to examine carefully whether they are all delivering what they set out to do because it is a significant annual investment by the Government.</p>
          <p eId="para_251">The Health Service Executive has also made great strides in the provision of treatment.  More than 8,300 heroin users now receive methadone treatment.  Recently the national advisory committee on drugs published the research outcome study in Ireland, ROSIE.  That study, carried out under action 99 of the national drugs strategy, involved 404 people in drug treatment services, following them for a year.  They were interviewed periodically, and changes were observed and documented.  The overall message from the study was that treatment works.  I was very pleased with the results, since one often wonders, and people ask, whether the substantial State investment every year is achieving its aims or whether we are simply providing 650 jobs without doing anything to wean people off drugs or minimise their drug problems.</p>
          <p eId="para_252">The clear message from that study, which followed more than 400 people in drug services, was that treatment works.  The key findings from the outcomes at the end of the first year were that there were significant reductions in heroin and other drug use; 27% were abstinent from all drugs, excluding alcohol, after one year; there were extensive reductions in drug injecting, both in the number of days and the number of times per day; there were improvements in the study group's physical and mental health; there were extensive reductions in criminal activity; and there was increased contact with health and social care services and a low mortality rate.</p>
          <p eId="para_253">Some people were still involved in crime, but we all know that if one does not provide services, people with a drug problem will feed it in two ways.  The first is through involvement in crime such as robbery and mugging to get the price of their next fix.  The other is that they turn into mini-dealers themselves, recruiting friends and others to make money.  Through our bringing them into services, putting them on methadone and supporting them, after a year they were much more aware of the damage their habit was causing them.  They had not all walked away from drugs but many of them showed an improvement.  While they were still on drugs, it was a lesser problem for them.</p>
          <p eId="para_254">The national advisory committee is also involved in organising the all-Ireland drug prevalence survey, for which a contract has recently been placed.  Fieldwork is in progress and will continue until April 2007, with the first report on national prevalence figures and trends expected in autumn 2007.  We had an all-Ireland study a few years ago, and this new one will enable us to measure the effect of action taken in recent years.</p>
          <p eId="para_255">Three basic questions are asked in such studies: whether one has ever used drugs, whether one has done so the last year, and whether one has done so in the last month.  The last two are the important issues because the numbers who have used drugs at least once in a lifetime are increasing all the time because some younger people who have done so are now entering older categories.  When we receive the outcome of the study next year, it will show us trends in drugs and how many are using each drug.  While that question is asked overall, it is also asked regarding cocaine, heroin, ecstasy, magic mushrooms and so on in particular.</p>
          <p eId="para_256">Education, prevention and awareness initiatives with regard to drugs are continuing.  Our children are now being educated on the dangers of drugs through dedicated modules of the social, personal and health education, SPHE, programme in all primary and post-primary schools.  That is complemented by the work of the national drugs awareness campaign.</p>
          <p eId="para_257">Tackling the drug problem is a key priority for the Government and will continue to be so.  That commitment is evidenced by the allocation of €43 million to my Department's Vote for the drugs initiative and young people's facilities and services fund in 2006, an increase of 37% on the original 2005 allocation.  More or less everything that we do is a pilot project and when those are evaluated, they are made mainstream and devolved to other agencies and Departments.  When mainstreamed projects are included, one sees that the Government is spending €70 million per year on projects that originated at community level.  Projects worth €20 million or €25 million that started in phase 1 of the plans have been mainstreamed.</p>
          <p eId="para_258">At community level, approximately €70 million a year is being spent by the Government on projects that started at local community level, serviced by approximately 650 full-time staff.  That shows a substantial Government investment.  The Health Service Executive spends approximately €80 million a year, and there are also the Garda and Customs and Excise.  Overall, the Government now spends between €190 million and €200 million a year through various arms, agencies and Departments on dealing with the problems of drug supply and treatment.</p>
          <p eId="para_259">I look forward to hearing Members' comments and will be happy to assist them by clarifying any issues.  I thank the House for the opportunity of speaking on the issue today.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#JoeMcHugh" eId="spk_82">
          <from>Mr. McHugh</from>
          <p eId="para_260">I welcome the Minister of State at the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, Deputy Noel Ahern, to the House to discuss this important matter which grows in seriousness with every passing week.</p>
          <p eId="para_261">The Minister of State acknowledged the challenging nature of the task.  It is very difficult to seal every port and harbour of our island community to combat the importation of drugs.  The seriousness of the Minister of State's brief is acknowledged in his portfolio, but he covers the areas of competence of the Department of Education and Science and, regarding resources for gardaí, the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform.  The job can be advanced and tackled only through collaboration on drug control between all Departments.</p>
          <p eId="para_262">I will focus first on preventative measures.  I acknowledge and welcome the fact that there has been an increase in personnel in the community sector.  However, there are still considerable deficits in community infrastructure from Malin Head in County Donegal to Mizen Head in County Cork.  We may think that we will tackle drugs and raise awareness of their dangers among young people through building sports facilities and community buildings.  That is a key component, but we also need the human resources through a dedicated roll-out of youth workers by using the Youth Work Act 2001 as best we can.  Youth workers must operate in a voluntary or paid capacity in every village, town and city.</p>
          <p eId="para_263">I welcome the 650 extra jobs over the past nine years that the Minister of State mentioned, but that still does not go far enough.  The voluntary sector has been crying out for some time for the roll-out of a proper, strategic, informal, paid community and youth work sector.  The need was never more evident than in my county over the Hallowe'en period when we suffered a great many incidents of anti-social behaviour.  They were not all down to idle minds with nothing to do, but we must work on the gap that exists at interdepartmental level.</p>
          <p eId="para_264">We should use the Youth Work Act 2001 to bring together young people in informal settings.  We must combine our energies in creating awareness of the dangers of drugs, including the constant heroin problems of this city.  Those are the issues and challenges we must tackle.  The Minister of State acknowledged the existence of programmes delivered through primary and secondary schools, which I also welcome.  However, young people engage in a more relaxed and open way when they are placed in an informal setting.  This will only happen when they are removed from their schools and uniforms and the top-down system of education that obtains in this country.  They must be placed in the non-formal sector where they can engage with their peers and in which youth workers can create awareness among them.  That is one of the preventative measures that is required.  The Minister of State acknowledged that there are programmes in the primary and secondary sectors but such programmes must also operate in the non-formal sector.</p>
          <p eId="para_265">The Garda Síochána is fighting a serious battle in respect of the drug epidemic in this country.  It is trying to combat organised gangs, the advanced communication systems used by drug dealers and the absolute hunger that exists, especially in Dublin, for heroin.  Gardaí are trying to fight this scourge.  I urge the Minister of State to use his influence with the Tánaiste and Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform.  Plain clothes officers are trying to intercept drug deals and identify the major players, and they are doing so without the use of guns, batons or bullet-proof vests.  From the point of view of safety, a greater level of resources must be allocated in this regard.  It is a miracle that those members of the force engaged in drug busts have not suffered serious injury or been killed.  This matter cannot be taken lightly.  We take the actions of these officers for granted because we do not see what they do.  The individuals to whom I refer are not the gardaí we see patrolling our streets; they operate in very dangerous environments and do a good job in that regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_266">The Garda Síochána recently intercepted €11 million worth of heroin.  That was a major drug bust on the part of the force and everyone else involved.  However, the interception of those drugs will only lead to a two-week gap in supply in specific areas.  This highlights the enormity of the task we face in respect of combating drug abuse.</p>
          <p eId="para_267">At a human level, one need only talk to primary and secondary school teachers in Dublin to discover what is happening.  One teacher informed me that she is aware of a national school in which half of the 28 students in sixth class have lost a brother, sister or someone else to whom they were close as a result of the drugs trade.  That is a stark reality and we must come to terms with it if we are ever to move forward.  We should challenge ourselves and invite feedback from teachers in respect of how we should combat drug abuse because we do not have the answers.  I accept, however, that we can put forward solutions.</p>
          <p eId="para_268">An 18 year old youth was recently confronted by a garda who asked how he had ended up addicted to heroin, the devil's drug.  The youth replied that his mother had injected him with it when he was 14 years of age.  How do we even think about coming to terms with this matter and facing up to the challenges involved when we are talking about first, second and third generation drug addiction?  The only way we will obtain answers is to continue to engage in debate and challenge ourselves in terms of how best to draw up ways to protect young people.  We cannot give up hope and we must learn from our mistakes.  The 18 year old to whom I refer stated that when he was first injected with heroin at 14 years of age, he got a buzz and an almighty adrenaline rush.  As a heroin addict, however, he no longer gets that buzz and is merely trying to get by and feel normal on a day-to-day basis.</p>
          <p eId="para_269">On the subject of resources, I will not even place on the public record the number of sniffer dogs available.  However, I am aware it is minimal.  I do not want to send out a signal that we cannot compete in terms of combating drug abuse.  The number of sniffer dogs that are trained to detect heroin is also minimal.  Gardaí will require additional sniffer dogs if they are to compete in the environment in which they are trying to compete.  Will the Minister of State communicate that fact to the Tánaiste and Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform?</p>
          <p eId="para_270">On the legal front, when someone is arrested on suspicion of dealing in heroin, be it a user or a supplier, a difficulty arises because such an individual can either swallow the small tablets of heroin or hide them in another way to which I will not refer on the public record and then deny access to his or her person to a doctor trying to extract the drug.  Tougher measures should be introduced to facilitate doctors trying to extract heroin tablets from such individuals.</p>
          <p eId="para_271">We live on an island and I live on the coast thereof.  Anyone who lives in an area such as that in which I reside is aware that it is impossible to seal our coastline.  Two weeks ago, the miraculous cure put forward by the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources was that if we get rid of all the drift net fishermen, salmon would be free to swim up our rivers to reach their spawning grounds.  People in coastal communities live in the real world and are aware that poachers operate in a professional manner and use sub-aqua techniques to remove far more salmon from our rivers and coastal waters than drift net fishermen.  I use that analogy because when one lives in a coastal community, one knows it is almost impossible to prevent the importation of drugs.  The only way we can combat this problem — this epidemic — is through awareness, protecting and informing young people, building up the self esteem and self confidence of young people, working in an informal environment, working with youth workers and working in a protected environment where young people are not thrown out as fodder.  As legislators, we are all responsible.</p>
          <p eId="para_272">This is not a political debate.  It is an issue on which both sides of the House are on the same message.  We must continue to be on that message and we must challenge ourselves, open up the debate and move it forward.  We need to provide information and protection for young people.  We owe it to them because we have let down generations of people.  There are first, second and third generation heroin addicts.  It is our responsibility and duty to continue the debate.</p>

          <from>Labhrás Ó Murchú</from>
          <p eId="para_273">I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Noel Ahern, to the House and compliment him on his work in this portfolio.  Most accept that he has an exceptionally proactive profile.  He adopts a no-nonsense approach to what he must do and he is not prepared to become defeatist.  As he stated, there is no quick solution to the problem, which is generally accepted.  Indeed, if we want to understand the extent of that problem, we can see it in the very successes that have been achieved in our fight against drug abuse.  Statistics show that in 2002, €49 million worth of drugs were seized.  In 2003 the figure for seizures was almost €100 million and in 2004 it was approximately €132 million.</p>
          <p eId="para_274">I welcome Senator McHugh's comment that this is not a political issue.  Of course it is not; it is a human issue that is perhaps one of the most important matters with which we must deal.  That is why this debate, and all other debates on this issue, are so very important.</p>
          <p eId="para_275">There are three main groups of victims of drug abuse: the misusers, the families of misusers and their communities.  If we look back over the years, it is sad to realise that just when we think we are getting on top of the drug problem, we find there is an increase in the use of cocaine and heroin, which is a further difficulty.  Following the mid-term review of the national drugs strategy, it was evident the strategy was meeting with considerable success, which most would accept.  However, because the goalposts change as the problems maximise, it is essential to refocus on the priorities, which I am glad to note the task force has done.  It would be wrong to put in place a strategy and believe it would be relevant for all time.  We accept it is necessary to keep the strategy under constant review.</p>
          <p eId="para_276">If we consider how we might tackle the problem and how the strategy has been pieced together, the most important element is to prevent drug dealing.  The review accepted there will undoubtedly always be a need for more gardaí and more community policing, but that is only one element.  We must ask ourselves fundamental questions.  Why do so many people need drugs?  Why do they experiment with drugs?  This does not involve a small number of people.  Many in all sections of society use drugs.</p>
          <p eId="para_277">The answer to these questions has its roots in our lifestyles.  First, there has been a change in family values and structures since the time when there was always one parent at home to bring about a focus and a degree of discipline and accountability.  Second, we are more affluent and more money is available.  Third, there is a greater exploitation of youth, which is evident in the type of advertising seen not just on television but in marketing generally.  These factors must be kept in mind.  No matter what answers we have to the immediate problem, we must keep an eye on the ball with regard to the fundamental issues which must be revisited from time to time.</p>
          <p eId="para_278">This can be done in two ways.  The first involves education, which is already being undertaken.  Some people have been especially proactive in this area and perhaps at times they become disillusioned that education programmes have not been taken on board by the young.  Perhaps they have been taken on board but we are not aware by how much.  How many times have such programmes prevented young people from going down that road by alerting them to dangers of drug taking?  One could almost go so far as to suggest that if one becomes addicted to hard drugs, it is the end of life as we know it.  Senator McHugh made the point that there is an initial buzz but after that, one is addicted and requires the substance just to get by.  People do not realise this at the time.  Perhaps many have been prevented from going down that road but it is important to get the message across.</p>
          <p eId="para_279">The second point is that role models have a major part to play.  It is amazing how people from the world of entertainment and sports can have such an attraction for the young.  Again, this results from marketing and advertising.  Role models should be presented to the young in the context of avoiding substances that will rule their lives.</p>
          <p eId="para_280">In that regard, alcohol must be included.  I am glad that in recent years there has been increasing awareness that one of the most prevalent drugs is alcohol.  This is not a question of being anti-alcohol.  People can drink sensibly, as they have always done.  However, one cannot suggest binge drinking is sensible.  As I understand it, binge drinking is drinking for the sake of getting drunk.  We have heard of cases where young people were prepared to work for two days per week, perhaps in a fast food outlet, so they could spend their earnings on binge drinking at the weekend.</p>
          <p eId="para_281">The difficulties we have may be related to vested interests.  We were very slow not so much to acknowledge but to promote the concept that alcohol is a drug.  There were vested interests which did not want the word "drug" associated with drinking.  One can see this even in the structures and resources available to us.  We must be courageous in this regard.  Alcohol and drugs must be dealt with by the same agencies and using the same resources.  If we do not do that, we are ignoring one of the biggest problems in society.</p>
          <p eId="para_282">Following a terrible recent tragedy outside a nightclub in Dublin, "Prime Time" made a number of television programmes highlighting the anti-social behaviour which resulted from alcohol abuse in particular, although I am sure drugs were involved as well.  Most people, who do not experience this behaviour at 2 a.m. or 3 a.m., suddenly became aware of this cancerous element in society.  The newspapers then began writing responsible editorials.  I recall stating in the House at that time that it would be a seven-day wonder, there would be an outcry and people would be outraged by what was depicted.  That happened but if we regulate and legislate to build that outrage into the structure, it will help.</p>
          <p eId="para_283">Great emphasis is placed on rehabilitation and I am glad that is part and parcel of the Minster of State's strategy.  I have been fortunate to hear young people who have been rehabilitated and it gives one's spirits a lift when one witnesses the absolute enthusiasm they have for life again.  They almost have a missionary zeal as they encourage other people not to go down the same road.  The Minister of State is correct that treatment works and the positives of what is being achieved must be promoted all the time.  If additional resources are needed for rehabilitation, they should be provided.</p>
          <p eId="para_284">I am delighted an extensive number of FÁS schemes play a role in the rehabilitation of drug abusers and addicts.  When people who have difficulties take up a scheme, they work with people who are not addicted to drugs and the normality of the situation and the insulation provided by that environment can be every bit as powerful as medication in helping them.  The FÁS model should be examined because I have witnessed how quickly it works.  Perhaps the Minister of State should re-examine the model to establish how interaction can be improved.</p>
          <p eId="para_285">I refer to alcohol sponsorship and a suggestion I have made previously.  Where organisations benefit from sponsorship by alcohol firms, they should be compensated so that they do not need to take such sponsorship.  It would be a step in the right direction because, at the end of the day, sponsorship, even if it only relates to the corporate image of the firm, gives credence to a link between alcohol and achievement, which is not correct.</p>
          <p eId="para_286">Alcohol advertising should be banned in the same way as tobacco advertising.  Members will recall the outcry when the former Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Martin, introduced the tobacco regulations.  People thought the end of the world was nigh but the smoking ban has been accepted.  Smokers will put up their hands nowadays and admit it was a good development.  Many of them have endeavoured to give up because of the unfashionable nature of smoking.  A similar ban should apply to alcohol because it is a health hazard, especially among young people.  To use entertainers and sports people to advertise alcohol and to link achievement with drink is wrong.  I fail to see a reason we should not take the bull by the horns in this instance and put an end to alcohol advertising once and for all.  The drinks companies will survive and they will still be able promote their products but they should be prevented from using the airwaves and print media and a change should be made in this regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_287">I wish the Minister of State well.  The statistics outline what has been achieved in a short time.  All Departments have brought resources to bear on this issue and significant consultation has taken place.  Ten regional task forces are working on this issue and these initiatives indicate the speed at which the programme is being rolled out.  However, as the Minister of State said, there is no easy solution to this problem and no one would ever thank us if we became defeatist.  We must always focus, therefore, on the positive as well as the problem.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#MaryHenry" eId="spk_84">
          <from>Dr. Henry</from>
          <p eId="para_288">I welcome the Minister of State.  He is correct that this is a difficult problem, internationally and domestically.  We must keep a close eye on what effective initiatives are being taken in other countries to combat drug abuse as we try to put our own solutions together.  I have always been fascinated by people who are keen to legalise drugs, which is a road I would not follow.  A number of cities and towns in Holland, as an experiment, provide cafes where people can use small amounts of cannabis without fear of prosecution, but one of the most recent reports on this initiative states that because so many foreign drug addicts are travelling to Amsterdam, for example, the authorities have attempted to locate drugs cafes in towns along the German and Belgian border.  They have been accused by the Belgian and German Governments of anti-social behaviour by trying to move their problem as close as possible to other countries.</p>
          <p eId="para_289">Drug abuse is not being defeated on the international stage and it is particularly worrying that because the war is going so badly in Afghanistan owing to a lack of troops and a lack of improvement in the general conditions of the Afghan population, heroin production will be larger and better than ever this year.  This is destined for the European and American markets.</p>
          <p eId="para_290">Domestically, the Government is doing a great deal.  It has managed to persuade a number of local communities, although not all, that it is better to locate drug treatment clinics in their localities rather than leaving drug addicts in their areas with nowhere to go for treatment.  One of the first clinics was established in Baggot Street Hospital, near where I live.  It has proven over time to be a great source of relief to me because when I received representations from people in which they appealed that a drug clinic should not be set up in their community, I was able to tell them truthfully that a drug clinic was open down the road from me and I found it addressed the issue gradually.  Initially there were so few clinics that all the addicts from south Dublin attended the Baggot Street clinic but, gradually, the situation was brought under control.  Society must accept that if we have such problems, we must deal with them.  I visit Mountjoy Prison regularly and I regret prisoners are in what the governor described as the biggest methadone clinic in the country because many of those involved in crime are addicted to drugs.</p>
          <p eId="para_291">The recent Dáil na nÓg report was interesting.  The children who attended the Parliament in Croke Park sought mandatory education for parents and children about drugs.  This highlights that they know drugs are a serious business and they want this message brought home to children and their parents.  Education policy in this area must be examined because the State is not getting involved early enough.  An Oasis report on drug awareness programmes stated second level schools will be required to put in place effective substance abuse policies.  Unfortunately, this issue must also be addressed at primary level because too many children are coming into contact with drugs for the first time at primary school age.</p>
          <p eId="para_292">Substance abuse policies must be put in place in primary schools. I know how difficult it can be to set up these school programmes.  For example, parents may object.  However, we should be strengthened by the fact that the children in Dáil na nÓg wanted mandatory education for parents and children.  The Minister of State could quote that statement to any objectors.  Owing to parents' objections, the Stay Safe programme has had problems and only operates in approximately 70% of schools.  Parents should be told that this is a serious issue.  Sometimes, the most out-of-touch parents believe that such programmes are not necessary.  Perhaps we could try to work in this regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_293">We must address the issue of providing young people with places where they are not exposed to drugs or drink.  It is amazing how little they ask for.  Examining the reports of the National Youth Council of Ireland and Dáil na nÓg, the main measures sought are safe and warm places where young people can make their own entertainment and where no alcohol or drugs are available.  If this is what children want, investing as much money as we can to make facilities available to them would be worthwhile.</p>
          <p eId="para_294">Senator Ó Murchú was right in his address of alcohol abuse among teenagers and youths.  From national statistics, there is a good correlation between drink and drugs.  Drink is frequently the gateway drug.  It is the drug of choice in this country and we are one of its greatest consumers in the European Union.  We should not believe that our example is not passed onto our children.  The Dáil na nÓg participants wanted a greater restriction placed on the advertising of alcohol.  Leaving aside the Vintners' Federation of Ireland, the Minister of State is pushing an open door.</p>
          <p eId="para_295">While I cannot speak for the rest of the country, the Minister of State was right to state that cocaine has overtaken heroin in Dublin in terms of consumption.  It is with horror that I listen to the many middle class people who believe that they are not on drugs if they take cocaine.  This is a worrying development.  Cocaine addiction is a serious physical and psychological issue and we have no idea of its effect on people's work, career prospects and so forth.  It is depressing to learn that many people believe that cocaine is a good, clean drug, as was described to be by a woman in her 30s.  I do not know what she thinks is a dirty drug.</p>
          <p eId="para_296">Drugs are cheap.  When one hears of the significant quantities seized and the drugs that get through, one wonders why the market has not collapsed.  While there are many drugs around, only a certain number of people can buy them.  Frequently, I am told of drugs that cost only €10.  For this reason, I was not in favour of mandatory sentences for people with certain quantities of drugs found on them.  Should we take the quantity as being valued at the top or the bottom end of the marketplace in downtown Dublin?  It is not helpful and, unfortunately, circumstances change.  I have met enough mules to know that people become involved in carrying drugs for the most appalling reasons, for example, blackmail.  We would be wise to allow judges the freedom to address each issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_297">A considerable number of people are addicted to prescription drugs.  I became peripherally involved in a case.  The Garda contacted me concerning prescriptions purportedly written on my prescription pad that had been handed into a few chemists.  The telephone number was wrong, the prescriptions were not properly made out, my name did not list a degree and there were no addresses included for the people for whom the drugs were supposedly prescribed, but they managed to get the prescriptions cashed in several chemists.  The pharmacies in question were not out of the way.  We must ask pharmacists to be careful when scrutinising prescriptions.</p>
          <p eId="para_298">Subsequently, the Garda explained that this is a common practice and that it is not difficult for addicts to order prescription pads which can be posted to them.  Since that event several years ago, an effort has been made to address the issue of printers being fooled into sending prescription pads to people who are not doctors.  We must keep a close eye on the prescription drugs situation.</p>
          <p eId="para_299">While only a small number of cases have passed through the drug courts, the courts appear to be working well, a situation I hope will be promoted.  Regarding the Criminal Court, the 2004 report on court statistics is interesting.  Some 1,091 and 2,068 drug offences were dealt with in Dublin and Limerick, respectively.  The Dublin figure includes Dún Laoghaire, Swords, Richmond and the Chancery Street Children's Court but excludes Kilmainham and Tallaght.  Of the Dublin cases, 159 were dismissed and 341 were struck out, but I cannot work out why.  The statistics give no explanation.  Close to half the cases were either dismissed or struck out, but I do not know whether the people involved agreed to go into treatment, the evidence was not good enough or no one turned up.  I would have liked to have found out more about this.</p>
          <p eId="para_300">Some 69 people were sentenced to imprisonment.  Unless they were big drug dealers, this was probably just as well because they become more enthusiastic when they go to prison and are presented with the opportunity to expand their network of drug suppliers.<b> </b> This is probably the right way to go about the matter.  Some people were sentenced to suspended imprisonment and 149 were given fines.  I hope the latter were not subsequently imprisoned because they failed to pay those fines.</p>
          <p eId="para_301">From listening to the debate, the Minister of State has the support of all Senators in doing something about drug addiction.  It is not a party political issue and anyone with good ideas should come forward.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#CyprianBrady" eId="spk_85">
          <from>Mr. Brady</from>
          <p eId="para_302">I welcome the Minister of State to the House and I welcome the opportunity to discuss the abuse of drugs.  Given that the global drugs industry is worth as much as $500 billion and the estimated worth of Ireland's drugs industry is €1 billion, it is easy to see how people are attracted to becoming involved financially.</p>
          <p eId="para_303">When we are out on the streets, the problems we encounter cannot be measured in financial terms.  The effect a drug addict has on his or her immediate family and the wider community can be devastating.  Every day in the north inner city, I see the consequences.  In the 1980s, communities took to the streets because of the scourge of heroin in the north inner city and throughout Dublin.  Parents, relatives and friends of people who were dying because of the use of heroin became involved.  It took such action for successive Governments to take notice of what was happening.  Fortunately, since then huge progress has been made for which I congratulate the Minister of State and his Department.  I am spokesperson on the drugs strategy in the Seanad and I have seen at first hand the improvements that have taken place on the ground at all levels, on the part of gardaí, in rehabilitation and treatment services and in education.</p>
          <p eId="para_304">It is widely accepted that there is no standard international model to deal with drug addiction and the consequences of the misuse of drugs.  There always will be a market and people willing to supply it, which is not surprising given the amounts of money involved.  However, we are resourcing the problem to a much greater extent than previously and it is having an effect.  I have been involved with the local drugs task force in the north inner city since its inception and the different strands of the strategy are having an obvious effect.  There are still problems and people, for whatever reason, continue to slip through the net, whether they are waiting for detox treatment, for counselling or for methodone.  We must, therefore, concentrate on those areas.</p>
          <p eId="para_305">The co-operation between the State agencies and the local communities plays, as the Minister of State said, a huge role in the implementation of the strategy and I see that on a daily basis.  Three times a year we attend a local policing forum in the north inner city.  The community, gardaí, the local authority and the various health agencies come together to discuss the problems.  At the last meeting a Garda spent 20 minutes reporting the various seizures that had been made since the previous forum, which was startling.  The seizures varied from amounts carried by a person for his or her own use to major hauls involving millions of euro worth of ecstasy tablets, cocaine, heroin and cannabis.  That shows the effect the drugs squads around the country are having and the Garda Síochána must be congratulated.  It needs as much resources as possible to keep the work going.  It is accepted internationally that seizures account for only 10% of what is in circulation, which is a frightening thought.  However, the Garda is well on target to meet its requirements under the strategy.</p>
          <p eId="para_306">There are three tiers to the problem.  The first is international trafficking and production and, as Senator Henry said, we must think differently about that element of the problem.  We must consider international ways of tackling the drugs coming out of Afghanistan, Colombia and other places, including encouraging the replacement of poppies as the cash crops in such countries.  The EU has a role to play and the Garda is in regular contact with Interpol in that regard.  The Department should continue to pursue that approach.</p>
          <p eId="para_307">The second tier is the import and distribution into the country, at which point the main dealers make their money as the drugs are broken up and distributed.  The final tier involves the local dealers and the market.  As I said, there always will be a market and young people will always want to experiment as that is in the nature of young people.  However, we must educate them to make choices not to submit to peer pressure.</p>
          <p eId="para_308">We see the effects of the misuse of alcohol in our young population.  As Senator Ó Murchú said, they are making television programmes about it now.  We must continue to educate and huge strides have been made.  The SPHE, which has been compulsory in all primary and secondary schools since 2003, is having an effect.  However, we must develop the curriculum to take account of changes taking place.  There are new drugs on the market with different effects from those with which we are familiar.  Young people, parents and teachers must be educated to recognise the signs, to give advice and to deal with the problem appropriately.  Garda youth diversion programmes are hugely successful and I know a couple in my own area, but they need resourcing and a greater framework on which to build.  Other successful models exist and the more we adopt the better.</p>
          <p eId="para_309">I have my reservations about methodone treatment.  I have not seen the ROSIE report, to which the Minister of State referred, but it seems very interesting.  It claims 27% of users are abstinent from all drugs after one year's treatment but I would be concerned about the other three quarters of users.  We have all seen the recent publicity concerning the Liffey boardwalk and the problems there, which were attributed to recovering addicts.  That the boardwalk is equidistant from three major treatment centres meant it became a place of congregation for people in rehabilitation.  Methodone is only one of the treatments available.</p>
          <p eId="para_310">There have been huge strides forward in combatting drugs.  I urge the Minister of State to continue the good work that has been done.  Local communities will offer co-operation and support, as will this House where there is cross-party support.  I look forward to the strategy going from strength to strength.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#MauriceCummins" eId="spk_86">
          <from>Mr. Cummins</from>
          <p eId="para_311">The Chief Justice, Mr. John Murray, said recently that there was no minor form of drug dealing as far as the courts were concerned and that all suppliers were at risk of serious sentences irrespective of the type of drug or its value.  When jailing drug dealers, he said the courts are entitled to take into account the impact of the offence on the local community and on society as a whole.  The Chief Justice went on to say the drug problem had to be taken seriously and that it was not a matter of degrees of seriousness.<b/> I welcome these comments from the Chief Justice and I express the wish that the mandatory sentences, laid down in legislation, be acted upon on a far more frequent basis than at present.</p>
          <p eId="para_312">The latest crime statistics highlight two interesting points about drugs and the criminal justice system.  Arrests for possession of drugs for sale or supply has increased by 7.7% year on year but, looking at the third quarter to quarter figures, it is clear there was a big increase in arrests between 2005 and 2006, which begs the question as to whether gardaí are more efficient in making arrests or increased numbers of drug dealers are on the streets.  I am inclined to support both options.</p>
          <p eId="para_313">The Garda has made major strides in arresting the bigger fish between the third quarter of 2005 and the third quarter of 2006.  This period saw a 62.5% increase in arrests for the cultivation, manufacture and importation of drugs.  Cocaine related prosecutions accounted for 11% of total prosecutions, almost equalling those of heroin which accounted of 11.2% of the total.</p>
          <p eId="para_314">A worrying finding of a 2004 Garda study, compared with a similar study conducted in 1997, relates to the apparent stabilisation of local drug markets over time and the reported easier availability of drugs.  The 2004 study records an increase from 46% to 76% in the number of people stating they sourced their drugs from a local dealer.  This has serious implications for local policing and other supply control initiatives.  The recruitment of the promised extra gardaí by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform might be one way to counteract this trend.  However, many other measures are required.</p>
          <p eId="para_315">Drug use is usually assumed to be an urban phenomenon.  However, when the size of population is taken into account, two areas outside Dublin are highlighted as having high relative rates of problem abuse, my constituency of Waterford and Carlow.  Carlow has the highest rate of problem drug abuse in the country.</p>
          <p eId="para_316">With regard to health implications, a report by J. Long earlier this year has found that there was a fall in the number of HIV cases among injecting drug users between 1994 and 1998.  It was suggested this might be attributable to the introduction and expansion of harm reduction measures.  However, this was contradicted by the sharp increase in the number of drug users testing positive for HIV in 1999 with 69 new cases while 2000 saw 83 new cases.</p>
          <p eId="para_317">Drug abuse has no boundaries.  It is alarming that the use of cocaine is now moving into new sectors and achieving a recreational Hollywood style appeal, particularly in middle class areas, although the stigma associated with treatment is preventing many of these users from seeking help.  The Coolmine Therapeutic Community has said that while the practice of injecting opiates has become endemic in deprived urban areas, there has been a marked increase in cocaine use across a range of different user groups.</p>
          <p eId="para_318">The risk of acquiring HIV and hepatitis C is associated with certain high dependency drug areas and may be linked to cocaine use.  The results of the Long study highlight the emerging cocaine problem and the high risk practices associated with it.  The findings are that current harm reduction methods are not robust enough to prevent the transmission of HIV among heroin users who also use cocaine.  There is a clear need to ascertain which aspects of harm reduction are inefficient and to determine what changes of harm reduction services are required to prevent transmission.  In other words, a coherent well structured approach must be put in place as a matter of urgency.</p>
          <p eId="para_319">Fine Gael proposes the creation of a unified approach to drug and alcohol abuse.  This would mean the creation of a single comprehensive national addiction strategy, to tackle both alcohol and illicit drug abuse.<b>  </b>It would represent an acceptance that increasing numbers of young people are abusing both alcohol and drugs.  The groundwork of implementing this strategy could be carried out by expanding the role, functions, manpower and resources available to the existing local and regional drugs task forces, many of which have significant expertise in tackling addiction.</p>
          <p eId="para_320">We suggest, and if elected to Government will introduce, a structured health care plan for each recovering drug and-or alcohol abuser to assist in overcoming their addictions.  Those on methadone maintenance would be subject to a six-monthly review by health care professionals, which would assess their progress and examine the feasibility of drug free treatment options.  The latter would also mean expanding support services for recovering addicts to pursue drug free rehabilitation.</p>
          <p eId="para_321">We will create a mentor system, where all drug and alcohol abusers who seek assistance, will have one health professional attached to their cases.  This professional, whether youth worker, drug worker or social worker, would act as a point of contact for the drug-alcohol misuser and would inform drug misusers of all the services available to them.</p>
          <p eId="para_322">We will increase support services, particularly counselling services, for those seeking treatment for cocaine abuse,<b> </b>in addition to increasing training for health care professionals to deal with the growing cocaine problem.  We will expand the availability of primary health care services as part of the service currently provided by drug services, to include general health information, dental services, hepatitis vaccinations, HIV, hepatitis and TB testing and community care.</p>
          <p eId="para_323">We will expand outreach services to specifically target hard-to-reach drug and alcohol abusers, such as mothers, the young and the homeless, with a concerted effort to get drug abusers to engage with the regular drug services.<b>  </b>This will involve increasing both the number and resources available to the outreach service.  We will also expand existing support services to the parents and families affected by drug misuse through the creation and expansion of family support network units to involve families and addicts.  Such support services would also concentrate on issues such as family break up and relationship breakdown.</p>
          <p eId="para_324">Furthermore, we will expand targeted outreach programmes, particularly drugs education, to vulnerable young people such as those who drop out of schools or are young offenders who are likely to miss out on drug education at school.  The Minister and his party colleagues have consistently asked us what our policies are on a wide range of issues.  I have outlined just some of our proposals in this area.  I hope they will form part of any targeted action in the future, irrespective of who is in Government.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#BrendanDaly" eId="spk_87">
          <from>Mr. Daly</from>
          <p eId="para_325">It is good to hear a constructive speech from the Opposition, rare as it is.  There are good initiatives outlined in the Senator's contribution and they will be taken into account by the Minister of State.  It is important to acknowledge the work being done by the Minister of State, Deputy Noel Ahern, and to thank him for his contribution to this debate.  It set out the strategy being followed by the Government to deal with this complicated issue, which is a cause of concern both nationally and internationally.</p>
          <p eId="para_326">The Cathaoirleach comes from the same geographical area as I, and for many years that area was spared the scourge of the distressing drug problem experienced in the inner city areas of Dublin and Limerick.  To a large extent it did not have the type of criminal activity and drug abuse experienced in cities in the past 30 or 40 years.  There is an escalating problem in Limerick city, although it is confined to a small section of the community and is contained within certain parts of the inner city.  It has been suggested that the neglect of these areas and the lack of facilities, be they recreational, leisure, social services and so forth, led to people turning to drug abuse, a devastating and tragic activity.</p>
          <p eId="para_327">It is unfortunate that what we were spared for many years is now creeping, slowly but steadily, into rural areas, especially in my constituency.  There have been some bad incidents recently involving drugs.  This has caused distress, anxiety and some soul-searching as to how it can be dealt with at a time when it was generally believed that at a national level we were coming to grips with the problem.  If it had been contained in the area in which it had been prevalent for many years, the prospects of it spreading at its current alarming rate in isolated rural areas would have been minimised, if not eliminated.</p>
          <p eId="para_328">I join other speakers in complimenting the members of the Garda Síochána on the work they are doing.  The number of detentions and seizures, particularly in the past year or so, is an indication of a robust approach by all those involved, whether it be the drugs squad, other members of the Garda Síochána or Revenue.  The result is encouraging in that they appear to be coming to grips with the escalating problem by seizing substantial quantities of drugs which otherwise would be on the market causing more damage.</p>
          <p eId="para_329">It is important to get across the message about the dangers drugs pose to young people, in particular, from whom part of the solution must come.  We should try to get a response from them similar to the one we are seeking in respect of dangerous driving.  We could involve them in the partnership arrangement about which the Minister of State spoke.  Until we do this, we will not get the results we want.</p>
          <p eId="para_330">I am particularly concerned about the increased availability of speed, ecstasy tablets and cannabis at events such as concerts and festivals, particularly in the summer.  There is a necessity to make sure the culture which is introducing a drugs element to those attractive social events and leisure activities is stamped out.  Young people must play a part in this, as well as the Garda Síochána, the interdepartmental committees and the other interventions mentioned by the Minister of State.</p>
          <p eId="para_331">Senator Henry spoke about cannabis cafés.  I am not sure whether she advocated them but in so far as my opinion is worth anything, their introduction would be a unmitigated disaster.  I urge the Minister of State to vehemently oppose any such suggestion which has been made for various reasons at various times, that this might be a useful initiative to try to curb the escalation of the drugs problem.  Introducing cannabis cafés would be a recipe for disaster and I oppose the suggestion.</p>
          <p eId="para_332">It is important to get across to young people involved in a minor way in drugs that there is only disaster waiting for them at the end of the road in what is an escalating problem.  They only have to look at the devastation and tragedy caused in some of our cities, with people being shot in their cars and homes and bodies being found on the side of the road.  The tragedy for the families affected should bring home to the younger generation the need to make every effort to stem this horrific development which inevitably leads to death and disaster for families and upset for hundreds.</p>
          <p eId="para_333">There is a drugs squad in Ennis which is successful in so far it goes.  I support the view expressed by previous speakers on the necessity to supplement the efforts of the drugs squad with support from the other agencies which have responsibilities in tackling this problem.</p>
          <p eId="para_334">The Health Service Executive recently organised a conference in Dublin at which various agencies, organisations, Departments, the Garda Síochána and others involved in tackling the drugs problem came together to form an initiative to try to come to grips with it.  While that initiative in Dublin is welcome, it must be replicated on a regional basis.  There is a necessity in each region for a similar initiative under the aegis of the Minister of State, his officials and the interdepartmental committee.  Conferences similar to the one held in Dublin could be organised at which the various agencies, whether it be the Health Service Executive or educationists, could meet at local level to come to grips with the problems in their area.</p>
          <p eId="para_335">I compliment the Minister of State on the work he is doing and I urge him to continue with the approach he is taking because some success is being achieved.  If Fine Gael brings forward new important initiatives, they could be built in but the main focus of attention in dealing with this issue must be on young people.  Unless they take the initiative and work with the drugs squad, other members of the Garda Síochána and the State agencies to try to find solutions to the problem, it will continue and the long-term result will be further death and devastation.</p>

        <speech by="#BrendanRyan" eId="spk_88">
          <from>Mr. Ryan</from>
          <p eId="para_336">I listened both here and in my office to many of the contributions which were constructive.  There is no doubt that measures are being taken that were not taken previously.  Senator Cummins's contribution, in particular, was very thoughtful.  There was much in it with which I agree.</p>
          <p eId="para_337">There is an issue at the core of this debate which has not been discussed.  For the past 25 years Members of these Houses have been talking about the drugs problem.  For a long time we had two related issues to address, one of which was the gradual infiltration of our youth culture by cannabis, in particular, and, to a limited but worrying extent, ecstasy.  Parallel with this — perhaps it was not wisely discussed in the same debate — was the extraordinary invasion of heroin into the poorest communities in Dublin, in particular.  For a long time it was exclusively and overwhelmingly a Dublin issue.  My understanding is that some of the drug gangs in Cork struck moral poses about the fact that they did not sell heroin and it somehow made them feel superior.  They have got over this now that they have discovered how much money is to be made.</p>
          <p eId="para_338">I am open to Members on the Government side misrepresenting the problem.  To a degree, we confused the solutions by pretending that there was not a fundamental difference between a youngster who used cannabis on a regular basis and another who used heroin on a regular basis.  The truth is that they are not the same.  The outcomes are not likely to be the same but there is an overlap.  There is no disputing the fact that some young people who started using cannabis ended up using heroin but one could go further back and discover that they all started with cigarettes or alcohol before they used any other substance.  On the question of a gateway drug, it is a matter of looking through the sequence and deciding where the barrier is but there is no overwhelming argument that moving the barrier and redefining something as a gateway drug will stop anybody from taking drugs.</p>
          <p eId="para_339">I do not believe in the prohibition of alcohol, for instance.  It did not make any difference in the United States; in fact, it probably did more harm.  On the other hand, it is not sensible to legalise the use of something that is currently illegal.</p>
          <p eId="para_340">When discussing drug misuse, we need to realise the reasons illegal substances are used by various sectors of society are profoundly different.  For example, I believe the overwhelming use of heroin is a consequence of extraordinary social deprivation.  My party was in Government for part of the period when this became an issue, so the comment is not a party political one.  There has been a sense of abandonment of communities in this city for a long number of years.  A whole generation was blighted by heroin and the belief that nobody cared.</p>
          <p eId="para_341">This abandonment was confirmed when these communities finally set up local campaigns against drugs.  By whom they were organised or motivated is secondary.  It was not that these people were naive, but as a result of the campaigns, they saw more gardaí in their communities policing the anti-drugs campaigners because of their alleged suspect political affiliations than they ever saw of the gardaí policing drug pushers.  There were more gardaí in their inner city communities because of the anti-drugs campaigners.  It is possible that a significant number of those involved in the anti-drugs campaigns had less than noble motives.  However, it is a fact that in the perception of the communities with most victims, there was more visible police activity regulating, controlling and policing the anti-drugs campaigns than ever regulated, policed and controlled the drug pushers.</p>
          <p eId="para_342">There was a story in this morning's newspapers about a well known Dublin city drug pusher.  This man absconded from prison when serving a long sentence.  Deputy Gregory, who represents the inner city, said everybody knew where he was living long before he was arrested.  However, despite having absconded once, when he was rearrested, he was returned to an open prison, Shelton Abbey.  I do not know what sort of check is made on the type of person suited to an open prison, but a person who absconded when on three days compassionate leave and who was missing for months is not the obvious choice.  This situation is heartbreaking for communities where such individuals are seen as the source of so much evil.  This is one side of the drug problem and the Minister of State adverted to the fact that serious resources are being provided to try to deal with it.</p>
          <p eId="para_343">There is another issue of concern, one that used to manifest in cannabis abuse.  When I was of an age when a culture existed where cannabis was widely used — when I was a student — the overwhelming group of those who used cannabis on an intermittent basis were aware of a reasonable balance between the risks they took and their reason for using the drug.  They also had a genuine belief that intermittent use was not a serious health risk.  They may have been wrong, but theirs was a conscious and rational decision. What I find disturbing now is the increasing use of cocaine, the harmful effects of which are not in any doubt.  Nobody would argue that there is not a serious health or addiction risk or the risk of a serious personality disorder attached to its regular use.</p>
          <p eId="para_344">The generation that used cannabis made a reasonably rational decision to do so.  However, I cannot see how it is possible to make a rational decision to use cocaine on a regular basis.  We should be disturbed that this decision is being made by the best educated generation we have ever had.  It is a generation with more access to knowledge, information and money, yet it seems to have abandoned any element of rationality in the area of substance use, including its attitude to alcohol.</p>
          <p eId="para_345">Some people think it funny that I have often mentioned that in my life I never set out to get drunk.  I often ended up drunk, but I never set out to get drunk.  I set out to enjoy myself and the consequence was I drank more than I should.  I am not alone in that.  It is disturbing that nowadays a significant number of comparatively well off, well educated young people's idea of a night out is to set out to get drunk.  If they remember what they did for the night, they are convinced they did not have a great time.</p>
          <p eId="para_346">It is very disturbing that this culture of obliviousness to the consequence of one's actions is manifest in our society.  There is a sense that it does not matter that one is doing one's self profound physical damage in one's 20s, when one should be looking forward to what life has to offer.  Many of our young people who are well off financially and in good jobs, deliberately and knowingly practise a lifestyle which will do them serious harm.  This is an issue we need to address in terms of abuse of drugs.</p>
          <p eId="para_347">If 20% of people are indifferent to their long-term health and to their short-term security, they will not be concerned about whether they end up in prison.  It appears to me that their sense of life values is vastly different from ours.  The inconvenience of being caught does not trouble them and they will not be deterred by penalties.  These people know what the penalties are because they are well informed.  The situation for them is different than for others such as drug pushers.  The greatest deterrent for all criminals is the likelihood of being caught, rather than whether the penalty is five, six or ten years in prison.</p>
          <p eId="para_348">What future strategy should we develop on drugs?  We, the older generation, all believed somewhat naively that if we gave people information early about drugs, they would not act stupidly.  Unfortunately, we have considerable evidence that people are acting stupidly, even though they know how much harm they will do to themselves.  Normally I head back to Cork early on a Thursday, but I stayed late today because I want debate on this issue to begin.  What is happening in the minds of a large section of the population between the ages of 20 to 35?  They are not poor or deprived, but have grown up in considerable privilege and have well paid jobs.</p>
          <p eId="para_349">These young people have developed a kind of hedonistic obliviousness.  I am quite an enthusiast for hedonism, provided people are doing what they enjoy and understand what they are doing.  However, this is a kind of oblivious hedonism.  It is a sense that there is no future and that nothing matters, not even life.  I believe this attitude spills over in its extreme case into our suicide epidemic.  Something has happened to the mentality of some of our young people which has nothing to do with protest, experiment or amusement.  It has to do with a sense of obliviousness and a sense that life is pointless, meaningless and worthless and that we might as well act this way because there is nothing more worth doing.</p>
          <p eId="para_350">My contribution may not be as constructive as Senator Cummins's was, but it comes from my genuinely serious concern for the future of Irish society.  I am concerned about why we have this new manifestation of what is apparently widespread, middle class abuse of an inherently profoundly dangerous substance.</p>

          <from>Minister of State at the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs (Mr. N. Ahern)</from>
          <p eId="para_351">I thank Senators for expressing their views and acknowledge their desire to co-operate in fighting this problem.  Senator McHugh discussed the issue as it affects youth.  While the Department of Education and Science has overall responsibility for the Youth Work Act, we have established the young people's services and facilities fund to specifically target areas and communities at risk from drug problems.  We have spent more than €125 million in recovered drugs and dormant accounts money on providing youth workers and facilities such as youth cafés.  These facilities are concentrated in the greater Dublin area, including the inner city and the suburbs built in the 1970s, such as Coolock, Finglas, Clondalkin and Tallaght, to help young people avoid the dangers of drug abuse by offering them a choice of activities.</p>
          <p eId="para_352">Senators McHugh and Ryan claimed the State was ignoring and deserting people.  While some of their comments may be partly true and the State's significant increase in spending may indeed be belated, questions of personal responsibility remain.  If people are prepare to ruin their own health and lives, the State cannot be fully responsible for them.  It certainly has a duty to help those who are prepared to seek help but it cannot be blamed if people act recklessly.  If some mother injects her 13 year-old child with heroin, it is not fair to blame the Government.  The problems that arise for some people are very complex.</p>
          <p eId="para_353">Senators Cummins and Ó Murchú made the connection between alcohol and drugs.  At meetings of the British-Irish Interparliamentary Body and at international level, I sometimes encounter Ministers who describe themselves as having responsibility for drugs, alcohol and tobacco.  However, the drugs strategy in Ireland was developed separately because it was originally a reaction to heroin abuse in particular areas.  Ten years ago, if one suggested that local taskforce members should become involved in alcohol control, they would have freaked out because they saw themselves as responsible for addressing a specific problem.  On the other hand, people have claimed at meetings of regional drugs taskforces that the biggest problem in their areas is alcohol.  The local drugs taskforces in Dublin have also realised the prevalence of what is known as poly-drug users, who consume alcohol one night and whatever is available the next.  Therefore, the argument against linking alcohol and drug strategies has become less certain.</p>
          <p eId="para_354">The current policy of Government is that my Department has responsibility for the drugs strategy, while the Department of Health and Children is responsible for alcohol.  Linkages can be made between the strategy's five pillars of supply reduction, prevention, treatment, research and rehabilitation.  In schools, for example, the dangers of addiction are emphasised and, whether one refers to cannabis or alcohol, linkages can be made at the prevention level.  However, differences arise in terms of the legality of alcohol and the illegality of other drugs.  In addition, heroin and, to a lesser extent, cocaine are concentrated in disadvantaged areas and among certain age groups, whereas alcohol is consumed by young and old, rich and poor.  The possibility remains, however, of linking the two policies, as is the case in other countries, and communities would not object as strenuously as before to such a linkage.</p>
          <p eId="para_355">Senators outlined strategies for dealing with the drugs problem, many of which have already been implemented.  I am not suggesting that everything is perfect but improvements have been made.  I acknowledge that Senator Henry did not wish to score political points when she raised the need for communities to accept treatment facilities.  We have all attended meetings on this issue.  Some of the controversy which arose ten years ago, when people objected to treatment facilities, is resurfacing in towns throughout Ireland.  However, it is preferable to provide treatment facilities because the alternative is that people will steal or become dealers to find the money for drugs.  In one case, a doctor and Fine Gael Dáil candidate in Dublin West led a campaign against the plans of a pharmacy to supply methadone.  Large clinics and local primary care centres already supply methadone but pharmacists can serve small numbers of people at the local level.  My criticism of the candidate in question, who persuaded 300 frightened middle class women to attend a series of public meetings, is on the basis of his profession rather than his political affiliation.  After all, every party is capable of spawning people who cannot resist the temptation to hang their names in lights.  Many professionals in the health services were disappointed that one of their own, who should know more than the rest of us, led a charge in that direction.</p>
          <p eId="para_356">Cocaine was mentioned by several Senators.  There are still approximately 14,500 heroin users in the country and the image of people injecting themselves is particularly nasty.  Heroin also carries a severe risks of infection and the sharing of needles and other paraphernalia causes a range of problems.  However, even in disadvantaged areas, heroin has come to be regarded as a drug for losers.  Cocaine is surrounded by the myth that it is a clean drug, even though it is probably more dangerous than heroin.  It can cause serious complications in terms of heart attacks, strokes and respiratory infections and long-term use can result in mental health problems.</p>
          <p eId="para_357">Cocaine users do not realise the damage they are doing to themselves.  We encounter that attitude among middle class and recreational users but, while their health does not deteriorate as quickly as that of heroin users, they will encounter severe problems over the longer term.  They may be able to sniff and snort again and walk away from it.  I would never try to give the impression that one is hooked for life after one sniff.  To say so is neither fair nor true.  Those who develop a regular habit are in big trouble and very slow to cop on.  Even given that State services may be perceived to be aimed at heroin users rather than users of other drugs, cocaine users do not recognise or accept they have a problem.  It is often only after getting into trouble at work, in relationships or with the bank manager that they seek help, advice and counselling.  When they are counselled or analysed, they admit they have a problem.</p>
          <p eId="para_358">This problem, on which the State is spending nearly €200 million per year, will not go away.  I appreciate the comments made by Senators because every Government will have to deal with the issue.  Progress is being made.  The single message I can send is that treatment works.  When one hears statements to the effect that the number being treated in Waterford has increased by 500%, for example, one should realise this is good.  It means there were no services five years ago and that there are some now.  Five years ago drug users had to come to Dublin on the train or did not receive treatment.  We are trying to attract them to treatment and work with them.  I hope that over time we can make them recognise they are damaging their health.</p>
          <p eId="para_359">I thank Members for their comments and their support for the national drugs strategy.</p>

            <from>Mr. Morrissey</from>
            <p eId="para_360">I thank the Minister of State for attending to discuss the education of learner drivers and the wider driving community.  As we all know, alarming numbers have been and continue to be killed on the roads, despite our best efforts, including the penalty points system, the Garda traffic corps and random breath testing.  If we are to devote all our resources to enforcement, on which we are expending much effort, we will not succeed very well.  Enforcement is the last stage of the procedure.  I would, therefore, like more resources to be directed towards the education of drivers.  I refer not only to the education of young drivers but also to the ongoing education of experienced drivers.  We should further encourage driving simulation and make it available on a graduated basis.  It could be introduced among students in transition year before the leaving certificate.  One could offer a proper learning experience to young drivers over many months.  As of now they try to cram three, four or five lessons into the one-month period before their driving test.  We must extend this timeframe.</p>
            <p eId="para_361">If 50% of students failed the leaving certificate examination, we would ask one or two questions.  We would either say the standard required was too high or that the preparation was inadequate.  However, some 50% of those who undertake the driving test fail on their first attempt.  It is a waste of State resources to test drivers who clearly are not experienced enough to do the test.  It is crazy that people are stuck in a revolving door trying to pass the test on their first attempt when clearly they are not able to do so.  They are clogging up the system.</p>
            <p eId="para_362">Simulating driving experience in the classroom is one way of addressing the problem.  It would give students an early learning driving experience which would not cost anything by way of insurance.  The students' parents would not have to buy cars for them and the initiative would offer a new experience to students and a greater experience of the dangers posed by a motor car on the road.  The system would provide motorway and night-time driving experience which is not tested under current conditions.  There are many advantages to my proposal.  Every consideration should be given to considering it for the transition year curriculum, not just on a pilot basis but widespread across the country.  We must do so.  I encourage the Minister to consider driver education before spending all the available moneys on driver enforcement.</p>

          <speech by="#NoelAhern" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Community,_Rural_and_Gaeltacht_Affairs" eId="spk_91">
            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs (Mr. N. Ahern)</from>
            <p eId="para_363">I wish to outline the position of the Department of Education and Science on the introduction of driver education to the school curriculum.  The Department has no plans to introduce driver education in the form of driving lessons in schools.  It is not the norm within the European Union.  As the Senator may be aware, a report produced for the NCCA by an expert group which included representatives of the National Safety Council, the Garda Síochána, the Irish Insurance Federation and the Society of the Irish Motor Industry indicated that the research available internationally was inconclusive on the benefits of teaching young people to drive at school.  Particular issues highlighted include the gap arising between the time practical skills are learned initially and put into regular practice and the risks arising from having more young people take up driving at an earlier age.</p>
            <p eId="para_364">Nonetheless, the Department believes schools have a role to play both in teaching students about road safety issues and in helping them to develop the attitudes necessary to promote safe behaviour on the roads.  The social, personal and health education programme which is mandatory in primary schools and at junior cycle level provides a framework under which the generic values and skills that underpin responsible decision-making and respect for the rights and safety of others can be developed and promoted among students.  The social, personal and health education programme has a specific personal safety strand which provides a mechanism through which road safety issues for all can be best dealt with in an age-appropriate way.</p>
            <p eId="para_365">Specific materials for teaching young people about road safety have also been given to schools.  At the start of the 2001-02 school year the National Safety Council, assisted by the Department, distributed copies of Staying Alive — a road safety resource for transition year and the senior cycle — to all second level schools.  This pack contained a wide range of learning materials and activities on topics such as personal responsibility and decision-making, environmental issues and risks and rules for road users.  A CD-ROM with additional material downloaded from the Internet was included in the pack, with copies of the Rules of the Road.  In the preparation of Staying Alive, resource material views were sought from a range of organisations with an interest in the promotion of road safety.  The material is supplemented by Garda visits to primary and secondary schools during which the themes of crime, road safety, personal safety and substance abuse are explored as part of the social, personal and health education programme.  Some 1,900 school visits were made in 2005.  The curricular framework that is in place, in which the importance of road safety can be taught to young people, is supplemented by specific teaching materials and a comprehensive programme of Garda visits to schools.  The Department of Education and Science will continue to work with the Road Safety Authority to strengthen further the role of schools in promoting road safety.  The authority has commenced work in a number of key areas.  It is developing a road safety programme for use in transition year in co-operation with the Department of Education and Science and the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment.</p>
            <p eId="para_366">I hope my response has been of benefit to Senator Morrissey.  While the Department is doing a great deal, it seems it is not prepared to provide for driving lessons in our schools.</p>

            <p eId="para_367">The Minister of State said lessons of this nature are not the norm across Europe.  However, I am certain that what we are experiencing with young drivers in this country is not the norm.  We are mistreating young drivers by pushing them into a system whereby they fail their tests at the first attempt and are then charged large amounts of money for insurance because they have failed their tests.  This problem is not the responsibility of any single Department — it is the responsibility of several Departments.  The Department of Education and Science is failing miserably.</p>

            <from>Mr. Cummins</from>
            <p eId="para_368">In the years between 1991 and 2001, <i>per capita</i> income in the south east fell from 91.1% to 85.3% of the State average.  The region’s record in attracting and stimulating knowledge-based industries is also lower than the State average.  Just 30.4% of employment in the region is in the modern export sector, compared to the national average of 38.4%.  Some 19.7% of the workforce in the south east has a third level qualification, compared to the national average of 26%.  Waterford is the only gateway city without a university.  Its annual investment in higher education is substantially behind the other gateway cities.</p>
            <p eId="para_369">Waterford Institute of Technology, which has more than 10,500 full-time and part-time students, has built a stock of intellectual capital and infrastructure that could be easily reconfigured to university level without significant cost or delay.  It is comparable in size to many universities.  The breadth of study offered by Waterford Institute of Technology is substantial and diverse.  It spans disciplines such as the arts and humanities, social science, education, business and management, information technology, science, health sciences, architecture and engineering.</p>
            <p eId="para_370">The 2005 Goodbody report suggested that Waterford Institute of Technology, under its current structure, will make no additional contribution to the region over the next five years.  The report argued that the upgrading of the institute to university status would result in the creation of almost 750 high-skilled jobs and lead to an additional annual inflow of up to €80 million per annum into the region.  The overall conclusion of the report is that significant value, in terms of economic and social development, would accrue from the investment that would be necessitated by the designation of Waterford Institute of Technology as a university.  University designation would provide for a stronger and more competitive cutting edge, beyond that which the institute can achieve within its current boundaries.</p>
            <p eId="para_371">I ask the Minister of State to outline the current status of Waterford Institute of Technology's application for redesignation as the university of the south east.  What further steps are required before such a redesignation can take place?  What timescale is envisaged for the realisation by the region of its true potential, in terms of having its own university?  I hope the Minister of State will not give us any more pious platitudes or announce that more reports will be undertaken.  He should concentrate on specifics in his reply because we are tired of generalities, nods and winks and the muddying of the waters with bland statements.  Waterford and the south east as a whole need to know where they stand in this regard.  I hope the Minister of State will clarify the matter.</p>

            <from>Mr. N. Ahern</from>
            <p eId="para_372">As Senator Cummins is aware, the Taoiseach recently confirmed that the Minister for Education and Science plans to commission a preliminary independent examination of a submission that has been made by the governing body of Waterford Institute of Technology.  The governing body wrote to the Department of Education and Science in February 2006 requesting a review of its status under section 9 of the Universities Act 1997.  The provisions of section 9 state that the Government may appoint a body, which will include international experts, to advise the Higher Education Authority on whether, having regard to the objects and functions of a university, an educational institution should be established as a university.  On the advice of the body and the recommendation of the authority, the Government may, by order, deem the institution to be a university for the purposes of the 1997 Act.</p>
            <p eId="para_373">The submission from Waterford Institute of Technology seeking university status is under consideration by the Department of Education and Science.  When such an application is being considered, a detailed statutory review process needs to be followed and significant wider issues need to be considered in advance of a statutory review.  Some important wider policy developments in the higher education sector are relevant in this context.  It is important to take account of the recent significant changes in the legislative framework governing Irish higher education.  I refer to the passing of the Institutes of Technology Act 2006 at the end of the last Dáil term, for example.</p>
            <p eId="para_374">Some changes were made to wider Government policy on foot of the review of Irish higher education that was carried out by the OECD in 2004.  The broad thrust of that review was endorsed by the Government.  One of the central purposes of the OECD review was to support Ireland's strategic ambition of placing its higher education system in the front rank of such systems within the OECD nations.  That ambition is being pursued in the context of the wider national objective of developing as a leading knowledge economy and society.  In its report to the Government, the OECD recommended that Ireland should retain the differentiation in mission of the university and institute of technology sectors, which it identified as a key strength of our system.  It emphasised that there should be no institutional transfers into the university system in the foreseeable future.  The report also recommended that the universities and institutes of technology should be brought together under the remit of a single authority for the purpose of achieving a unified higher education strategy.  The OECD report further recommended that the extent of the external regulation of the institutes of technology should be lightened to give them greater managerial freedom in responding to the opportunities and challenges of supporting regional and national social and economic development.</p>
            <p eId="para_375">The Institutes of Technology Act 2006, which addresses some significant elements of the OECD recommendations, marks a major milestone for the institutes of technology sector and the development of higher education in Ireland.  The Act will transform the Irish higher education landscape.  It will inform our consideration of the case being made for university status for Waterford Institute of Technology.</p>
            <p eId="para_376">In the interests of achieving the best outcome, it is intended, as a first step, to commission a preliminary independent examination of the governing body's submission.  The examination will involve the appointment of an eminent international expert on higher education to comprehensively analyse Waterford Institute of Technology's submission, taking account of the wider changing policy context.  When the independent expert's report has been completed, it will be used to guide the Government's decision on whether a formal statutory review process should be initiated to consider the application, as required under the Universities Act 1997.  It is expected this appointment will be made soon.</p>
            <p eId="para_377">The Minister for Education and Science is cognisant of the strong support that has been built in the south-east region around the application from Waterford IT for university status.  However, the relevant wider policy developments that I have outlined are also fundamental to her consideration of the appropriate next steps on the application.  I hope this helps the Senator to understand the present thinking and policy on education.</p>

            <p eId="para_380">Most of the Minister of State's speech referred to the OECD report that suggested no further transfers to the university sector for the foreseeable future.  That seems to be the policy of the Government.  In other words, the people of Waterford and the south east have been shot in the foot again.  No hope whatsoever is being given to our aspiration for a university in the region.  It is most disappointing that we have this kind of reply from the Department, but it does not surprise me.</p>

            <p eId="para_381">The Senator is not being fair.  I outlined what the Department is doing, which is in accordance with what was laid down in legislation.  The other comments about the OECD are fair.  I accept that they do not sound encouraging, but they are used as background and tell us of the parameters and of the other view.  I fully understand the local view about university status, but the Government is proceeding in accordance with the legislation passed by the Oireachtas.</p>

            <from>Mr. Coonan</from>
            <p eId="para_383">I welcome the Minister of State to the House, having not had the opportunity to do so before.  This matter is about a proper, modern sewage treatment plant for the town of Templemore.  I will not go into the background of this or we would be here for a long time.  I will suffice to say that in 1991, I was elected to North Tipperary County Council when it was an issue.  In 1994, I was elected to Templemore Urban District Council and it was still an issue.</p>
            <p eId="para_384">I appreciate that the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government has dealt with the issue and has approved a sewage treatment system for Templemore.  However, it has not yet been built and this has stifled development in Templemore.  We are in an era of high levels of development and Templemore has lost out to a large extent.  The public and developers in the area are now very frustrated that the plant has not been built.</p>
            <p eId="para_385">The Department announced three different schemes for Templemore.  The first is a DBO, or design, build and operate plant for the town.  The second is a septic tanks effluent drainage system, or STEDS.  I compliment the Department on that because it is a pilot scheme and is unique in Ireland.  The Department's officials are co-operating with local officials to establish that system in the town.   The final scheme to be approved is the SLI, or service land initiative, for another area of Templemore.</p>
            <p eId="para_386">When I left local government in Templemore three years ago following the legislation enacted to abolish the dual mandate, we were told that the plant would be up and running by the end of that year.  However, we still do not have such a plant.  Ancillary works were carried out over 12 months ago, but there is still no sign of the plant.  I do not wish to make a political issue of this and I complimented the Minister of State and the Department for announcing the scheme.  It was announced in 1997 and again in 2002.  An important even is due to take place in 2007 but I am worried that the plant may not be constructed by then.  What is causing the delay?  If there is anything the Minister and the Minister of State can do to speed up the construction, the people of Templemore and the surrounding areas would appreciate it very much.</p>

          <speech by="#NoelAhern" eId="spk_101" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Community,_Rural_and_Gaeltacht_Affairs">
            <from>Mr. N. Ahern</from>
            <p eId="para_387">I thank the Senator for raising this issue.  The Department's water services investment programme 2005-07, published last December, includes 18 major water and sewerage schemes for North Tipperary, with a value of over €90 million.  The Thurles, Roscrea and Newport areas will all benefit from new or upgraded water supply schemes, as will towns and villages in the north west of the county that will be served by the new north-west regional water supply scheme.  In addition, Thurles, Ballina, Nenagh, Newport, Roscrea, Borrisleigh, Cloughjordan, Dromineer, Rearcross and Silvermines can all look forward to new sewerage systems.  The €5.8 million Templemore sewerage scheme is also part of the Department's water services investment programme.</p>
            <p eId="para_388">There are two elements to the Templemore scheme.  The Department approved Templemore Town Council's tender recommendation for the upgrading of the old sewage collection network in 2004, including separation of the foul and storm water sewers in the town.  This allowed the council to deal with the lack of capacity in the network and to resolve the problems caused by both the foul and storm water feeding into and overloading the existing treatment plant.  I understand that these works are now complete.</p>
            <p eId="para_389">The second component of the scheme is the upgrading of the treatment plant and again I can report positive progress. Last February, the Department approved North Tipperary County Council's contract documents for the plant upgrade, which cleared the way for the invitation of tenders from a panel of short-listed contractors.  The closing date for tenders was in September and the council is now examining the bids received with a view to selecting the most economically advantageous tender.  The design, construction and subsequent operation of the upgraded plant were all included in the tender process and this will speed up completion of the project once the contract has been awarded.  The Department is currently awaiting the results of the council's examination of the tenders for the treatment plant.  Funding for the project has been allocated in the investment programme and it can be drawn down from the Department as soon as it is needed by the council.</p>
            <p eId="para_390">I have listened carefully to what the Senator has said, and while the next move is up to North Tipperary County Council, we can anticipate the early appointment of a contractor to build the treatment plant and a quick start to the upgrading works.  This is very much in the remit of the county council.  If the closing date for the tenders was in September, the council must be nearly ready to roll at this stage.  I hope the Senator can use his influence with councillors at local level to speed up the decision on the tenders.  The ball seems to be in their court at this stage.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#NoelCoonan" eId="spk_102">
            <from>Mr. Coonan</from>
            <p eId="para_391">I thank the Minister of State for his reply.  I do not disagree with anything he said, but I would like to point out two aspects. First, I have heard before about closing dates for contractors regarding this scheme.  It has been going on at least since 1991 and we want to get it built as quickly as possible.  Second, the situation in Templemore is unique.  It is a Templemore solution to a Templemore problem, just as there are often Irish solutions to Irish problems.  Planning permission was granted for houses in Templemore with the proviso that one could build them but not live in them until the sewerage plant went up.</p>
            <p eId="para_392">Another issue of great concern is that there are a plethora of treatment plants around Templemore so that developments can go ahead, and that is not entirely satisfactory.  There is a delay, and I accept that the Minister of State is not at the relevant Department.  That gives me the ammunition that I need to go back to the county council, and I thank the Minister of State.</p>

            <p eId="para_393">I presume they got the tenders in on time.  The closing date for tenders is a legal issue, and one cannot slip them in late.  I do not know what is causing the delay but I will make inquires in the Department.  The Senator might also make his inquiries at his end.  We will see what happens.</p>
