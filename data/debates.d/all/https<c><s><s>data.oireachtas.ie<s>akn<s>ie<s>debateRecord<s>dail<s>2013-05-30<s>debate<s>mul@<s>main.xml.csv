#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-05-30 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	0	Parents and people throughout the country are still reacting to the "Prime Time" exposé of behaviour in crèches and the cruelty to children and emotional abuse that was witnessed in the film footage of that programme. Many people are looking for immediate responses as well as medium and short-term responses. The situation has clearly shocked many people across the country. I put it to the Tánaiste that some immediate steps could be taken to respond to the issues raised and enhance the service currently in place, in particular the inspection regime. Yesterday, I mentioned to the Taoiseach five areas that have had no inspectors for the past while, namely, Dublin south city, Sligo-Leitrim, Louth, Cavan and north Monaghan. Can the Tánaiste indicate a specific timeline for the filling of vacancies in those areas where there are no inspectors to carry out any inspection of child care facilities? I am sure he will agree this is unacceptable, so will he confirm that these vacancies will be filled immediately and a timeline will be outlined? In regard to the crèches that were the subject of the RTE investigative programme, will funding be cut from them, given the serious breaches of regulations that were uncovered? Does the Tánaiste find it acceptable that the crèches concerned, in particular those under Garda investigation, should remain open while under investigation? Should their activities be suspended pending the outcome of such investigations or, alternatively, should significant additional safeguards be put in to protect children in those crèches? Would the Tánaiste agree that CCTV cameras should be introduced immediately in all crèches? Currently, two out of three have CCTV in place. I refer to the 50,000 children who are minded in their homes by private childminders. In the original heads of the children first Bill, head 4 did not provide for training, licensing or any kind of inspection regime. Will these be include in the actual Bill? The legislation is a key issue. I have not received specific confirmation in terms of the timeline for the children first Bill - when can we expect it? My understanding is that the heads were published some time ago but the legislation has gone back to the drawing board. I refer to the child and family agency concerning which, again, there is no clear timeline as to when legislation will be published and enacted. Considered objectively, and given the suggested timeline for the legislation, it looks as if that agency will not be established until well into 2014. We need urgent clarification on the legislative area, particularly for the children first legislation and the child and family support agency.

It is completely unacceptable. It is every parent's worse nightmare that the child care facility to which they entrust their children may not be treating those children appropriately. It must be pointed out there are many very good child care service and facilities in this country which operate well. It is clear, however, that some of the operators have let the children and their parents down, particularly so in circumstances where parents are paying a hell of a lot of money to these facilities to mind their children. I spoke with the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Deputy Frances Fitzgerald, this morning. We agree this issue must be addressed with urgency and are determined it will be resolved. In the first instance, the crèche facilities that were the subject of the television programme are now the subject of both HSE and Garda investigations. A number of things must, and will be, done quickly. First, there will be a facility whereby the inspection reports that are made on child care facilities will be published online so that parents can see for the reports for themselves. Second, Deputy Martin asked about the areas where currently there are no inspectors. The intention is that the inspection regime will be managed on a national basis and the Minister has asked Gordon Jeyes to look at ways in which that can be done so that all areas of the country can be inspected properly. A system of registration will be introduced to replace the existing system of notification and this will be done by the child and family support agency. The intention is for that system to be in place within a reasonably short time. A report will be done on the for-profit child care sector and analysis will be made on all inspection reports presented to date to establish what the patterns are and what needs to be done. The issue of qualifications for child care workers is being examined. It is the Minister's view that FETAC level 5 is probably too low and needs to be increased. I appreciate the suggestions Deputy Martin has made. He stated this is an issue we need to resolve and that we must work together to do so. The issue of the inspection regime is being addressed immediately to ensure an inspection regime is in place across the country. In the case of crèches which are not complying with the required standards, the funding can and, I believe, should be cut. In respect of the crèches which are subject to investigation, I hope the investigations are concluded quickly and that the necessary action is taken as a result. I agree that CCTV should be used in crèche facilities. The wider issue of child care provision will be addressed under the registration regime that will be introduced.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-05-30 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	2	I am still unclear on the legislative timelines. The Taoiseach indicated on the Order of Business to our spokesman, Deputy Troy, that the heads of the child and family agency Bill were approved by the Cabinet last November. It is now June and I am not clear as to whether the Bill will be published before the end of July. It may be useful to ask an all-party committee to consider that Bill and the Children First Bill to accelerate their preparation and tease out any issues that may be delaying publication. I do not know whether fundamental issues need to be addressed, but I am not getting a clear timeline on either Bill.

#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-05-30 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	4	I mentioned the 50,000 children who are being minded privately in homes across the country because they were apparently not covered by the initial heads of the Children First Bill. Issues clearly arise in that sector given the breach of trust that has been exposed in the crèches under investigation. The issue of when Garda investigations take place is very serious. I acknowledge, to be fair, that we are not dealing with the types of abuse experienced in other institutions in the past but when allegations were made about individuals in these settings and the Garda commenced a formal investigative process, people were suspended from interacting with children while the investigations were under way. The crèches under investigation should either remain closed while the investigations are ongoing or else additional interventions should be made by the HSE and others to remove any doubt that the children in their care may be vulnerable to emotional abuse or cruelty. The response has to be robust to send a clear message that the kind of behaviour uncovered is unacceptable and has consequences. That in itself would help immediately by sending a wake-up call to every facility, including the many good ones. The response to the events that have been uncovered should signify a watershed in how these unacceptable activities are dealt with.
#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-05-30 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	5	I agree with that absolutely. The incidents shown in the television programme require immediate action and an absolute determination to deal with these unacceptable practices. At a minimum, parents leaving their children in child care facilities need to know they will be safe and not mistreated, and we are determined to put in place a regime that ensures safety and proper treatment. The intention is to publish both Bills this session. Certain policy issues that arose in the Oireachtas committee are being considered. I agree that the Bills could be considered at an early stage and I know the Joint Committee on Health and Children is due to meet on 11 June and intends to bring in the HSE and conduct meetings on what happened and the issues arising from the programme. A way can be found to allow it to also address the heads of the Bills. The Garda investigation has to take its course but I spoke with the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs this morning and we are determined that the investigations will be completed quickly. There will be a firm response to the outcome of those investigations. In respect of continued funding of child care facilities that are found wanting, that funding can be cut and there is a determination to ensure we are not applying taxpayers' money to facilities that are not operating properly. We need to be clear that what was shown on the television programme is utterly unacceptable to the Minister, Deputy Fitzgerald, to me and to the Government. We will deal with the matters arising quickly.
#MaryLouMcDonald	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-party	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-dob	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-05-30 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	6	As the Tánaiste noted, the images shown on the "Prime Time" exposé were unacceptable and people across the board have expressed deep shock. The reality, however, is that we have been here before. This is not the first occasion on which maltreatment in crèche facilities has come to light. Six or seven years ago serious issues were identified and since 2008 problems with under staffing, inadequate supervision and failures in vetting have been identified. As these facts emerged, Governments were appalled, horrified and shocked. They promised speedy reform, the publication of inspection reports, beefed up inspection regimes and a renewed focus on quality, but nothing was done and the responses were far from robust. Children have been let down not only by the operators of these crèches but also by the Government. What we saw on Tuesday night is a direct consequence of the relegation of carers and caring to the second division. I regret to say that in many of the decisions taken by the current Government, the trend of undervaluing and, in some cases, undermining carers and their work has continued.

#MaryLouMcDonald	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-party	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-dob	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-05-30 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	8	Yesterday, the Taoiseach said that the brand image of child care was of the highest standard. I am not sure what he meant by "brand image" but he is part of the same Government that is advertising on its JobBridge website positions for child care workers in organisations, including an advertisement from Giraffe child care, one of the brands associated with this scandal, seeking interns with no experience to work with children for €50 per week. What is that about and how does the Tánaiste square it with his proclaimed commitment to quality and safety for children? State funding should not go to any facility that does not conform to the highest standards of inspection, regulation, qualification and quality care. I note that he is being very careful on this issue. He stated that funding can and should be stopped. We need to hear that funding will be stopped. If he is not prepared to say that clearly, he has no prospect of restoring parents' confidence or protecting the good reputation of the many quality child care providers which operate across the country. I ask him to square the circle for me. How is it that €50 per week for an untrained and unqualified person is appropriate? Why are these jobs advertised on JobBridge and why is he so coy on current and future funding? I ask him to state clearly that funding will be stopped where regulations are breached.

We have a problem that needs to be resolved. It will be resolved and there is an obligation on everybody to work to do so. The Government established a dedicated Department of Children and Youth Affairs to deal with issues associated with children.

Let me be absolutely clear about that. On the issue of inspections, as I stated, work is being done on a national regime for inspections and an analysis is being conducted of the inspections carried out to date. The results of inspections will be published online in order that parents can see exactly what was found. With regard to the Deputy's remark about JobBridge, of the three facilities referred to in the programme, two have never had JobBridge interns, while the third had an intern whose internship finished in April this year. 
#MaryLouMcDonald	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-party	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-dob	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-05-30 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	16	This is not a matter of a political football but one of accountability, good governance and setting the minds of parents at ease. Rather than listening to the same old story, parents must hear a genuine and urgent commitment to ensure quality of care for children. My question on JobBridge was not framed in the past tense. I am asking the Tánaiste about positions that are being advertised on the JobBridge website today. As I stated, these positions pay €50 per week and are for people who do not have qualifications. Why are these posts being advertised on the JobBridge website? How on earth could it be appropriate to do so? It was never appropriate and it is even less appropriate given the outrage and shock the Tánaiste's expressed in response to the "Prime Time" programme.  Sinn Féin welcomed the decision to appoint a Minister for Children and Youth Affairs. However, the Minister has been in place for two and a half years, which is a long time in the lifespan of a child. How many children have completed preschool care in crèches in that period? While I have no doubt the Tánaiste was horrified by Tuesday night's television programme, there is no point expressing horror about breaches of regulations or giving such a clear commitment to proper standards and the safety and protection of children in child care when JobBridge, a Government website, is advertising yellow pack posts which pay €50 per week for child care workers. Our children are worth and deserve more than that and their parents expect better than that.

We are at the point where legislation is about to be introduced. As I indicated to Deputy Martin, the Children First guidelines will be placed on a statutory basis and a regime will be introduced whereby child care facilities will not only have to be notified to the Health Service Executive, as is currently the case, but will have to be registered with the child and family agency, which is in the process of being established. The reports of the inspections will be published and work to prepare for the publication of inspection reports has been under way for some time. This work did not wait for the television programme to be broadcast. Arrangements are also being made for inspections to be carried out nationwide. There is an absolute determination on the part of the Government, in particular, the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, to deal not only with the problems highlighted in the "Prime Time" programme, but also issues that have been highlighted in inspection reports. Nobody should be in any doubt about that.  On the issue of accountability, as I stated, the Joint Committee on Health and Children is due to hold hearings on 11 June, at which it will hear evidence from officials from the Health Service Executive, those involved in child care provision and the Minister. The issues arising from the legislation can also be discussed. We will have full accountability and transparency in this matter because parents and especially the children attending child care facilities deserve no less.
#ClareDaly	unknown-#ClareDaly-party	unknown-#ClareDaly-dob	unknown-#ClareDaly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-05-30 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	22	It would be wrong to allow this occasion to pass without registering the treachery that was committed yesterday by the Government, in particular, the Labour Party, in ramming through the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest Bill. The Tánaiste is a former ITGWU official and member of a party that emerged from battles over the right to join a trade union of one's choice that brought this city to a standstill. That he would support a Bill designed to threaten workers that should they dare to say "No" again, they would be met by further cuts is almost unbelievable and a new low for a party that we did not believe could sink any lower. It is a peculiar form of democracy, where one speaks of free engagement and negotiation, when the Government effectively offers workers a gun and tells them to either shoot themselves or it will blow their heads off. This approach is becoming an all too common feature of the Labour Party in government. It is exactly the same position it took with the hated home tax when it told people to hand over the money or it would forcibly deduct it from them with penalties. The Labour Party has become the promoter of dictatorial legislation because it knows it has lost the battle for the hearts and minds of ordinary people and does not have a mandate for the policies it is trying to ram through. Where is the Government's emergency legislation in the public interest to deal with the multinational corporations which only pay 2% taxation or the massive salaries and bonuses of bankers? It is nowhere to be seen because the Labour Party is not only complicit in these attacks but at the forefront of them.  The Bill passed by the Government last night goes far beyond a wage cut. It undermines fundamental trade union principles, namely, the right to negotiate one's terms and conditions of employment and the right to join a trade union. The Government has denied these rights to a section of the public service and gone even further by introducing enabling legislation that will allow a future Minister to change the terms and conditions of public sector employees. The Tánaiste and his colleagues, the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, Deputy Rabbitte, and Deputies Keaveney and Wall earned their living from the trade union movement. Half the Deputies opposite used trade union members' funds to get elected before betraying them in this House by introducing anti-union legislation.

From that experience I learned that the first thing any member of a trade union wants is his or her job. It cannot have escaped the Deputy's attention that this Government is engaged in protecting employment. In this instance, it is seeking to protect employment within the public service. The second thing one must have before one comes to address the issue of pay is the means to actually pay people. This country was on the edge of bankruptcy when the Government took office. Since we came to power we have been obliged to work to restore the country's finances in order that we will be in a position to pay the wages and salaries of those who work in the public service and to ensure that public services will be maintained. As the Deputy knows, the approach we have taken has been to negotiate with the trade unions. However, those unions rejected the offer that was put on the table in the first instance and that is why we entered into a second round of negotiations. I compliment Mr. Kieran Mulvey and the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Howlin, on the work they did in negotiating settlements with each of the individual unions. Pay reductions will be on a scaled basis. This means that the core pay of those on under €65,000 per annum will not be reduced. Pay above that amount will be reduced on a scaled basis. We are of the view that where pay reductions are necessary, they must be introduced on a graduated basis and those on the highest levels of pay must bear the greatest burden. Legislating in respect of multinational corporations and the payment of tax must be done on an international basis. When I attended the ministerial meeting of the OECD yesterday, I signed our commitment to the international effort being made to deal with the issue of tax avoidance - either by individuals or companies - on an international scale. We support the efforts in which the OECD is engaging in order to deal with this problem. In the course of our current Presidency of the European Union, we have managed to secure agreement on a regulation to place a cap on the remuneration of bankers on an EU-wide basis.

Perhaps it is because he has been hanging around so much with those in Fine Gael that he has become almost indistinguishable from them. It has not escaped my notice that 87,000 people have been forced to leave this country, that we have massive levels of unemployment and that last month was the third worst for retail sales since the crisis began. It is beyond me how taking €300 million out of the pockets of public sector workers and millions more from homeowners in the form of a property tax is going to lead to growth and benefit the private sector. The Tánaiste referred to freely negotiating. If the Government freely negotiated this deal, then why does it not let workers vote on it? What the Government has done is to introduce legislation which will have a similar - if not greater - impact as the deal in the event that public sector workers freely reject it. Are there any lengths to which the Tánaiste will not go in order to protect the wealthy in this society from a fair system of taxation?

I hope it will not escape the Deputy's notice that we are making some modest progress in this regard. The quarterly national household survey - which is being published about now - will show that during the past year the private sector has created over 2,000 jobs per month. That is in stark contrast with the 250,000 jobs that were lost in the three years before we took office. The survey will also show that, for the first time since we came to power, the unemployment has dropped below 14% and stands at 13.7%. That is still too high, particularly in view of the fact that so many young people are unemployed.

That plan will be part of the youth guarantee that has been agreed at European Union level. On Tuesday, when I was negotiating the European Union budget for the next seven years, I proposed that the money which is available to address youth unemployment and which will have an impact in this country should be frontloaded in 2014 and 2015 in order that we might deal with this critical problem on a more urgent basis.

One relates to an EU-Israel aviation agreement, in which respect significant issues merit debate in plenary session as well as full transparency.

#MaryLouMcDonald	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-party	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-dob	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-05-30 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	99	I agree, particularly regarding the EU-Israel aviation agreement. We should not be party to such an agreement, as it rewards Israel despite that country's continual flouting of international law and its ongoing blockade of Gaza. In 2001, the Israelis destroyed Yasser Arafat International Airport in Gaza. Run by the Palestinian Authority, it was opened in 1998, then bombed by the Israeli army. Ironically, it was built with funding from EU member states and others to the tune of $86 million. In this context, it is extraordinary that the Government would ask the Dáil to approve such an agreement on the nod and without debate. Let me state clearly that I do not believe that the Dáil or the State on behalf of our people should in any circumstance support such an agreement and give a pass to Israel and its brazenly illegal maltreatment of Gaza and Palestinians. To ask us to do so without debate is extraordinary.

As Minister for Social Protection in arguably the most challenging economic period this country has ever faced, I have operated on simple and enduring principles, namely, welfare must be there for those who need it and the Government must do everything it can to help people back to work. In short, welfare must be both a safety net and a springboard. To that end, my focus has been on transforming the Department from the passive benefits provider of old to one that actively assists people back to work, training or education. In this legislation, I am continuing these necessary and important structural reforms of the social welfare system. The Department of Social Protection accounts for €4 in every €10 spent each day by the Government. As a result, the Department has been obliged to play its part in the effort to get the deficit under control. However, while making savings in social welfare expenditure has been forced upon us, the reductions have been targeted with the objective of making the system fairer, focused and fit for purpose. I will start with fairness. Many families in Ireland depend solely on social welfare to provide for all of their needs. This is the reason the Government, in successive budgets, has protected core social welfare payment rates. In a time of unprecedented crisis, it is standing by those who are most vulnerable and international research proves it. Compared with other EU countries, Ireland's system of social transfers is the most effective in reducing poverty. Consequently, protecting core rates makes absolute sense from a social justice perspective. However, it also makes sense economically as at a time when consumer confidence remains depressed and people remain reluctant to spend, the €20.3 billion social welfare budget is a crucial injection of cash into every corner and region of the economy. As I have stated recently in several forums, the European Union must shift its approach from austerity only if the Union is to recover and, thankfully, I believe this message now is beginning to seep through. What does this mean in an Irish context? Given that Ireland is still in a bailout, it has little choice but to observe the conditions of the troika until it again is able to fund itself on the financial markets at reasonable rates. This means further corrections in the forthcoming budget, with the ratio of taxation measures and expenditure savings still to be determined and, again, my Department will be expected to play its part. However, I return to my earlier points about the crucial importance of protecting the most vulnerable and the value of social welfare expenditure as a Keynesian automatic stabiliser. The Government's challenge is to create the room for an economic and social dividend, while respecting the need to meet deficit targets and exit the bailout. The proceeds of the promissory note deal must be put to the most effective use, to invest in jobs and give people hope. The reality is that job creation is the single most effective way of reducing social welfare expenditure. This year, as part of its Pathways to Work strategy, my Department will spend more than €1 billion on work, training and education places that will benefit approximately 85,000 people. In addition, under the pathways strategy, the Department continues to roll out its Intreo activation service for jobseekers, as well as its new, revamped and reformed social welfare offices. The crucial need for the pathways strategy is highlighted by ESRI research on jobless households. This research showed that during the height of the boom between 2004 and 2007, the share of households defined as jobless shockingly recorded a double-digit increase to 15%. It is hardly believable that this happened at the height of the boom. In stark contrast, the average across the eurozone in 2007 was just below 10%. Even though Ireland was experiencing a boom, its figure increased to 15% and that this was allowed happen during a period of such prosperity is the single most shocking thing about the figures. The current Government has greater ambition for those citizens who are unfortunate enough to be unemployed. It views each and every individual person on the live register or otherwise distant from the labour market as an untapped resource and a future employee who will participate in the rebuilding of this country. This ambition is the reason the Government is moving from a passive to an active welfare state. In addition to deep-rooted reforms, I have prioritised efforts to combat social welfare fraud.Since becoming Minister, I have travelled to numerous local offices throughout the country and spoken to the front-line staff who deal with and support customers on a daily basis. The overwhelming message they have given me is that social welfare fraud is not a victimless crime, and that those who defraud the system do so at the expense of the vast majority of genuine customers who rely on social welfare income supports, and that includes the vast majority of our retirees and pensioners. I want to thank those staff for their honest feedback, their invaluable insights and the work they do on a daily basis. This Bill will give legislative effect to a number of important amendments to the social welfare code in relation to PRSI, jobseekers' payments, and the prevention of fraud. It will also make amendments to the pensions code in relation to occupational pension provision. In his Budget Statement last December, the Minister for Finance announced a number of measures to broaden the income base for PRSI in order to ensure the stability of the Social Insurance Fund. This is so that the fund can continue to pay pensions for those who are retired or widowed and for short-term benefits for those who become ill or unemployed.  One of the PRSI base-broadening measures provided for in this Bill extends liability for PRSI contributions in 2013 to certain civil and public sector workers who pay modified rates of PRSI contributions and who also have income from a trade or profession. They will now be liable to a PRSI contribution of 4% on any income arising from a trade or profession. In recent years, reforms have been made to the one-parent family scheme. The strongest protection against poverty is decent, secure and fairly paid work, and the idea that the welfare system must be a springboard is especially true when it comes to people who are parenting on their own. Although full-time work may not be feasible for parents of very young children, we believe that supporting parents to participate in the labour market once their children have reached an appropriate age will improve their own economic and social circumstances. In the long term, it will be best for them and for their families. The reforms introduced in budgets 2011, 2012 and 2013 recognise parental choice with regard to the care of young children while at the same time having an expectation that parents will not remain outside the workforce indefinitely. Last year, I said that I would proceed with the measures to reduce the age limit to seven years only if a credible commitment on the delivery of a robust and comprehensive system of child care was forthcoming.  I will be frank. Although I was very pleased to secure an additional €14 million in the budget to fund an extra 6,000 after-school child care places this year, the comprehensive system we need is not yet in place. I am now proposing, therefore, reforms to the jobseeker's allowance scheme to ease the transition of former recipients of one-parent family payment with young children to the scheme.  Jobseeker's transition will be a targeted version of the jobseeker's allowance scheme, which provides means-tested financial assistance and activation supports. Recipients of jobseeker's transition will be required to engage fully with the Department's activation process. Crucially, however, they will be exempted for a transitional period from the full conditionality of the jobseeker's allowance scheme, specifically the criteria that jobseekers must be available for and genuinely seeking full-time work. This will allow the lone parents in question to seek part-time work rather than full-time work if this better suits their family circumstances. They will also be able to access existing child care supports to enable them to engage in education and training programmes. The transitional period will last, provided the individual continues to satisfy entitlement conditions for one-parent family payment, other than the relevant age, until their youngest child reaches 14 years of age. I wish to speak about family income supplement, FIS. I will be amending the FIS scheme so that former one-parent family payment recipients in receipt of FIS will have it increased in light of the termination of their one-parent family payment due to the age of the youngest child. Once family income supplement is awarded, it is normally paid for a 52-week period, as Deputies are aware, and it is not affected by any changes in circumstances in that period, such as a change in weekly income. I will be introducing regulations shortly to enable entitlement to FIS to be reassessed during the 52-week period to take account of such a loss of the one-parent family payment. These reforms recognise the difficulty of parenting on one's own and will enable people parenting alone with children of primary school age to qualify for a jobseeker's payment. They represent a compassionate, supportive and effective approach to helping lone parents' transition to work and provide for their families' long-term best interests, particularly their children. I am introducing changes regarding jobseeker's benefit and jobseeker's allowance to allow for persons working as retained firefighters to be exempted from certain conditions to enable them access these schemes. Since 1972, the social welfare system has essentially subsidised the State's cost of providing a nationwide part-time fire service but no legislative base was ever provided to support this position, which led to uncertainty and difficulty at times for individual firefighters. I am now bringing clarity to this situation in recognition of the social good work of retained firefighters and the invaluable service they provide to communities throughout our country outside the big cities with permanent fire brigades. A retained firefighter who is on call will be deemed to satisfy the availability conditionality. This will mean that retained firefighters will no longer be disallowed on the grounds of availability for the days they are on call. However, they will still have to satisfy the genuinely seeking work and availability conditionality for the days they are not on call. These changes recognise the vital service that these workers provide to local communities. That is an issue that has been raised in the House on and off for the past 40 years. I am delighted to be able to legislate for it and to recognise the invaluable work of retained firefighters. I mentioned earlier the issue of welfare fraud. My view on this is simple: such fraud undermines confidence in the entire system and is unfair to genuine claimants and the taxpayers who fund the system in the knowledge that it is there for them when they need it.  Welfare fraud is a serious crime and the Department is doing everything it can to crack down on people who abuse the system. We have begun the phased introduction of the public services card with key security features, including a photograph and signature, which will be used to authenticate the identity of individuals, thus helping to reduce fraud and error in the social welfare system. By close of business today, we will have issued over 230,000 public services cards. Under the existing legislative provisions, there is a mandatory requirement for new applicants to allow for his or her photograph and signature to be captured and reproduced in electronic format for purposes of a PPSN allocation, public services card and claims for social welfare benefits. I will be proposing a change to provide for the introduction of a condition for existing
recipients of social welfare payment that the person must satisfy the Department as to his or her identity, including allowing for electronic capture of photograph and signature. I am introducing a number of changes to occupational pension provision in this Bill. These changes give effect to the recommendations of the critical review undertaken on the Pensions Board and the Pensions Ombudsman as part of the Public Service Reform Plan.I am also introducing a number of other amendments to the Pensions Act to give powers to the Pensions Board to wind up a pension scheme in certain circumstances, provide for the disclosure of information on a proposal by the Pensions Board to restructure scheme benefits and to provide for an appeal to the High Court on a point of law against a direction by the Pensions Board to restructure a defined benefit pension scheme, provide the Pensions Board with a right of appeal to the High Court to seek compliance with a directive to either restructure scheme benefits or a direction to wind-up a scheme, change the fines regime that applies to personal retirement savings accounts and amend the terms of office of the Pensions Ombudsman. The changes I am bringing forward today will strengthen governance and regulation of occupational pensions and give consumers greater input into pensions policy. They will reform the governance structure of the Pensions Board by distinguishing between the operational oversight and the policy advisory functions. The Pensions Board will be renamed the Pensions Authority to ensure public awareness and clarity of its role and functions and distinguish it from the policy advisory activities. The chief executive of the authority will be known as the pensions regulator. I am introducing changes to the Pensions Act to give the Pensions Board power to wind-up a scheme in certain circumstances. I am very aware of the serious funding challenge facing pension schemes. It is expected that most defined benefit schemes will be in a position to meet the funding requirement by the end of 2023. However, the trustees and-or employer of some schemes may decide not to adopt or not to comply with the requirement of the funding standard, and in such cases the board may have to direct the trustees either to restructure scheme benefits or wind-up the scheme. The power to wind-up is considered a measure of last resort. There was an expectation that I would be bringing forward in this Bill changes to the manner in which assets are distributed on the wind-up of a pension scheme. This is a very complex and sensitive issue and one which requires careful consideration before any change is made to the current provision. My officials have engaged with representatives of stakeholders and have also engaged external consultants to advise on the matter. In light of the recent decision by the European Court of Justice in the Waterford Crystal case, the Government recognises the need for a comprehensive policy and legislative response that addresses the range of issues involved. We have been in intensive discussions with the Attorney General and her staff. In addition, it is considered necessary to await the submissions of funding proposals from pension scheme trustees as these will give a more comprehensive and in-depth picture of the funding position of defined benefit pension schemes. I will be tabling two amendments to the Bill on Committee Stage to allow for the expansion of the penalty rates regime for jobseeker's allowance, jobseeker's benefit and supplementary welfare allowance and a measure to enhance powers in the area of overpayments recovery. I will now outline the main provisions of the Bill. Section 1 provides for the Short Title, collective citations, construction and any necessary commencements. Section 2 defines a number of common terms used in this part of the Bill. Section 3 replaces references to training which is provided or approved by FÁS that are contained in the Social Welfare Consolidation Act in light of the new structural arrangements for the provision of State training. Section 4 amends the definition of a "special contributor" which is used for the purposes of the special collection system operated by the Department of Social Protection for the collection of certain PRSI contributions. Section 5 is a technical amendment. Section 6 extends liability for PRSI contributions to modified rate PRSI contributors, that is, PRSI Class B, C and D contributors, who also have income from a trade or profession. This PRSI contribution will be at the rate of 4% of relevant emoluments and income, but will not count towards determining entitlement to social insurance benefits. Section 7 provides for a number of amendments to the Social Welfare Consolidation Act 2005 to take account of the provisions of the Civil Partnership and Certain Rights and Obligations of Cohabitants Act 2010. Section 8 amends the conditions of entitlement applying to the partial capacity benefit scheme to enable decisions relating to whether or not a claimant has a restriction on his or her capacity for work and the level of that restriction to be appealed to the social welfare appeals office. Section 9 provides for changes to the jobseeker's benefit and jobseeker's allowance schemes to exempt persons who are working as retained firefighters from certain conditionality due to the nature of that employment. Section 10 provides for amendments to the jobseeker's allowance scheme to cater for the transition of persons to that scheme who no longer qualify for one-parent family payment due to their youngest child reaching specified age thresholds. Section 11 extends the identity authentication requirements that currently apply to new applicants for a social welfare payment, a personal public service number or a public services card to existing recipients of social welfare payments. Under these requirements a person will be disqualified from continuing to receive a social welfare payment where he or she fails to satisfy the Minister as to his or her identity. Section 12 provides that a working director with a shareholding of 50% or more in a company will not be regarded as being insurable as an employed contributor in that company. Section 13 clarifies the operation of the income disregard which is used for the purposes of the rent and mortgage interest supplement scheme. Section 14 extends the list of bodies that are authorised to use the personal public service number for the purposes of carrying out transactions with members of the public and for sharing personal information and exchanging relevant data for the purposes of carrying out those transactions. The new bodies being included are the Insolvency Service of Ireland, Quality and Qualifications Ireland and payment service providers who have been authorised by the Revenue Commissioners to collect the local property tax. Section 15, together with the Schedule to the Bill, is a technical amendment dealing with obsolete references and typographical errors. Section 16 provides for amendments to the Civil Registration Act 2004 to allow for the provision of index information from the registers of births, deaths, marriages and civil partnerships to the Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht to facilitate access to this index information. Index information in relation to adoptions and stillbirths is excluded. Section 17 defines the term "Principal Act". Section 18 inserts a definition of the pensions council which is being provided for in the new section 26B of the Pensions Act 1990. The Pensions Act was amended in 2009 to allow for payroll evidence to be admissible to prove an offence and to increase the term of imprisonment for conviction on indictment for an offence of failure to remit pension contributions to an occupational pension scheme to deal with a very largescale problem in the construction sector at that time. Sections 19 to 21 apply this offences regime to personal retirement savings accounts. Sections 22 to 25, inclusive, and section 30 provide for structural changes to the Pensions Board by giving effect to the recommendations of the critical review undertaken on the Pensions Board. This critical review was undertaken as part of the public service reform plan. These sections and the details contained on the following pages will come into effect later this year when they are the subject of a commencement order. Section 26 amends section 50 of the Pensions Act 1990 to provide for the disclosure of information where the board proposes to issue a direction to restructure scheme benefits and for an appeal to the High Court by such persons as may be prescribed on a point of law on a direction from the Pensions Board to restructure a pension scheme. Section 27 inserts a new section 50B in the Pensions Act 1990 to provide the Pensions Board with the power to wind-up a pension scheme in circumstances where a scheme is underfunded and the trustees and employer are not in a position to adopt a funding proposal, or where the trustee of a scheme fails to comply with a section 50 direction to restructure scheme benefits. Section 28 inserts a new section 50C in the Pensions Act 1990 to provide the Pensions Board with the power to apply to the High Court to seek an order requiring a person to comply with a direction to wind up a pension scheme or to restructure scheme benefits. A critical review of the Office of the Pensions Ombudsman was also carried out as part of the work of the steering group chaired by Mr. Richard Hinz of the World Bank. It is expected that the recommendation of this review of the Office of the Pensions Ombudsman will be included in a future Bill. In the meantime, and in order to facilitate any future proposal to merge the Office of the Pensions Ombudsman with the Office of the Financial Services Ombudsman, section 29 extends the age on which the Pensions Ombudsman must vacate that office from 67 to 70 years and allows for the appointment of the Pensions Ombudsman for a period of up to six years, rather than a set term of six years. The Government continues to invest heavily in social protection for citizens in spite of the economic circumstances in which we find ourselves. That is only right and just. However, I am also ensuring that the money we spend on social protection, which is contributed by those at work in taxes and PRSI, is spent on those in genuine need, and in a positive way that encourages and helps them to return to work. This is not a one-way street. The obligations of the State must also be balanced by the responsibilities of citizens. Seeing those who are capable of working languish on welfare is not something we should ever support. Seeing young people, with all their creativity, talent and energy, languishing on social welfare is not part of my vision for Irish society. Hence, my strong political bias towards work and the policies to promote it, such as a commitment to full employment, activation, investment and skills training, not only for Ireland but for the European Union. This Bill is another positive step on the road towards an active, supportive and engaged social protection system. I commend the Bill to the House and I look forward to an informed debate and to hearing the views of Members on the measures contained in it.
#WillieODea	unknown-#WillieODea-party	unknown-#WillieODea-dob	unknown-#WillieODea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-05-30 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	148	Naturally, there are measures in the Bill with which I agree. Most of the provisions of the Bill on the social welfare side are fairly uncontroversial and unexceptional and are designed to provide administrative fixes. Some of them adopt proposals that have already been made to the Government which make a certain amount of sense and more of them simply implement in a legislative form measures which have already been announced by the Minister for Finance. My main criticism of the Bill is not what it contains but, rather, what it does not contain. The Minister will be aware that the system that applies to a defined benefit pension scheme when it is wound up is insupportable. What happens is there is not enough money to pay every scheme member what he or she was promised when he or she joined and paid into it and the law states that whatever money is there must be taken in the first instances to ensure that existing pensioners get 100% of what they have been promised and if there is anything left over, it is to be divided amongst the workers and those whose pensions have been deferred. This is gravely unjust. I can quote instances of this. The current rules mean, for example, that a retired chief executive on a pension of €100,000, €150,000 or €200,000 is guaranteed that while somebody who is weeks from retirement, and who has worked in the company and contributed to the pension scheme for 30 years, might finish up with nothing simply for the sake of a few weeks. Proposals have been made from civic society across the board to the Government that the system should be changed. Proposals have been made, for example, from ICTU, employers' bodies such as IBEC, the group representing pension schemes, the Irish Association of Pension Funds, IAPF, and actuarial bodies. There is consensus across society that this should be changed and it is high time to change it, particularly in the present situation where it is estimated that over 90% of defined benefit pension schemes are in deficit. All of these bodies across society recognise the inequity, or should I say "iniquity", of the present system and the urgent compelling need for reform. A survey carried out recently by the IAPF showed overwhelming support for the notion that the priority list should be changed, that there should be some equity brought into the system. The OECD recently issued a report on the Irish pensions system for which the Government forked out €130,000 of taxpayers' money. In that report, the OECD made a compelling case for changing the priority list. They gave the Minister her first opportunity to implement a key element of their report in the introduction of this Bill and she has failed to do so. Mr. Jerry Moriarty, who is spokesperson for the IAPF, stated on a number of occasions, along with others, that the rules should be amended for defined benefit pension schemes to give enhanced benefit to those still in employment rather than the current absolute weighting given to those already in receipt of their pensions. He summed up the position well, stating, "It is simply not fair that those nearing retirement age must suffer to such a degree by ... having their pension cut in half [or worse], while a former colleague who has just retired receives his full benefit for life". Trustees recognise that in an ideal world everybody should get that to which they are entitled, but where 90% or, perhaps, more of those pension schemes are in deficit, some of which have already announced their intention to wind-up and others of which no doubt will follow, we are not living in a perfect world and it is not possible to pay everybody his or her entitlement. Why pay one half everything to the exclusion of the other half? Mr. Moriarty went on to state, "Add to that the super-cautious funding requirements for schemes currently in place, and employers are more likely to be deterred from making the significant contributions required to maintain current benefits". There is a rumour that the liability for a defined benefit scheme will be placed firmly on the employer. This is a further deterrent to employers to continue to fund retirement benefit schemes. Interestingly, Mr. Moriarty, in 2011, stated that things were changing, they had spoken to the Minister and she promised she would change the system. I have been told directly by IBEC that, at a meeting in October 2011, the Minister promised faithfully to reform the priority order. Unfortunately, she reneged on that promise and, instead, set up a consultation process. The consultation process was to consult about something she had already promised, but that provided only a temporary respite because those whom she consulted were also of the opinion that the priority order should be changed. Accordingly, I am informed, in September 2012, the Minister again solemnly promised to change the priority order. The Bill represents yet another breach of promise. The promises, like Billy Bunter's postal order, are always made but never delivered. It is disingenuous, self-serving, outrageous and cynical that the Minister should come in here today, after that period of consultation and after making all those specific promises, and refer to the issue as "complex" - which it was when the Minister gave her promise in 2011 - "sensitive" - which, I presume, it was then too - and needing "careful consideration", and that she must get advice from stakeholders.All the advice has been one way and there has been plenty of time for consideration. The Government has deliberately created an impression in the minds of the pension industry and potential recipients that it would rectify this injustice but it has failed to do so. It is particularly cynical to seek to hide behind the decision in the Waterford Crystal case, which has nothing at all to do with it. That case does not require the Government to prevaricate and delay further in this vital reform. The Waterford Crystal case indicates that when both a company and the company pension scheme become insolvent or go into liquidation, the State would have to pony up in a defined benefit pension. I hope that in the vast majority of cases where these pension schemes will wind up, the company will not go into liquidation, so the Waterford Crystal case does not apply at all. In any case the Waterford Crystal case is about who pays but what we are talking about is the priority order in which the fund is applied for payment. The Minister is well aware of the vital necessity of making this necessary change before 30 June. This date is critical because as a result of new rules introduced by the Government which make it more difficult for pension schemes to survive and which will make many schemes wind up if they cannot survive. Many of them cannot and will not submit a restructuring programme by 30 June to show how they will be brought back to solvency. The Minister knows and recognises this explicitly in legislation because, as she mentioned in her speech, the explanatory memorandum indicates this inserts a new section 50B into the Pensions Act 1990 to provide the Pensions Board with the power to wind up a pension scheme in circumstances where a scheme is under-funded and the trustees and employer are not in a position to adopt a funding proposal, or where the trustee of a scheme fails to comply with a section 50 direction to restructure scheme benefits. In other words, the people who drafted this legislation and the Minister envisage that there will be a number of wind-ups because people will not be able to meet the onerous requirements by 30 June. Time will tell if I am right or wrong but tens of thousands of workers already face closure of pension schemes and a change in the priority order would help them to salvage some of those pensions. I am referring to active employees and deferred pensioners. By putting off reform yet again, the Minister is, unfortunately, condemning those people to penury. I have come across concrete examples in this regard and I will come back to them. After 30 June, if a pension scheme winds up or cannot meet onerous funding requirements and provide a solution, the chief executive of a company - who may have a full pension of €100,000, €150,000 or €200,000 - will be fully protected but a 64-year-old worker who is weeks short of retirement may be left with no pension at all. As late as last weekend I had two groups who called to see me in my office in Limerick. One consisted of deferred pensioners from a defined benefit pension scheme which has already announced that it is winding up. The other consisted of investors in a defined benefit pension scheme which is almost certain to wind up, although it has not officially announced it. The first group consisted of three women in their 50s who took early retirement on the basis of a calculated pension of between €22,000 per year and €24,000 per year. As a result of the wind-up, with senior people getting up to €100,000 because they have already retired, the women are getting between €4,500 per annum and €4,800 per annum. That is a scandal and there is no excuse whatever to leave that unaddressed, particularly in view of the Minister's very specific commitments in this regard. This is the Social Welfare and Pensions (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill and the second part of it is concerned with pensions. I wonder if it should be called a pensions Bill at all as what is there in the Bill about pensions? There is a decision that could have a major impact on the real lives of people coming to see me, and they will be going to the media, but if it is avoided, what will the pension section of the Bill deal with? It deals with such monumentally important matters as changing the name of the Pensions Board to the pensions authority. How extraordinary and radical is that? Another dramatic, radical and far-reaching change will alter the title of the chief executive, who will now be known as the pension regulator. My goodness. The change to the number of people on the board is welcome. The Bill proposes to set up another quango, known as the pensions council, to advise the board. The most far-reaching, dramatic, Earth-shattering and monumental change of all is to allow the pensions ombudsman hold office for up to six years instead of for a fixed period of six years. We have the time, inclination and ingenuity to introduce these radical, dramatic and life-changing matters but the one measure that would have an effect on people's lives has been deliberately avoided. To use an historical analogy, the Minister is fiddling while people's pensions are about to burn. The Cantillon column in The Irish Times of 23 May 2013 is relevant, although I am not singling out this newspaper as I could quote various sources that have commented adversely on the decision to avoid the central issue faced by the Government. The column in question argues that the pensions section of the Bill essentially contains "administrative" fixes and that none has the capacity to fundamentally alter somebody's financial circumstances, although the priority order does. I could not have put it better myself. The column went on to state that the "Government is looking for time but this is the second time it has pulled back on the issue, and some workers do not have that luxury". The article argues that by the time the Government acts, it will have no way of recovering these lost pensions, which is the issue in a nutshell. Fundamental reform in pensions is not the only element missing from the Bill. There is no mention of the self-employed. We have discussed at length through questions, committees and in the public domain the notion of extending social benefits to the self-employed. There have been reports, articles, speeches and suggestions but there has been no action. I have read the reports and I am aware of how much this would cost. We are talking about the self-employed, and such people may want to be in a position to get jobseeker's or illness benefit in the event of a business folding or not doing well. They should know in advance what is the price of this and there should be a choice in paying that price. An issue that deters people from setting up a business is the notion that if a person is self-employed, he or she will get no social welfare no matter what. The Minister may indicate that, technically, a person who has been self-employed and who does not have means or assets when a business folds should be entitled to jobseeker's allowance. It is a legal entitlement to seek that. Many social welfare officers are making it so difficult that the word has got out that it is practically impossible to get the benefit.This is most unfair and should be sorted out. It is high time we faced up to the notion of allowing these people, if they so wish, to purchase further benefits. What this country desperately needs at present, in view of the fact that more than 400,000 people are still unemployed and 200,000 people a day are emigrating, not counting all of the people being taken on to schemes who therefore no longer appear unemployed, is to encourage people to create jobs for themselves and, hopefully, for others. The Bill does not address pension coverage. According to the Pensions Board only 54% of people in the workforce have pension coverage. If we take it that 90% have coverage in the public sector, then pension coverage in the private sector is extremely low. The national pensions framework published by the previous Government in 2010 cites the examples of the hotel and restaurant sector where pension coverage is only 23% and the wholesale and retail trade where pension coverage is only 36%. Independent consumer research carried out on behalf of the Pensions Board indicates almost eight out of ten people who do not contribute said the State pension would not meet their needs in retirement. Although employers are obliged by law to offer employees access to a pension, independent consumer research shows that 43% of those interviewed had not been offered access and of these, 93% had never asked the employer about access to a pension. I suppose they dare not. A key issue is how to improve coverage. Among OECD countries only Ireland and New Zealand do not have a compulsory pension saving. Nowhere can I find in anything stated, proposed or done by the Government a move towards establishing a pensions structure which is financially sustainable and socially adequate. Fundamental questions such as this have not been faced up to by the Government. I welcome some of the social welfare aspects of the Bill. I acknowledge the change in the law to assist the position of part-time firefighters. They have been making representations for many years and I regret previous Governments did not accede to them. It is a positive move which I acknowledge and appreciate. The Bill includes a provision which gives people the right in the case of refusal of partial capacity benefits to appeal to the social welfare appeals office. This is an administrative improvement. I do not know how much difference it will make but it is a step in the right direction. I welcome the measures to tighten identity authentication requirements, although a certain sensitivity will have to be shown to old age pensioners and people in receipt of disability benefits. I also welcome the change in the family income support regulations but I must ask the Minister whether it will be confined to lone parents who will avail of the transition measures. Will it apply generally? There has been quite a lot of discussion and we have had many representations about the serious anomaly in the system whereby family income support is calculated at the beginning of the year and if one's circumstances change drastically, for the better or worse, the amount remains fixed for 52 weeks. I always thought the reason for this is because it would be administratively difficult to recalculate it in the event of a change of circumstances, but now it seems to be possible in the case of lone parents. Will it be confined to lone parents or will it be applicable generally? I ask the Minister to address this when she replies. Section 6 of the Bill extends liability for PRSI to people who pay modified contributions and also have income from emoluments, a trade or a profession. I realise people in the public sector would have had to have joined before 1995 to be in receipt of modified contributions so this may be applicable to a limited number of people but it will apply to pension payment. I find objectionable the further provision in the section that one pays 4% on one's private income but receives nothing for it. The great United States of America was founded on a revolution with the slogan "No taxation without representation". Here, people are being asked to pony up PRSI contributions but are told they will receive nothing in return. I object to this. I welcome the improvement, such as it is, outlined in section 10 of the Bill with regard to lone parents but there is an irony at the heart of the matter. I realise the previous Government proposed the change whereby the age of the qualifying child would reduce further and further and more and more people would be excluded from lone parent's allowance. It might be time to reconsider this in light of the poverty figures in the country and the fact that according to the statistics and percentages lone parents are one of the most vulnerable groups in the country to poverty. A huge percentage of lone parents live on the margins; I do not have the figures with me but I was looking at them recently. In her opening statement the Minister stated we must encourage people to get out and work. I do not see how lone parents will be encouraged to go out and work by the Government reducing, as it has, the amount of money they can earn while working. I certainly do not see how they can be encouraged to go out to work if they are put on jobseeker's allowance when their child reaches a certain age. Many of them take up part-time jobs which help bring them back to the workforce, but those put on jobseeker's allowance because of the change in the age of the child will not be able to work because every euro earned will be taken from their jobseeker's allowance. It is a euro for a euro means test. Rather than encouraging people-----

I am right that people on lone parent's allowance can earn a certain amount without the allowance being affected and then the allowance is reduced in stages as the income increases. My strong impression and information is that if people in receipt of a means tested jobseeker's allowance have any outside income earnings the allowance is reduced euro for euro. There are disregards if one's spouse earns but not on one's direct income. The Civil Service officials are shaking their heads. If there is a disregard for people in receipt of jobseeker's allowance I will bet my bottom dollar it is nowhere near the disregard which applies to lone parents so the point stands. There was a big commitment in both Government parties' election manifestoes, and in the programme for Government, to combating child poverty. I wonder how one can really combat child poverty by discouraging lone parents from going out to work, reducing child benefit, taxing maternity benefit, increasing prescription charges and drug payment scheme thresholds, abolishing the cost of education allowance, abolishing the PRSI allowance for the low paid people, and putting property tax on social welfare recipients. I do not see how one can combat child poverty in this way. I agree with Karen Kiernan, the director of One Family, who stated single parents are reeling from the cuts in the budget which saw the poorest families and children becoming ever poorer as a direct result of ill thought out changes.There is no room there for congratulations.  I welcome the general provision in section 16, which facilitates online searching of the index of births, marriages and civil partnerships. I am not sure why it excludes adoptions and stillbirths, but I am sure there is a pretty good reason for it.

My main point is that the section arises from the Civil Registration Act 2004. The Minister will be aware that that Act was amended by the Civil Registration Act 2012. This legislation enables secular bodies to solemnise weddings legally. I recall that, at the time, Senator Bacik was involved in drafting it and the Bill was generally supported on all sides of this House. The Minister took, and got, a good deal of credit for it but the Act is not working. The Humanist Association has been in touch with me, and I am sure with others, to say that it received 600 enquiries in the first three months of this year about facilitating humanist ceremonies. The association is not able to meet the demand, however, because the General Register Office, which is to accredit people who solemnise these marriages, has so far only given one accreditation. Eleven applications have been in for months, yet only one has been given accreditation. I tabled a parliamentary question about this but it was brushed aside by the Department which said it was none of its business, but rather concerned the General Register Office. The Department of Social Protection is in charge of this, so it cannot ignore the matter by turning its back and walking away. The latest we have been told is that there are people in the General Register Office who are worried about the notion of people making a profit out of this. If there is somebody in the General Register Office who is worried about this, they have no legal right to be worried about it. I have read and re-read the Act and there is nothing in it about being entitled to refuse people accreditation because they might get paid. I suspect, and it has been represented to me, that there is some ideological objection in the General Register Office. Because they do not believe in the whole thing, they feel they are in a position to interfere with the democratic process to ensure a law passed, and supported on all sides of the Oireachtas, is not being implemented.

There are some welcome provisions in this Bill, to which I will revert, and I acknowledge that progress has been made. I have been critical of most social welfare Bills since this Minister has been in office, as well as those of the previous Administration, but I welcome positive changes when they are made. On this occasion, however, I am critical of the fact that there are not enough changes. Retrograde decisions taken in the past have not been sufficiently rowed back on. It is utterly meaningless to be tinkering at the edges of the system where those in need and dependent on social welfare are concerned. We should be dealing with the problems of those in abject poverty due to the cuts in social welfare structures in recent years. In addition, the cost of living has not dropped substantially. In fact, it is continuously rising in some respects when one takes into account the cost of rents, electricity and travel. There has been a whole range of increases, all of which target the poorest people in society. Those who have less disposable income are hit hardest by the changes and increases, many of which are within the gift of the Government to limit or control. On top of that, there have been a series of social welfare cuts. The Minister has been at pains to claim that there have not been cuts to social welfare rates, but I have repeatedly shown that there have been such cuts. There have been quite a number in recent years, but since this Government came to office there have been some more. One of the latest cuts was to the jobseeker's benefit, for example. It is a cut if one changes the eligibility for jobseeker's benefit from 12 to nine months. At the end of that period, one goes into a means-tested jobseeker's allowance payment. A person's partner could be working, so the applicant no longer qualifies for that allowance. That amounts to a cut of three months in a person's jobseeker's benefit. Such changes may not be presented as cuts by the Minister, but the people affected know well that they are cuts. My biggest problem with this Government is that it came into being on the back of promises it made to the electorate that it would be different. In fact, however, it has enthusiastically followed the lead that was given by the previous Government in terms of social welfare. The Government has become a cheerleader for some of those social welfare cuts. Like other social welfare legislation before now, the Bill before us approaches matters in an ad hoc and piecemeal manner. We come across such Bills on occasion. They are tidying-up Bills which deal with miscellaneous provisions and the little bits that are missed because the social welfare code is so complex. When one change is made, sometimes there can be unforeseen consequences, some of which are reflected here today. Some of the changes are positive and welcome because they address anomalies that come to light when people engage with the system. For example, unforeseen circumstances can be spotted, so there are occasions when miscellaneous provisions Bills are welcome. While accepting the Bill before us, I find it difficult to understand why there is such a rush. This Bill was produced a week ago, and when we return after the break, it is expected that Committee and Remaining Stages will be held on one day in the House. I have not seen anything so far that is urgent.The people who would be affected by the changes would welcome their passage as quickly as possible, but sometimes we need to be careful we do not breach our own rules or conventions on legislative processes. Sometime we need to have the gaps between the stages to allow us to put amendments, contemplate further or get some of the information back from those who are affected. Often those in the Citizens Information Board, the Money Advice and Budgeting Service, MABS, various other groups and our clinics deal with the peculiarities of our social welfare system day in and day out and might be able to spot something that needs to be changed. That is why there are supposed to be at least two weeks between each Stage. Perhaps when the Minister is concluding she could explain the reason for the urgency. If there is urgency, so be it. Deputy O'Dea mentioned the pension changes. If there was an urgency in the pension changes then the urgency relates to the Waterford Crystal case but this Bill does not deal with that, so that urgency which sometimes pertains to court cases or court judgments does not exist in this instance. I will not labour that point. Social welfare payments should be designed to prevent poverty and also need to be sufficient and adequate in terms of the prevailing standards and costs of living. Lately that ethos has been wholly disregarded. That argument would be made that we have to live within the confines of what we are producing but one also has to be mindful of the effects one has on the weakest and most vulnerable in society. That was a laudable proposal during the election campaign by the parties in Government, that they would protect the most vulnerable. It was in the programme for Government, but their actions afterwards undermined that provision. Perhaps now that the Minister has come back to the left and decided to embrace the fact that austerity is not working, she might be able to persuade the rest of her Cabinet that austerity is not working and cannot work.

The social welfare system is not working as a safety net because the gap between rich and poor in our society is growing. That is the gap between the lowest cohort of our society and the richest. Even at a time of recession that gap is increasing. The rich are getting richer at a time of recession. They are benefitting from the chaos and grief of others, as has always been the case. We live in hope that Governments would address that, but they have not done so. We have been continually told about the high rates of social welfare payments to people in Ireland and we have seen comments from those who are here to dictate to us how to spend Irish taxpayers' money and run the economy. It has also been heard in this Chamber from Government spokespersons that social welfare rates are high. It is trotted out time and again. There seems to be this recurrent theme that if one says something often enough it comes true or, at the very least, will come to mean something. The high rate of payments in Ireland is not fact but merely a straw man argument in the welfare debates. One can make all the crude comparisons one wants with other states in the EU and elsewhere on social welfare payments but the payment is meaningless and the argument is meaningless if one does not have the same purchasing power as other populations for the payment one receives. That is the cost of living argument. In Ireland the cost of living is astronomical. Children are living in poverty. I have not seen any statistic or analysis to show the cost of living in Ireland has substantially reduced to show any type of justification, if ever there is one, for social welfare cuts. Ireland's place on the list of comparisons is virtually meaningless. We should be looking at purchasing power. I would say if one examined the purchasing power of social welfare payments in Ireland compared to other EU countries we would be near the bottom, not the top. There is nothing generous, to use one of the favourite words, about the social welfare system. I have heard the Minister use the word generous about a system that allows 10% of the children in this country to go without basic provisions. That is not generous in any way. In all the recent social welfare budgets we have seen changes to allow further clamp-down on social welfare fraud while we do not see legislation that would clamp down on white-collar fraud. Fraud, whether in banks, business or social welfare, should be pursued and I have never argued otherwise but there are degrees of effects and when one considers the effects of some of the banking scandals on Irish society, social welfare fraud is minuscule. That is not to justify it in any way, just in case somebody tries say I am doing so. I have been an advocate of ensuring there be more social welfare inspectors to ensure there is no abuse of the system but I am concerned that once again - because this Bill was not dealing with it other than the social welfare card - the Minister's presentation announced there would be further changes and what has been termed an "expansion of the penalty rates regime for jobseeker's allowance, jobseeker's benefit and supplementary welfare allowance and a measure to enhance powers in the area of overpayments recover". I will wait and see that and we will have that debate on Committee Stage. I am not saying I am opposed to it because I have not seen it yet and sometimes it could be the practical changes that are required to give effect to some of the provisions. We also need to be careful because we continuously see headlines that all those who were involved in overpayments were involved in fraud, because that is what the fourth estate will do. They will have their headlines such as "€600 million social welfare fraud". The figures are there, and the Minister's Department has shown them, but quite a lot of it is overpayments, some through clerical error, some through mistakes while filling out forms. It is not all fraud. Fraud is when people specifically set out to defraud the system and the Department. We need to make that distinction. Fraud is quite a low element that the Department prosecutes when it can, and it is entitled to recover all the money that has been defrauded from it whereas in terms of overpayment, the Department needs to be careful it does not drive people further into poverty by its pursuit of money it caused the person to get in the first place through it. Hopefully we will get to address this area on Committee Stage. Of late in social welfare debates the Committee Stage is time limited and we do not get the opportunity to deal with the meat of the provisions and amendments, positive or negative from the Minister or ourselves. That is a pity. Even at this stage the indication is that we will be time-limited to deal with Committee and Report Stages of this Bill. The Government is happy to create a picture of the deserving poor and present social provision as some kind of charity rather than an entitlement. It should not treat the social welfare system as such.It is not a benevolent fund, or rather it is a benevolent fund that was created by the PRSI system. Those who are dependent on it now, or those who have gone before them, have paid into this fund and although it may be in deficit at present there have been times when it has been in the black. That is the nature of the social welfare fund, the ciste leasa shoisialta. People have paid in over the years on the understanding they will receive back some of their payments if the unlucky event happens and they become unemployed, sick or dependent in some way on the social welfare system. In the main they have been happy to do so.  That allows me to address one of the points made by the previous speaker in respect of PRSI payments of the self-employed. I hope there will be some type of opt-in mechanism in the next social welfare Bill to allow those who are self-employed to pay a full contribution of 14% or 15% as indicated - in one case the figure was 17%. Whatever the figure may be it should be set and people who wish to opt into this will do so on the understanding they will enjoy the same benefits received by everybody else who pays through their PRSI contribution, added to their employer's contribution. There would not then be the situation whereby many self-employed people who have fallen on hard times, whose companies or businesses have collapsed, are totally dependent on exceptional needs payments, if they are lucky enough to get that much. There should be some kind of safety net eventually, once they have sold off all their assets to justify the payment from the State. It should be established they are unemployable or cannot start up their business again in the future. That is what they must do now to avail of any type of payment. There has been much discussion about child benefit and changes to same. I have had that discussion before with the Minister and have urged her not to make any changes. I have also questioned the contemplated changes, asking whether it was better to leave the system well enough alone as it is, in spite of the changes and cuts the Minister has already made, whether to go with the proposals contained in the Mangan report, or whether to go with the proposals on child benefit that came from the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Ruairí Quinn. I am adamant I will oppose any other cut to child benefit and I believe the public would also oppose this. The Labour Party in particular will suffer the consequences if it goes down the road of undoing further the promise it made during the election campaign not to cut child benefit. I will not dwell on that aspect of social welfare. There are many people in extreme poverty, however, for whom this Bill will not do anything, those who find themselves with very little on which to survive. A woman telephoned my office the other day who had €80 for herself and her partner to survive on for the coming three weeks. That is not uncommon. When she had paid all her bills, the mortgage and all other outstanding matters, that is the sum she was left with as a result of the cuts to both her and her partner's wages. There was nothing there for her. She could apply to the Society of St. Vincent de Paul, which is running out of money because of the huge draw on its resources, or could apply for the exceptional needs payment. However, because her partner is working and that payment is means-tested it is more than likely she would not qualify for it. Although I welcome that the Minister has seen fit to deal with one parent family payment, she will remember that when we first discussed this, after she had got rid of the existing transitional payment, we argued that this payment should have been left in place. When the change of the qualifying child went from 14 years to seven we argued the Minister needed to reverse and pull back from that change. At the time, the Minister stated there needed to be a proper system of child care in place. In her speech today, the Minister acknowledged that such a system is not yet in place and therefore she would introduce a change. Why will she not simply repeal the section which changed the age qualification for one parent families from 14 to seven years? That would be the easiest way and, at a later date, if the Minister were so minded, she could change the age back when the system of child care we all wish for - the Scandinavian model of child care - is instituted in this State. We do not have it, however, and are not likely to have it in the near future because the necessary investment does not exist. Although what the Minister proposes in this regard is welcome, it goes contrary to everything else she has stated in regard to the social welfare code. She is further complicating that code. Two years ago we had a debate about the single working age payment. At the time the ethos was being dictated by the changes being brought about in Britain and also by the troika. The response was to simplify the code but now the Minister is introducing a new social welfare payment, with all the belts and braces and whatever else attached.

That would have been much simpler than putting in a complicated scheme which, I am led to believe, in some cases could end up leaving women in a worse situation than they are in at present. The Minister has acknowledged that the comprehensive system we need is not in place. I will table an amendment to that effect and I urge the Minister to reverse the change she made in 2012. One might describe this as cover because the new scheme applies only to those who already qualify; it does not apply to anybody who has qualified for the one parent family payment since the change made in 2012. As far as I can work it out, it only goes to those already in the scheme but I will look at it further. It is a reducing number in order that this payment will disappear quickly enough unless the women concerned, who are already in payment, have more children. The payment is a reducing transitional one. I hope I am wrong and that this is not a piece of trickery. The changes I welcome are similar to those made to jobseeker's benefit and jobseeker's allowance. I have asked the Minister to look at this issue on a number of occasions and I acknowledge she has dealt with it as it relates to the retained firefighters. That has been welcomed and we hope it will work to address a problem that had been about to cause mayhem in fire services around the country had social welfare inspectors been intent on sticking to the letter of the law, as they saw it. At least now the letter of the law will allow them to make allowance for retained firefighters. What will happen to those who were refused and have made an appeal? Will this change reinstate the payment to date from the original date of their appeal, or will they have to reapply following the passage of this Bill into law?

I welcome the overdue recognition of the important role played by retained firefighters and their exclusion from certain conditions of the jobseeker's allowance. I also welcome the rationalisation of the regulation of pensions. The establishment of the new pensions council appears a particularly positive development, although we will have to see how it works out. The council will have greater involvement from consumers, and people who were previously paid will be replaced by volunteers. I have no major objection to identity cards. I am neutral on them, although I will not say I welcome them. It is positive that the Minister acknowledged the need to undo the damage wrought by cuts to lone parent payments. She is now attempting to address this issue with the jobseeker's transitional payment and the changes to family income supplement. Problems remain with the system but the Government has at least recognised the hardship created for lone parents by previous budgets. Credit where credit is due; the Minister listened to the concerns expressed on this side of the House and, more important, by groups like SPARK and One Family, which have appointed people representing lone parents to speak on these issues. Before I deal with the details of the Bill, I want to discuss three issues in regard to what is in the Bill, what is not in it and what might be in it.I will first respond briefly to some of the general comments the Minister made. I welcome her statement that we need to look beyond austerity. Her words echo statements made in recent weeks by senior figures in the European Union and reflect a long overdue acknowledgement that the disastrous policy pursued for the past five years by this Government, the previous Fianna Fáil-led Government, the European Central Bank, the European Commission and governments across Europe has failed. It is now recognised that we cannot resolve the current crisis through a policy of crippling austerity that is aimed primarily at forcing the cost of the bank bailout onto ordinary citizens and must instead move in a different direction. The trick, however, in moving beyond austerity, is to make the shift from words to deeds. As the Minister pointed out when she discussed her brief, there is something of a contradiction between saying we need to move beyond austerity and continuing to adhere to the debt and deficit targets the troika has imposed on us and which require her to impose further cuts in the forthcoming budget. I note the European Commission stated this morning that the Government must not waver from its commitment to remove a further €5 billion from the economy in the next two years. To date, the Government has made clear it will not waver from this commitment. I shudder to think what this means. Whether one believes, as the Minister does, that the adjustments and cuts that have been imposed over the past five years are necessary or whether one believes, as I do, that they are unnecessary and wrong, we all accept they have been cruel and have caused hurt and suffering. People are close to the end of their tether in terms of the cuts in income they can endure. I suspect that people across society, especially the vulnerable who depend on social welfare payments, shudder to think where the Government will find further savings in the forthcoming budget beyond what is in the Bill. I do not know how the Government will find the savings without causing suffering to people who have suffered enough. It is contradictory to state that austerity has ended and we need to move beyond it while at the same time recommitting oneself to imposing cuts of billions of euro in the forthcoming budget. I note the Minister's statement that the Government's key commitment is to jobs. We all agree that growth and jobs offer the way out of the contradiction between the desire to move beyond austerity and demands to meet debt and deficit targets. It is, however, difficult to reconcile these two imperatives. I do not see how one can take a further €5 billion out of the economy without causing further job losses. I hope the Government is not impressed by figures showing that unemployment has declined from 14.6% to 13.7% since the Government came to office. Many of the jobs lost during the period in question were full-time, permanent positions, including in the public sector, which have been replaced by part-time jobs. Moreover, the decline in the unemployment rate can almost certainly be explained by the high level of emigration during the period in question. The reality, therefore, is that little of substance is taking place in the area of job creation. In setting out her commitment to job creation, the Minister cited a figure of €1 billion to be spent on education and training. This funding is welcome and desperately needed as we try to reposition and reorient the economy and encourage the unemployed to prepare for the new work opportunities we hope will materialise, even if there are few signs that this is happening. I note in passing that there is also a contradiction between making a commitment to re-education and training in one area, and I accept the Department of Social Protection is spending money in this area, when cuts being imposed by the Department of Education and Skills in the further education sector will significantly and adversely impact on the training and education available to the very groups on which we know we must focus if we are to help them out of unemployment. Further education, as we know, is the sector that caters most for people in disadvantaged areas who are unable to access or do as well in the mainstream education system. It has done well in filling a gap through the provision of education and training to sections of the population which have not prospered in the mainstream education system. However, the sector is under attack and its educational offering will be significantly reduced as a result of the decision to increase the pupil-staff ratio in further education colleges. It is campaigning hard against retrograde cuts which will undermine the critical imperative to provide education and training to people who need it if they are to get out of the unemployment disaster that has struck us. It is unfortunate that the Minister continues to repeat the claim that the Government has not touched core social welfare rates. Let us at least be honest about what has taken place. Everybody who receives a social welfare payment has taken a significant hit in recent years arising from the budget cuts the Government has imposed. Playing around with semantics about core social welfare rates is disingenuous. Cuts to the rent and fuel allowances, lone parent payment, child benefit, school clothing and respite care grants and many other payments have caused suffering and constitute real cuts in the income on which some of the vulnerable sections of society must live. The Department acknowledges this in its assessment of the main welfare and taxation measures in the 2013 budget. According to the document, which is published on the Department's website: "Households worst affected by the measures are those with children, in particular lone parent families." The Department acknowledges that the most vulnerable sections of society have been adversely affected by the social welfare cuts it has imposed. I propose to raise an issue that should be addressed in the Bill. The Minister may not be aware of it as I have not raised it previously. A couple in my constituency contacted me recently to discuss a decision to reduce significantly their jobseeker's payments.This decision was taken after the Department of Social Protection inquired as to how this man and his wife are paying their mortgage, which is currently in distress. The man had been working but, like many others, he lost his job and could not afford to pay his mortgage. When asked how he was meeting his mortgage repayments, he openly and honestly replied that his children had loaned him some money in order that he might try to do so. He also informed the Department that he is attempting to obtain employment on a daily basis and that in the meantime - and because he does not want to fall behind with his repayments - his children, who are working, have agreed to lend him some money in order to pay off the mortgage. When this emerged, the Department cut his and his wife's payments by €65 per week. This was in direct proportion to the amount of assistance they received from their children, which is disgraceful. If one cannot pay one's mortgage and one approaches the Society of St. Vincent de Paul for and receives financial assistance, this is not taken into account by the Department. However, because one's children help one out of a hole, one is penalised. This is not extra income one is hiding or using in order to lead a better life, it is, rather, money one is using to pay off one's mortgage rather than allowing it to fall further into distress. If people cannot repay their mortgages, there are consequences for the banks and, ultimately, the taxpayer. This is a matter to which the Minister should give consideration because what happened in this instance was unfair.

I wanted to draw the matter to the Minister's attention because I am of the view that the way these people were treated was grossly unfair. I suspect that if it happened once, then it is probably occurring on a wider basis. In the context of the jobseeker's transitional payment, it is positive that the Minister has addressed a major problem which arose on foot of the fact that people cannot obtain the lone-parent or one-parent family payments when their children reach the age of seven. However, there is a problem with her assertion to the effect that she wants to provide people with incentives to return to work in order that they will not be dependent on social welfare payments. Let us start with the facts. When income disregards were initially introduced in respect of lone parents, the latter took them up in droves. The number of lone parents who were working when those disregards were first introduced stood at 58%. This meant that the belief that lone parents do not work because they can depend on the lone-parent payment was simply not true. When they were given incentives to work, these people took them up as a result of the introduction of income disregards. Under the Bill, however, when lone parents whose children reach the age of eight move onto the jobseeker's transitional payment, they are going to lose out if they are working. Those who are in jobs in respect of which they earn €200 per week will lose out to the tune of €39 each week as a result of the fact that the income disregard which applies is significantly less. Initially the disregard was €149 under the lone parents scheme. It then decreased to €110. Under the jobseeker's transitional payment scheme it has fallen to €60. As a result, lone parents who are working on a part-time basis are going to take a major hit. What is proposed is going to act as a significant disincentive for lone parents to work at a time when the Minister and the Government claim they want to incentivise those people to work. The matter to which I refer must be addressed, otherwise what the Minister is doing will be a retrograde step not only in terms of people's incomes but also in the context of being a disincentive to work. This is against the background of the EU-SILC report on deprivation showing that the level of deprivation among the general public in this country is 24%, that it is 42% among the unemployed and that it stands at 56% among lone parents. It is clear that lone parents suffer disproportionately from deprivation. We had in place a scheme of incentives to get people back into employment that was working but now we are moving in a retrograde direction. I ask the Minister to give serious consideration to this matter. There should be no disincentives for lone parents and nor should there be any further attacks on their incomes. My final point relates to pensions. There is significant disappointment regarding the fact that the Minister has not addressed the order of priority in respect of pensions, particularly in view of the fact that four out of five defined benefit pension schemes here are in serious trouble. As long ago as 2011, she acknowledged that something needs to be done in respect of this matter. She promised that legislation would be brought forward but she is now using the judgment handed down by the European Court of Justice in the Waterford Crystal case as an excuse to, yet again, place this matter on the long finger. As already stated, I welcome the fact that an attempt is being made to rationalise, restructure and reform pensions regulation. However, the Minister has not dealt with this critical issue which has given rise to cases such as those relating to Waterford Crystal, the Abbey Theatre, etc. The entitlements of thousands of pensioners are under serious threat. Not including a provision in respect of this matter is a major omission. It should be addressed in this Bill.

The Bill contains only a few minor positives. It is part of an overall policy of austerity, of making cuts and of forcing middle and lower-income families to pay for a recession which they had absolutely no hand, act or part in creating. The previous Fianna Fáil-Green Party Government began the destruction of the social welfare system in this country by launching a direct attack on rates of payment. The current Administration has continued that attack but has done so in a much more subtle, devious and underhanded way by introducing cuts and changes to eligibility across the board. Since she came to office, the Minister has introduced what I call the "dirty baker's dozen of cuts". She has presided over cuts to child benefit, household benefit, the fuel allowance and jobseeker's allowance; changes to the contributory payments for pensions - these affect women to a much greater extent because many of them were obliged to leave work in order to raise families; cuts to carer's allowance, farm assist payments, the back to education allowance and exceptional needs payments - which hardly exist anymore; an increase in the age eligibility criteria relating to State pensions; the taxation of maternity benefit; and huge cuts to one-parent family payments and rent allowance. The effect of these and of extracting in the region of €28 billion from the economy in recent years - a huge chunk of which came from the Department of Social Protection - has given rise to poverty rates increasing month on month and year on year. There have been significant increases in both consistent and relative rates of poverty. In addition, there has been a huge increase in the rate of child poverty. These are the effects of the cuts introduced by the Department of Social Protection. There are alternatives and the Government has choices. However, the Government has no mandate in respect of the cuts it continues to introduce. The cuts to which I refer run completely contrary to the promises and commitments those now in Government made in the 2011 general election campaign. The Labour Party stated that things would be done its way and not Frankfurt's way and that it would protect the vulnerable. It also stated that there would be no more money for the banks, that bondholders would be burned and that ordinary men and women would be protected. The opposite has, in fact, proven to be the case. As stated, there are alternatives. There are people in this country who possess significant wealth. The Minister for Finance informed me a month ago that the top 20,000 earners in Ireland have incomes amounting to €7.42 billion. This means that they each take in €371,000 per annum. The wealthiest 5% of people here have personal assets worth of the order of €239 billion. In the past two years, the richest 300 individuals in this country have increased their assets by €5.5 billion.

As the country has some very wealthy people in income and asset terms, there is certainly room for a wealth tax to accrue much needed income for the Exchequer. If there was ever any doubt about the high level of wealth in Ireland, it was dispelled last week when the Minister's colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Costello, informed the House that Ireland was the seventh richest country in the world. In light of this, there is considerable scope for ensuring that the very wealthy pay their fair share and contribute properly to our recovery. It must be remembered that many of them were involved in creating the recession, not the middle and lower income families who had no hand, act or part in it. The Central Statistics Office, CSO, has published information showing that, while 90% of the population have lost approximately 18% of their incomes in recent years, the upper 10% have increased theirs. They have also increased their assets in the teeth of this recession, yet they are not being asked to pay their fair share. The most noticeable effect of the austerity programme, including cuts to social welfare and so on, is poverty. I am referring to consistent and relative poverty as well as to child poverty, all of which have increased substantially in recent years. The programme has also had a direct effect on the domestic economy. Low-income recipients of social welfare payments and the working poor spend all of their money in the economy, particularly their local economies. If one walks down the main street of any town or city, the significant amount of money that has been taken out of the economy through cuts is evident. Shops and long-standing businesses have closed, resulting in considerable levels of unemployment. Taking money out of the economy, be it through social welfare reductions or changes to eligibility criteria, will undoubtedly create further job losses. Recently, the Nevin Economic Research Institute showed that the Croke Park II proposals would only save €250 million of the €1 billion cited and would lead to approximately 10,000 people becoming unemployed, half of whom would be from the private sector. The proposal on the one-parent family payment and jobseeker's transition payment should be withdrawn from the Bill. I do not agree that the age of seven should be the cut-off point. The Minister has accepted that proper, affordable child care is not available. The Bill should include statutory time limits for social welfare applications. Currently, decisions on most applications are taking in the region of eight months. Reviews take approximately three to six months and appeals take approximately 12 months. We need statutory maximum limits to ensure applications are dealt with in a timely fashion. The Minister should take the opportunity to withdraw the cuts she has imposed since coming to power, in particular cuts to child benefit and those affecting the elderly such as carer’s allowance, fuel allowance and electricity allowance. In terms of pensions, the Bill does not deal with the crucial issue of defined-benefit pension schemes and the benefits to workers where their employment has ceased or a business has gone bust. That should have been addressed long before now, as far back as 2007 when there was a similar case in Britain. The Bill's provisions do not deal either with the exorbitant fees charged on pension funds. It has been accepted in recent times that they are significant and should be reduced.

Following the economic crash of recent years thousands of people who never previously availed of social welfare payments found themselves forced to seek funds from the State to keep their families afloat and while this expenditure is necessary and must be maintained, it is important that every cent spent on social protection measures is given to those who most need it. Social welfare fraud is taking money out of the pockets of the most needy in society and lining the pockets of the undeserving. The Minister, Deputy Burton, has made huge efforts to stamp out social welfare fraud and has come up with a number of innovative measures to help combat fraud. These measures have resulted in significant savings to date and thus I support her in her further efforts to eliminate fraud through the introduction of new measures to authenticate people’s identity. We have all heard stories, many of them urban myths, about people claiming multiple payments in different names. Under the current regulations people applying for a PPSN or public services card have to attend a Department of Social Protection office to have their photograph and signature recorded electronically, and a person who refuses to do so can have their payments suspended. The provisions of the Bill allow the extension of the scheme to all persons currently in receipt of social welfare and should have the effect of decreasing the opportunity for fraud even further. I also welcome changes to jobseeker’s allowance, which will allow recipients of one-parent family payment to be exempt from certain conditions for a specified amount of time. It must be recognised that single parents with children in school, for example, are not available to take up courses which would render them unable to be present to collect or care for their children. Another very welcome and commonsense measure relates to firefighters who are currently in receipt of jobseeker’s benefit and jobseeker’s allowance. The Bill will exempt them from certain conditions and allow them greater access to jobseeker’s schemes. The changes in the Bill are in place on the ground in many cases, but incorporating the changes in legislation will provide further security to the State’s firefighters. With money in very short supply, every opportunity to consolidate services must be examined. Accordingly, I welcome as another commonsense measure the decision to merge the office of the Pensions Ombudsman and the Financial Services Ombudsman. I note that the current Pensions Ombudsman has agreed to stay on past planned retirement to oversee the merger process. Such mergers can provide real savings in terms of office and human resources costs and opportunities for further such mergers should be identified in coming months. I admit that I was somewhat concerned initially about plans to establish a new pensions council, fearing that it would morph into yet another State quango. However, I am pleased to learn that this will simply be a council which will advise the Minister on pension matters on request. It will not be a corporate body and will not have the power to spend money. I also welcome the fact the chairman and members of the pensions council will be unpaid. While undoubtedly new structures must be put in place to oversee governance of pensions systems, every effort must be made to ensure that we do not add to the already overweening levels of bureaucracy in the State. I commend the Minister, Deputy Burton, on her innovation in this regard. The Pensions Board will have the power to wind up a pension scheme where that scheme is underfunded. That is a necessary and long-overdue power and one that will be called upon in future as our ageing population places increased pressure on pension funds. Further changes are necessary for the disbursement of pension scheme assets. The Minister must take cognisance of the recent decision in the European Court of Justice on the Waterford Crystal case. A comprehensive response to the findings in the case has yet to be formulated. Many of the measures contained in the Bill are commonsense measures, designed to combat fraud and improve oversight of pension schemes, while remaining ever mindful of the need to preserve the State’s scarce resources.

With a budget of almost €21 billion per annum, reform of the social protection system should be an ongoing process. Given the amount of public funds involved, constant vigilance and progress are required. I welcome many of the provisions in the Bill, in particular the new social protection cards which will enhance the identification process. In my previous existence as a postmaster I worked in an office that paid social protection to many clients. Positively identifying the correct claimant has always been an issue. The post office system has done a good job in giving the cash to those who are entitled to it but the enhanced security offered by the new card is more than welcome. Some might criticise me for saying that the new card does not go far enough. Such cards should contain much more information than a photograph, name and date of birth. Information such as whether one is an organ donor, one’s blood type, driving licence and insurance details should also be on the card. In effect, it could be a one-stop shop. I accept the Minister has addressed the issue but work remains to be done in certain respects. I refer in particular to the type of constituency in which I live, which the Minister visited recently. She would acknowledge that the same issues do not apply in such an area. We do not have many public services, other than those provided by doctors, nurses and hospitals. We have a high ratio of self-employed people, for example, in construction. Much work has been achieved to facilitate people moving in and out of the social protection system but it could still be further refined. I come to the table with problems and I do not have the solutions but the matter requires extra attention. Incorporating lone parents into the jobseeker’s system is a welcome initiative. Currently, the lone-parent system is a poverty trap and it has to be addressed. I welcome the Minister’s initiative to encourage lone parents to come back into the jobs market. They have a significant amount to offer. They wish to be in work and it is unfair to say that they are happy with a situation where it would not be advantageous to come back into the jobs market. The system should be incentivised. There are opportunities for lone parents and the social protection system will facilitate that, allowing people to work a couple of days a week, for example, and still maintain many of the necessary benefits and services social protection can offer. I wish to be a little parochial again. I again refer to my interest in the post office. We had a debate in the Joint Committee on Transport and Communications, of which I am a member, and we published a report on the future of post offices.While the gradual move towards a cashless society has many advantages, I hope the Minister is aware that a sword of Damocles hangs over the future of many post offices. In any future tendering conducted by the Department of Social Protection, the effect and impact of such moves on many rural and urban post offices should at least be considered and kept in mind by the Minister and her officials. Finally, I wish to pay tribute to all the officials and staff in the social protection offices throughout the country, whose courtesy, dedication and work is much appreciated. I have had nothing but good experiences with them. They are at the coalface and deserve a mention for facilitating the reforms and the measures provided for in this Bill.

At the outset, I commend the Minister on bringing this Bill before the House. The Government received a mandate from the people in the general election of 2011 to fix a broken economy and to bring back Ireland's economic sovereignty. On assuming office, it rapidly became apparent that a tsunami of challenges and difficulties lay in store in the road ahead. However, the new Government has set about its task diligently and to date has made significant progress in re-orientating the economy back towards a more sustainable path. One of the more challenging legacies left by the previous Administration for the present Government to tackle was the loss of more than 250,000 jobs in the economy during the preceding years. As a newly-elected Deputy after the 2011 general election, one of the toughest and most difficult positions in which I found myself was in my clinic at an office in Bandon, west Cork, while explaining to someone who had been self-employed that the person had no entitlement to supports as an automatic right. Many such self-employed people had come from the construction industry and had contributed enormous sums of money to the Exchequer during the so-called Celtic tiger era. However, Members of the newly-elected Government were faced with the task of telling them there was nothing they could do for them. They were not entitled to benefits because they had not paid the requisite PRSI contributions. What made such people particularly irate was looking around them, where they could see what appeared to them to be people who had never worked in or contributed anything to the economy but who were in a position to avail of the full suite of entitlements. As this irritant is hard to explain, I welcome the moves made by the Minister, in this Bill in particular, towards addressing the entitlements for those who are self-employed. It is long overdue, is a most welcome development and I look forward to further developments in this regard. The overwhelming mandate given to the Government both requires it to regain Ireland's economic sovereignty and puts a huge demand on it to reform the State and how it is run. In recent months, I have had occasion to knock many doors in my constituency, in towns such as Bandon and Clonakilty in west Cork. When one converses with people, by and large most will accept there is tough medicine to be dished out. However, I have challenged myself repeatedly to try to narrow down to a single word what it is that people want of the Government. The question is what is it that one could write in a paragraph or sentence or could distil into a single word. On examination, however, the word one comes across on the doorsteps most often is fairness. People do not mind taking the medicine and do not mind contributing and helping the Government to get the country back on track but they want it to be done in fairness. If this is the case, they will put up with the sacrifice and be willing to assist the Government. Regrettably, political opportunism arising from opposition politics, as well as cheap and crass media headlines, continually portray and project a sense of unfairness by trying to create illusory and false information to convince people that many of the measures are unfair and that fairness is not at the heart of the day-to-day running of this country. It is suggested the Government takes some form of perverse pleasure from protecting an elite group of rich people or from protecting bondholders, as though such individuals were voters who might re-elect Government Members. Through such political opportunism, people are made angry and as they hurt and take tough medicine, it is not helpful for the day-to-day living they must go through. To this end, I greatly welcome the steps taken in this Bill to prevent further fraud. Welfare fraud is a particular irritant for those who continually seek fairness. An example of this took place last week, as I knocked on doors in the Deerpark estate in Bandon, which is located in my constituency. Many of the people who live there are council tenants and were irate because they had experienced increases in the weekly rent they pay for their council houses of between €20 and €50 per week. These people had received leaflets from the local Sinn Féin party the previous weekend, advising that these rent increases were as a result of the Fine Gael-Labour Party property tax. To suggest that a €20 or €30 weekly increase, which would amount to an annual increase of between €1,000 and €1,500, was to cover the property tax clearly was disingenuous and deceitful. It was a lie. It simply compounded the anger and anxiety people feel in these difficult times.
#SeanKyne	unknown-#SeanKyne-party	unknown-#SeanKyne-dob	unknown-#SeanKyne-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-05-30 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	177	I believe the seanfhocal, is ar scáth a chéile a mhaireann na daoine, exemplifies the approach of most Irish people to the safety net that is the social welfare system. Social welfare is viewed positively as a way of supporting those citizens who require help and this belief sets us apart from many other nations. For example, a representative of the American non-profit sector, who spoke recently in Leinster House at a briefing on that sector, unintentionally highlighted the different approach to social welfare between our two countries. The distrust and unease many Americans feel towards government was abundantly clear and was in stark contrast to the opinion of most Irish people, who view the Government as playing a paternalistic role in providing for the citizens in times of difficulty. This strong belief manifests itself in the fact that in 2013, Ireland will spend nearly €20.3 billion or 37% of State expenditure on social welfare. It is a colossal sum of money, accounting for nearly €2 out of every €5 of Government expenditure. At a time of such financial pressure on the country, when the Government is required to borrow more than €1 billion per month to cover day-to-day spending, one must out of necessity review and examine social welfare. I will take this opportunity to commend the Minister, Deputy Burton, and her Department on the work achieved in protecting primary weekly social welfare rates and on introducing many other reforms. Examples include the increase in regular engagement with jobseekers to assist them in securing employment or further education. I note that 37,800 jobseekers received referrals in the first four months of 2013. Similarly, I note the success of the ICT skills conversion course, which has helped more than 700 jobseekers to acquire new skills to avail of employment opportunities in the ICT sector, as well as that of JobBridge, which is one of Europe's most successful internship programmes and has one of the highest placement-to-job ratios. The Bill before Members contains further significant reforms, which will help core social welfare weekly supports, while also helping to ensure the provision of that assistance and support those citizens genuinely need. New provisions include the roll-out of the new public service card. In this context, I note and welcome the establishment of a new centre just off Eyre Square in Galway, which will enable the smooth and speedy delivery of new public service cards, which will help to guard against fraud and to ensure the right supports reach the right people at the right time. The introduction of the jobseeker's transition arrangement also is most welcome and will assist parents of one-parent families in re-entering employment. The Bill also contains provisions relating to the Civil Registration Act 2004. I have raised this Act a number of times and appeal to the Minister to introduce the necessary changes to facilitate families of Irish citizens who die abroad in obtaining an Irish death certificate or an equally valid certificate from the State. It is well over two years since I first raised this issue and I acknowledge many other Deputies also have done so, both this year and in previous years. I appreciate that changes to the general register must be carefully drawn up and well thought out although I am at a loss as to the reason there has been such an inordinate delay. I have published a Private Members' Bill on this subject but out of courtesy to the Minister and the Department, I have not entered it into the lottery system for hearing. However, I seek to have this matter progressed. People in my constituency are affected and in the words of one daughter speaking on behalf of her parents, they would like to get a death certificate for her brother, who died tragically, before they die themselves. Consequently, this matter should be progressed. I also have raised measures to strengthen genealogical services and tourism. I am encouraged by provisions in this Bill, which act as a stepping stone to achieving this overall aim. I also wish to place on record my previous suggestion that the Central Bank premises on Dame Street be acquired for use as a centre for genealogy and social history research, as such a use would sit very well with the status of that building. While Members must defend and uphold the principles underpinning the social welfare system, they must also defend the value and importance of work. Employment must always pay and the reward for working must always outweigh the benefits of remaining in receipt of social welfare. Supporting the social welfare system and believing that a person must always be rewarded for working are not irreconcilable opposites. It is unacceptable that recent figures from the Department show that more than 43,000 people or one in seven recipients of jobseeker's payments have never contributed to PRSI.Such statistics are deeply worrying for every taxpayer.  I welcome the news today of the largest drop in unemployment since the start of the economic collapse, which is encouraging. I am also encouraged by many other aspects of the Bill including the extension of the public services card, the new jobseeker's transition arrangement, the special qualifying provisions for retained firefighters, and the establishment of a pensions council among others. We must continue to work hard to ensure the social welfare system and its supports, as well as the efforts at reform, are focused on assisting genuine, honest citizens. Such a focus is central to the type of country we want and recognises the substantial and positive effects of social welfare budgets on all aspects of Irish life.
#JohnBrowne2	unknown-#JohnBrowne2-party	unknown-#JohnBrowne2-dob	unknown-#JohnBrowne2-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-05-30 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	178	I welcome the opportunity to speak on the Social Welfare and Pensions (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2013. The Bill gives us an opportunity to reflect on some of the areas of social welfare that probably need to change, and some recipients who recently had major cuts imposed on them. I always contend we have two categories of people on social welfare, namely, the old, the sick and people with disabilities who depend very much on social welfare and do not see any other way of getting an income for the future, and then the people who are able and want to work but who are unable to get a job. It is important that those people can avail of relevant courses in counties where job opportunities might be available. In the past I argued with Ministers in my party that an analysis should be carried out in each county of the type of jobs available and match the courses to such jobs. For example, I represent a very agriculture-related county which has a large number of meat factories and produces a large number of products related to agriculture and fisheries. These are the areas courses in Wexford could specialise in but courses operated by FÁS and other agencies appear to bear no relevance to the job opportunities that might be available in the county. It is important that we would reflect on that and have an analysis carried out by the Minister's Department and the Department of the Minister, Deputy Bruton, to match jobs to courses that might be available in future. A number of Deputies earlier reflected on the position of the self-employed. In the past three or four years a huge number of self-employed people have lost their businesses and their income. They have come to me and other Deputies asking us to make representations to the local community welfare officer or to the Department of Social Welfare. However, there is not much flexibility in terms of helping such people and by the time analysis is carried out and books and accounts are presented, families find it very difficult to survive. I have had many men and women from a self-employed background crying in my office because they are unable to get social welfare payments. That is an area that should be reflected in any pension changes in the future. I appreciate the Minister is trying to focus on that area and encourage people and I will return to that. It is important to have a pension structure that is financially sustainable and socially adequate. We must always believe in basic pension provisions being universally available and ensure that all citizens can live in dignity, particularly in old age, and get social welfare payments when they lose their job, which in my opinion should be only on a temporary basis. The Minister has tabled a number of amendments to the Social Welfare Consolidation Act 2005, for example, extension of PRSI and the new identification requirements where the card system will be introduced. I do not have a problem with the card system, and I hope as the Minister stated it will be done in a sensitive way because many old age pensioners and people on disability allowance may not be able to get to the local social welfare office or to the other areas to make themselves available to have their photographs taken, authorisation of their signature electronically and so on for identification purposes. Will that be done only in social welfare offices or can it be done in a post office where many people, particularly old age pensioners, claim their social welfare payments? In Wexford, for example, the only social welfare office is in Wexford town. A very large number of people would only go to their post office. The Minister might examine that to determine if it can be done in post offices to make life easier for people who will have to comply with the regulations once the Minister introduces them. Regarding the one-parent family payment, the Minister's announcement in the budget regarding the proposed changes has caused many problems and is the subject of many representations to me and, I am sure, to other Deputies, particularly the one in 2014 regarding the child aged seven. In her budget speech the Minister said she would seriously examine that and take into account the possibilities of child care facilities not being available and whatever else that might be required but it is the one issue in the budget that has caused many problems and is the subject of many representations from people on the one-parent family payment. I will not call it a climb down but I welcome that the Minister has made suggestions to make changes in this area. We know that approximately 36% of recipients are already in paid work of one sort or another. The aim must be to increase that percentage and ensure that lone parents can progress to full-time work, which is an aspiration for all lone parents. However, many lone parents only work on a part-time basis because of child-minding difficulties and it is important that is reflected on before the Minister makes her final decisions on that area. I welcome the right to jobseeker's benefit for part-time firefighters. That has been an area of contention for as long as I have been a Member of this House and no Minister ever saw to make the changes. I thank the Minister for recognising the role of part-time firefighters. They do a tremendous job. Some people say they make a lot of money but I do not accept that, judging by the payments firefighters in my county receive. However, it is important they would be entitled to social welfare payments when they qualify, and I welcome that the Minister has introduced that. Regarding the pensions council, it will comprise of a chairperson, a representative of the Minister for Social Protection, the Pensions Regulator, a representative of the Central Bank, and a representative of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform. The Minister has the right to appoint eight members with relevant skills and specialist knowledge. She might outline those relevant skills when replying. Will an old age pensioner, a lone parent or someone from the widowers association be represented on the board? A mistake many Ministers made in the past was to appoint professional people to boards, many of whom did not have a lot of commonsense. It is important that people in receipt of social welfare, who are Department's consumers, are represented on the pensions council. The general public will be happy to see that the pensions council members will be unpaid and that it is not a case of another quango being set up with chief executives and people on high salaries. I hope the pensions council will have a strong consumer focus. In particular it should examine the area of pension charges. One of the persistent criticisms of the private pensions industry is that it is designed to make vast sums of money for the fund managers, administrators and intermediaries. It has often been described as opaque, confusing and offering mediocre to poor value for pension holders. I hope the pensions council will seriously examine that area.The Minister reduced rent supplement and mortgage interest supplement last year and again this year. This is causing severe problems in some parts of the country where private rents are very high. I know the Minister will reply that the more money she gives in rent supplement, the more landlords will charge, but in all counties on the east coast, rents are extremely high and the reductions in rent supplement have caused severe hardship for many people. I try to get landlords to come down on their charges but it is difficult because they will answer that the property tax and NPPR charges must be paid. In many cases, however, they are passing those charges on to the tenant. The reductions in rent supplement have caused problems for those on social welfare who are renting. They are finding it very hard to make ends meet at present. According to the national Pensions Board, only 54% of people in the workforce have pension coverage. Within the working population there are wide disparities. Public service coverage is over 90% while in some areas of the private sector, coverage is low. The national pensions framework published by the last Government in 2011 cites the example of the hotel and restaurant sector, where pension coverage is only 23%, while the wholesale and retail trade has only 36% coverage. Independent consumer research carried out on behalf of the Pensions Board indicates that almost eight out of ten people who do not contribute to a pension say the State pension will not meet their needs in retirement. Although employers are obliged by law to offer employees access to a pension, 43% of those interviewed had not been offered access. Of those, 93% had never asked an employer about access to a pension. There are serious problems in this area. The key issue is the improvement of coverage. This must be done through a combination of incentives, soft and hard. Mandatory pensions must be considered. People might criticise my saying that but almost all OECD countries, with the exceptions of Ireland and New Zealand, have compulsory pension savings. It is an area we must look seriously at. I do not know if the new pensions council will have the power to look at this topic but it will have the power to make recommendations to the Minister and the Minister will have to act on them. The time has come to look seriously at the whole pension situation in the country so pension schemes will be adequate financially. It is particularly important that those with a disability and the sick will continue to be looked after in a fair manner. The cuts to the free fuel allowance, the carer's allowance and the exceptional needs payments are causing severe hardship for families on social welfare. How will the Minister address that? A lot of money is being pumped into social welfare at present. The Minister is talking about pension schemes today and it is important that we have a pension scheme that will meet the needs of the people. I hear talk about Ireland being the seventh richest country in the world but I do not know how these people define rich. I am a long time in the House and I do not see any of this wealth being made available to the Department of Social Protection. Perhaps someone will explain to me how they define this wealth if Ireland is the seventh richest country. What advantage does that offer the ordinary people of this country? The only finances I see available for ordinary people are the taxes they have paid. It is important that we encourage as many people as possible back into the work environment. The only way we will get out of this situation is to get more people back to work. The courses that will be designed by the Department should reflect the job opportunities available. I generally welcome this Bill and hope it passes through the House as quickly as possible. I hope the Minister will take on board those amendments that might improve the Bill. It is important we have a social welfare system that is fair and equitable and that will continue to look after those who need social welfare payments.
#TerenceFlanagan	unknown-#TerenceFlanagan-party	unknown-#TerenceFlanagan-dob	unknown-#TerenceFlanagan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-05-30 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	179	I too welcome the Social Welfare and Pensions (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2013. This Bill gives effect to a number of social welfare and pension reforms, some of which will bring about savings to the annual budget of the Department of Social Protection. We know that the Department has already made substantial savings this year and hopes to achieve net savings of €390 million for the year. One of most important measures introduced in the Bill is to address the problem of benefit fraud. It is another issue this Government has inherited and must deal with. Clearly the system has been too loose for too many years. This Bill will provide comfort for the genuine public concern that exists. As a public representative, I have received representations from people who are concerned about the level of benefit fraud. The new system will require photo identification and a signature for access to the social welfare system. There was an idea of finger printing being introduced at one stage so perhaps we could clarify why that was not further considered. The media have reported on the issue on many occasions, particularly "Prime Time". We have been approached by members of the public who have highlighted certain cases they are aware of where a person is claiming and receiving benefits he is not entitled to. I am aware the Department has undertaken a number of measures already to address this problem. Recent reports in the media have shown 100 people have been caught at Dublin Airport flying into the country to sign on for social welfare payments. Welfare tourism is a problem here and I was heartened to hear a significant number of people have been caught. I am concerned to hear 1,400 reports of fraudulent claims made by people outside Ireland last year. Similarly I am happy to hear that more people are reporting their concerns over social welfare fraud to the Department. The number of people reporting has almost doubled between 2011 and 2012, when more than 28,000 reports were made to the Department. The figures show the Department has saved €91 million in misspent jobseeker's benefits, €173 million in one-parent family payments and €83 million in child benefit. The Department recorded control savings of €666 million in 2012.An increased target in control savings of €710 million is proposed for 2013. The Minister has assured me and other Deputies that the Department reviews claims on a regular targeted basis, particularly where there is a higher risk of fraud. I believe the new welfare card system will be effective and will contribute to decreasing social welfare fraud in this country. Up until now, all a welfare applicant has needed is a PPS number or a public services card to confirm his or her identity. From now on, a recipient's photograph and signature will be recorded electronically on the system to check against in the future. Obviously, this is necessary. If recipients fail to comply with this new regulation, they will put themselves at risk of not receiving further payments or of their payments being stopped. There are citizens who must rely on welfare payments and are dependent on them. There are large numbers of unemployed genuinely trying to find work. These, quite rightly, are being supported by the Government in every way possible in their search. I very much welcome today's statement about the reduction in unemployment numbers to below 300,000 for the first time since 2010. Certainly, that is a good news story. It is a psychological lift for the country when we need a lift. I would agree that those falsely claiming benefits under someone else's identity should be stopped from doing so. They do a disservice to the genuine recipients of welfare payments because everyone is in danger of being tarred with the same brush. They also do a disservice to taxpayers, particularly with them put to the pin of their collar. Everything that needs to be done, I am sure, will be done. The Bill also introduces measures to allow for the transition of those on the one-parent family payment to the jobseeker's allowance scheme or another payment. Parents with a child over the age of seven will now be placed on a targeted version of jobseeker's allowance called jobseeker's transition. The transition period allows for lone parents who have been out of the job market for some time and who may have difficulties securing child care to seek work on a part-time rather than a full-time basis, and applicants will be exempt from a number of conditions for jobseeker's allowance for a transitional period until the child is 14 years of age. The Government recognises that lone parents applying for jobseeker's allowance may find it difficult to meet the requirements of the payment, which are to be available and genuinely seeking full-time work. Therefore, lone parents of children between the ages of seven and 14 will not have to meet this requirement. Instead, they will have to take part in training and in educational opportunities which will help to get them ready for employment when their parenting obligations are less intense in the future. It is my understanding that the Department of Social Protection will hold a series of information meetings next month to inform recipients of the one-parent family payment so that they can get more details of what is being proposed, and a letter will issue in due course. Other measures introduced in the Bill include changes to the Pensions Board which aim to increase consumer trust in and generate greater public awareness of the system in the pensions area, changes in liability for PRSI to broaden the PRSI base thus supporting the Social Insurance Fund to continue paying pensions and benefits to those who need them, and changes to the index information from the registers of births, deaths, marriages and civil partnerships allowing historical indexes to go online and making Irish genealogical research easier. The latter measure is particularly important this year with The Gathering. Given the large Irish diaspora, there is a broad level of interest among people in wanting to know who they are, where they come from and their background. Having this online will make the research much easier. I welcome the contents of the Bill. I trust that every measure will positively impact on those it affects.

It also amends the Pensions Act 1990, providing for the restructuring of the Pensions Board. Budget 2013 announced a number of measures to broaden the income base for PRSI in order to ensure the stability of the Social Insurance Fund so that it can continue to pay the pensions and benefits required by those who need them most. A number of these measures were provided for in the Social Welfare Act 2012, including an increase in the minimum level of annual contribution of the self-employed, from €253 to €500. This Bill extends liability for PRSI contributions to certain civil and public sector workers, who pay modified rates of PRSI - classes B, C and D - and who also have income from a trade or profession. Such income will now become liable for PRSI at the rate of 4%, but will not count towards determining entitlement to social insurance benefits. The Bill also provides that a working director with a shareholding of 50% or greater in a company is not insurable as an employed contributor in the company, and is insurable at PRSI Class S, as a self-employed person. The Bill also introduces measures to allow for the transition of lone parents to the jobseeker's allowance scheme when they no longer qualify for one-parent family payment due to their youngest child reaching the specified age threshold. Former recipients of the one-parent family payment will be exempt from a number of the conditions for jobseeker's allowance for a transitional period up until their youngest child reaches the 14 years of age. Lone parents who qualify for jobseeker's allowance during the transitional period will be required to engage proactively with normal activation process in order to retain their payment. In effect, the lone parents in question will be placed on a targeted version of the jobseeker's allowance to be known as jobseeker's transition. In recognition of the nature of their conditions of employment, the Bill also provides that the retained fire-fighters will be exempt from certain conditions applying to the jobseeker's benefit and allowance schemes. These changes will reflect the administrative arrangements that are already in place. A measure to strengthen control of social welfare expenditure will require an existing social welfare client to provide certain information and to have his or her photograph and signature electronically captured for the purpose of identification on a periodic basis. A person who refuses without good reason to comply with these requirements will be disqualified from continuing to receive a social welfare payment. The Bill extends the list of bodies that are authorised to use the personal public service number, PPSN, for the purposes of carrying out transactions with members of the public and for the sharing of personal data and information for the purpose of carrying out such transaction. The additional bodies being included are the Insolvency Service of Ireland, Quality and Qualifications Ireland, and payment service providers who have been authorised by the Revenue Commissioners to collect the local property tax. The Bill amends the Civil Registration Act 2004 to facilitate online access to the index information from the registers of births, deaths, marriages and civil partnerships. The Pensions Board is being renamed as the pensions authority. The authority will consist of an independent chairperson appointed by the Minister for Social Protection and two ordinary members, reduced from 16 ordinary members. The two ordinary members will consist of a representative of the Minister for Social Protection and a representative of the Minister for Finance. Another change included in the Bill is the establishment of a new unincorporated body called the pensions council. The function of the council will be to advise the Minister for Social Protection and the pensions authority on pension matters on requests or on its own initiative. The pensions council will not be a corporate body and will not have the power to spend money. The chairperson of the pensions council will be unpaid and will be appointed by the Minister. The Pensions Board will be provided with the power to wind-up a pension scheme in circumstances where a scheme is under funded and the trustees and employer are not in a position to adopt a funding proposal, and where the trustee of the scheme fails to comply with a section 50 direction to restructure scheme benefits.
#JohnOMahony	unknown-#JohnOMahony-party	unknown-#JohnOMahony-dob	unknown-#JohnOMahony-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-05-30 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	182	I also welcome the opportunity to contribute to the debate and I welcome the number of provisions in the Bill which adjust anomalies which have been there for a very long time that discriminated against certain categories of people and individuals. The self-employed and retained part-time firefighters come to mind in that respect. Firefighters perform a very important role in local communities on a part-time basis and they often put their lives at risk while providing service in addition to full-time employment if they are lucky to have it. A discrepancy existed in that if firefighters became unemployed, they could be denied jobseeker's allowance or have to get it on appeal. It was an unfair process and I compliment the Minister on adjusting it. This process was first implemented in 1972, when it was decided that the days for firefighting or training would be disregarded in determining an entitlement to jobseeker's benefit. It took a long time but I compliment the Minister on making the change. Another change means that all social welfare recipients will get a photo identification card. People may argue that this could be intrusive but it will allow payments to be made to people who are entitled to them, which is what everybody should want. People who fall on difficult times should receive payments but people should not succeed in making fraudulent claims. I know the Minister has made much progress in recent years on the issue but this Bill will make further and better progress easier, allowing money to go to where it is deserved. There are many areas where I would like the Minister to be able to use funding, such as the farm assist scheme. Adjustments were made in the last budget and perhaps with some of the provisions going through in this Bill, we will be able to look at the matter again. There are 1,800 recipients of farm assist funding in my county and many have had it cut. If these people are not in the farm assist scheme, they are not entitled to be in the rural social scheme, and that has major implications that may not be evident for people in receipt of family income supplement. If there is a more targeted approach to cutting fraud, we may be able to consider that issue again in the near future. With regard to the use of photo identification and signatures, one can see in the free travel scheme how measures can be abused. I know many elderly people and disabled people who are fearful that the free travel scheme will be readjusted because of its inherent costs. People who use the scheme fraudulently are putting at risk those for whom the scheme is meant. It is a wonderful measure for senior citizens and disabled people, and it contributes to the economy because many such people in the winter may use free travel to stay overnight in hotels and guest houses. It provides a cushion against social isolation and any change caused by abuse of the system would be terrible. The move to the use of photo identification is positive as it is a way of targeting payments and giving help where it is deserved rather than catching out people. As other speakers have indicated, the Bill also introduces measures to allow for the transition from lone parent to jobseeker's allowance when a person no longer qualifies for a single parent family payment due to a child reaching specified age thresholds. This part of the Bill allows for flexibility and deals with a scenario in which many lone parents find themselves. It is consumer-friendly, which is good. The Bill is also addressing the plight of the self-employed, broadening the PRSI base to allow them to pay into a scheme that will give them extra entitlements. It is a terrible pity that was not done ten years ago by the previous Fianna Fáil Government during the construction boom as all of us were in halls in our constituencies filled with people who had employed other people, paid taxes and boosted their local economy only for their businesses to crash, many of them in the construction area. They were not entitled to anything as a result and the Bill will address that concern. It is a pity this has not been in place for the past four or five years in particular, but I compliment the Minister on facing up to the issue. I welcome the provisions I mentioned, although I do not have time to get into some others. I am very supportive of the Bill.

I am an admirer of the Minister and what she is trying to do with social welfare. It is not an easy job. Before Government backbenchers or others get alarmed, I should say that I appreciate the difficult job she has had because of the recession and the number of problems she has faced while looking to reform. She has a good relationship with most of us on this side of the House and all politicians. I welcome the change to the status of retained firefighters, who have given sterling service to the State and have been unfairly hit by the pension levy as they are not full-time workers. They risk life and limb to answer a call to defend others and save people's lives, so it is good to recognise that they should be exempt from certain conditions for pension schemes and entitlements such as jobseeker's allowance. I welcome that there will be a new board, although I forget exactly what the name will be. I know that with the eight appointees the Minister might insist there should be a voice for widows, pensioners, lone parents and those in small business. I would be glad to assist the Minister in this regard as such people would be fair and have a better understanding of the matters at hand. I know the chairman works free of charge but there are many good people in community organisations and volunteers who could make a good contribution and have some common sense. The self-employed are not being recognised enough although I salute the Minister's efforts to allow them pay some PRSI and get something back. I have been self-employed for 30 years and I know how the sector employs people, pays taxes and has the nightmare of organising work and ensuring everything is done correctly and is above board by meeting all the regulations. That is only correct and there is a good relationship with many employees. A business may founder, as many did, because of the recession and all the employees would be looked after, which is only correct. However, the self-employed person and his or her family get no recognition. They have all the pain and no gain. They want some recognition and we need those people to create jobs and employment for the economy. We do not want them to be made into paupers. I welcome the good news today on the employment front and any bit of good news in that respect is important. The new identification cards will be a major step forward and I do not understand why they were not put in place ten or 15 years ago. It is not rocket science to have a person's identity matched to a PPS number and picture. I hope it will stop fraud.Fraud damages the good people. I do not use the train much but I took it this week from Limerick Junction. I asked the man at the station how business was and he told me it was desperate. I am sure he was an employee of Irish Rail. He told me without the free travel scheme the station would be silent. I met two people from Cork in the guesthouse this morning who are in Dublin for two nights. It is important for the economy that they are allowed to travel and it gives the people themselves the freedom and initiative to get out of the house. They told me Killarney and Westport train stations would close down without the free travel scheme. The business communities in these towns take initiatives and provide offers to attract people. It is wonderful for people to be able to forget about the economy and economic issues for a day or two and go away and see how other people live and enjoy themselves and relax. Irish Rail supports trips taken by the Carers Association, day care centres and active retirement groups and it is very important to encourage people such as these to get out. The free travel scheme must remain in place and Iarnród Éireann should not be sold off as rich pickings for companies who want to take the lucrative routes and forget about the subsidies for the people who built up the country and worked hard. We can all demonise lone parents but most of them are genuine. There will be a gap when children are between the ages of seven and 14. Parents can take part in training and be upskilled to meet the needs of the jobs market. I cannot imagine how difficult it is to be a lone parent. Lone parents are isolated and trying to look after the family, and they may not be able to keep abreast of the changes in society and the different skill sets required to obtain employment again and be of assistance and play a meaningful part in the workforce. The farm assist scheme needs to be examined even more thoroughly. I praise the benefits of the rural social scheme because farmers have time on their hands. A bit of off-farm income is wonderful and the schemes in which they have been involved have been wide and varied, including graveyards, research, genealogy, tidy towns and caring associations such as community alert and visiting family members or the elderly, and no better people to do so because the farmer's instinct is to work hard. This scheme needs to be broadened and farmers need to be given a bit more leeway because anomalies exist between the farm assist scheme and jobseeker's allowance and this is unfair. I hate to be critical but I am aware of a case involving a person from my area and I have spoken to the Minister about it. It is with regard to an application made in May 2011. While the person has received payment, he has been waiting for back payments since January 2012. I telephoned the Department and was told it would be another week. On various occasions I have been told it would be days or weeks. I know the staff are under pressure and busy, but it is very frustrating to be told indicative dates in good faith and then it does not happen. From May 2011 to now is too long to have to wait. The gentleman still has not received his due rewards. He was originally refused but appealed and passed all the medicals and was awarded in January 2013 but is still waiting for the arrears. If he is receiving payments he is in the system so it would not be rocket science for somebody to calculate the amount of arrears and pay it out, whether weekly or in another way. At least he should be informed of his entitlements and how long it might take to pay. He should be given certainty because it is unfair. People must go through rigorous tests and many hoops and loops. He has a genuine disability. Iarraim ar an Aire é sin a dhéanamh. I know social welfare officers do their best but they are understaffed. I know significant changes have occurred in social welfare and it is a pity. I thank the Minister for her stewardship of the Department. She does not have an easy role and her partners in government do not have the same values as she does. She is a member of the old Labour Party I knew and she is trying to live up to those ideals. She is serving the Department and the country with a modicum of respect and dignity and she is fighting her corner in Cabinet to ensure moneys are voted for this very difficult area in these very difficult times. I agree with previous speakers that these reforms should have been made years ago but various Ministers did not do so, including some from the party of which I was a member. I accept this. Photographic identification should have been introduced yonks ago because it will stop the myths and rumours about people flying out of the country and collecting social welfare and rudaí mar sin. It is only right that those who deserve social welfare and those who have paid their way, paid stamps and are entitled to it received full support. If there are fraudsters and chancers, of which there are a minority in every walk of life, they must be dealt with stringently particularly with regard to free travel. Why should they defraud this wonderful service and deny others the privilege of travelling? Mar focal scoir, just again gabhaim mo bhuíochas don Aire as an sár obair atá á déanamh aici gach lá.
#TomFleming	unknown-#TomFleming-party	unknown-#TomFleming-dob	unknown-#TomFleming-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-05-30 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	186	The Bill allows us to address many anomalies whereby the long-term unemployed find it extremely difficult or impossible in many cases to return to the workforce. Graduates are also finding it difficult to get on the jobs ladder. The stark reality is that 25% of our third level graduates are unemployed. This cannot be allowed to continue. Thousands of well-skilled and educated people, including those with qualifications in construction, engineering, information technology and science, and highly qualified nurses have left our shores in droves in recent years. This is a huge drain of our best resources. We have wonderful talented people but in many cases they had no option but to pack up and leave and try their hand in far-off shores. We must get back to basics and shows some light at the end of the tunnel for this sector of society. Addressing this matter is paramount to the requirements of lifting the country out of the doldrums. In the short term we must address this neglect which is demoralising for our citizens who see no hope on the horizon. A recent survey and audit was carried out by Brightwater on the deficiencies in our IT sector with regard to suitably qualified computer programmers. It stated a large factor in the shortfall was that the focus in our colleges was too much on theory and not enough on practice. Another major deficiency according to the survey was that the universities teach old computer languages which are outdated. We are languishing far behind the modern world and this is pitiful. The rest of the developed world is leaps and bounds ahead of us and we are failing to keep up with the growing demands of this vital sector which is the real growth area in the world economy.The stark reality is that the foreign direct investment companies which have invested in the IT sector are reasonably satisfied because it gives their management and other staff a higher quality of life. It is a good environment in which to do business and interact socially. We have a lot going in our favour but we need to work on this matter and bring it up to speed to meet the demands. Such companies are starting off with a number of qualified staff and gradually train new recruits. It has now reached the stage where, before they come into this country, companies want suitably qualified people in place and available to work. Unfortunately, as the Minister knows, there is a shortfall of approximately 5,000 staff who are needed for the IT sector. This problem has been staring us in the face for the last four or five years. A further 10,000 such people will need to come on stream in the near future. It is pitiful and shameful that there are 430,000 on the live register, while we are falling down dramatically in this area. While we will not solve the problems overnight, a number of factors need to be brought together in this regard. IT is such a growth industry so this shortfall of trained staff will not be accepted in future. These companies are now demanding the availability of fully trained staff as a priority even before they relocate here. Anything up to 15,000 staff will be needed in the near future. It is a poor reflection on our educational enterprise policy which does not appear to have any joined-up thinking. There is potential to treble the projected figure by perhaps going up to 45,000 or 50,000 over the next five years. That would certainly put a big dent in our unemployment figures. Recently a small Dublin firm, which was started from nothing by an entrepreneur, was employing five computer programmers. The boss of the company needed to build that number up to at least 25, but he had to move abroad due to the lack of qualified staff here. People with the necessary experience were not available so he relocated to Poland where there is widespread availability of suitably qualified staff. The entrepreneur immediately recruited 20 extra staff and now has a small enterprise going there with 25 full-time viable jobs. That is typical of what is happening here at the moment. That company's owner upped sticks and is now flourishing elsewhere with a view to further expansion. The good thing is that his headquarters are still in Dublin, which at least leaves room for some optimism that he may come back in the future, bringing that experience with him. We will have to provide the right environment here, however, to ensure that such people will be welcome in this country. We must be receptive to such firms and ensure that all the necessary facilities are in place to encourage entrepreneurship of that nature. One can imagine what little confidence direct foreign investors have when a native entrepreneur is forced to leave due to our deficiencies. The Minister for Social Protection should liaise with her fellow Ministers, including Deputy Bruton and Deputy Quinn, on this matter. She should rein in all the stakeholders, including the new education and training boards, and second and third-level institutions, to deal with this void in our economy. This must be done if we are to have any chance of reviving the situation over the next five years and making progress in reducing our huge unemployment figures. We need to get a better skills match between industry's needs and third-level graduates. That matter needs to be addressed by any proposed initiatives. The transition from social protection schemes to training and upskilling for jobs should be seamless. Entitlements should be provided automatically. Databases should match up so that more immediate interaction can be achieved within existing computer systems. It is annoying for people who may be finishing a training scheme but who do not have full-time work, not to receive payments automatically. I know that efforts have been made in that respect but I have seen a few cases where payments did not come straight through for welfare recipients, so their families had to support them in the meantime. There have been big reductions in the farm assist scheme, as was mentioned earlier. If a person's €160 payment is reduced to €100 over two years it can mean the loss of some quality of life, particularly with children to support. The Minister should re-examine the farm assist scheme, given the dramatic reductions and the extreme weather conditions which, as we are all well aware, have hit the farming community. The Minister should also examine other schemes such as those for the disabled and carers. In addition, the self-employed are finding it very difficult to access social welfare payments even after paying stamps for years. I hope that matter will be rectified. I know the Minister has established a board to deal with it.

#GeraldNash	unknown-#GeraldNash-party	unknown-#GeraldNash-dob	unknown-#GeraldNash-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-05-30 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	189	I am glad of the opportunity publicly to welcome this Bill. It contains many measures which are long overdue and which were, unfortunately, overlooked or ignored for many years by previous Administrations. One area of the Bill deals specifically with jobseeker's payments to retained firefighters. This is a subject of particular interest to me. It has been raised with me on many occasions and with other colleagues in the House. County Louth, including places like Carlingford, was one of the areas where many retained firefighters did not receive payments to which, I believe, they were justly entitled. It is an indictment of the state of our social protection system under previous administrations that this situation was allowed to develop in the first place. In one part of the country, retained firefighters received their payments without any fuss, while elsewhere they were effectively blocked as the regime was interpreted differently depending on what rules were applied by deciding officers. Nobody in this House needs to be reminded of the important role carried out by retained firefighters across the country. Their function is essential, particularly in rural areas, and as back-up to full-time staff in urban stations such as those in Drogheda and Dundalk in my constituency. We should not be putting obstacles in the way of them fulfilling their duties. When I first raised this issue with the Minister for Social Protection, following my election to the Dáil, she was very sympathetic to the plight of retained firefighters. She grasped straight away the importance of correcting this particular anomaly. I am glad that we now have what could be described as a sensible and fair solution, whereby retained firefighters can receive jobseeker's payment subject of course to the normal requirements. They will no longer be disadvantaged as a result of the fact that they are required to reside in close proximity to their stations, which would limit alternative employment opportunities.There is no doubting their desire and availability for full-time employment but if this situation had not been resolved in the context of this legislation, we could have ended up with the ludicrous situation of telling dedicated firefighters that they should sit at home rather than serve their communities because they would not be adequately and justly rewarded for doing so. To continue to operate such an unclear system at the mercy of deciding officers was unjust, unfair and very frustrating. This measure allows the State to support the retained firefighters who are as well trained and committed to the fire service as the full-time colleagues beside whom they serve. There is no doubting that. In the absence of such a measure contained in this Bill, we could have feasibly ended up with a situation where retained firefighters denied access to appropriate social welfare supports could have exited the service entirely having had thousands of euro of taxpayers' money spent on their training. This would have been a complete waste of their time and taxpayers' money. I pay tribute to the Minister and the determined way she has addressed this issue and the departmental staff who have dedicated significant time to assisting the Minister to resolve this issue. This provision of the Bill is a very positive development and I congratulate the Minister, Department and this House, which I hope will see fit to support this aspect of the Bill in supporting rural communities in particular which very much depend on the retained firefighters and the dedicated service they provide.
#AnnPhelan	unknown-#AnnPhelan-party	unknown-#AnnPhelan-dob	unknown-#AnnPhelan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-05-30 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	190	I thank the Ceann Comhairle for allowing me to participate in this debate. There is no doubt this Bill will give effect to a number of social welfare and pension reforms, with changes in liability for PRSI contributions, broadening the PRSI base, changes to the jobseeker’s payment scheme, enhanced identity authentication requirements for claiming social welfare and the changes in the Government structure of the Pensions Board. First I compliment the Minister on working towards what I believe she hopes to achieve, a modern social welfare system that is trying to build in flexibility. While our social welfare system is huge and turns very slowly, and it takes a very long time to make changes to it, the Minister is trying to make the social welfare system fit for purpose and I hope to be able to help her in those endeavours. Like my colleague, I congratulate the Minister on solving the situation for the retained firefighters. A number of them are in my constituency and I felt very sorry for most of them. I have made representations on behalf of a number of retained firefighters and some have had to endure financial hardships. As a result, many have accumulated severe debt through mortgage arrears, credit card debt, household expenses and, in some cases, very severe medical expenses. All of this is because they were classed by the Department as “not being openly available for full-time work.” I was recently approached by a retained fire officer who informed me that he was due to undergo a review by the Department regarding his entitlement to jobseeker's benefit. Because of the arduous nature of the process over nine months ago, he became extremely negative towards the State. He claimed that at this stage, the process had become so complicated, time consuming and stressful, he was seriously considering resigning his post in the fire service to go on jobseeker's allowance altogether. It was no longer worth the hassle for him or for his family who were really struggling with their expenses. In light of this case and others I represent in similar circumstances, I am pleased the Minister has taken all of our representations on board and has seen fit to incorporate a provision within this Bill to ensure all retained firefighters are exempt from having to satisfy the sub-loss rule, and that any days of employment when they are firefighting will not reduce their jobseeker’s claim. Regarding availability for work, I am delighted the proximity clause in itself does not render a claimant unavailable for full-time employment provided they are genuinely seeking work. On this basis, retained firefighters will be able to re-qualify continually for jobseeker's benefit as they will not have to suffer a sub-loss, even in situations where firefighting is their main employment. The new jobseeker’s allowance transition announced by the Minister is another welcome addition. The Department recognises that it would be very difficult for some lone parents to meet the conditionality attached to the jobseeker’s allowance which requires recipients to be available for, and genuinely seeking, full-time work. Under the new arrangement, unemployed lone parents with a youngest child aged between seven and 14 years will not have to fulfil this requirement. I have long thought that education is the great equaliser and am delighted the Minister sees it this way too. This Bill allows for lone parents to engage with education, training and employment supports to help them upskill and make them more job-ready for when they can dedicate more time to the labour force. This Bill will exempt former one-parent family recipients from having to be genuinely seeking employment, available for employment and proving unemployment, but who satisfy the jobseeker’s allowance means test. These reforms will allow parents to access and avail of part-time work, which is more suitable to a particular moment in their lives. That is what is required. I am delighted with this flexibility and I compliment the Minister on introducing it because I have always believed we needed this in our social welfare system. We must introduce a scheme that self-employed people can pay into. We must learn the lessons from the Celtic tiger. There are any number of people who have suffered very badly. They have to pay into it but we must devise a scheme where they will be able to avail of that.
#ArthurSpring	unknown-#ArthurSpring-party	unknown-#ArthurSpring-dob	unknown-#ArthurSpring-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-05-30 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	191	I compliment the Minister on doing an excellent job in her portfolio in unprecedentedly difficult times for our economy. The element of fairness is upheld in this Bill. Comparison with EU countries suggests Ireland's system of social transfers is the most effective in reducing poverty. When we look at social welfare we often think of the fact that 2.2 million people in Ireland are in receipt of some form of social welfare out of a population of 4.5 million, yet we often forget we have to protect those with the very least in society. There are many good parts to this Bill and a lot of sense is being spoken on it on all sides of the House. My two party colleagues who spoke before me spoke about the firefighters and the fact that we are addressing an anomaly that has stood in this House and the country for years without being addressed. Particular praise needs to go to Deputy Stagg because he has pursued this for years before many of us became politicians. There is also an element of truth about this because fraud is an element in all societies. Unfortunately, we are trying to address a situation where €700 million can be saved. I welcome that and the Department is doing a good job. The fact that 250,000 identity cards have gone out is very welcome and will mean that people will feel under scrutiny when they attend a social welfare office. It will not be overly burdensome but appropriately so. I encourage the Minister to pursue the concept of the pensioners in line with what is being done with the Passport Office. Rather than bringing every pensioner in and trying to provide them with an identity card, she should work with the Passport Office to see if she can produce a card for the pensioners and give them a level of access to the identity system too.I would like to see these ever so slightly improved. The issue of pharmacists is one that affects my area in particular. They do great work in small communities, often in large areas that can be uncared for by local authorities due to the current strains on the system.  The self-employed still need more care. Any self-employed person who comes to my office seeking help has not been getting fair treatment at the level society would wish for them. Those who have had their fingers burnt as a result of being self-employed are not inclined to start another enterprise, which is not a productive measure of society. The Pathways to Work scheme is welcome and so is the stabilising of social insurance, jobseeker's transition and pension payments. As Deputy Ann Phelan noted, the lone parent's access to education and the capacity for flexibility within the system are excellent.  If I may, I will bring the attention of the Minister to the Social Welfare and Pensions Act 2011 because it is my belief we need to address part of that Act. At present people retire from private employment at 65 years of age, as per contract, but because the State pension will now not kick in until they are 66 there will be a gap of a year during which the transitionary pension will not be in place. I have been contacted by a number of people, in particular some who have been working on the factory floor in the Kerry Group, who have approached the management, seeking to have either an extension of their work or an option to retire later, a provision they do not have. We cannot ask a person who has been working for 45 or, in some cases, 47 years, to retire and go on jobseeker's benefit. There needs to be an incremental process whereby people are allowed to retire in this way. Otherwise we must bring in the Congress of Trade Unions and employers' agencies such as IBEC, with the Government standing by, and work out a way whereby people can work longer or else be given the option to have a State pension without having to go on jobseeker's benefit. Much of the work that is spoken of is physically intense and the capacity to do a similar job to the one previously held is limited for people aged 65 or 66 years of age. This must be addressed rather quickly. I believe there is an appetite within congress and some employers realise such people have passive knowledge built up through work experience that cannot be brought in by younger people. I ask the Minister to address that. I realise it is not pertinent to the current Bill but it is pertinent and the deadline is upon us.
#SeanKenny	unknown-#SeanKenny-party	unknown-#SeanKenny-dob	unknown-#SeanKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-05-30 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	192	This Bill provides for the implementation of a number of changes to social welfare schemes announced in budget 2012, including the welcome changes to the one parent family payment. In addition, the Bill provides for a number of amendments to the Social Welfare Consolidation Act 2005 and amendments to the Pensions Act 1990 in respect of the funding standard which applies to defined benefit pension schemes. The changes require defined benefits pension schemes to hold a risk reserve to meet the scheme funding requirements. Section 6 amends and extends the list of bodies that are specified in Schedule 5 of the Social Welfare Consolidation Act 2005 as being authorised to use the personal public service number, or PPSN, for the purposes of carrying out transactions with members of the public, for sharing personal data and information for the purposes of carrying out transactions, and for exchanging data. I welcome this initiative, which is long overdue.  Section 7 extends the list of weekly social welfare payments that are excluded from the general disqualification for receiving a weekly social welfare payment, where a person is also participating on a community employment scheme. At present, participation on a CE scheme does not affect a person’s entitlement to rent supplement payable under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme. Section 7 provides that participation on a CE scheme will not affect a person’s entitlement to mortgage interest supplement or to the diet supplement, payable under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme. Part 3 provides for the necessary amendments to the Pensions Act 1990 to give effect to the Government's decision to introduce a risk reserve into the funding standard. The funding standard needs to be met by defined benefit pension schemes to ensure that the pension scheme can live up to its pension promise. This is intended to improve the sustainability of pension schemes and the security of members’ benefits and provide a buffer against the volatility of financial markets. The measure will allow pension schemes a long lead-in time to develop the required level of risk reserve. The level of risk reserve will be linked to the level of risk the pension scheme is carrying in terms of its investment strategy. The existing funding standard provisions in Part 4 of the Act, which require pension schemes to maintain sufficient assets to meet the liabilities of a scheme, will be extended to require pension schemes to hold a risk reserve. The trustees of pension schemes are currently required to submit an actuarial funding certificate to the Pensions Board to indicate whether the scheme satisfies the funding standard. If it does not do so, the trustees are required to submit a funding proposal to the board to restore scheme funding. The amendments to the Pensions Act will now, in addition to the submission of an actuarial funding certificate, require the trustees of a pension scheme to submit an actuarial funding reserve certificate.  Section 12 also provides that a working director with a shareholding of 50% or more in a company will not be regarded as being insurable as an employed contributor in the company. Company directors holding 50% or more of the shareholding of a company are not normally regarded as falling within a normal employer-employee relationship and are therefore, deemed not to be employed under a contract of service and liable for PRSI class A contributions, namely, as an employee. Instead, such company directors are deemed to be employed under a contract for services and to be liable for PRSI class S contributions, something I very much welcome. There are a number of measures to broaden the income base for PRSI in order to ensure the stability of the social insurance fund so that it can continue to pay the pensions and benefits required by those who need them. A number of these measures were provided for in the Social Welfare Act 2012, including an increase in the minimum level of annual contribution from the self-employed, from €253 to €500.  I join my colleagues in welcoming the eligibility for social welfare payments of part-time fire-fighters. Believe it or not, people have been struggling to get this for more than 40 years and it is welcome it has now been achieved. This is a very good Bill and I commend it to the House.

"Miscellaneous provisions" in the title of a Bill is generally the parliamentary term for the kitchen sink, with everything thrown in on top. At the beginning of any social welfare Bill, however, it is appropriate to pay tribute to the staff of the Department of Social Protection who work throughout the country and deal every day with people who are under huge pressure. They deal with us, too, and the telephone inquiry lines of the Department are a model for other organisations of Government as to how to facilitate us. As I always do, I appeal to the Minister to try to deal with the backlog of social welfare appeals - to provide the extra staff required in that area. None of us are happy with a situation where social welfare appeals are running behind, in some areas, by 14 or 15 months. I know the Minister has put extra people in place and that a particular cadre is what is required, but we must address that issue. There are some welcome elements of the Bill. I welcome in particular the extension of PRSI. In this country we have a difficulty with entrepreneurship and business. We still do not give appropriate - or enough - support to entrepreneurs and do not give them enough encouragement as they go about creating their business. In particular we do not support them when it does not work out. This is not political, it is cultural. We love to celebrate failure in this country and love to throw at a person that his or her business did not work out. If we are to move on as a country we have to support people. The current situation is that many people who were employers during the so-called boom times are now in a worse situation than those they used to employ because the system is not designed to help them. Deputy Spring referred to this. It is not good enough. The people who contributed substantial money in taxes and PRSI are now left out and cannot access a payment because, in many cases, they are not entitled to one. Even if they are so entitled, because of properties they have that are worthless at this stage, they cannot get the payment because there is a perceived income arising from the property. We need to look at that situation and encourage people. Schemes such as the back to work one are excellent and need more support and publicity. I welcome the granting of the principle in this legislation that PRSI will be extended to those with an income for a trade or profession. It does not go far enough but at least it is we have opened the door. I welcome the provision for part-time firefighters to receive jobseeker's allowance. Particularly during the spring emergency season for gorse fires, part-time firefighters play an important role. They are not especially well paid for the risks to which they expose themselves and I pay tribute to all who campaigned on this issue. The notion of them not being available for work because they are protecting public safety reminded me of Sir Humphrey and I am glad the matter has finally been addressed. Although the Bill makes provisions for pension reform, we still are not facing up to the pensions time bomb. The Minister and her predecessor have commissioned a series of reports and conferences on the subject and every so often there is a splash on the six o'clock news but then we move on to the next story. We are facing a serious problem down the line as our population structure changes and the proportion of those in need of pensions begins to exceed those at work. Perhaps because we are so busy trying to get through our current difficulties we are not focusing our governmental, societal or personal attention on the pension challenge. The Bill goes some of the way to resolving this issue but in 15 or 20 years time people will retire in the expectation of a pension pot that is no longer available. They will then try to access the social protection system but at that stage it will be too late. The number of retirees will be so great that our system, which is already under pressure, will collapse unless we begin preparing now. It is no bad thing that the age of eligibility has been increased given that people are working longer but the question of how Ireland Inc. pays for pensions remains to be addressed. There is no sense in planning for our economic recovery if we ignore the elephant in the room because adequate pensions provisions are essential to ensuring our recovery is sustainable. In the spirit of miscellaneous provisions, I would like to raise a number of issues relating to social protection. It was wrong to cut farm assist in December. The Minister of State, Deputy White, will not be familiar with farm assist.

Their situation has deteriorated even further because they have experienced the worst six months of weather and an unprecedented fodder crisis. We speak about these issues frequently in this Chamber but the national conversation does not appear to take account of the seriousness of the crisis facing farm families. While there has been growth in some parts of the country, farm families have maxed out their credit with co-ops and banks and are no longer in a position to buy supplies. The decision to cut the only protection for those on low farm incomes needs to be reviewed ahead of the budget in October. In her first Social Welfare Bill, the Minister increased the number of contributions required for pensions. This had a particular impact on women who were returning to the workplace after raising their families and many find themselves short of the full pension to which they are entitled. All of us have encountered this issue through our constituency offices and will have attempted to track contributions over a period of 40 or 50 years to make up for gaps in employment. This was an incorrect decision on the part of the Minister and we are seeing what it has done for the sake of saving a few euro per week. It tells the people concerned that their work is not as important as those who managed to get out before the change. In fairness to these women who have done the balancing act in terms of raising their families and working to put their children through college, the number of required contributions needs to be reviewed. I am concerned about the impact of the move to cashless payments on those who are most dependent on social welfare, namely, older people. Many of them are still uncomfortable with cashless payments and prefer to receive the cash in their hands. At times I do not blame them for this. The change will also have an impact on our post office network. The Minister explained the ongoing tendering process in response to a parliamentary question I tabled two weeks ago, but she did not reassure me in this regard and I will also be raising the subject as a Topical Issue with the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources. Has the Government given any thought to what will happen to our post office network if it loses the social protection contract for cash payments? These payments are what keep most post offices open and they comprise 60% to 70% of the business of many rural post offices. If that business is given to some other operation at the end of this year or we move to the era of cashless payments, we will lose our post office network. I refer not only to small post offices, but also ones in relatively large towns because the traditional postal business has changed so much that they depend on these contracts to remain open. I am aware that reports have been commissioned and that Deputy Tom Hayes's committee has produced a report on the matter, but I do not get the sense that the Government realises the imminence of this threat. There is much to support in this Bill but we need to open the door further in terms of extending PRSI to those earning incomes from trade. Even if it means forcing individuals to pay contributions, at least the current generation of entrepreneurs will be in a position to get a payment to carry them through the down times. We need to encourage the spirit of getting back on the horse after a fall. However, the elephant in the room for our country is the pension time bomb. The Bill suggests a plan but it does not go far enough in terms of raising the alarm.
#SimonHarris	unknown-#SimonHarris-party	unknown-#SimonHarris-dob	unknown-#SimonHarris-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-05-30 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	199	I welcome the opportunity to speak on the Social Welfare and Pensions (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2013. I agree with the comments by Deputies Calleary and Spring in regard to the self-employed and welcome the first step the Bill takes to rectifying the anomaly whereby those who take a chance and try to establish a business are left without a safety net if they fall on difficult times. I look forward to a prompt report from the expert group established by the Minister so that the Government can act at the earliest opportunity. I also welcome the provisions in the Bill on retained firefighters. In many areas of the country, including my own county of Wicklow, people generously give of their time for small or nominal sums of money in order to protect communities in times of emergency. It was a bugbear for many people that such individuals were deemed ineligible for the jobseeker's payment.  The changes made by the Bill to lone parent supports are particularly welcome. The introduction of a new jobseeker's transition arrangement will allow those who were formerly in receipt of the lone parent family payment to seek part-time work. This has been welcomed as a progressive initiative by organisations like One Family which work with lone parents on a daily basis. One Family has described the new measures as a helpful stepping stone. We do not want a social welfare system with built in poverty traps and in the absence of these reforms we would have run the risk of the lone parent family payment becoming a poverty trap. The proposed transition mechanism will be extremely helpful in enabling single parents to balance their desire or need to work with their caring responsibilities for their children. I commend the measure. I also welcome the measures to tackle fraud, an issue of concern for every taxpayer in this country and one which regularly arises in the Committee of Public Accounts.Measures that require people, where necessary, to visit their local social welfare office to have their photograph taken and provide a signature to be scanned electronically and recorded on their file will go a long way towards cracking down on social welfare fraud. They will also help to ensure that the allocations to social welfare of more than €20 billion passed annually by this House will reach those who need them most and prevent people from engaging in fraud. We need to bring stakeholders with us when introducing social welfare reforms. The Minister provided an excellent template for doing so when dealing with reform of the domiciliary care allowance. Rather than establishing an in-house expert group, she asked representatives of all the stakeholders, including the Carer's Association and groups representing children with autism and the parents of children with special needs, to outline their proposals for changing the domiciliary care allowance system. This process produced excellent proposals for change. We need a similar process to be applied in many other areas of the social welfare system in need of reform. Unfortunately in politics, one tends to hear announcements of rash changes to one or other payment structure at which point we scramble to engage in consultations only to find it is too late. I commend the Minister's efforts to change the domiciliary care allowance and ask her to explore the possibility of extending the model of bringing together all relevant stakeholders when reforming the systems and supports in place for carers.
#TomHayes	unknown-#TomHayes-party	unknown-#TomHayes-dob	unknown-#TomHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-05-30 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	200	I support many of the contributions of previous speakers, especially comments on the fairness of this social welfare legislation. Many families depend solely on social welfare to provide for all their needs. For this reason, the Government has protected core social welfare rates in successive budgets. As the Minister noted, in a time of unprecedented crisis we are standing by those who are most vulnerable. In difficult times, when tough decisions must be made, we must salute the Government for standing by the most vulnerable, namely, the unemployed and those who depend on social welfare payments. I am pleased to note that Ireland's social welfare system ranks highly when compared with other European Union countries. I ask the Minister to clarify how many of the 400,000 people who are registered as unemployed are engaged in some form of work. Is the figure 50,000, 60,000 or perhaps 100,000? This matter needs to be clarified.  It is vital that the Government ensures everything possible is done to enable people who wish to return to work to retrain. Blocklayers, plasterers and other skilled building workers need to be retrained because the construction industry accounts for only a small percentage of gross output. I could cite many projects in my constituency which are unable to find people to engage in training. Only last week, I attended a function in my home town of Cashel at which I met people who could not fill training positions. Something is wrong with the system and the Department should address it.  I concur with Deputy Calleary's comments on the post office network. The Joint Committee on Transport and Communications, which I chair, produced a detailed report on the future of the network. We found that the social welfare contract is one of the key factors keeping post offices open. While I accept the Minister is bound by certain rules and regulations and the need for transparency, given the vital importance of post offices to rural areas, I ask her to ensure social welfare contracts remain with An Post. 
#PaschalDonohoe	unknown-#PaschalDonohoe-party	unknown-#PaschalDonohoe-dob	unknown-#PaschalDonohoe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-05-30 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	201	I welcome the Bill and thank the Minister for attending the debate. This legislation should be placed in the context of employment statistics published by the Central Statistics Office today. The figures are important and deserve comment because they show employment grew for the third quarter in a row and unemployment dipped below 14% for the first time since the crisis began. While we would all like unemployment to be much lower, it is noteworthy that the rate has fallen below 14%. Apart from the top-line figures, another statistic is worthy of comment. It is encouraging that employment levels among people aged 35 years and older are now returning to the levels that existed when the economy was enjoying high growth rates. However, the flipside of this is the position of those aged below 35 years. A recent report by the Economic and Social Research Institute noted that the youngest have borne the brunt of the crisis from which we are emerging. In that context, I welcome the Bill and urge the Minister to continue to focus on certain areas. Some of the recent figures from the Department on the periods people spend on jobseeker's allowance and jobseeker's benefit show that we must redouble our efforts in the area of activation, in other words, helping people return to the employment market by ensuring appropriate incentives are in place. Deputies will be familiar, from their clinics and constituency work, with the despair felt by people who cannot find a job. This feeling is even greater among our constituents who find a job but cannot afford to take it because of the negative impact it would have on their benefits. Typically, the jobs available are either part-time or on the lower end of the wage spectrum. This is particularly relevant given that much of the employment being generated is in the area of part-time work, as is the case in the early stages of recovery in most labour markets.  I urge the Minister to focus on three areas, the first of which is the activation measures to which I referred. Through the Pathways to Work scheme, the Minister is seeking to ensure that everyone in receipt of a jobseeker's payment will be contacted regularly by someone providing assistance in finding a job. The purpose of this approach is not to harass people but to help them by ensuring they receive appropriate training and are given good advice. The second area on which I urge the Minister to continue her work is rent allowance. In some cases, people find they lose more in rent allowance than they gain from taking up employment. The third issue I ask the Minister to address is to ascertain the impact of taking up employment on the social welfare benefits of the household as opposed to the individual entering the workforce. We want to ensure that taking a job pays and that, as the recovery accelerates, it delivers jobs for those who need them most.

Given that speaking time is short, I will focus on a couple of specific points. Section 15 amends the Civil Registration Act 2004. The Minister has promised on a number of occasions to introduce legislation to deal with an issue that is not covered in the section.I understand that the heads of the Bill may already have been prepared. We are in the midst of the holiday season and people die while overseas. I and my colleague, Deputy Tom Hayes, have raised this matter on a number of occasions and Deputy Kyne has drafted a Private Members' Bill in respect of it. I am of the view that we have missed an opportunity in the context of dealing with this matter in the legislation before the House. We could have amended the Civil Registration Act to allow for details of the deaths of Irish citizens which occur overseas as a result of accidents, etc. to be recorded in this country. I agree with Deputy Donohoe that the figures which have been produced are excellent. This is an issue about which we should be talking much more, particularly in the context of the positive aspects relating to it. The matter I want to refer to and which is not dealt with in the Bill relates to those who are self-employed. The statistics released earlier today show a 4.3% increase in the number of people who are self-employed. We all support the concept of entrepreneurs starting up their own businesses. However, there is no safety net for these people if their businesses fail. In America, people whose business fail are encouraged to start again, but in this country there is no safety net. Therefore, young entrepreneurs whose businesses fail cannot rely on the social welfare system for support. A number of countries throughout Europe have opt-in systems whereby people can make additional PRSI contributions so that if their businesses fail, they can obtain some form of social welfare payment. There is a need for such a system or safety net in this country. I am aware the Minister is awaiting a report on this matter. I hope that when she receives it, she will be in a position to act as quickly as possible in order that there will be a safety net for self-employed people. In the coming five to ten years, it is these individuals who will be creating jobs for the next generation of school leavers. I hope the Minister will consider the points I have raised. I welcome the Bill and I also welcome the figures that were published this morning. Those figures prove that the various job innovation schemes that have been put in place are guiding people back towards work. The latter will definitely put our economy on the right track in the years ahead.
#HeatherHumphreys	unknown-#HeatherHumphreys-party	unknown-#HeatherHumphreys-dob	unknown-#HeatherHumphreys-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-05-30 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	203	I welcome the opportunity to contribute to the debate on the Social Welfare and Pensions (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2013. I wish to address three main aspects of the Bill, namely, the fact that it will provide part-time firefighters with equal rights in respect of jobseeker's benefit, the support it provides in the context of assisting single parents to return to work, and the issue of PPS numbers. In the past two years I have received many representations from retained firefighters in Monaghan and Cavan outlining their frustration at being turned down for jobseeker's benefit on the grounds that they were not available for and seeking work. The Bill provides that a retained firefighter who is on call will be deemed to satisfy the available for work condition. It also provides that any days of employment as a firefighter will not lead to an individual's weekly jobseeker's benefit payment being reduced. If a person works five days as a firefighter, he or she will also receive five days' worth of jobseeker's benefit. I commend the Minister on taking action and addressing this long-standing anomaly. As everyone is aware, retained firefighters play a vital role within their communities. The legislation will ensure their jobseeker's payments will not be reduced in any way. I welcome the establishment of the jobseeker's transition scheme, the aim of which is to support lone parents and assist them in returning to the labour market. This scheme will allow former recipients of the one-parent family payment whose youngest child is under the age of 14 to receive the full support of the Department's activation services in returning to work, education or training. It is critical that we should provide this support to lone parents because they must traverse many difficult hurdles when trying to return to work. Many lone parents will have been out of work for a considerable period and any attempt to return to training or further education must be weighed against the prospect of high child care costs. In some instances, people may not be able to pursue training courses or schemes as a result of such costs. Essentially, therefore, they are trapped. The Bill will afford lone parents the flexibility they require. Under the transition scheme, lone parents will draw up personal development plans in conjunction with their case officers. These plans will identify suitable education, training and employment programmes that will enhance their skill sets and better equip them to return to the workplace. The scheme will also allow lone parents to seek part-time work if this better suits their family circumstances rather than being obliged to be available for and seeking full-time employment. This is a common-sense and practical approach on the part of the Minister because seeking full-time employment is simply not a possible for some lone parents. I welcome the fact that the Bill extends the list of bodies authorised to use PPS numbers to include the Insolvency Service of Ireland, Quality and Qualifications Ireland and payment service providers authorised by the Revenue Commissioners to collect the local property tax. Will the Minister consider extending the list further to allow PPS numbers to be used in the compilation of the electoral register? Such a move would greatly improve the accuracy of that register. As Deputies are aware, the register is currently full of inaccuracies. I would welcome it if the Minister would allow for the use of PPS numbers in this way because it would be of major assistance in the context of the electoral register. I welcome the Bill and I commend the Minister on the proactive approach she has taken in addressing the matters with which it deals.

There is an impression that they are on the dole because they do not want to do anything else. It might have been possible to make statements to that effect in the 1980s without people being in a position to contradict it definitively. However, we can contradict them definitively now because the majority of those who are unemployed were working when there was work available. They are not unemployed because they are lazy, it is because they cannot obtain employment. The Minister referred to getting people back to work, which is essential. However, one of the most important aspects in that regard is to create the environment whereby employment opportunities will be available for them. If such opportunities are created, there will be no need to push people out the door to get them to work. They will do so under their own steam, regardless of whether it is because they are sick of looking at repeats of "Dr. Phil" on television or as a result of the fact that they do not have a red cent in their pockets. These people want to work. It is as simple as that. I meet them in my office all the time. A couple of weeks ago I met a man - a big individual - who had tears running down his face and who informed me that he was going insane at home. He had spent six years on a FÁS scheme, which is the maximum period allowable. The man in question is a machine driver and he was wiling to remain on the scheme for no pay but it was not possible to obtain any work for him. This is also a mental health issue. People are suffering because, on top of everything else, they are bored. I know the Minister is aware of that fact. In light of the mental health aspect, there is a need for action. It has been stated that the level of unemployment is decreasing. One of the major reasons for this is because people are leaving the country in their droves. This cannot be denied. If those who emigrated had not done so, the unemployment figures would not have fallen. If the country was hit by a tsunami tomorrow and if half the population was wiped out as a result, the Government would come along in a couple of weeks and inform us that the unemployment figures had decreased. This would, of course, be due to the fact that half the population had been killed, which is not really how one would want to reduce unemployment. Why not try to keep people in the country while reducing the level of unemployment? People would like to remain in this country because they like it here. It is not for reasons of leisure that they are going abroad.The 19 out of 20 people in my and my wife's households who emigrated did so because they had no choice. However, it appears that, by tinkering with the system, the Government is taking positive strides towards making it more likely that entrepreneurs will create work, in that they will not be denied social welfare. As everyone agrees, people who are of an entrepreneurial spirit should be encouraged. When they visit my office, their story is that, even though the people next door to them did not even work during the boom, those people are getting something while the entrepreneurs are getting nothing. The Minister needs to change this situation quickly. It is not on and does not encourage people to create work when I am sure that she would only be delighted to encourage them. When trying to return to work, many of the entrepreneurs in question - I am sure that they visit other Deputies - apply for contracts to build something or other, but are told that they cannot because they do not have turnovers of hundreds of thousands of euro. It is a catch-22 situation - even though they are well qualified to do the work, they are knocked out on the basis that they have not been working and do not have the turnover. If anything can be done to change this unfair situation, please do it. Harmac Medical Products - I am unsure as to whether I can mention its name - employs hundreds of people in my town of Castlerea. Its HR section asked me to highlight the fact that it has been trying unsuccessfully to fill 12 part-time positions for the past six months. It is easy to criticise and get PR from running down the Government, but if it is doing something good, it deserves praise. I hope that its plan for single parents will help. Harmac Medical Products is offering five hours per day, three days per week during the hours when kids are at school and parents have some spare time. They would be paid €187 for their 15 hours and would still be able to mind their kids. Perhaps it would be useful for someone else in the social welfare system. I am unsure as to how this approach fits with what the Government plans for single parents, but I hope that it would rectify the situation. There is a problem with the social welfare system in general, namely, it is so rigid that one is not even allowed to get one hour of work per day without losing one's payments. This situation needs to change. The company is offering other positions. These involve working two 12-hour shifts at the weekend at €12.50 per hour, which is not the minimum wage. This work is worth €300 per week, but the company cannot find people to take these positions because working more than 19 hours per week removes one's entitlement to a social welfare payment. This is the company's understanding of the situation. The social welfare system needs to be changed to cater for such situations. If a few hours of gainful work were available without impacting on social welfare payments, no social welfare recipient would turn them down. Perhaps we should consider a suggestion made by the Jesuits' Milltown Institute and Fr. Seán Healy years ago. I presume they are still pushing the same idea of a guaranteed basic income. Some people will trash this and question how every adult could be guaranteed a minimum payment. If someone had earnings from additional work, the guaranteed income would be taxed to the point that he or she would not actually get it. If an unemployed person - someone in receipt of a social welfare payment - had a guaranteed basic income, one could take up a job because one would be gaining all of the time. There would be implications for the tax system, leading to higher taxes in certain respects, but no one would be disincentivised from working. If someone had a money-making idea, one would not need to worry about losing more money than one would make. The system would be less rigid. I do not have anything close to all of the answers, but this idea needs to be discussed. As the Minister is well aware, places like Castlerea have dire unemployment levels. At the same time, there is work that people cannot accept. The Minister must address this issue. Not only would she increase people's incomes, she would improve their self-esteem by allowing them to add to their communities. They would also pay tax. I do not agree with people who claim that we must consider taxpayers as if they are separate from the unemployed. It is as though the latter do not give anything to society. We should be looking out for citizens in general. Something needs to be done to make it possible for people to accept casual work without losing their social welfare payments. A Deputy mentioned the cut to farm assist payments. Negotiations on the Common Agricultural Policy, CAP, are well advanced. If proposals by organisations such as the United Farmers Association, UFA, were listened to and payments under the policy were capped at €35,000 per farmer, close to €92 million would be returned to the less well-off farmers. By providing them with this income, the State would save money in terms of farm assist. These savings could be put towards smaller farmers under pillar 2, as I am dubious that the Government can find the matching funds otherwise. Overall, there would be a better package for everyone. A major mistake was made when the Government cut the fuel allowance. Genuinely, I have no problem with the Government cutting its own costs in this regard, but it did not seem to be open to other ideas. For example, if it provided the money to people in single lump sums, they could get better value and there would be no additional cost to the State. Someone could purchase a few trailer loads of turf or, with a big lump of money in hand, get a better deal from a co-op on cheaper briquettes. I know this for a fact. While saving money, the State would not increase the person's hardship. I would love to see the Government pursue this idea next time. A number of people have attended my office about the idea of front-loading social welfare payments so that they could start businesses instead of staying on social welfare indefinitely. People's reluctance to take up courses has been mentioned. Who knows why they might be reluctant, but one can surmise that they do not view training as relevant or believe that they will get anything out of it at the end. Training for training's sake is demoralising. We need to get away from that approach. It has been stated that we need to train people who used to be in the building industry to do other jobs. That is 100% correct. In the past week, I heard in the news that the Government was considering investing €1 billion in shovel-ready projects. Many of the projects in question might be important, but is it not time to stop viewing projects that involve concrete as the only work that is shovel ready?There are many shovel-ready projects that do not involve building or using a shovel. There are shovel-ready projects involving work with young people and the provision of youth services. Several youth organisations have come to me and said their funding has been cut. We cut their funding, reduce the amount of people working with them and then we use the money for more building. Have we not done enough building in this country for a while? Could we not start thinking about shovel-ready projects that will help people in more ways than just getting them mixing concrete? The Minister must examine that as well. That is what I have to say on the Bill. I hope my tuppence worth is worth something to the Minister.
#BrendanRyanDublin	unknown-#BrendanRyanDublin-party	unknown-#BrendanRyanDublin-dob	unknown-#BrendanRyanDublin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-05-30 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	207	I welcome the opportunity to speak on this Bill in the House today. There are many provisions in the Bill on which I could comment but I will concentrate on just a few. Like others, I welcome the change in the Bill which ensures that part-time or retained firefighters will no longer miss out on jobseeker's payments because of a requirement that they reside near their stations. The practical solution put forward in the Bill will ensure that the proximity clause in itself does not render a claimant unavailable for full-time employment under the welfare code, provided they meet the other welfare requirements. This is a practical solution to a problem successive Governments since 1972 have failed to address. I urge the Minister to issue an immediate memo to the effect that any cases in the system involving retained firefighters that fall foul of existing legislation would be immediately resolved. I wish to see further reforms this year in social protection. We must ensure that unemployed people who perhaps are not entitled to a payment due to their spouse's income, are eligible for further training and internship programmes. I have dealt with a number of cases, usually concerning middle-aged men, who are work-ready but find it difficult to compete with younger and perhaps more mobile jobseekers. We must create a mechanism whereby such jobseekers can apply for training places or for programmes such as JobBridge or Momentum. Activation measures are only useful if they activate all jobseekers, regardless of whether they qualify for a means-tested payment. There is also a cohort of people who expected to be in receipt of a transition pension at the age of 65 but will now have to wait for another year to claim their old age pension. I refer to people aged perhaps between 60 and 65 who are now considered as jobseekers. There should be a formal acknowledgement by the Department of the extra challenges faced by this pre-retirement group when rolling out the Pathways to Work activation measures. I am interested to hear the Minister's plans in this area. Common sense has been applied to one-parent family recipients in the Bill with the roll-out of the new jobseeker's transition scheme. The scheme is an offshoot of jobseeker's allowance and will exempt lone parents from the full rigour of the requirement for those receiving jobseeker's allowance to be available for full-time work. Availability for part-time work will provide full eligibility. The initiative is to be welcomed. In parallel, we must continue to pursue the provision of cost-effective, quality child care arrangements to further support the movement of lone parents back into the workforce. That is something on which I will continue to work and will continue to raise with the Minister and her Cabinet colleagues. The Minister is on record on this matter herself. I welcome her reiteration of the position today. I refer to the enhanced identity authentication requirements for claiming social welfare. It is vital that we strengthen the control of our finite and reducing social welfare expenditure. The issuing of identity cards with biometric photographs and electronic signatures will act as a defence against false claims. However, I urge the Minister to provide assurances that there will be human oversight of the system. We must ensure that should any mistake be made with the new system that results in recipients losing a payment in error, those unfortunate recipients are not bogged down in an appeals process for a payment they should never have lost. Fraudulent claims must be tackled, although not with a heavy-handed approach towards all social welfare recipients. Recent experience leads me to believe that people are guilty until proven innocent when it comes to social welfare investigations. That manifests itself when a person has his or her payment immediately cut off before an investigation or inspection even begins. Such a response can automatically send families into desperate financial situations. I accept that some claims are
fraudulent, but in many cases people are cut off in error. I call on the Minister to review the practice of immediate cut-offs and to replace it with a risk-based approach. I propose a flagging system, whereby, following a risk assessment, an individual may be advised that from a certain date he or she will be under investigation and should the investigation prove an instance of fraud or false claim then the payment will be taken away from the time the investigation began. An innocent until proven guilty system is required. It applies in the courts and we should also apply it in the social welfare system. I wish to refer also to some other matters, some of which are contained in the Bill. A scheme to cater for the self-employed must be brought forward as a matter of urgency. Other speakers have referred to the issue. I welcome the change in the appeal system for the partial capacity payment. The changes to FIS assessments are welcome for lone parents. I hope such changes will in future apply to all FIS recipients. I look forward to the Minister's response on the issue. I congratulate the Minister on her determined efforts and success in resisting efforts to scapegoat social welfare recipients, on protecting the most vulnerable in society and promoting the value of welfare in a Keynesian context.

Like previous speakers I welcome the changes announced by the Minister, especially to the jobseeker's allowance for parents who no longer qualify for a one-parent family payment due to their youngest child reaching the upper age limit. The unemployment transition is a significant and progressive development in a long series of welfare initiatives intended to support families at risk of poverty. In the past 30 years, income support payments were reformed in response to gender equality legislation and to reflect the significant shifts in female labour market participation and social attitudes to the role of women. Measures to encourage lone parents and women married to welfare recipients to take up employment were also introduced in a renewed effort to combat and prevent poverty. Members have different views on the issue but findings, both national and international, are almost unequivocal in stating that employment offers the best protection against poverty. That is very important, most especially to those of us who are part of the labour movement. The jobseeker's transition recognises the challenges in combining full-time paid work and caring when parenting alone and the inadequacies in the current supply of child and after-school care places while at the same time maintaining the goal to lift lone parent families out of poverty through employment. Many views were expressed following last year's budget and especially on the social welfare Bill. I acknowledge the Minister's response to those who were in favour of reforming the system. I commend the Minister in that regard. Nobody can take that from her. Some Members were critical of proceeding with the reduction of the upper age limit when there are so few jobs available. We all recognise that. However, I take a different view because such a mindset belongs to our less enlightened past. Lone parents should have the same rights and responsibilities to compete for jobs and to secure a better quality of life for themselves and their children.
#RayButler	unknown-#RayButler-party	unknown-#RayButler-dob	unknown-#RayButler-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-05-30 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	209	I welcome the Bill and the improvements it provides to certain sectors in respect of social protection. In the course of the debate, many Members have spoken on the subject of entitlements for the self-employed. I have been waiting for the forthcoming report from the departmental working group on the future status of self-employed people and social protection. If this country is to move forward and to create new jobs, the issue of self-employed people and social protection must be considered. In fairness to the Minister, she has been championing the cause. Most self-employed people pay an S-class stamp, which amounts to 4% of their annual earnings and essentially, this entitles them to a contributory pension and nothing else. However, there have been some leaks from the forthcoming report to the effect that were a further 1.5% to be paid, bringing the contribution to 5.5%, it would enable the provision to those concerned of some other entitlements such as illness and disability benefits. This is to be welcomed, as small and medium-sized enterprises, SMEs, are finding it hard at present and their takings are down. Given the recession, this is natural but one must recall that in such cases, if they are making a profit, they will pay income tax on it. If not, they are taking drawings and if such drawings also are taxed, as a self-employed person I would rather look after myself and put something on a stamp than have nothing available, were something to go wrong. Consequently, I welcome the picture that is emerging. I also thank the Minister for lowering the bar for self-employed people and getting some entitlements for them. Since she assumed office, she has been excellent in looking after the self-employed and I urge her to keep it up. Some infrastructure must be put in place for social protection for this group in the future and I look forward to working with the Minister on this matter as a member of the Joint Committee on Education and Social Protection. The issue of self-employed people and social protection must be recognised because while they will get us out of the mess in which we find ourselves, a safety net is required for them in the future.

The Acting Chairman might tell me when nine minutes have elapsed. The Minister, Deputy Burton, may be in attendance in a few weeks' time when Neil Young and Crazy House will entertain us at the RDS. Given the deplorable impact of cutbacks and the great tightening of qualification criteria for social assistance, benefits and pensions since March 2011, I hope the Minister will be able to happily sing along if Neil Young breaks into "Are You Ready for the Country (because it’s time to go)", because the impact of the three budgets since early 2011 has been severe on different and significant cohorts of our most vulnerable citizens, many of whom of course are counting down the days until they have an opportunity to vote in a general election. The conservative media rant on about the €20 billion social welfare spending and always conveniently omit any reference to the Social Insurance Fund and the huge extent to which people directly fund their own benefits and pensions. I note the Minister recently has been talking hopefully about the need to end austerity, following the fine lead given by President Higgins. I hope she is sincere and determined in that belief and will not countenance another series of mean cutbacks in the social welfare budget for 2014, which I understand must be finalised by late July or early August in this first year of the European Union's two pack rules. I believe the Minister should have resigned last year, rather than present the social welfare budget of 2013 and she could have then joined Deputy Shortall and me on these benches. I hope that some of the positive aspects of the Bill indicate the Minister really is determined this time to end austerity for our most vulnerable citizens. As the Minister is aware, the need to ensure we have a solid and reliable social welfare system is the key to supporting individuals and families through this difficult and still recessionary period. Like all Deputies, I frequently meet vulnerable people who really struggle financially. Their experiences with the Department of Social Protection are variable and unfortunately, many of the constituents I meet on a weekly basis - in the same manner as the Acting Chairman and other colleagues who are present - are encountering serious delays in respect of appeals and reviews, which they find to be particularly difficult. For example, I have come across individuals who have been waiting for more than a year for applications for invalidity benefit to be finally decided. Earlier today, I was addressing an invalidity pension application that had not been decided after a period of two and a half years since the first application. While I understand the Department is under strain with the continued baleful influence of austerity on demand and growth in Ireland and with increased numbers of citizens relying on welfare payments, it cannot be acceptable that individuals are waiting for six months and more for an invalidity pension appeal decision, for example. I note from figures the Minister recently supplied to me that there is no backlog in invalidity claims at present. She reported that almost 60% of her Department’s current claims in this regard are awaiting a decision for two months or less. However, the overall rate of processing invalidity appeals must be improved drastically. I also recently asked the Minister about claims for disability allowance and she reported that her Department has completed a major service delivery modernisation programme and that a plan is in place to reduce the backlog of disability claims. I hope this will become evident as Members and the Department deal with people in the coming weeks and months. I had tabled an oral question for the Minister yesterday in respect of one key area, namely, the cuts to rent supplement but unfortunately it was not reached. As the Minister is aware, I asked her about current expenditure and the ultimate impact the cuts in rent supplement rates are having on rent levels. I reiterate that unfortunately, I did not get the opportunity to speak on it but I appreciate the reply the Minister supplied to me. I note she indicated that her Department’s expenditure on rent supplement in 2012 was €423 million but that it has been reduced to €403 million for 2013. Can the Minister confirm that these revised rent limits with which Members are wrestling will be realistic? Yesterday, I was detailing to the Minister of State with responsibility for housing, Deputy Jan O'Sullivan, and to the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Howlin, the huge problem of homelessness in this city of which the Minister is also aware. I refer, for example, to the 20,000 people on Dublin City Council's waiting list, many of whom have moved into homelessness because of decreases in rent supplement payments and no decreases in rents. I raised this issue with the aforementioned Ministers yesterday and appealed to them to campaign for a major public housing investment programme in 2013. I hope this is a proposal that the Minister would also support and that it will come to pass because there is a crisis in this regard. Section 9 amends section 2(1) of the Social Welfare Consolidation Act 2005. It provides that retained fire fighters will be entitled to social welfare payments and I welcome this provision as a support to valued members of the fire services, who consistently deliver a high-quality service. It is welcome that the uncertainty that part-time fire fighters experienced in their entitlement to certain social welfare payments finally has been eliminated. I also welcome the Minister's rethink in producing the measures she has introduced to assist lone parents who are moving from the one-parent family payment to jobseeker’s allowance in section 10. The changes to one-parent family payment, which formed part of the Department's reductions in budget 2013 are profoundly worrying for lone parents who are among the most vulnerable of social welfare recipients and are most at risk of poverty. I agree Members must support those citizens to help themselves to move out of the poverty trap and note the comments of the One Family organisation in that regard. However, it is essential to have in place a system in which employment opportunities are encouraged for lone parents. I have spoken many times to the Minister on the activation programmes in which the Department has been engaged. I acknowledge the Minister spent many years trying to promote such measures at local level. Again, a much more proactive and imaginative approach is required in 2014. However, I recognise the Minister is working to redress the present situation, in which lone parents traditionally have been disincentivised from seeking employment because of the effect this would have on their social welfare payments. Hopefully, all Members recognise the creation of a transitional arrangement for lone parents whose youngest children have reached 14 years is vitally important. Moreover, the Minister must ensure the Department fully supports those parents, who are very stressed and anxious about changes to the one-parent family payment scheme. Lone parents also need support in the form of the provision of child care places. I note from the Minister's speech to the House that she does not believe the child care services have yet been comprehensively reformed to a satisfactory level. The debate Members have had in recent days on this vitally important matter on foot of the "Prime Time" programme might inform Government decisions in a positive way in the latter part of 2013. As the Minister is aware, lone parents are disproportionately affected by cuts to child benefit and the Minister should give a commitment to the House that there will be no further cuts in child benefit in budget 2014. I have always believed that all citizens should have national identity cards, in the form of photo ID, for all interactions with the State, including with gardaí.I remember discussing that matter as transport spokesperson for the Labour Party when the PULSE system was being developed. My preference was a national identity card rather than the date of birth mantra. I welcome section 11 and the role it will play in reducing the level of fraud. I note, however, the recent experience of some of my constituents who are part of the cohort of 230,000 individuals who have already been issued with the new cards. Some of those did not positively engage with the Minister's Department and had their weekly payments stopped until they complied. It needs to ensure compliance but there is concern that citizens are being punished before we pass this legislation. I welcome some of the reforms the Minister is introducing in Part 4 regarding the establishment of the new pensions authority and consequent amendments. However, as the Minister has recognised, there is a need for further major reform, particularly in the fallout from the Waterford Crystal case. This Bill fails to tackle the inequity regarding the division of pension assets among members of pension schemes when defined benefit schemes have been left with a deficit after a company has gone into liquidation. On the subject of pensions we cannot forget our hard-working citizens, particularly women, who are adversely affected by changes in budget 2013 to reckonable contributions to qualify for State pensions. I am aware of senior women who have worked for more than 30 years who discovered that they do not have an entitlement to a full or near full State contributory pension, and they are very upset by that. I broadly welcome some of the provisions contained in the Bill but there are various issues the Minister must address more seriously. I hope that in budget 2014 we will not be faced with another remorseless attack on the most vulnerable people in our society.
#RoisinShortall	unknown-#RoisinShortall-party	unknown-#RoisinShortall-dob	unknown-#RoisinShortall-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-05-30 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	212	The Hogan judgment, which was delivered on 25 April last, has major implications for the operation of defined benefit pension schemes. It is a matter of extreme regret that this Bill does not address the precarious position that so many Irish people find themselves in as a result of being in defined benefit pension schemes, with little or no protection. Legislation was promised to provide such protection as is required but, unfortunately, for some reason that legislation is not contained in this Bill. That is a missed opportunity. Not only does it continue the insecurity for defined benefit pensioners but it also exposes the State to potential significant claims as a result of the failure of successive Governments, including this Government, to provide that necessary legislation. Members of defined benefit schemes currently have no protection whatsoever in legislation and, as a result, they are dependent entirely on the continuing support of their employers to deliver on the pension commitments made in the past but there is no legal obligation on employers to honour those commitments that have been given. I very much welcome the ruling of the European Court of Justice, ECJ. It is a very good ruling for the Waterford Crystal pensioners in particular and it is promising for members of defined benefit, DB, schemes generally as it will provide a greater level of clarity for people in those schemes in the event of a company going into liquidation where the pension scheme is also insolvent. It is the first time I can remember during the current economic crisis when a European institution has found in favour of the people, and in that regard it is to be welcomed. Since the ECJ delivered its judgment in favour of the Waterford Crystal workers there has been little or no constructive engagement by the Government with those workers. In light of that fact the legal team acting for the workers is now in the process of preparing to return to the High Court to see this case out. It is important to point out that the Waterford Crystal workers got positive rulings on all the significant points of law before the ECJ. There is a good deal of optimism among the workers, their legal advisers and their pension advisers regarding the likely outcome of the case when it returns to the High Court, but it is very important that the Government would now decide to address this matter. We know that after the ECJ ruling on the precedent case, the Robins case, the United Kingdom moved swiftly to introduce legislation to provide the kind of protection required and has provided protection to the level of 90% of people's pension entitlements. That addressed the issues that had been raised by the ECJ.  It is incumbent on the Government now to move to deal with this matter. We expected some provision would be made in this Bill to address the precarious position DB pensioners are in but for some reason Government spokespersons, including the Minister for Social Protection, seem to be using this judgment as an excuse for not legislating when the onus is on Government to do the reverse. Given the positive findings of the ECJ on the Waterford Crystal workers case there is an urgent need now for Government to move to legislate to provide the necessary protection, which the UK Government has already done and on which the ECJ has found the Government to be remiss in its responsibility to members of DB schemes. I do not know the strategy the Government is pursuing. The sensible thing to do would be to take account of the fact that all of the ruling has been positive to date, take account of what happened in the Robins case and move to engage at a senior level with representatives of the Waterford Crystal workers to reach an arrangement with those workers to assist them in ensuring that they have an entitlement to a significant percentage of their original pension promises. If, as is expected by most people, the case is won in the High Court the likelihood is that there will be a very significant capital compensation payment demanded of the Government that will result in a very significant expenditure exposure by the Government, estimated to be in the region of €250 million to €300 million. That is likely to be an up-front payment with other associated costs and for that reason the most sensible thing for the Government to do would be to engage with workers to see if a plan can be put in place to meet the likely liabilities in terms of the pensions of the former Waterford Crystal workers. The actuarial advisers to those workers have calculated that the immediate exposure, if such an arrangement was to be reached on the basis of staged payments over the lifetime of those workers, would be in the region of €2.5 million rising to a maximum of approximately €18 million in about 2030. From everybody's point of view - the taxpayer and the Waterford Crystal workers - that would be the most satisfactory outcome if agreement could be reached to secure the pension provisions of the Waterford Crystal workers over their lifetime and also, in the process, reduce the liability of the State and provide the necessary security. If an up-front compensation payment is demanded of the State by the High Court we are then talking about having to buy annuities to secure the future pensions of the Waterford Crystal workers. That would work out far more expensive and, in addition, there would be legal fees associated with further hearings in the High Court. For all those reasons the sensible thing for the Government to do would be to engage with the Waterford Crystal workers and reach an agreement on the way their pension provision can be secured into the future while at the same time limiting the financial exposure of the taxpayer. I again urge the Minister to take action in that regard and engage at this point before the matter returns to the court. Leaving aside the particular case of the Waterford Crystal workers, there is a need to act now to ensure that security is provided for members of DB schemes generally.Companies that are solvent should be prevented from walking away from their pension scheme responsibilities where there is a question of insolvency in the scheme itself because as things stand a company can do that. There is an urgent need to introduce an insurance scheme to provide a safety net for those workers who find themselves in a double insolvency, as happened in Waterford Crystal. It is a matter of serious regret that action has not been taken to date. Overall, it is disappointing that no action has been taken on a thorough review of pension provision in the State generally. More than €2 billion goes to tax relief on pension schemes, the vast majority of members of which are higher earners who have benefited from the unfairly generous pension tax relief scheme that has operated in the country in recent years. That must be brought to an end. The Government signalled last year that it would do that in this year's budget and there is no reason why a limit could not have been put on the total tax relief any one person could claim in last year's budget. The Government moved against everyone else: public sector workers, child benefit recipients and other people are on low and middle incomes. The better off, however, always get away with it for as long as possible. There was no excuse for the Government not acting in the budget last year. I would like to hear an assurance when the Minister is concluding the debate that promised reforms and the cap that was talked about last year will now be applied to pension tax reliefs for the current year, where relief will not be given to anyone that would allow a pension in excess of €60,000 per annum. Finally, I raise with the Minister again the issue that I have raised on several occasions, the opportunity for the State to make savings of €21 million by ending the welfare subsidy that currently goes to insurance companies because of the failure of the Government and the Minister's Department to introduce a system where it is possible to claim back welfare payments paid out to a person who has had an accident and who made a successful insurance claim. It makes no sense that no arrangement is in place to recoup those social welfare payments. This represents a welfare subsidy to the insurance industry at the cost of the taxpayer. It is an opportunity for the Minister to make savings of €21 million that would not impact on social welfare recipients.  The processing times for social welfare claims leave a lot to be desired. It is intolerable that people are waiting for up to 60 weeks for an invalidity pension claim to be processed. People are in horrendous circumstances while waiting between 30 and 60 weeks for claims to be dealt with by the Department. That would not be tolerated in any other walk of life and I urge the Minister to take the necessary action and transfer staff from other areas to bring those claim times down to an acceptable level. It is a disappointment that the Government has not acted to put in place a fairer regime where we no longer spend €2 billion on pension tax relief for the better off. We currently have a situation where people on low incomes who cannot afford a pension subsidise the pensions of the better off. That is intolerable and must be brought to an end. People who are paying into defined benefit schemes must be given the security they require.
#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-05-30 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	213	I thank all Deputies from both Government and Opposition who contributed so thoughtfully to the debate. I want to start by mentioning today's latest employment figures from the CSO, which Deputies on all sides referred to. The figures show employment grew by 20,500 in the first quarter of the year. It is important to remind people that in the three years after the bank guarantee, and the disaster that brought on the country, 250,000 jobs were lost so although people might say that 20,500 figure should multiplied by a factor of ten, which is my ambition, nevertheless, this initial growth in employment is extremely important. Also according to the CSO, unemployment has fallen below 300,000 for the first time since 2010, from 14.1% to 13.7%. That figure of 300,000 is a lot of men and women and the figure is still unacceptably high. Every one of those has a personal story about not being able to find work, to contribute and to be financially independent. The numbers, however, are going in the right direction and it is a significant improvement that will be seen internationally as statistically significant as well. The Government is making firm progress in its goals of fixing the economy and getting people back to work. The Department is now spending more than €1 billion per year on employment support. Today's figures show the Pathways to Work strategy is making a strong contribution to people returning to work, education, training and work experience. There are some 85,000 people involved in those areas. The reforms I am introducing in the one parent family payment are a vital element of the strategy. Deputy Ó Snodaigh asked why I am proceeding with those reforms. Despite significant levels of State spending over the years on one parent families - Deputy Broughan and Deputy O'Dea both know about this from their constituencies - those families continue to experience significantly higher rates of consistent poverty. in comparison to the population generally. Why do children from such families have worse outcomes in educational achievement? Other countries that have the sort of system we are moving to have much better outcomes for the life chances for parents and children. The best route out of poverty is through paid employment. This is why I am proceeding with these reforms. The Government believes that supporting lone parents to participate in education, training and the workforce, once their children have reached an appropriate age, will help them on the pathway back to work. Work, however, especially full-time work, may not be an option for parents of young children. For that reason, it is crucial that lone parents are helped in a compassionate, supportive and effective way to move into the labour market. The changes to the jobseeker's scheme contained in this Bill achieve this by recognising the difficulty of parenting alone and will ease the transition of former one parent family payment recipients with children of primary school age on to a jobseeker's payment while fully recognising and balancing their caring responsibilities for young children.In other words, lone parents will get the full support of the Department's activation services to help them on the pathway back to work, but in a manner that recognises the reality of their circumstances. This progressive pathway back to work would not be available to lone parents if the Government had followed the advice of some on the Opposition benches who at times in the debate over the past two years backed themselves into a corner in wanting no reform of the lone parent system or social welfare in general. Members' sentiments may be admirable, but it does not help recipients to keep them locked out of having successful working lives. I remain convinced that we need the best possible child care and early education system in this country to help all families. In the context of the debates of recent days, the Department has, through community employment, roughly 1,700 people supported in child care situations. As Members will be aware, the experience in the community-based crèches for children is of a high quality, and since I came into the Department, I have worked intensively to develop and expand the education and training path for those involved, through community employment. It is important that staff are trained. In that regard, for instance, we will be looking at FETAC level 5 as the standard outcome of those during their period with a community employment scheme. In fact, as time passes, we will be progressing that to higher levels. I am aware that Deputy Ryan, among others, has a number of community child care facilities in his constituency. I am also aware how important these are as a community resource as well as an opportunity for people to get involved in work in an important area of caring for children and to get serious and progressive qualifications that enable them to get well-paid employment and to look after children properly. On the issue of pensions, I was glad to hear the welcoming comments for the Pensions Council and the reform of the governance structure of the Pensions Board. As Deputy Ó Snodaigh acknowledged, this will strengthen consumer protection and give consumers increased confidence in the system. The work I commissioned on pension charges shows that many small schemes charge high fees and often consumers are not as knowledgeable as they ought to be about what pension charges are being incurred on their account. This can mean vastly reduced pensions on retirement, and it is important to engage consumers. Pension coverage is a critical issue and it is essential that citizens have sufficient income on which to live in retirement. This is the primary concern expressed by the OECD, specifically in its recommendations on a national supplementary pension scheme, in a recent review of the Irish pension system, which I published in April. Increasing numbers of employers and employees are relying simply on the State pension, and Deputy O'Dea referred to that. We must expand coverage. Other countries have done that successfully. In that regard, I will be bringing proposals to Government in due course. On Deputy O'Dea's comments on defined benefit, I am well aware of the persistent funding problems of such schemes. Deputy O'Dea also has direct experience of this, given that the problems date back to 2000-2001 when he was in Government. I say that, not to make a political football of the issue because it is important to hundreds of thousands of people-----

I am bringing proposals to Government to address the range of issues facing defined benefit schemes and the pension sector generally. The funding standard was suspended by the previous Government when the economic crisis struck in order to allow employers and trustees assess and restructure their schemes. That is what the Government of which Deputy O'Dea was a member stated was the reason. Numerous measures have been introduced since then to assist schemes improve their funding position. Ultimately, it must be remembered that the regulatory structure is there to ensure members' benefits are protected and it is also important to note that the OECD report to which I referred described our minimum funding standard as "undemanding".

That is the core problem for the schemes, dating back to the time of the dotcom bubble and the catastrophe from 2008 onwards. On the approaching deadline of 30 June for funding proposals, more than 300 schemes are due to send in funding proposals to the Pensions Board. The board will then decide what steps to take scheme by scheme on a measured basis and taking account of the individual scheme circumstances. However, it must be emphasised that trustees must meet their legal obligations, and ultimately the Pensions Board will use its regulatory powers where benefit underfunding is not properly addressed. This is to protect scheme members, not to punish employers. After 30 June, I will be in a position to assess the extent of the funding difficulties and the effectiveness of the measures that have been taken or are being proposed. On the priority order, Deputy O'Dea will be aware from his own experience that this is a highly sensitive area. He did not refer to the fact that the priority order involves reducing the pensions of existing pensioners - that is what he was proposing - and using those funds to provide additional moneys for current employees and former or deferred members of the scheme. As he will be aware, this not a straightforward matter. Defined benefit pensions are not the significant amounts for many individuals that people suppose. For example, 40% of defined benefit pensions pay out less than €6,000 a year and 70% pay out less than €24,000, which are not large pensions. The proposal to reduce those kinds of pensions in general proposals made by some - I am not suggesting Deputy O'Dea advocated that - relates to relatively small pensions. We must look at this with considerable care and sensitivity towards all those involved. In any priority order, the large six-figure defined benefit pensions to which Deputy O'Dea referred would have to bear a significant part of the rearrangement, but they are a small fraction of the total number of such pensions in payment. That is what I want Members to reflect on. Considerable work has been done on this issue and I will bring proposals to Government, in the light of the outcome from the funding standard and the consultations under way with the Attorney General on the appropriate policy response to the Waterford Crystal situation. As I stated earlier, my Department and I have been in detailed consultation with the Attorney General and her staff on the Waterford Crystal case, which was referred by the Irish courts to the European Court of Justice and which must return there on certain matters. During the course of the debate, Deputies referred to the position of self-employed people in relation to social welfare entitlements.

#PeterMathews	unknown-#PeterMathews-party	unknown-#PeterMathews-dob	unknown-#PeterMathews-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-05-30 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	220	I thank the Ceann Comhairle for selecting this Topical Issue. It arises from a request by many constituents of mine, and many families around the country, for the Government to explain its policy on fee-charging schools. These constituents object to the recent decision by the Government to increase the pupil-teacher ratio in selected schools, which they feel have been singled out. They are referred to as fee-charging schools. There are 55 such schools in Ireland with more than 25,000 students currently attending them. The Government is increasing the pupil-teacher ratio from 20:1 to 23:1 starting in September 2013. My constituents contend that the Labour Party is putting significant pressure on Fine Gael to increase that ratio further by 2015, given the publicly stated policy to withdraw all public funding from fee-charging schools. The constituents have highlighted a number of areas of concern, including the mandate. Neither in the 2011 manifestos of Fine Gael and the Labour Party, nor in the programme for Government 2011-2016, are there references to an increase in the pupil-teacher ratio for the small group of schools singled out for attention - as they contend - in such an inequitable manner. They have asked us to explain from whom the Fine Gael and Labour parties received their election mandate for these recent actions.  Under the heading "The Economics of Education", they point out that the independent report from PwC in 2011 concluded that there is a saving to the State for each student enrolled in a free-charging school. Without getting into the specifics, the key point is that the parents of students attending fee-paying schools reduce the cost to the State and the rest of the tax-paying population by contributing to the cost of educating their children.  If ten of the 55 schools were to close - which is not an unrealistic assumption, given the recent trend - that would affect 5,000 students. Can the Government indicate what would be the increased cost to the State over a six-year period, including salaries, capitation grants and other school financial supports? Bearing in mind that those students would transfer to schools with a pupil-teacher ratio of 20, what would be the cost if all 55 schools closed? The Government has announced 275 major schools building projects as part of a €2 billion investment programme to address the 70,000 additional students coming through the system up to 2018. This includes 43 new and 65 large extensions to second-level schools. Given that the increased capacity being developed is not intended to accommodate students coming into the system due to the closure of these schools, can the Minister of State advise whether these factors are now being considered? What would be the potential shortfall in capacity, as well as the additional capital cost, if ten of the 55 schools closed? The representations also cover employment. The 55 schools in the fee-paying sector employ approximately 600 additional teachers and 600 other persons across a range of services, including administration, catering, facilities management. That is beyond what would be employed in a non-fee charging school. This amounts to 1,200 valuable direct jobs and probably the same number in indirect employment in what is a damaged economy. These jobs are sustained through the fees paid by parents across all these schools. What is the policy in attempting to protect the employment of these people in the context of 430,000 unemployed on the live register? What has been the reaction of the teachers' unions to this policy direction which threatens their members' jobs? These schools have their own facilities and share them with GAA clubs, community groups, and other neighbouring sports clubs. If these schools were to close it would make a very big dent in the amenities provided by them across the country. 
#AlexWhite	unknown-#AlexWhite-party	unknown-#AlexWhite-dob	unknown-#AlexWhite-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-05-30 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	221	On behalf of my colleague the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Ruairí Quinn, I thank Deputy Mathews for giving me an opportunity to outline to the House the position concerning the issue he has raised. This Government has protected frontline services in schools to the greatest extent possible in the recent budget, and there will be no reduction in teacher numbers in primary schools and in free second-level schools for the 2013-14 school year as a result of the budget. The DEIS scheme for disadvantaged schools is also fully protected with no overall changes to staffing levels or funding as a result of the budget. At post-primary level and in order to promote fairness in funding second-level schools, a two-point increase in the pupil-teacher ratio in fee-charging second-level schools will be introduced in September 2013. Currently, 55 schools out of 723 post-primary schools are charging fees ranging from €2,550 to €10,065 for day pupils.The State pays the salaries of one teacher for every 21 pupils in these schools compared with one teacher for every 19 pupils in schools in the free education scheme. A ratio of 18.25 pupils to one teacher, applies in DEIS schools. This will rise to 23:1 in fee-charging schools from September 2013. However, these schools have the resources, through fees charged, to employ teachers privately, an option which is not available to schools in the free education scheme. A report on the analysis of the tuition income of fee-charging schools carried out by the Department of Education and Skills was recently published and shows that the schools in question have €81 million in discretionary income that schools in the free scheme do not have. The report contains no policy proposals at this stage. However, even after the budget changes are implemented, the discretionary income available to these schools will still be quite considerable. There are some concerns within the Church of Ireland community on the recent budget measure affecting fee-charging schools. This Government recognises the importance of ensuring that students from a Protestant or reformed church background can attend a school that reflects their denominational ethos while at the same time ensuring that funding arrangements are in accordance with the provisions of the Constitution. How best to sustain education provision for widely dispersed and small local communities presents as a particular challenge, especially in any locality where enrolment is declining to single figures. The Government is intent on fostering pluralism in school provision. Supporting small communities including minorities in maintaining their schools is part of that policy. Regarding the fee-charging Protestant schools, an arrangement exists whereby funding is provided by the Department of Education and Skills to the Secondary Education Committee, SEC, an organisation run by the churches involved in managing the Protestant secondary schools. The SEC then disburses funds to the Protestant fee-charging schools on behalf of pupils who would otherwise have difficulty with the cost of fees and who, in the absence of such financial support, would be unable to attend a second-level school of a reformed church or Protestant ethos. Funding amounts to €6.5 million annually. This fund ensures that necessitous Protestant children can attend a school of their choice. The Minister for Education and Skills and the relevant Department officials will continue to engage with the relevant education sector stakeholders, including the Church of Ireland and boards of education, regarding education provision for all areas.
#PeterMathews	unknown-#PeterMathews-party	unknown-#PeterMathews-dob	unknown-#PeterMathews-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-05-30 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	222	I want to go over the broad statistical parameters. There are 55 fee-paying schools, comprising 32 Roman Catholic, 20 Protestant, two interdenominational and one Jewish. If ten of those schools were to close, 5,000 students would be affected. The cost for a student in a fee-paying school is €4,500 per year, but €8,000 per year in a non-fee-paying school. There is an immediate jump up there that would be a big dent in the State's finances. The format to date has been the most successful public private partnership in Ireland over the years. To start revisiting, dismantling or weakening it would be a backward step. The constituents feel this, and make their case very well. We should put a brake on this and revisit the fundamental fabric of what is going on here. One cannot sufficiently emphasise that the facilities of many of these schools are shared throughout the communities with clubs, local communities, sports clubs, swimming pools etc. That is a very important non-measurable advantage for society. If ten schools were to close, there would be a very big impact of at least 1,200 direct employees suffering job losses and maybe a further 1,200 in indirect losses. I ask the Minister to revisit these matters with a very acute mind and multidimensional understanding of the situation. From a political point of view the 25,000 students have 50,000 parents and probably a cohort of 150,000 past pupils who value the schools and would not like to see them damaged or undermined in any way. That is a large population of electorate who will be affected.
#AlexWhite	unknown-#AlexWhite-party	unknown-#AlexWhite-dob	unknown-#AlexWhite-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-05-30 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	223	Since Donogh O'Malley introduced the free secondary schools scheme back in the 1960s it has been the overarching policy of the State to provide free secondary school education to all students. My view, shared by the Minister, is that the scarce resources available should be deployed in a manner that ensures we have the broadest possible level of provision across the board for all students and that we should try to ensure as best we can equality of input and opportunity for all students across the country irrespective of where they are or what the income of their families may be. There is a cost to the State in providing fee-charging schools entering the free scheme, and this has come up in a study mentioned by Deputy Mathews. I do not know if there is any question of schools closing as the Deputy suggested. Where fee-charging schools enter into the free scheme I respectfully suggest to the House that the cost that has been suggested as being associated with such a move has been greatly exaggerated in some reports. At a time of reduced resources we must prioritise where valuable State resources would be focused and the Minister for Education and Skills has signalled, through these budget measures, that his focus must be on schools that do not have an income stream available to them, as the fee-charging schools do.
#MichaelMcGrath	unknown-#MichaelMcGrath-party	unknown-#MichaelMcGrath-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcGrath-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-05-30 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	224	This issue relates to an ongoing investigation by the Central Bank of Ireland into the mis-selling of payment protection insurance, PPI, policies to a range of customers over a long number of years potentially. People were sold products that they were never eligible to benefit from. Categories include self-employed people, farmers and people close to retirement when the product was sold to them. Without putting a tooth in it, their money was stolen from them because they were sold products they could never possibly benefit from. I welcome the ongoing Central Bank investigation but it is moving too slowly and I will outline my reasons for saying that. The investigation is dealing with PPI products that were sold to customers in July 2007. The firms involved who sold them their products have written to approximately 13,000 customers who were sold the products in one particular month, July 2007. If it continues to move at that pace, where they take it month by month, many of the people affected will be waiting a very long time to have any justice or recourse on this issue. It is potentially a very significant issue. Some 340,000 PPI policies were sold since 2007 so it is a very significant issue. In the UK the authorities are ahead of Ireland in resolving the issue. It will cost billions of euro, and in the UK it could potentially cost £14 billion or £15 billion, so it must be resolved. Why does the review deal only with products sold by firms since July 2007? Are we saying there was no incidence of the misselling of PPI policies before July 2007? I do not believe that. There are two issues relevant to the Financial Services Ombudsman, FSO. One is the current six-year rule whereby a person can submit a complaint to the FSO in respect of a product sold in the last six years. If one takes the example of people who bought the product in July 2007, they have only until July of this year, two months' time, to submit a complaint to the FSO. One of my concerns is that if those people do not get any satisfaction from the firm that sold them the product, the clock is ticking very quickly. Another reform we propose in that area, which the Minister is taking on board through a Central Bank Bill, is to allow the FSO to publish the complaints records of individual financial institutions. What is the timetable for the conclusion of this investigation? It is going on since 2011. It was broadened in 2012 and now, in May 2013, the firms involved are writing to one very small group of customers who bought the product in one month, July 2007.At that pace, people who bought the product in 2009 and 2010 will be waiting a considerable period for the investigation to be concluded. I will leave my opening remarks at that. This is about the mis-selling of products. It is essential that the people affected get justice and a relevant form of restitution, whether through compensation, a refund of their money or the adaptation of the scheme to make it suitable for them. In addition, the firms involved which, in my view, knowingly mis-sold these products to thousands of customers should be punished and fines should be levied accordingly. This is the very type of practice that unfortunately prevailed in Ireland for far too long. It needs to be faced up to and I welcome the investigation. However, I want it to be concluded quickly and have tangible results from which people can benefit.
#AlexWhite	unknown-#AlexWhite-party	unknown-#AlexWhite-dob	unknown-#AlexWhite-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-05-30 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	225	I thank Deputy McGrath for raising this important issue. I have been advised by the Central Bank that it is conducting an ongoing investigation into the sale of payment protection insurance, or PPI, by firms from July 2007. In September 2012 the Central Bank broadened its investigation to include a number of other banks and credit institutions. Approximately 340,000 PPI policies have been sold by banks or credit institutions since 2007. The Central Bank issued an update on its ongoing investigation into the sales of payment protection insurance policies on 17 May 2013. Ten firms are currently undertaking reviews of their payment protection insurance sales. At the request of the Central Bank, the firms previously informed all their customers included in the PPI sales review of their intention to provide updates to them as the review progresses. The firms have commenced writing to their customers who purchased PPI in July 2007 to inform them of the outcome of the review as it relates to their situation. Approximately 13,000 customers have received letters in the last two weeks. The Central Bank is advising customers who receive a letter and who have any questions to contact their banks or credit institutions directly. It is too early at this stage to comment on either the number of consumers who will receive refunds or the total amount to be refunded. Some firms may be able to indicate to their July 2007 customers how much they will receive but the majority will not until customers have decided whether they wish to have restitution or to keep the policy subject to further suitability assessment. The Central Bank will make a statement at the conclusion of the overall process. Throughout 2013, firms will continue to conduct the review and will directly contact all other PPI customers included in the review with the outcome of the ongoing review. The Central Bank will continue to require firms to take an orderly, co-ordinated and consistent approach to the review and will monitor progress on an ongoing basis with the firms involved and with the independent third party overseers who were appointed at the request of the Central Bank. The Central Bank's update on its ongoing investigation into the sale of payment protection insurance is available on the website www.centralbank.ie. On the issue more generally, the Central Bank's consumer protection code is applicable to all entities regulated by the Central Bank. These regulated entities include State-supported banks and financial institutions. The code requires, among other things, that a regulated entity must ensure that in all its dealings with customers and within the context of its authorisation it acts honestly, fairly and professionally in the best interests of its customers and the integrity of the market and with due skill, care and diligence in the best interests of its customers. Any breach of the code may be considered under the Central Bank's administrative sanctions procedure. In addition, as the House will be aware, the Financial Services Ombudsman was set up to adjudicate on unresolved disputes between complainants and financial service providers in an independent and impartial manner.
#MichaelMcGrath	unknown-#MichaelMcGrath-party	unknown-#MichaelMcGrath-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcGrath-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-05-30 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	226	I thank the Minister of State for his reply, although unfortunately it is, verbatim, the reply to a parliamentary question I submitted recently. I do not blame the Minister of State for that because it is what he was provided with by the Department of Finance. The essential issue is that of the 340,000 products sold since July 2007, the evidence is that an unknown quantum were mis-sold. There is an ongoing formal investigation and the firms involved are dealing with the products that were sold in July 2007. We are told there is an independent third party overseeing the process. However, the problem is that, under existing legislation, if people do not get the recourse they require through the Central Bank investigation, the six-year rule will exclude many of them from applying to the Financial Services Ombudsman. The Minister has stated he is open to introducing the principle of discoverability, such as exists in the United Kingdom. That means it is only from the date a person learns that a product was mis-sold that the clock starts ticking. It is important that the Government implement that reform as quickly as possible. This issue has been highlighted on RTE's consumer programme and The Sunday Times has been running an ongoing campaign on it. It is a genuine issue and at its heart there are people who, when hard times hit them, when their businesses folded or they became ill and were no longer able to work, thought to themselves, "Well, I'm fine, because I've been paying into a payment protection policy. I'll just ring them up and they'll ensure I continue to have a reasonable standard of living." However, such people were then told by the companies concerned that even though they had been paying into the fund for a number of years they were not actually eligible for or entitled to any payment. In basic terms, that is the issue. These people deserve justice and deserve to be compensated. Small changes would ensure most of them can be accommodated and I ask the Minister of State to bring those points to the Minister for Finance.
#AlexWhite	unknown-#AlexWhite-party	unknown-#AlexWhite-dob	unknown-#AlexWhite-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-05-30 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	227	I will certainly bring the points the Deputy raised to the Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan. Deputy McGrath referred, correctly, to the constraints that exist from a legal point of view in regard to the bringing of claims in general, not only in this area. The statute of limitations confines the bringing of claims to particular limitation periods, as the Deputy will know. Presumably an amendment would be required for change in this area. In general, time limits on litigation make sense because they ensure that potential litigants or defendants can have some level of certainty as to their exposure. That is a general proposition. When awful cases such as these arise, however, they point us in the direction of the constraints that exist in law and it may well be that a case could be made. The Law Reform Commission has looked at this issue on a number of occasions and we also have the principle of discoverability in regard to the bringing of claims in personal injury actions, where the law has been changed to allow for it. Therefore, there may be a case. The Deputy is fully aware of this issue, as is the Minister. However, I will relay the comments of the Deputy to the Minister. This is an extremely difficult and terrible situation, faced by very many people.
#JonathanOBrien	unknown-#JonathanOBrien-party	unknown-#JonathanOBrien-dob	unknown-#JonathanOBrien-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-05-30 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	228	Mayfield Community Enterprise Limited, which was established in 2001, was responsible for co-ordinating and administering community employment schemes within the Mayfield area. The Minister of State may be familiar with the local community through his party colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch. This is an area of high unemployment, in which there has been much social deprivation in the past. Thankfully, in the past 12 years, through the CE schemes, the workers and the various host groups, much work has been done to transform the community. A lot of good work continues to be done right up to today. It came as a bit of a shock yesterday, therefore, when the host groups were called to a meeting to be informed that the impending retirement of the supervisor for the Mayfield area is due to take place in September. At the meeting people were told that a recommendation is going to the manager and the principal officer of FÁS that the position not be filled. In effect, this means that Mayfield Community Enterprise Limited will cease to exist, and the supervision, administration and the operation of the CE workers in the community will be transferred to other areas. Two are going to Military Hill, ten to Blackpool and nine to the North Mall CE umbrella group of CE schemes. This is obviously of concern to the local host groups and the communities. One of the advantages of having a supervisor within the Mayfield community is that such a person has built up a great knowledge of the local community and has a good relationship with the host groups. There is a fear that if the supervisor is taken out and not replaced, with the enterprise to be co-ordinated and administered by CE groups outside the Mayfield community area, there will be a detrimental impact on the provision of CE schemes. Just in case anybody is worried, I stress that there is no indication or talk of a reduction in the number of CE scheme workers. I want to make that clear because I do not want people who hear this debate to be fearful that there will be a reduction in numbers. That is not what is being proposed, but what is proposed is that the vacancy for supervisor not be filled.There is general concern that something which worked well for 12 years is now being stripped back and people do not understand the rationale behind the change. The only conclusion they can reach is that it is a cost cutting exercise and this is a cause for genuine fear in the local community. I ask the Minister for Social Protection to rethink this recommendation before it is put to FÁS manager and to seriously consider filling the supervisory position when it becomes vacant in September.
#AlexWhite	unknown-#AlexWhite-party	unknown-#AlexWhite-dob	unknown-#AlexWhite-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-05-30 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	229	I thank Deputy Jonathan O'Brien for raising this issue and commend him on the measured manner in which he outlined his concerns. Mayfield Community Enterprises Ltd. is a company that operates a community employment, CE, scheme based in the Mayfield area on the north side of Cork city. Currently there are 21 participants on this scheme spread among ten different community organisations and groups. The nature of the work undertaken by the participants ranges from child care and care of the elderly to maintenance of community and sporting facilities. This scheme is fully funded by the Department of Social Protection. The CE supervisor on the scheme will reach retirement age in September of this year and the Department is examining the possibility, on operational cost grounds, of not replacing this position and instead amalgamating the scheme into several other CE schemes which operate in this area of the city. Such a move would have no impact whatsoever on the number of participants or on the services provided to the local community through this scheme. All participants on the scheme would remain in their current positions in existing organisations but would operate under the auspices of a different CE scheme. Such a proposal, which has been successfully implemented on a number of occasions in Cork and other counties, has the advantage of allowing all existing CE participants to continue their placements in their existing organisations while allowing the Department to operate the schemes more cost effectively. The Department has met with the board of the Mayfield Community Enterprises Ltd. to advise it of its intentions and has agreed to a further meeting with the board in the coming weeks to further discuss this proposal. I am sure this meeting will provide an opportunity for elaborating the concerns expressed by the Deputy.

One of the advantages of the scheme as it currently stands is that the supervisor has direct contact with host groups. I appreciate that the Department will engage in further meetings with the board but it is also important that it sits down with host groups, community leaders and associations which work closely with the current supervisor to outline exactly what is being proposed. The perception exists that it is the beginning of the end for CE schemes in that area. I do not believe that is the case but people's fears need to be addressed and it would be beneficial were the Department to meet not only the board, but also the CE scheme workers and their host groups. I ask the Minister of State to give a commitment that such an engagement will be entered into before the current supervisor retires in September.

My colleagues, Deputies Dara Murphy and Jim Daly, as well as several Dublin based Deputies have also been in contact with the Office of Public Works and the Irish Insurance Federation regarding the issue of homes that have been flooded and can no longer access any form of insurance. As I have raised the matter with the Minister of State, Deputy White, on previous occasions, I will be brief in rehearsing the two issues arising. First, the constituents whom I represent understand that the premiums they will be asked to pay could reflect the increased risk of flooding to their homes, but they find it difficult to accept that they cannot get any flood insurance whatsoever. Second, the State is funding infrastructure throughout the country to protect communities from the risk of flooding. Insurance companies reflect this infrastructure in the premiums they charge in those communities. In effect, the State is providing support to the insurance industry but communities which are not protected by flood prevention infrastructure - I am also seeking to fix this - are given no support from the insurance industry. A question of fairness arises if the insurance industry is not recognising the State's investment in certain communities to prevent flooding and, in many cases, refusing to provide flood insurance at any price. Even homes that have never experienced flooding are unable to get flood insurance because they are located near areas that were flooded. I acknowledge that the Minister of State at the Department of Finance, Deputy Brian Hayes, is doing considerable work in this area and is seeking to advance negotiations. I would be grateful if we could get an update on the current status of these negotiations.
#AlexWhite	unknown-#AlexWhite-party	unknown-#AlexWhite-dob	unknown-#AlexWhite-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-05-30 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	233	On behalf of the Minister of State at the Department of Finance, Deputy Brian Hayes, I thank Deputy Donohoe for raising this issue and commend him on the work he and others have been doing to address it. I am happy to provide an update on developments since the Deputy last raised this matter in February. I am aware that the issue of obtaining flood insurance cover continues to create difficulty for people in certain locations, either in terms of the review of household insurance premiums or where their existing insurance companies indicate they will no longer provide such flood cover specifically. The Irish Insurance Federation, IIF, has repeatedly assured the OPW that the incidence of such difficulties remains at a low level and that only 2% of insurance policies nationally are involved. None the less, 2% of households represents a significant number of affected people and the Government is anxious to address the problem for this reason. In February, the Deputy was updated on the establishment of a working group comprising the OPW, the IIF and representatives of the main household insurance companies operating in the Irish market to consider and address this issue. It is important that the nature and purpose of this group and the role of the OPW in this process are clearly understood. The OPW has no role or function in relation to the oversight or regulation of the insurance industry or of insurance matters generally. It is important to state this because there may be some misconception about the nature of the OPW's engagement with the IIF in regard to flood insurance cover. The discussions which are currently ongoing between the OPW, the IIF and the insurance companies have a specific focus and are solely concerned with agreeing a basis on which information can be provided to the insurance industry on flood relief schemes completed by the OPW and the standard of protection offered by those schemes. The working group has made solid progress towards reaching agreement on a data sharing platform which will allow the insurance industry to take proper account of the levels of capital investment in flood protection measures over several decades by the OPW when assessing flood risk in localities where such flood measures have been completed. A considerable number of technical issues have had to be addressed but it is important that all such matters are addressed in a comprehensive way to ensure that the system of data exchange is robust, reliable and sustainable. The information is being provided in a readily accessible GIS format which will show in digital map files the areas benefiting from completed flood defence works. The initial focus of the group's work is the provision of information on schemes which provide protection for the one in 100 year flood.Last April the Minister of State, Deputy Brian Hayes, had a very constructive meeting with the new chief executive officer of the Irish Insurance Federation. The new CEO confirmed his commitment to the process under way and ensuring the working group established between the Office of Public Works and the Irish Insurance Federation agreed to a memorandum of understanding to guide present and future interaction between the insurance industry and the OPW on communications on completed flood defence works. The OPW is satisfied that the insurance industry is engaging constructively and positively in this process and there is a strong willingness to reach agreement on a sustainable system of information exchange. Ultimately, it is a matter for the insurance companies to decide how they will use the information provided on completed flood defence works. As part of the process, they are committing to take the information into account in their assessment of risk. It is hoped this will facilitate the provision of flood cover in all areas protected by completed schemes. The Minister of State looks forward to the completion of the work of the OPW-IIF working group in the near future and expresses his appreciation of the effort the IIP has put into this co-operative exchange in recent months. The level of information available to the insurance industry on flood risk throughout the country will be greatly enhanced with the thorough and robust mapping of the country's watercourses for flood risk under the national catchment flood risk assessment and management, CFRAM, programme. In time, it is expected proper assessment of flood risk by the insurance industry will be based on firm evidence based and verifiable assessments. I remind the Deputy of the avenues available to those having difficulty, with complaints or queries in seeking insurance cover through the Irish Insurance Federation's free insurance information service. In addition, the Financial Services Ombudsman deals independently with unresolved complaints from consumers about their individual dealings with all financial service providers.

His response acknowledges that progress is being made and the insurance industry is engaging constructively and positively in this process. It is important to highlight this, as we must tackle this issue. I ask the Minister of State to relay to the Office of Public Works my concern about the benchmarking of the infrastructural work the office is required to do. While I understand the need for such benchmarking, in Dublin city the lead provider of flood relief infrastructure is Dublin City Council rather than the Office of Public Works. This may also be the case in other Dublin local authority areas. The Office of Public Works tends to be responsible for such provision outside the capital. Dublin City Council is constructing flood prevention works to the same standard as those provided by the Office of Public Works. However, the Minister of State's reply makes explicit reference only to the Office of Public Works. I ask that the Office of Public Works examine this issue to ensure the work required in Dublin is done to the standard required by the office. Perhaps the Office of Public Works could check works carried out by Dublin City Council or other State bodies to ensure it is satisfied that they are done to the required standard.

I will ensure the comments he made on the position on Dublin City Council which I did not fully appreciate until now are relayed to the Office of Public Works. I am sure the Minister of State, Deputy Brian Hayes, will ensure they are taken on board in the work being done.

Sa chaoi is gur féidir linn an Straitéis 20 Bliain don Ghaeilge a chur i bhfeidhm go héifeachtach, níl amhras dá laghad orm ach go bhfuil sé riachtanach go mbeidh ról lárnach ag pobal na Gaeilge agus na Gaeltachta sa phróiseas sin. Ar ndóigh, tá an ról sin aitheanta go sonrach in Acht na Gaeltachta 2012 a leagann bunús reachtúil faoi fheidhmiú na Straitéise agus faoin phróiseas pleanála teanga ach go háirithe. Mar thoradh ar Acht na Gaeltachta, tá ról níos lárnaí ná riamh ag pobal na Gaeilge agus na Gaeltachta, agus ag na heagraíochtaí pobail a fheidhmíonn thar a gceann, i gcur i bhfeidhm na Straitéise tríd an phróiseas pleanála teanga ar an talamh.  Chomh fada is a bhaineann sé leis an Ghaeltacht, tá aitheantas ar leith tugtha sa Straitéis don ról faoi leith atá á imirt le fada an lá ag pobal na Gaeltachta agus ag na heagraíochtaí pobail sa Ghaeltacht i gcur chun cinn na Gaeilge mar theanga pobail agus teaghlaigh sa Ghaeltacht. Le cur i bhfeidhm an phróisis phleanála teanga faoi Acht na Gaeltachta, déanfar ról an phobail sa Ghaeltacht a threisiú tuilleadh, chomh maith le ról na n-eagraíochtaí pobail a fheidhmíonn thar a gceann, le tacaíocht phraiticiúil ó mo Roinnse, ó Údarás na Gaeltachta agus ó fhoinsí Stáit eile. Sa chomhthéacs sin, tá obair ullmhúcháin ar bun ag Údarás na Gaeltachta i gcomhar leis na heagraíochtaí pobail chun cabhrú leo pleananna teanga a ullmhú sna limistéir pleanála teanga Ghaeltachta. Chomh fada is a bhaineann sé leis an chuid eile den tír, níl aon amhras ann ach go bhfuil raon d'eagraíochtaí thar a bheith gníomhach i gcur chun cinn na Gaeilge i measc an phobail i gcoitinne, le tacaíocht phraiticiúil ó mo Roinnse, ó Fhoras na Gaeilge agus ó fhoinsí Stáit eile. Tá a gcuid oibre siúd thar a bheith tábhachtach agus muid ag iarraidh cuspóirí na Straitéise a bhaint amach ar bhonn náisiúnta. Tá obair ullmhúcháin ar bun ag Foras na Gaeilge, i gcomhar le heagraíochtaí pobail áirithe taobh amuigh den Ghaeltacht, chun cabhrú leo pleananna teanga a ullmhú i gceantair ar leith. 
 Additional information not given on the floor of the House
 Ós rud é go gcreidim go láidir gur chóir go mbeadh ionchur ag na heagraíochtaí pobail i gcur i bhfeidhm na Straitéise, tá sé beartaithe ag mo Roinnse, i gcomhar le hÚdarás na Gaeltachta agus le Foras na Gaeilge, seimineár a reáchtáil don chuspóir seo go luath. Tá súil agam go gcuideoidh sé seo le malartú eolais faoin Straitéis a éascú idir mo Roinn, an tÚdarás agus an Foras, agus na heagraíochtaí Gaeilge agus Gaeltachta. Tabharfaidh an seimineár deis an próiseas pleanála teanga a phlé leis na heagraíochtaí seo fosta. Beidh mé ag tnúth leis na tuairimí uile a thiocfaidh ón seimineár a mheas i dtráth cuí.

Tá mé ag seasamh isteach don Teachta Kitt, atá as láthair inniu. Glacann chuile duine go bhfuil an tAire Stáit tógtha go hiomlán leis an Ghaeilge. Níl aon amhras orm ina thaobh agus ní dóigh liom go bhfuil amhras ar bith ar éinne eile. Tá amhras mór ar mhuintir na tíre mar gheall ar cé chomh tógtha atá an Rialtas leis an teanga, áfach. Is í sin an fhadhb leis an straitéis. Feiceann daoine go bhfuil lagú ag teacht ar an straitéis ón am á tháinig an Rialtas seo i gcumhacht. Is í sin an deacracht. Cé go n-admhaíonn an tAire Stáit go bhfuil muintir na Gaeltachta thar a bheith tábhachtach, mar an gcéanna leo siúd lasmuigh den Ghaeltacht ag a bhfuil suim acu sa teanga, níl struchtúr ardleibhéal ar bith ar fáil dóibh ionas go mbeidh tionchar acu ar na húdaráis atá ann faoi láthair. Is í sin an deacracht is mó. Impím ar an Aire Stáit rud éigin a dhéanamh faoi sin chomh luath agus is féidir leis.

Ar ndóigh, tá struchtúr ar fáil. Tagann an fochoiste Rialtais, atá ag tiomáint na straitéise ar aghaidh, le chéile go rialta faoi chathaoirleacht an Taoisigh. Tá na Ranna go léir páirteach sa choiste idir-rannach ar a bhfuil mé féin mar chathaoirleach. Tá na Ranna sonracha - an Roinn Oideachais agus Scileanna, an Roinn Comhshaoil, Pobail agus Rialtais Áitiúil, srl. - páirteach san fhochoiste. Is cinnte go bhfuil se ag dul ar aghaidh. Tá Acht na Gaeltachta curtha fríd. Táimid anois ag déanamh na rialacháin maidir le cur i bhfeidhm na ceantair pleanála teanga agus foilseofar iad gan mhoill.

Tá Acht na Gaeltachta 2012 cáinte ag beagnach gach eagraíocht Ghaeilge sa tír; tá an Chomhairle um Oideachas Gaeltachta agus Gaelscolaíochta, Oifig an Choimisinéara Teanga, Údaras na Gaeltachta, atá tar éis ciorruithe buiséid a ghlacadh, Raidió na Gaeltachta, Acadamh na hOllscolaíochta Gaeilge agus Foras na Gaeilge ar an liosta fada. Tá easpa daonlathais san údarás anois. Táimid fós ag fanacht leis na pleananna teanga. Tá a fhios agam nach bhfuil na hacmhainní ann. Tá na deontais bainte os na hábhair oidí. Tá deireadh curtha le scéim labhairt na Gaeilge. Tá maoiniú na heagraíochtaí Gaeilge fós ard san aer ag an bomaite. Tá easpa seirbhísí Gaeilge ag go leor Ranna agus comhlachtaí Stáit. Tá moill fhada ar aontú scéimeanna teanga na heagraíochtaí Stáit. Tá an próiseas comhairliúcháin phoiblí maidir leis an Acht críochnaithe le breis agus bliain, ach fós níl na torthaí le fáil. Conas is féidir leis an Aire Stáit obair le hurlabhraí na n-eagraíochtaí ata á mbagairt agus á gcur faoi bhrú aige? Chonaiceamar é sin i gcás Guth na Gaeltachta cúpla mí ó shin. Cén fáth nach bhfuil an tAire Stáit sásta na n-eagraíochtaí Gaeilge agus Gaeltachta - is léir an luach, an t-ábhar agus an fuinneamh atá acu - a aithint mar gheallshealbhóirí i gcur i bhfeidhm na straitéise 20 bliain? Oibríonn an Rialtas leis na ceardchumainn san earnáil phoiblí i gcónaí. Tá ról lárnach ag na heagraíochtaí a bhaineann le cúrsaí feirmeoireachta sa phlean forbartha Harvest 2020. Tá an Rialtas ag fágáil na heagraíochtaí Gaeilge amuigh sa bhfuacht ag an bomaite.

Ba mhaith liom fáil amach cad iad na tuairimí, na moltaí agus na smaointe atá ag na heagraíochtaí seo, iad a thabhairt le chéile agus éisteacht leis an méid atá le rá acu.

My primary objective with this initiative is to ensure that the participating towns in the pilot scheme - Westport, Youghal and Listowel - will have access to and an understanding of appropriate guidance to assist them in best conserving their heritage assets. In so doing, they can underpin the sustainability of their communities and local economies. It is my hope that meeting these goals will also significantly enhance the visitor experience in these towns and will help to maximise the potential positive contribution of tourism to each of them. Following the launch earlier this year of a framework document, funding has been allocated by my Department and by Fáilte Ireland to the three towns for projects in 2013. Each town will make an additional contribution in the form of direct financial aid or contribution-in-kind and the pilot phase will run through 2013 and continue into 2014. The pilot towns are currently implementing the steps set out in the framework document and each has set up a local historic towns initiative working group consisting of representatives from local government and community groups and other stakeholders. The local groups are responsible for drawing up a vision for their towns, with specific objectives supported by a clear action plan. It is intended that the first projects identified in the action plans will commence this summer. I understand that the three town councils, with financial support from Fáilte Ireland, will shortly undertake a baseline survey to gauge the views of the local community, various business stakeholders and visitors regarding the issues they see facing each town. This survey will be used to monitor the effectiveness of the pilot phase of the initiative, its return in terms of heritage-led regeneration and the impact on tourism. As the Deputy will appreciate, it is too early at this stage in the project to provide a detailed report of its financial return in terms of heritage tourism.

Despite the fact that work remains ongoing, I can say with great confidence that Youghal, the town in which I live, has benefited hugely from this project.Youghal has a public realm plan, as I am sure Westport and Listowel do. This is a fantastic opportunity for them to roll out their plans. The pilot scheme has had a knock-on effect, in that many businesses are decorating their premises. The towns benefit greatly from this. There is a clear connection between a town's visual impact and its ability to attract tourists. Does the Minister plan to extend the scheme and will there be a second phase of funding for the three towns involved if the scheme is deemed successful?

She was present in a supportive capacity at the public occasions at which we launched the programme, including the occasion in the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government's heritage section. The town of Youghal has embraced this opportunity and is making something special out of it. The project's future is one of my main priorities in office. Some 34 towns were designated heritage towns by Fáilte Ireland, primarily in the early 1990s. It seems that fewer than half of them are actively promoting themselves as such. I will revisit 31 of the towns and try to re-energise them. Some are availing of the brand whereas others are not. Of the network of 21 walled towns, some also happen to be heritage towns. The walled towns network is an all-Ireland initiative and presents a great opportunity for North-South co-operation through Tourism Ireland, which promotes all of the island abroad, to expand the heritage town concept to Northern Ireland. The two categories can be marketed together. I will extend the pilot scheme and will probably choose a further three towns based on certain criteria that I will outline. It is a worthwhile initiative. As Deputy McLellan stated, it is working in Youghal.

In the current climate of mass emigration and high rates of unemployment, it is impossible to overestimate the importance of schemes like the historic towns initiative for each of the three towns involved. I hope that it can be expanded. I have a slight concern that the abolition of town councils might have a negative effect, as the scheme must be done in co-operation with local authorities.

I am sure that every county with a heritage town has such an officer. This is an essential criterion. The changing format of local government will not affect the scheme. Actually, it might help. In some cases, a county may have more resources than an urban authority. I am anxious to continue the scheme and to re-energise it as much as possible.

The effect of the order is that any work affecting the site requires the consent of the Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht under section 14 of the National Monuments Act 1930, as amended. The landowner's application to my Department for consent to proposals that include the provision of a commemorative centre to the 1916 Rising and its leaders on the national monument site is being examined. As part of the consent process, the applicant was asked by my Department to provide an environmental impact statement, EIS, on the proposed works. Following completion of the statutory consultation procedures associated with the EIS, I am proceeding with the formal environmental impact assessment, EIA, including consideration of the submissions received. I will then make a decision on the consent application itself. The national monument is in private ownership and has not been subject to compulsory purchase procedures. Responsibility for its upkeep and maintenance rests with the owners. My function in that respect is confined to considering any related proposal by the owners for which my consent must be sought under the National Monuments Acts. Such consent has been applied for, and granted, from time to time, most recently for essential stabilisation works to the building facades, and I understand that the buildings are structurally secure. The monument buildings are also included in the record of protected structures maintained by Dublin City Council under the Planning Acts. It is important to point out that the city council has specific powers of intervention should any particular concern arise about the structures' condition. I hope to be in a position to make a determination on the consent application under the National Monuments Acts and the associated EIA in the near future.

As I rise, I feel like a person in the early Alzheimer's advertisement, which asks whether the person keeps asking the same question again and again and again. This matter has arisen again and again and again during our sessions with the Minister. He has indicated to the House that he intends to consider the request for consent, but we have reached the point of urgency with the national monument at 14-17 Moore Street. We all appreciate the site's importance. It is in a state of advanced decay and I understand that the Minister gave his consent to emergency works being carried out in February. I also understand that, when a number of Deputies visited the area in the course of the past week or two, they were refused access because of the state of the buildings. Dublin City Council has advised the Minister against giving consent for the proposed works. My colleague, Councillor Mary Fitzpatrick has been campaigning on the council for Moore Street's restoration and broader works of a positive nature in the north O'Connell Street area. Can we please inject a level of urgency into this issue? While it does not all rest with the Minister, will he move forward urgently with his area of responsibility so that we do not need to raise these questions again and the Department can be seen to be taking action?

I am awaiting my officials' recommendation. Hopefully, it will be presented. I have looked for it and would have been delighted to advise the Deputy that I had it. After I have it, I will assess it and make an announcement shortly. I promised Deputy McLellan that the announcement would come before the end of this Dáil session. This is for sure. I agree with everyone that we need to make a determination on this issue, as 2016 is approaching. Whatever the determination will be, it will be important. One side of the family supports the proposal while the other side does not.What is proposed for Nos. 14 to 17 Moore Street is being examined and I will make a decision on the matter shortly. All I can do under the existing legislation is give consent to any works being carried out. I must determine whether the proposed works would in any way affect the monument. Chartered Land has sought permission to carry out stabilisation work on No. 15, which I provided and the work is being carried out. Work on the facade is to start immediately. Permission was not required for such work but the company informed me of it. I urge Deputy Ó Fearghaíl to convey to his party councillors who are interested in the matter that Dublin City Council can issue a directive to Chartered Land at any time to carry out essential structural works if it is concerned about the buildings. If such a request appears on my desk I will deal with it immediately because I am as concerned as anyone else in the House about the buildings. This is something that concerns all of us. I would like to see a united approach from everyone to resolve the issue. The matter is not simple and significant issues arise but it is important that the House is united on the approach. To date, generally speaking people have been positive, practical and pragmatic in their approach. I agree with the Deputy that concerns arise and that the matter must be addressed urgently. Accordingly, the decision will be made before the House adjourns.

I understand that the Moore Street committee is very anxious to visit the monument. I received a letter from Deputy McLellan requesting such a visit in which she outlined that problems had arisen in that regard. I will contact Chartered Land to ensure the committee is accommodated. I understand an all-party committee has been selected to visit the monument as soon as possible. I will certainly make the request.

There were two projects in my Department on consultancy services in culture and film in the 2012 calendar year and in 2013, to date, that incurred expenditure. In 2012, €3,000 was expended on the international promotional works of the culture Ireland division in respect of a web development consultancy carried out by SureSkills Limited. That was the final payment for a consultancy that had commenced in 2011. A total of €10,959.30 was expended in 2012 on the independent external review of Dublin Contemporary 2011. The review is being carried out by Bonnar Keenlyside and should be completed later this year.

His Department has not spent that much on consultancy fees. I was not aware of that. I am pleased the Minister agrees that consultants should only be used in exceptional circumstances and that it is of the utmost importance that taxpayers' money is spent sparingly when it comes to the employment of consultants. His response has satisfied me.

My policy is that we should have the competency in any Department to be able to review projects. In my Department we have experienced staff who have served under a number of Governments in various capacities and I rely on them for their judgment at all times. They are very energetic and they have always fulfilled any task I have asked them to complete in terms of reviewing projects or making reports within the expected timeframe. I do not see a necessity to employ consultants.

The Wildlife Acts provide protection to NHAs through a requirement for certain activities to require ministerial consent before being undertaken. As with the case of special areas of conservation, a ten-year derogation was applied to allow domestic turf cutting to continue on NHAs. In May 2010, the previous Government decided that turf cutting should come to an end on all raised bog NHAs at the end of 2013. However, the current Government undertook to review the situation. This review is now under way. To assist in this task, my Department has engaged a team of scientific specialists to underpin the review, which I hope will be completed in the autumn. NHAs are not subject to the same legal regime under the habitats directive that apply to raised bog special areas of conservation, SAC. However, the approach to peat extraction on NHA raised bogs has been raised by the European Commission in the same reasoned opinion that was addressed to Ireland on turf cutting on raised bog special areas of conservation, SAC. The issue relating to NHAs concerns adherence to the requirements of the environmental impact assessment, EIA, directive. It should be noted that the NHA raised bogs were formally designated as part of a resolution to a case where Ireland was found against in the European Court of Justice in regard to inadequate application of the EIA directive regarding peat extraction. This judgment was made against Ireland in 1999. Therefore, while the Government has more options in regard to the management of NHA raised bogs we need to work closely with the European Commission to ensure we meet our legal obligations. The review will provide clarity for turf cutters and landowners in advance of the 2014 turf cutting season and my Department will contact individual landowners and turf cutters on the outcome of the review. Issues in relation to NHA raised bogs have also been discussed with stakeholders represented at the Peatlands Council as part of its remit.

Is he aware that there are lots of difficulties with 53 special areas of conservation bogs and that there is also concern with bogs in the natural heritage areas? Could the Minister inform the House how many bogs are designated under Irish law and how flexible is the law? In how many natural heritage areas is turf cutting taking place? What meetings have been held with turf cutters? What meetings have been held between turf cutters and the National Parks and Wildlife Service? Is there a possibility of lifting the designation on some or part of the bogs in the natural heritage areas?
#JimmyDeenihan	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-party	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-dob	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-05-30 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	281	Under Irish law there are 75 designated bogs that are referred to as natural heritage areas, NHAs. Under EU law, there are 53 special areas of conservation, SAC, and that law has been transposed into Irish law. We have more flexibility on the NHAs. The previous Government decided in a Cabinet decision in May 2010 that turf cutting would cease in all 53 SAC bogs and all 75 NHA bogs. Turf cutting can take place this year but the Government was given until 2014 to cease cutting turf on NHA bogs. We gave a commitment in the programme for Government that we would review the decision on NHA bogs because we have more flexibility on the issue at national level.Consequently, the Department has taken on consultants to do this job. At present, they are examining the various bogs and are considering alternatives on a scientific basis, within the context of the habitats directive, as whatever proposals will be made to the Commission must be within that framework. Those involved are engaged in consultations, obviously working with the Peatlands Council, but in general as well. An entire process is under way with the consultants and the National Parks and Wildlife Service. This consultation will be extremely important in the effort to get solutions for this issue which, as all Members are aware, is highly sensitive.

In May 2012, I announced the introduction of a new philanthropic initiative on a pilot basis for arts and culture organisations. The initiative, called the Philanthropic Leverage Initiative, was designed to encourage philanthropic sponsorship and endowment of the arts from private sources. It has provided an incentive to arts organisations to seek proactively new funding relationships with sponsors that deliver private sector financial support, thereby increasing overall funding available to the arts. It was anticipated that a multiple of 3.5 on the pilot initiative funds of €230,000 would result in philanthropic funding of approximately €800,000 being raised for the arts. The initiative proved very successful with a multiplier of 4.26 in philanthropic donations being leveraged for the arts. The arts got a boost of more than €1 million last year, of which less than one fifth came from the public purse. A full list of awards under this scheme can be viewed on the Department's website and I have a list of them to hand. This year, €210,000 is available to arts organisations under the initiative, which is being targeted at arts and education and for arts organisations that are carrying out projects in schools. In 2013, priority will be given to arts and culture organisations seeking support for projects that include an education component. This is to support the Arts in Education Charter which I launched in conjunction with the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Ruairí Quinn. Last October, I hosted and chaired a forum on philanthropy and the arts in Smock Alley Theatre. It featured speakers from key philanthropic organisations and the arts in Ireland. The conference was well attended and generated positive feedback and a full report on it may be found on my Department's website. Parallel to these initiatives, the Arts Council is undertaking an initiative which dovetails with the work in my Department. The initiative is called RAISE: Building Fundraising Capacity and consists of a programme that is providing one-to-one professional support to eight selected arts organisations for two years. The initiative is designed to assist in planning and implementing a tailored fund-raising programme for each organisation. Eight leading Irish arts organisations aim to raise €10 million in private funding over the next five years as part of this Arts Council initiative.

Members had a very useful debate in this Chamber a couple of months ago on the importance of philanthropy. This question was tabled conscious of a development that is of concern, namely, the exit from the Irish scene of Atlantic Philanthropies, which over the years has contributed €1.1 billion in funds to not-for-profit organisations, and of the One Foundation, set up by Declan Ryan, son of the late Tony Ryan, which has contributed €40 million. Between them, the aforementioned two organisations represent approximately 86% of philanthropic contributions in general. I accept the Minister's comment that unfortunately, only a small percentage of such moneys go towards the arts. Consequently, the initiative taken by the Minister is particularly welcome. However, at a time when these major donors appear intent on exiting the Irish stage, how can one ensure Ireland will get its comparative contributions? In this context, I note the United Kingdom gives 6% of its overall giving to the arts, while the equivalent figure in the United States is 5%. If the figures I have to hand are correct, even now, less than 1% is given in Ireland. What initiatives has the Minister in mind to address this issue?

Basically, in this country approximately half a billion euro is available through philanthropic means on an annual basis, of which the arts generally get just 0.6%. As for total funding for the arts, approximately 3% comes from philanthropic sources. I am trying to create a culture here of philanthropic giving towards the arts and this is succeeding to an extent. In addition, I am trying to encourage organisations to seek such funding and a number of initiatives have taken place over the past two years, as I have outlined here. However, my Department also supports the Business to Arts organisation. It has a highly creative scheme called Fund It and a number of initiatives have resulted therefrom, as Business to Arts is doing really good work in this regard. I also am very encouraged by the efforts being made by organisations such as, for example, the National Archives, which last year succeeded in getting one quarter of a million euro from the Wellcome Trust, which was very important for it. I am encouraging the national cultural institutions, as much as possible, to seek funding from philanthropic sources. For example, representatives of the Abbey Theatre visited the United States recently, as did representatives of the National Concert Hall. These institutions are looking at possibilities for their projects, as is the National Gallery. Overall, a culture is developing within the national cultural institutions and in cultural organisations across the country towards trying to attract philanthropic contributions.

#JimmyDeenihan	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-party	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-dob	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-05-30 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	288	I have made that quite clear. As a result of the programme framework, all the organisations know precisely by how much their funding will be reduced next year. I have deliberately tried to keep Arts Council funding at as high a level as possible and the decrease in its funding was not commensurate with the decrease in the funding of other national cultural organisations because of the dependency of so many organisations on Arts Council funding. I made this commitment previously when I was referring to the review and reform of the national cultural institutions, namely, that in no way will there be a reduction in public funding because of an increase in philanthropic funding. I assure the Deputy that so doing would defeat the purpose. I am trying to gain additional funding for the arts through the philanthropic process to help bolster pre-existing funding. Consequently, the funding from the State must be guaranteed, albeit while looking at the opportunities that exist to attract philanthropic funding. As I know from my own experience, they exist.

It is responsible for the management, maintenance, development and restoration of the inland navigable waterway system throughout the island, principally for recreational purposes. Waterways Ireland has responsibility for approximately 1,000 km of navigable waterways comprising of the Shannon-Erne Waterway, the Shannon Navigation, the Barrow Navigation, the Grand Canal, the Royal Canal, the Erne system and the Lower Bann Navigation. In 2007, Waterways Ireland’s remit was extended by the North-South Ministerial Council to include responsibility for the restoration of the Ulster Canal between Clones and Upper Lough Erne. While the Waterways Ireland 2013 business plan and budget is the subject of ongoing discussions with the co-sponsoring Department of Culture, Arts and Leisure in Northern Ireland and will require formal approval by the North-South Ministerial Council, I have provided an indicative funding allocation of €4.071 million to Waterways Ireland for capital projects in this jurisdiction in the coming year. This will facilitate capital works by Waterways Ireland in developing, restoring and improving infrastructure for water based and activity recreation and tourism, consolidating facilitates and improving access to the waterways across the navigations. I am advised that the Waterways Ireland draft 2013 business plan has a development schedule providing for 1354 m of additional moorings across the navigations. Works planned within this jurisdiction include a range of major projects such as upgrading Bagenalstown Lock on the Barrow; provision of a slipway and stabilisation of the dock walls at Grand Canal Dock, dredging the Grand Canal; development of houseboat facilities at Lowtown and Sallins; lifting the bridge at Tullamore depot; bridge upgrades, works on weirs and locks on the Shannon; and commencement of work on the Belturbet Service Block on the Shannon Erne and purchase of plant and machinery. Waterways Ireland continues to work within the funding available to continue to improve facilities across the waterways network.

As a regular user of places like the Shannon Navigation, one never ceases to be amazed at the number of non-nationals one meets on that waterway who have been coming back to Ireland year in, year out. I wonder to what extent the funding the Minister has available to him should be augmented by the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport. These waterways are of immense value to the local populations privileged to live in the catchment area of each amenity, along with their huge tourism importance. What sort of interaction does the Minister have with tourism bodies north of the Border and the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport? Is anything planned for the waterways under the auspices of The Gathering?

Those have made a major difference to both towns in different counties on either side of the Shannon. The result of that investment is obvious and local people would accept that. As regards involvement from Fáilte Ireland, Waterways Ireland is augmenting Fáilte Ireland's promotion of the waterways. Waterways Ireland is providing funding on an annual basis for the promotion of tourism on its waterways. It is a North-South body, which is also very important, because Tourism Ireland promotes the entire island and the waterways network of more than 1,000 navigable kilometres can really be pushed on an all-island basis and we are doing that. I have tried to minimise the reduction in funding for Waterways Ireland because of its North-South significance and its potential and considerable work has been done. We have improved facilities for tourists so we are now ready to proactively promote this great facility.

The Boyne is littered with internationally recognised heritage monuments and would be a fantastic tourist attraction that would bring people into the region. People who holiday in the region visit Trim Castle and Newgrange on coach trips and as ar result Meath does not get the full value of their tourism. The Boyne Canal runs from Navan to Drogheda. It is not covered by the Waterways Ireland network. Would the Minister agree that such a canal should be brought within the ambit of Waterways Ireland, along with other canals, and would he consider the funds that might be available to help with the development of such a green way along the River Boyne?

The focus of our investment in capital development will be from Clones to Lough Erne to the value of €35 million. As regards the green way, I do not have direct responsibility but any way I can help through Waterways Ireland, I will do so. As a keen cyclist and walker, I am all for encouraging green ways wherever possible. If the Deputy has a proposal I can forward to Waterways Ireland for discussion, I will gladly take it.

Therefore, the agency is accountable to the North-South Ministerial Council and to the Ministers in the sponsor Departments: the Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht and the Department of Culture, Arts and Leisure in Northern Ireland. The Ulster-Scots Agency is co-funded on the basis of 25% from my Department and 75% from the Department of Culture, Arts and Leisure in Northern Ireland. The North-South Ministerial Council approved an overall budget provision of €3,692,824 (£3,028,116) for 2011 and €3,251,103 (£2,828,460) for 2012 for the Ulster-Scots Agency.  While the 2013 business plans and budgets for the North-South Language Body are the subject of ongoing discussions between the sponsor Departments and will require formal approval by the North-South Ministerial Council, an overall allocation of €14.613 million has been allocated in the Revised Estimates for the North-South Language Body in 2013.

I understand that rather than recognising it as a language in the Good Friday Agreement, it was seen as part of the culture and wealth of Ireland as a whole. How many people speak the language on even an occasional basis? What sort of practical steps are being taken, using the funding being provided, to keep the language alive and to revive it? What method of evaluation does the implementation body apply to the expenditure of these funds?

Coming from Donegal, I recognise the importance of the Ulster-Scots language to sections of the people along the east Donegal border with Northern Ireland. I do not have an in-depth knowledge of the language but I have had the opportunity to listen to it and to spend time in the company of people who speak it regularly and I know they have a rich cultural heritage in music, song, dance and the language itself. There is a bimonthly newspaper that I always look forward to that is published both in English and Ulster-Scots. The language is more vibrant in some parts of Northern Ireland than others. In the east of the Province, if I can put it that way, along Antrim and Down, it is very prominent but it is to be found in every part of Northern Ireland and along Border counties, in Donegal, Cavan, Monaghan and perhaps Louth. The Ulster-Scots Agency has a board, four of whom are nominated by the Government and four by the Northern Executive. The board lays down policy and appoints a chief executive. We meet the board regularly and last Friday, on my way home from Dublin, I had the opportunity of attending a function in the hall in Raphoe where a play was being staged about the effect of partition from the Ulster-Scots perspective, and how it divided a family in east Donegal in 1924.The Minister and I had the pleasure of visiting their headquarters in Belfast a number of weeks ago and we were very impressed with what is going on there. I had the privilege and pleasure of opening a new office for the Ulster-Scots Agency in Raphoe, the entrance of which is from the street. That fine office is frequented by many people on a daily and weekly basis. The language is an important part of what makes us up and I believe we must give it parity of esteem. That is what it is all about. The Ulster-Scots language is as important to those who speak it as the Irish language is to us.

Whether it is a language or a dialect is a debate that continues; there is no doubt about that. I have one question on the Ulster-Scots Agency. My understanding is that the accounts of the Ulster-Scots Agency, or at least the combined accounts, have not been published for the past three years, and it seems there is a reason for the holding back of their publication by An Foras Teanga, which is the organisation for both the Ulster-Scots Agency and Foras na Gaeilge. Perhaps the Minister can shed some light on that and tell us how it will be solved. I believe there was a review of the functionality of An Foras Teanga in 2008, which has not yet been published. The review of the functionality of both organisations has not been published for five years. If we are waiting five years for the publication of a functionality review, it does not bode well for the efficiency of that organisation.

Since the new chief executive took over in recent times, there has been a noticeable improvement. There will be consolidated reports and we expect them shortly, perhaps at the meeting that will be held within the next fortnight. Deputy Tóibín's second question-----

Perhaps the Minister could look into it.
