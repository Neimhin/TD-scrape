#RoryKiely	unknown-#RoryKiely-party	unknown-#RoryKiely-dob	unknown-#RoryKiely-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-05 00:00:00	Prelude	0	I have received notice from Senator Terry that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, she proposes to raise the following matter:The need for the Minister for Education and Science to report on the steps she has taken to tackle the health and safety issues and class size problems in St. Brigid's national school, Beechpark, Castleknock.I have also received notice from Senator Morrissey on the following matter:The need for the Minister for Health and Children to extend the community mothers' programme to the greater Blanchardstown area, which has been operating in the Dublin area for the past seven years.I have also received notice from Senator Jim Walsh on the following matter:The need for the Minister for Health and Children to make a statement outlining the up-to-date position on the provision of additional bed space and other improvements at Wexford General Hospital.I have also received notice from Senator Feighan on the following matter:The need for the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government to outline the position on the proposed works on the N5, especially at the Rathcroghan heritage site between Tulsk and Frenchpark, County Roscommon.I have also received notice from Senator Norris on the following matter:The need for the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government to take action as a result of a general system complaint about the State's failure to enforce uniform planning regulations, illustrated by the case of the Sawmills in County Offaly, which was refused retention permission by An Bord Pleanála almost two years ago, and which has been drawn to his attention by the authorities of the environmental section of the European Union.I regard the matters raised by Senators Terry, Morrissey and Jim Walsh as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment and they will be taken at the conclusion of business. I regret I must rule out of order the matter raised by Senator Feighan, as the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government has no official responsibility on the matter, and also the matter raised by Senator Norris, which is sub judice.
#MaryORourke	unknown-#MaryORourke-party	unknown-#MaryORourke-dob	unknown-#MaryORourke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-05 00:00:00	Prelude	1	The Order of Business is No.1, a referral motion re motion 9 on the Order Paper. The motion concerns the Commission to Inquire into Child Abuse which was established in May 2000 for a period of two years, and which was subsequently extended in December 2001 for a period of three years, until 23 May 2005. The chairperson of the commission wrote to the Minister seeking a further extension of the commission's term. This was agreed by the Government. The motion is to be taken without debate; No. 2, Registration of Deeds and Title Bill 2004 — Order for Second Stage and Second Stage, to be taken on the conclusion of Order of Business and to conclude not later than 1.30 p.m.; spokespersons have 15 minutes each and all other Senators have ten minutes. The Minister is to be called upon to reply not later than ten minutes before the end of Second Stage.With your permission, a Chathaoirligh, I wish to explain the arrangements for a Bill which will come before the House later today. The Dáil is today dealing with urgent legislation, the British-Irish Agreement (Amendment) Bill 2005. It is hoped that the Bill will have concluded in the Dáil by 3.30 p.m. The Seanad will then be required to deal with the Bill. It is therefore proposed that all Stages of the Bill be taken from 4 p.m. to 6 p.m. Spokespersons will have 15 minutes each and other Senators ten minutes. The Minister is to be called upon to reply not later than ten minutes before the conclusion of Second Stage.The Bill is being presented by the Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, Deputy Ó Cuív. The Bill was placed in Senators' pigeon holes this morning. It is a narrow, technical measure, but I understand from what I have been told that it simply must go through the Oireachtas today. There will also be an earlier signature motion to which, if the Bill is passed, we will ask Members to agree. I assume the Bill will successfully pass through this House. There will be a sos from 1.30 p.m. until 4 p.m. to allow for the passage of the Bill through the Dáil. I understand people may wish to get away, but the Dáil will spend two hours on the Bill and it will then take another half hour before it is ready to come before the Seanad from 4 p.m. until 6 p.m. There is no way out of the timetable.
#BrianHayes	unknown-#BrianHayes-party	unknown-#BrianHayes-dob	unknown-#BrianHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-05 00:00:00	Prelude	2	It is unusual for a Bill to be rushed through in this manner. However, I understand that it relates to a mistake made in initial legislation concerning ground water and the applicability of the legislation to the bodies established under the British-Irish Agreement. We will support the Bill and ensure that it gets through this House today on the basis that it will help the bodies and ensure the continued work of the Agreement.Senator Norris raised a very important matter on yesterday's Order of Business concerning drink-related problems in accident and emergency departments at weekends. In the Dáil, the Taoiseach cited the extraordinary statistic that three out of four persons admitted to accident and emergency departments in Dublin acute hospitals at weekends are drunk. We have a responsibility to protect staff and patients who are genuinely sick, and an additional responsibility to make these other people pay an additional charge. It is unfair and wrong that they can abuse our health service for no other reason than they are out of their heads with drink. I ask the Leader to forcibly express my views and those of other Senators to the Minister for Health and Children.Additional Garda protection is also needed in accident and emergency departments over the weekend. It is a most unsatisfactory situation for staff and patients. Senator Norris and others proposed drunk tanks, whereby drunk people are segregated from ordinary, decent patients.

#BrianHayes	unknown-#BrianHayes-party	unknown-#BrianHayes-dob	unknown-#BrianHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-05 00:00:00	Prelude	4	The Minister for Health and Children should take up the issue.As a former Minister for Education and Science, and as someone who has particular educational expertise, will the Leader comment on the controversial website www.ratemyteacher.com? I have received complaints about this website from many decent, hard-working teachers in my own constituency and others. Very little can be done to take action because it is hosted in the United States. However, we have a responsibility to speak up for the vast majority of teachers who work hard in our schools but must put up with anonymous statements by students. It is unfair. If people have something to say they should do so to a person’s face or put their name to a statement.
#MaryORourke	unknown-#MaryORourke-party	unknown-#MaryORourke-dob	unknown-#MaryORourke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-05 00:00:00	Prelude	5	I fully agree with the Senator.
#BrianHayes	unknown-#BrianHayes-party	unknown-#BrianHayes-dob	unknown-#BrianHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-05 00:00:00	Prelude	6	They should not scurry around by means of a website, making anonymous comments. Teachers must be told by both Houses that their work is valued. This is a gimmick used by some as a means of making teachers accountable. People should state their opinions to others' faces rather than anonymously on a website.
#JoeOToole	unknown-#JoeOToole-party	unknown-#JoeOToole-dob	unknown-#JoeOToole-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-05 00:00:00	Prelude	7	I raised the issue of the Marino Institute of Education on yesterday's Order of Business and was pleased it was taken up by many others over the course of the day. Senator Fitzgerald mentioned that the real issue is what will happen to students in the future. It has now come to light that the college cannot finalise its teacher education budget for next year because it does not yet know the cost caused by the legal action fiasco. The college was advised not to take legal action but responded in a macho fashion by allowing the principal take a case for constructive dismissal. Its attitude was, to coin a term, "Bring it on". I will not try the Cathaoirleach's patience, but have written to him this morning seeking the urgent adjournment of the House to deal with the issue. I know he will respond positively and I hope to deal with this matter in an hour's time. I look for his support in this regard.There are two arguments with regard to the issue of special needs assistants. If a person is employed in a school to work as a special needs assistant with a child who has a certain disability, the person will develop skills in that specific area. That person will also develop skills in general areas of support for children with special needs. Therefore, it should be easy and reasonable to create opportunities for such people to apply for positions in other schools. A panel arrangement should be put in place whereby they can be redeployed to schools for which they would be suitable.I express my thanks to Senator Mansergh for setting the record straight regarding public and private service pay contrary to what Senator Ross had said. I misled the House somewhat——
#ShaneRoss	unknown-#ShaneRoss-party	unknown-#ShaneRoss-dob	unknown-#ShaneRoss-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-05 00:00:00	Prelude	8	It was not the first time.
#JoeOToole	unknown-#JoeOToole-party	unknown-#JoeOToole-dob	unknown-#JoeOToole-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-05 00:00:00	Prelude	9	I had a serious argument with Senator Ross some years ago when we were discussing benchmarking. I made the point that public service pensions were taken into consideration and that the benchmarking award was duly reduced. I now find that I made a mistake and concede the point. This morning the ESRI stated that private sector pensions cost the State more than public sector pensions, which is a disgrace. The private sector should pay us back money. There must be a proper adjustment of awards in the new benchmarking arrangements to ensure a decent increase next time around which takes into consideration the huge amount the State is spending on private sector pensions.
#BrendanRyan	unknown-#BrendanRyan-party	unknown-#BrendanRyan-dob	unknown-#BrendanRyan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-05 00:00:00	Prelude	10	Like everybody else, I am mystified by what is happening in the Marino Institute of Education. The Government should not take the easier route and say it is a matter for the college. We cannot have the sort of chaos which has descended.The ESRI report meshes with some of the particularly eccentric comments made yesterday regarding benchmarking. The last benchmarking report had no background information because IBEC insisted that every scrap of information it submitted about private sector salaries should be destroyed so that it would not become accessible. That is why there was no back-up report. There were only conclusions without any back-up because the employers' group, in particular, was very insistent that any information it had supplied never became public. Let us have another benchmarking review and let the entire basis for its conclusions be made public, rather than having a report without background information. We know the result, namely, salaries in different areas will fluctuate, more or less in harmony but a little out of phase.I agree with what has been said about the website, www.ratemyteacher.com, although I looked at it and any teachers I know were rated highly. However, that is not the point. The most important thing teachers want from us as politicians is to ensure they are properly paid. Therefore, if another benchmarking award is made, some political parties should not decide to jump on a bandwagon and suggest it should not be paid. That is how one devalues teachers.
#BrianHayes	unknown-#BrianHayes-party	unknown-#BrianHayes-dob	unknown-#BrianHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-05 00:00:00	Prelude	11	It would be a bandwagon of double salaries.

#BrendanRyan	unknown-#BrendanRyan-party	unknown-#BrendanRyan-dob	unknown-#BrendanRyan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-05 00:00:00	Prelude	15	On the Order of Business, the ESRI report on pensions is worthy of debate in this House. There has been a massive rush towards tax incentives for private pensions and while one has no problem with that in principle, it ought to be a form of incentive which is not simply making well-off people even better off. This is essentially what the ESRI is saying.
#MaryMWhite	unknown-#MaryMWhite-party	unknown-#MaryMWhite-dob	unknown-#MaryMWhite-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-05 00:00:00	Prelude	16	In the light of the shedding of 485 jobs by Waterford Crystal, I call on the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Martin, to provide us with a snapshot of the current state of small and medium sized indigenous industries. I do not want to hear general statistics about growth figures and the like. I want to hear about the real state of indigenous industries, which in many cases are at the heart of communities. Today, Ireland has the highest costs in Europe. How can a company compete against a weak dollar? Any indigenous industry worth its salt must export and most of our exports are outside the eurozone. We are under severe pressure with exchange rates and the costs of doing business in Ireland.

The point is made that it can make a difference to prevent consumers from being ripped off by anti-competitive behaviour by using its enforcement powers. Apparently, according to the economist Patrick Massey, it is not doing so. I am unsure if a report has been published, but if this is the case, can the Leader of the House arrange a debate on it? It is important that we do so.On the point I raised yesterday regarding pensions, I support Senator Ryan. It would be a very useful debate in this House. I also raise the promised Employment Permits Bill and the new Defamation Bill. The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy McDowell, gave a preview of it to a selected group last night. When does the Leader of the House expect those Bills? Will they be initiated in this House? The Leader might give an indication as to when the Members can expect both of them.

I have spoken to several teachers who found it to be particularly hurtful. They find it hurtful because it is anonymous. It is unclear if the comments even come from a pupil. A conspiracy could exist against an individual and it is very ungenerous for young people to put such insulting comments on the site. We expect young people to be courageous, forthright and to nail their colours to the mast.Another aspect of this matter concerns the advertisers. Some very well-known business interests advertise on the site and I wonder how they can justify it. The view of the teachers is that many teachers give time over and above the call of duty outside of school hours. It is all right for an older teacher who has a track record and feels confident but this can be demeaning and hurtful for a young teacher in his or her first year who is trying to build up confidence in the profession.I am aware that we can do nothing about this matter in a legislative sense, but we should be aware that this is insidious. I do not blame the pupils. I blame the site, which is based in America, and I also question those people in Ireland who advertise on it.

#DavidNorris	unknown-#DavidNorris-party	unknown-#DavidNorris-dob	unknown-#DavidNorris-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-05 00:00:00	Prelude	30	In the light of the welcome and positive reports that appeared in the newspapers today about the Cabinet proposals for a €20 billion transport initiative over the next few years, which will include a metro with a link to Dublin Airport and on to Swords, I ask the Leader for a debate on this important subject. It is necessary for the House to give support because the idea for the metro came from here. The Oireachtas Joint Committee on Transport unanimously supported a metro and has commissioned a report from an independent expert which has also endorsed it. At this stage, it would be politically useful to give the Government support, particularly because there will be the usual cavilling questions from the Department of Finance.I also ask for a debate on Iraq because it has been some time since we monitored the situation there and it was useful when we did so previously. We now know that the British Prime Minister, Mr. Blair, clearly lied because we are in possession of the full text of Lord Goldsmith's advice to the British Government. The terms in which this advice was written raise worries about the morality of politics in our neighbouring island. It includes references like "greying the line" and notes that matters would be illegal, but that efforts must be made to try to justify it. We no longer hear so much about it. However, almost every day, there are explosions in Iraq, with ten, 20, 30, 60 or 100 people killed. They say the war is won and is over. It is a disaster, and we should not let it slip from our consciousness.On a positive note, an anniversary has occurred that we should be proud to celebrate in Ireland. I have just received the Genealogical Society of Ireland's newsletter, as have the other Members. Until I read it, I was not aware that this year is the flag of the European Union's 50th anniversary. The flag, with its blue background and 12 gold stars reflecting the membership, was designed by the Chief Herald of Ireland and accepted by the EEC in 1955. We can be proud that the flag, which is still used as the emblem of the European Union, was produced by Irish genius and craftsmanship and we should celebrate this 50th anniversary.

Some of the details which emerged yesterday were shocking and many questions need to be answered. Our primary concern is for the students and staff, but we could all benefit from a debate on the issue as a matter of the utmost urgency as it is a very serious situation.I also wish to raise the issue of local government funding, which I have raised here previously. For a number of years now, we have been informed that a review of local government funding is under way, but there is no sign of its completion. Can the Leader arrange for the Minister to come to the House to debate the issue? In the meantime, local authorities all over the country resolve budgetary shortfalls by increasing commercial rates. While all businesses must pay their fair share and are willing to do so, the situation whereby 8% of the beneficiaries pay 50% of the budget must be addressed. We need a more equitable system.
#SheilaTerry	unknown-#SheilaTerry-party	unknown-#SheilaTerry-dob	unknown-#SheilaTerry-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-05 00:00:00	Prelude	32	I join with the other Members who have asked for a debate on the ESRI report on pensions. Although we have had debates at my request on pensions in this House previously, it is timely that we have one now following the publication of this report and also in light of the many articles which one frequently reads about SSIA money and the efforts of the pensions industry to get its hands on it when it matures and that the Minister for Finance may be considering some other form of pension to tie in with the money. I am concerned the Minister will not demand that the pensions industry provide some protection for private sector pensions in return for any new deal. Senator O'Toole is correct that the Government is spending millions of euro in tax relief for the private pensions industry and we are not getting value for money. While I welcome the guarantees afforded to public sector pensions, the same is needed for those in the private sector. It is time we had another debate on this issue because the Minister is considering matters in this area.

This research shows that heavy and reckless drinking by young women, particularly when they are pregnant, is leading to a considerable amount of very severe abnormalities, particularly intellectual disabilities, among newborn babies. A debate on this issue would be timely, particularly one that focused on early education to combat binge drinking. This kind of preventive education should be introduced in primary schools. I am aware that some people consider this kind of education too shocking to be introduced in primary schools but I believe it is necessary because binge drinking will affect society today and in the future. It will have a long-term effect on the Exchequer with regard to health and education spending.
#JoeMcHugh	unknown-#JoeMcHugh-party	unknown-#JoeMcHugh-dob	unknown-#JoeMcHugh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-05 00:00:00	Prelude	34	I agree with Senator White who raised a very relevant point with regard to the long-term sustainability of indigenous industry. Our economists can only forecast as far as 2006 regarding predicted growth of 5.5%. One does not have to be a rocket scientist to know that we will have that growth because 12% of all investment resources are tied up in the construction sector. We must examine the post-construction sector of the economy. As everyone is aware, indigenous industry throughout the country is tied up with the construction sector.If there is a lesson to be learned, it is with regard to the manufacturing sector. We learned a very hard lesson in Donegal, where the Government was left with the problem of what to do with the workforce following the decline of the manufacturing sector. The Government sent workers on computer courses as a solution. We should plan for the future.

I have spoken on many occasions about the need for radiotherapy services around the country. I do not wish to labour the point but many people are suffering and we need a debate on this issue. The Department of Health and Children is breaching its own cancer care guidelines over dedicated oncology wards, which are not available in many hospitals.Waterford Wedgewood announced yesterday that it is to close its plant in Dungarvan with the loss of approximately 400 jobs. If one examines the scale of this closure, a closure of its magnitude in Dublin would result in 30,000 to 40,000 jobs being lost. We need an urgent debate on the closure of the Dungarvan plant and the Minister should come to the House and urge the IDA to redouble its efforts. I do not think the IDA is doing enough for provincial towns like Dungarvan.
#FergalQuinn	unknown-#FergalQuinn-party	unknown-#FergalQuinn-dob	unknown-#FergalQuinn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-05 00:00:00	Prelude	38	Figures published last Saturday in The Irish Times indicate that 70% of the wider prison population reoffend after they are released from prison. The Government introduced the Connect scheme some years ago, which dramatically reduced the rate of recidivism among participants. Only 5% of the scheme’s participants reoffended and wound up in prison again. The abolition of the Connect scheme some two or three years ago received no publicity. This issue should be debated in the House and I ask the Leader to consider asking the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to debate the prison visiting committee reports. I attended Wheatfield prison on one occasion as part of the Connect scheme with which I was extremely impressed. I was stunned last weekend to learn of its abolition.

The ESRI report addressed a very important point. Senator O'Toole's point that the private sector was costing €1.5 billion in relief to taxpayers should be debated. This debate would address the pensions industry. It is very easy to say that €1.5 billion is being lost to the Exchequer, which is undoubtedly true in a very forensic way. However, we need to ask the Minister to address the question of who has their fingers in the pensions pie. The pensions industry is a complete racket involving bankers, brokers, fund managers, lawyers, consultants and all kinds of people making a fortune——

I am asking the Leader to respond to my request for a debate. All the people I mentioned are making a fortune out of the pensions pie. If these people took less, and they have a vested interest in this industry's continuance, there would be much more money available for the taxpayer and the €1.5 billion would be substantially reduced every year.

Blanked-out shopfronts can be seen in every town in Ireland as a result of increased rates, insurance and fees. It is of paramount importance that we have a debate on this matter urgently because we owe it to the small businesses of this country to support them. The Government has not done enough for small businesses.The Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government should come to the House to discuss the role of Dúchas. Dúchas appears to be unaccountable and today, under a notice for the Adjournment, I saw Dúchas' position on the heritage site at Rathcroghan. I received a reply stating this was not the function of the NRA. I would like to find out Dúchas' position on the proposed advice on——

We are now in May and schools are facing another September without having advanced through the programme. The devolved grants are a welcome step but in one school in County Carlow, instead of receiving the €1 million it was looking for, it got €560,000. This left the school in an awkward situation because it is not enough to proceed and a refusal would result in its going back a few years in terms of building. This is a disaster.The announcement by the Minister last week about 124 schools progressing through the architectural planning stage is a complete myth. Two schools in County Carlow have gone backwards in this process, which is hard to believe. A secondary school in County Carlow received word four or five years ago that it would get a new building but last week——

They are causing a danger not just to themselves, as they brought on their conditions themselves, but to staff and other patients. The Senator asked that these views be conveyed to the Taoiseach's office and I will do so. Senator Brian Hayes then mentioned the website www.ratemyteachers.ie. There is nothing one can do about a website. The Senator strongly commented that something should be said to a person’s face and I could not agree more. People scurrying around talking about others is the wrong way to conduct one’s business. One should seek an appointment with one’s teacher and say it then. I cannot stand people who mutter in dark corners and who do not say what they want to say.

I telephoned the Minister for Education and Science's private secretary yesterday. The Minister is giving a lecture in Poland and will not be back in Ireland until the night of 6 May. I was told that she had just cleared, checked and made changes to the Adjournment debates on this issue in the other House. One sometimes wonders whether the parent Minister has made her imprint upon an Adjournment debate when it is held by another Minister or Minister of State but she has done so on this issue. I agree there should be clarity on the matter.I asked yesterday about having a panel arrangement for special needs assistants because I take the Senator's point. If one is dealing with children who have a disadvantage of some kind, one requires skills of a general nature that can be transferred into specifics later. To lose such people is wrong.Senator O'Toole also said that private sector pensions cost more than public sector pensions. Senator Ryan joined with him in asking for the Government to intervene in the Marino institute case. Senator Ryan then said during the debate on benchmarking that all of the documents and evidence should be included in the report this time rather than having some destroyed.Senator White asked for a debate on indigenous small industries and asked for the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment to address the House. She suggested what the Minister should say but we have no control over that. However, the European Central Bank's report is positive about Ireland, citing 5.2% economic growth this year, an increase from 4.7%. I remind the House that the euro was worth US$0.90 two years ago and is now worth $1.30. Oil prices have also doubled. The report also says there was an increase in exports from Ireland in 2005.

The Senator was present yesterday when I asked the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment to bring the legislation to the House. There is a legislative meeting today during which this matter can be aired.Senator Ó Murchú thought it ungenerous of young people to berate their teachers. The website was started in the UK and those who advertise on the site are doing so because it is viewed often. Nothing can be done about this. Senator Norris asked for a debate on future transport policy, such as the metro and other matters concerning the millions of euro to be invested. He also commented on the war in Iraq and was correct in saying we have not had an up-to-date debate, particularly in view of the British Attorney General's report on the matter, which mentioned illegality.I remember the day I said in this House that the war in Iraq was illegal. I felt the world falling on top of me in condemnation but we only saw the tip of the iceberg. Senator Norris also gave us some interesting facts. I did not know the Chief Herald of Ireland had devised the EU flag and that this is its 50th anniversary.Senator MacSharry called for an urgent debate on the Marino Institute of Education and pointed out that the shortfall in local government funding is being made up by increased business rates. This is the case in every local authority. I often feel this is not fair on business ratepayers who are asked to supply far more than the consumer price index increases.Senator Terry has been hammering at the pensions issue for some time and she spoke about the private and public sectors. Senator Feeney spoke about the research by Trinity College, Dublin, showing that young pregnant women who drink run a risk of abnormalities in their children. The Senator asked for another debate on youth drinking.Senator McHugh raised the issue of the indigenous construction industry, about which he has often spoken. Senator Kenneally spoke about cancer care and what is occurring with Waterford Crystal in Dungarvan. We made the point yesterday that the scale of job losses in so small an area is significant and I can only imagine what it is like. Senator Cummins also raised this issue yesterday but I thank Senator Kenneally, as I know he is involved. Senator Quinn mentioned that under the old Connect project, the recidivist rate was only 5% compared with 70% among other prisoners. This arose from a report on prison visits. The Senator called for a debate on the report.Senator Cummins asked why the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform has refused to go to the annual conference of the Prison Officers Association. Whether he goes is the Minister's business. I do not keep his diary but the Senator can be sure he has a good reason. If the Senator goes——

Senator Ross supported Senator Terry's call for a debate on the pensions industry. He went on to make strong statements about the industry and all those who have their fingers in the pension pie.

Before doing so, however, I wish to explain why the provisions set out in the Bill are so important. I also wish to inform Senators about a related joint project involving my Department and the Law Reform Commission, currently under way, which aims to modernise all our land and conveyancing laws.Effective and efficient property registration structures and systems are essential requirements in a successful market economy. Registration of ownership of land confirms and underpins the owner's rights to use and enjoy that land. The ability to demonstrate good title also facilitates the disposal of the land, whether the owner is trading up or trading down, a private individual or a business enterprise. Having good title to land allows the owner to use the asset to gain access to borrowing which, in the case of an enterprise, may be required to launch or expand the business or to diversify into another area of business. In the case of private individuals, re-mortgaging a property may allow the owner to, for example, assist a family member in gaining a foothold on the property ladder.It is clear that effective land registration systems have the capacity to contribute in a meaningful way to the level of economic activity in a country. The costs within an efficient registration system should be maintained at reasonable levels by ensuring that registration procedures are straightforward and delays are avoided. Effective registration systems also have the capacity to enhance national competitiveness by making the country more attractive to the international community as a potential investment location.A report published by the World Bank earlier this year entitled Doing Business in 2005, drew attention to the need for sound property registration systems as a means of enhancing business activity. The bank included two new indicators in the report, in addition to the five indicators in the report of 2004. One of these new indicators deals with the registration of property and includes the following specifics: the number of procedures legally required to register a property; the time spent in completing the procedures; and the costs involved including fees, stamp duties and payments to lawyers.According to the World Bank, Ireland ranks 15th overall out of 145 countries studied in terms of conducting business. While this is a good performance, it should be noted that five EU countries had a higher ranking: the UK was ranked seventh, Sweden ninth, Denmark 12th, the Netherlands 13th and Finland 14th.Ireland's overall ranking would have been higher but for our showing under the new property registration indicators. According to the bank's report, five procedures are legally required in Ireland to transfer property from seller to buyer, whereas three are required in Austria, Finland and Spain and only two procedures are required in Belgium and the UK. It takes an average of 38 days to register property in Ireland, compared with five days in the Netherlands, 14 in Finland and 21 in the UK. The costs involved appear to be much higher in Ireland than in most of the countries surveyed. Direct comparisons of costs must be treated with caution, however, because of differences of approach between countries on taxation and other charges.This is the first time the World Bank has used property registration indicators in this way and I am reluctant to draw decisive conclusions from the 2005 report. However, from the bank's analysis, it appears that Ireland is lagging behind certain other EU member states on property registration and that reforms in this area would make it easier to do business in this country and would help to improve our overall international competitiveness rating.I am committed to reforms in two areas for which I have responsibility, with a view to overcoming shortcomings that have been identified. I want to modernise land and conveyancing law and bring about a structural reform of the registration system, which is the subject matter of the Bill before us today.My Department is involved in a joint project with the Law Reform Commission aimed at modernising our land and conveyancing law. A commission consultation paper, Reform and Modernisation of Land Law and Conveyancing Law, was published in October 2004. It contains over 90 recommendations for a radical overhaul of all our land and conveyancing statutes.Publication of the consultation paper marked the end of the first stage of the joint project. It was followed by a consultation process, including a conference last November that was addressed by several international experts on land and conveyancing law. The final stage of the project, which is now under way, involves the drafting of a Bill to give legislative effect to the commission's recommendations. I expect the draft Bill to be published in the form of a Law Reform Commission report in mid-July of this year. This report will comprise a fundamental reforming statute on property law in Ireland. I intend to seek Government approval for proposals for future legislation in this area later this year.The emphasis in future legislation will be on simplifying and updating the law. Radical reforms are justified for several reasons. First, they will simplify the land and conveyancing law, making it more easily understood by legal practitioners and the public. Second, the reforms will update this area of law to accommodate changing social, economic and demographic needs, including new forms of property ownership such as shared apartments. Finally, the reforms will make the conveyancing of property easier and faster, with a view to reducing onerous costs and delays.The Law Reform Commission consultation paper identified over 150 pre-1922 statutes that will now be repealed, the earliest of which date back to the 13th century — the 1285 Statute of Westminster II and the 1290 Statute of Westminster III. The removal of so much ancient and redundant statute law will be a significant contribution to the process of regulatory reform, including statute law revision, to which the Government has committed itself.The main aims of the Registration of Deeds and Title Bill 2004 are to reform the structure and procedures of the Registry of Deeds and to improve the operation of the registration of title system operated by the Land Registry under the Registration of Title Act 1964. As it stands, the Bill provides for a combination of administrative and technical provisions concerning the Registry of Deeds, while those relating to the Land Registry are largely technical.The registration of deeds system operated by the Registry of Deeds provides for the registration of documents in respect of land to establish priorities between documents dealing with the same piece of land. The act of registering a document does not in itself guarantee title to the land covered by that document. On the other hand, the registration of title system, which is operated by the Land Registry, registers the actual ownership of the land.The Registry of Deeds was established under the Registration of Deeds (Ireland) Act 1707 and many of its current practices and procedures are governed by the provisions of that Act, as well as by other antiquated statutes dating from the 18th and 19th centuries. The result is that the Registry of Deeds does not have the required margin of operational flexibility to respond adequately to the changed conditions of today.

It appears that the operation of the board and the conduct of its members has resulted in a legal fiasco. I wish the House to examine to role of the Svengali-like figures on the legal committee of the board who pushed the institute into taking a disastrous legal action that has cost so much money that the normal work of the institute cannot continue. The role of the person who said that the institute was sitting on 38 acres of prime land in north Dublin, it should get back to work and then set up a meeting of the board in an office of Treasury Holdings must be analysed. I feel these matters need to be discussed. This man is a former chairman of one of the docks operations.

This will involve the outright repeal of the eight old statutes under which the Registry of Deeds currently operates and their replacement, where necessary, with modern provisions. I think Senator Norris will be struck by the following matter. The Registration of Deeds Act 1707, which we are proposing to get rid of, states it is an Act "for securing purchases, preventing forgeries and fraudulent gifts and conveyances of land, tenements and hereditaments, which have been frequently practised in this kingdom, especially by papists, to the great prejudice of the Protestant interest thereof".

In the early 21st century we will repeal a post-penal law statute. I want to acknowledge that the Registry of Deeds has served this country well since its establishment back in 1707. I also want to take this opportunity to thank the Registrar of Deeds and the registry's staff for their commitment and hard work. I visited the registry recently, having studied for many years in the King's Inns portion of the building. I had never been in the registry before. It is an extraordinary building and an extraordinary system that has existed for three centuries. The fundamental principles that operate there have remained largely untouched.Part 2 of the Bill, sections 5 to 29, provides an updated legal basis for the registry's operations. The general aim has been to ensure, as far as possible, there is a uniform and coherent approach to registration in both the Registry of Deeds and the Land Registry. For this reason, the new provisions set out in this part are, where appropriate, based on corresponding provisions in the Registration of Title Act 1964 which govern the operations of the Land Registry. The detailed registration procedures will be set out in general rules which will be drawn up and implemented under the power provided in section 26.Section 5 contains the definitions of various words and terms appearing in this part of the Bill. The broad definition of "deed" is worth noting. It includes "information in electronic or other non-legible form which is capable of being converted into any of the preceding documents". Although the system of registration of deeds was established in 1707, it will now be adapted to take electronic documents into account. Sections 6 to 11 contain revised provisions relating to the structure and staffing of the registry, while section 12 makes provision for the charging of fees for the registry's services. The latter is based on the corresponding section in the Registration of Title Act 1964 regarding Land Registry services.Section 13 makes provision for the register of deeds. To facilitate computerisation of records, it is provided that the register may be in an electronic or other non-legible form which is capable of being converted into legible form. Section 14 deals with the applications for registration of deeds. While the current legislation goes into exhaustive detail on this matter, section 14 simply provides that the manner of application and registration shall be set out in general rules to be made at a later stage under section 26. This flexibility will allow the registry to adapt to and take advantage of future advances in information technologies and systems.The method by which applications for registration are to be recorded in the future is addressed in section 15. At present, applications are recorded according to the day and hour at which they are lodged in the Registry of Deeds. The mere fact that memorials must be physically delivered to the registry is outdated considering that an increasing number of sales and conveyances are now being completed in electronic form. The current antiquated system also hinders any progression towards e-conveyancing. As an alternative I have decided that in future all applications will be allocated a serial number. The method by which the numbers will be allocated will be laid down in general rules.Establishment of priority between deeds has been the primary purpose of the Registry of Deeds system since its establishment in 1707. Section 16 provides that deeds shall rank in priority among themselves according to the priority determined by the serial number allocated under section 15. In the event that two deeds relating to the same piece of land are presented for registration on the same day, the deed with the earlier serial number will have priority.The section further provides that a deed which is not registered is void against a deed which has been registered. In subsection (3), I have made provision for those rare occasions where a person claiming under a registered deed had knowledge of an earlier unregistered deed. Notwithstanding the provisions contained in this section, the normal rules of law or equity will apply in such cases. It has been the practice of the registry to receive memorials of instruments in cases where execution by grantees only is proved. Section 17 is a technical provision designed to remove any future doubts regarding the validity of such memorials.One of the most curious features of the current legislation governing the Registry of Deeds is the lack of any provision for rectifying errors, even where an error originates in the registry itself. Section 18, which is based on the corresponding section 32 of the Registration of Title Act 1964, introduces such a provision for the first time. Section 19 makes it an offence for any person to procure or try to procure the registration of a deed which is false in any material respect or where the person knows the signature on the deed to be false. The penalty on summary conviction is set at a fine not exceeding €3,000 or imprisonment for a term not exceeding one year or both. Where a person is convicted on indictment, the penalty is a fine or imprisonment for a term not exceeding five years or both, which makes it an arrestable offence.Section 13 makes provision for the keeping of a register of deeds. Section 20 provides for the retention of other records, such as indexes, in the registry. Once again, it provides that such records may be held in electronic or other non-legible form capable of conversion to a permanent legible form. This will be a revolution. On my trip around the Registry of Deeds I saw rooms filled with vellum dating from the early 18th century. They are fascinating documents and are museum pieces in many respects. The new system will be adapted for the 21st century.Searches of its register and records have always been a part of the service provided by the Registry of Deeds. The method by which such searches is to be carried out is prescribed in great detail in current legislation. This is inflexible and, therefore, unsatisfactory. In future, the manner by which such searches shall be carried out should be governed by general rules. Section 21 provides for this.Section 22 deals with the inspection and examination of the register and other records held in the Registry of Deeds. The section provides that a person may inspect, examine, make notes of or take extracts from any such register or records. The manner in which the searches should be made and any conditions relating to the searching or inspection of the register or records shall be prescribed in general rules. In section 23, provision is made for judicial notice to be taken of copies of the register or any other record held in the Registry of Deeds. The word "reproduction" is included in subsection (a) because I believe that printouts of records held in electronic or non-legible form should be admissible where certified by a member of the staff of the Registry of Deeds without requiring any further proof. The purpose is to avoid having to prove such printouts as original documents, for example under the best evidence rule.One of the many anachronisms in current legislation is the provision dealing with the index of lands established under section 17 of the Registry of Deeds (Ireland) Act 1832. This index was to be used, in conjunction with the names index, for the purpose of searching the register. In practice, the names index proved more useful and the index of lands fell into disuse. As a consequence, it has not been maintained since 1946. Section 24 gives authority to the closing of the index of lands on 31 December 1946. A similar index in Northern Ireland was closed in 1967. Certain other records held in the Registry of Deeds have not always been maintained in accordance with the old and outdated legislation.Section 25 addresses this and provides that the various books mentioned there were closed during the periods in which they were not properly maintained. I have already mentioned that in future detailed practices and procedures will be set out in general rules. Section 26 provides that the rules committee established under section 44 may make rules in respect of these and other matters. These rules will replace all those outdated and prescriptive provisions contained in the pre-1922 statutes which are being repealed.Section 27 is a transitional provision which covers the lodgement of applications for registration prior to commencement of the section. It also provides that nothing contained in this part of the Bill affects the registration or priority of a deed registered prior to the commencement of the section.The legislation under which the Land Registry operates also needs updating in order to facilitate the ongoing modernisation of practices and procedures, such as the use of digital maps and the computerisation of records. The proposed amendments to the 1964 Act which are set out in Part 3 of the Bill meet this need and also pave the way for the introduction in due course of an electronic conveyancing system known colloquially as e-conveyancing.Section 30 amends section 3 of the 1964 Act which contains various definitions. A new definition of "index" is added while several other definitions will be amended. In particular, the definition of the Land Purchase Acts in the 1964 Act is being amended by deleting the current reference to the Irish Church Act 1869. This change is related to the amendment of section 23 of the 1964 Act, which is provided for in section 34.Section 23 of the 1964 Act deals with the compulsory registration of freehold title in certain circumstances, including any land sold, conveyed or vested under the Land Purchase Acts. It appears that difficulties have arisen on titles to property which were the subject of redemption of a fee farm rent under the Irish Church Act 1869. The Law Reform Commission first recommended legislative change on this matter in a 1989 report and returned to it with a revised recommendation in a 2003 report. It is intended that dropping the reference to the 1869 Act from the definition of the Land Purchase Acts, together with the proposed amendment to section 23 of the 1964 Act in section 34, will remedy the difficulties that have been identified. The section also deletes the definitions of "local office" and "local registrar". The 1964 Act made provision for local offices in each county other than County Dublin and for the county registrar to act as the local registrar of the Land Registry. The local registrars kept duplicates of the registers in local offices for inspection by persons residing in the locality. However, in future, the register will be available electronically and this will in turn obviate the need to maintain duplicates at local level.Section 31 states that there shall be an office or offices for the purpose of registering ownership of land in the State to be known as the Land Registry. The new section is similar in construction to that proposed in section 6 of the Bill for the Registry of Deeds. Section 32 amends section 12 of the 1964 Act, which deals with staffing, to delete the references in it to local offices. Section 33 deals with the official seal of the Registrar of Titles.The recommendation of the Law Reform Commission on land sold, conveyed or vested under the Irish Church Act 1869 is dealt with in section 34. Paragraph (a) deletes the words “or is deemed to have been” from section 23(1)(a). The benefit of this deletion is that no person could query a title on the grounds that while registration was no longer compulsory, it had been compulsory at some time in the past and should now be registered. Paragraph (b) expressly provides that registration of ownership of such land is deemed never to have been required merely by virtue of the sale, conveyance or vesting. In short, the section removes land covered by the Irish Church Act 1869 from compulsory registration and, in cases where it has not been registered, provides that compulsory registration is deemed never to have been required for such lands.Section 35 substitutes new subsection (1) into section 32 of the 1964 Act. The effect of the new subsection is to enable the registrar to amend errors originating in the register where she or he is satisfied that the error can be rectified without injustice to any party.Section 36 substitutes a new section 84 in the 1964 Act. Section 84 deals with the maps used in the Land Registry. The new section is designed to enable the Land Registry to use digital maps and is a vital provision which will eventually facilitate e-conveyancing of land. Section 37 replaces section 85 of the 1964 Act, which deals with the description and identification of registered lands, and is a consequence of the preceding amendment. The powers of a person entitled to be registered as owner of land or of a charge are dealt with in section 90 of the 1964 Act. Concern has been expressed that the powers granted under section 90 are too narrow because they do not refer to the granting of a lease, an easement or a profit à prendre. This concern is addressed in section 38 of the Bill. Computerisation will require changes in procedures regarding searches and inspection of records. Section 39 provides for inspections and searches of the register and maps in the form in which it is recorded or in a legible reproduction of it.Compensation for losses suffered as a result of errors in the register originating in the Land Registry is governed by section 120 of the 1964 Act. One specific part of section 120 which has been the subject of criticism in the courts is subsection (5)(b), which provides that the registrar shall determine the claim. Section 40 amends section 120 of the 1964 Act to avoid any reference to the determination of a claim by the registrar and provides that if a claim is not settled either the claimant or the Minister for Finance may apply to the court to determine the amount of compensation payable. The registrar is no longer the arbitrar of compensation for errors of this kind.Section 41 amends section 123 of the 1964 Act, which deals with the effect of words of transfer. In 1998, the Law Reform Commission recommended certain changes. The amendments set out in the new subsections (4) and (5) are needed because section 123 as currently constituted does not appear to apply to the granting of rights such as an easement or a profit à prendre. Without these words of limitation it would appear that the easement or profit à prendre would last for the lifetime of the grantee only. These amendments will only apply to instruments of transfer dated after the commencement of this section.Section 42 is a new provision which will enable judicial notice to be taken of certified copies of entries in registers or other records, including certified copies of reproductions of documents, entries or records kept electronically. It mirrors the provision included in section 23 on the Registry of Deeds.It is intended that a new registration of deeds and title rules committee will be established under section 44 to oversee the making of general rules for both the Land Registry and the Registry of Deeds. Section 43 amends section 126 of the 1964 Act to take account of the new committee. At present, the making of general rules for the Land Registry is carried out by the Registration of Title Rules Committee established under section 73 of the Courts of Justice Act 1936. There is no current legal provision allowing for the making of general rules for the Registry of Deeds. As stated earlier, the practices and procedures of the Registry of Deeds are governed by primary legislation dating back to the 19th centuryPart 4 provides for the establishment of a new committee to be known as the Registration of Deeds and Title Rules Committee. Section 44 provides that it shall perform the function assigned to it under section 26 of this Bill and under section 126 of the Registration of Title Act 1964. Subsection (2) contains provisions for the membership of the committee. It shall consist of a judge of the High Court assigned by the President of the High Court, who shall act a chair of the committee, the Registrar of Deeds, the Registrar of Titles, who shall act as secretary, a barrister nominated by the Bar Council and a solicitor nominated by the Law Society. Section 5 provides that the committee established under section 44 shall meet at least once a year and shall report to the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform on matters falling within its remit.I wish to inform the House that the Government has approved my proposals for a restructuring of the Registry of Deeds and the Land Registry. I intend to bring forward a series of amendments to the Bill on Committee Stage which will convert the Registry of Deeds and the Land Registry into a statutory body on the lines of the Courts Service. The new body will be known as the Property Registration Authority and will have a representative board, including representatives of conveyancing interests as well as consumer, staff and other relevant interests. I believe that this new structure will put the registries on a sound administrative footing and will underpin the modernisation process which is already well advanced in the registries. I am also mindful that these reforms will allow theregistries to take full advantage of the changes in the substantive law to which I referred earlier.The reforms set out in the Bill will make the conveyancing of land easier and faster and will reduce delays associated with registration. I believe it is a necessary and important Bill. It is in line with the Government's intentions on regulatory reform as outlined in the White Paper, Regulating Better, and will, when enacted, contribute to economic activity at home and improved international competitiveness.This is part of a three pronged approach to the reform of our land laws. The first is the material in the Bill before this house. The second is a new part which I will bring forward on Committee Stage in the near future. The effect of this part will be to combine these two bodies, one of which is 17th century and the other a 20th century successor to a 19th century body, into one 21st century semi-State body. That semi-State body will be a property registration authority. Its purpose will be to drive forward the process of registration of land on a modern, electronic and consumer-friendly basis.It will be subtended by the third prong, that is, the radical revision of our law of property. In 1925 Lord Birkenhead, F. E. Smith, was the champion of the reform of the English law of property. The law of property after 1925 swept aside huge chunks of Victorian, Georgian and medieval legislation and replaced it with a single modern statute governing land law.I am pleased to inform the House that the Law Reform Commission, assisted by Professor John Wylie and officials of my Department, has greatly progressed the project to set out in one statute the land law of Ireland. We will publish the heads of that statute in the relatively near future. That, combined with the programme which is already under way for electronic registration of documents and electronic mapping of properties which are the subject of registration, will transform, within a short period, the law of property here for practitioners from what is currently a familiar but cluttered slum to a modern edifice worthy of a country that wants to do business in the real world.
#MauriceCummins	unknown-#MauriceCummins-party	unknown-#MauriceCummins-dob	unknown-#MauriceCummins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-05 00:00:00	Prelude	93	I welcome the Minister to the House. I also welcome the Bill. I thank the Minister for his comprehensive explanation of its contents and other legislation that will come before us in the relatively near future. I liked the Minister's overview and description of the old Registry of Deeds office and all that is contained therein.It has become commonplace for people to criticise our land law because of its complexity but such criticism is entirely justified. Land law is frequently referred to as being draconian and that criticism is easily justified. The law that governs property rights dates back centuries, as the Minister stated. We did not need the Law Reform Commission to inform us that such law is archaic, outdated and needs to be changed. We have had Law Reform Commission reports but little has changed to date. I welcome this Bill as a first step in the process of change.The complexity of property law is made even worse by the rituals that have grown up over the same period in any land transaction. Anyone who is fortunate enough to own his or her own home will know that, at the very best, it takes up to six weeks to go through the rituals and rigmarole of buying one's own home. In the modern age of technology where past transactions, old deeds and contracts can be available electronically, I cannot understand why people should be dragged through this process any longer. The Minister explained that in other jurisdictions the process involved takes only 14 or 15 days compared to six or seven weeks in this jurisdiction. We should aim for the process to be completed in that shorter timeframe. The Bill will help in that respect to some extent but we have a long way to go.In the interests of the consumer we need to examine more closely the processes and checks that are said to be involved in conveyancing. Are all these checks and validations necessary? Are they being carried out? When an 80-year old house is changing hands, why does the chain of title need to be validated again and again? Do repetitive processes such as this in the conveyancing process serve any purpose? These are some of the issues I want to raise.In this context, I am pleased the Minister has taken steps to simplify matters in this area. However, as he would agree, this Bill is only one small step. There is a large element of repeal and re-enactment in the Bill. It is not all new material. As the Minister has informed us, the Bill will pave the way for the storage of deeds and maps on a computer. That is welcome but why was the Bill not introduced some years ago? For example, when the e-commerce Bill was presented to us five years ago, why were these provisions not included as part of that Bill?When it comes to moving forward with technological advances, why is the Government always so far behind? We made our Statute Book available electronically a few years after most countries had done so. While other countries have been using electronic tagging, the Minister is still wondering about whether the technology is right. As part of this Legislature, we need to stop being content with playing catch-up. We need to look ahead and bring forward legislation that will facilitate the greatest possible use of technology.I would much prefer if today we were in a situation where e-conveyancing was the norm and that buying and selling a house was a far more simple and straightforward process. Even after the enactment of this Bill, we will still have two distinct and different systems of land registration — the Registry of Deeds on the one hand and the Land Registry on the other. If we are serious about simplifying conveyancing, we should have one uniform system. I am glad the Minister announced here this morning that one such uniform system, which is essential, will be included in this Bill.However, it must be asked why has the Bill been introduced if it is proposed to make such a major change to it on Committee Stage? It is a major development to put in place a uniform system to bring these bodies together, which I welcome, but the Minister could have delayed the introduction of the Bill for a few weeks until all these amendments are ready. Alternatively, if they are ready, why were they not included? I agree with what the Minister and the Government are trying to do in this area but I do not agree with their ham-fisted approach to introduce another part to the Bill at a later Stage. I do not agree with legislation being introduced in that manner.I listened with interest to Professor John Wylie — to whom the Minister referred — one of the foremost authorities on this subject at a recent meeting of an Oireachtas joint committee. He stated:It is really absurd, when the State has been independent for ... 80 years, that we still have a ... land conveyancing which is based ... [on] old English feudal law. It is ridiculous in this day and age, when our lives are ruled more and more by computers that our conveyancing system is still based on the age of the quill pen and ink.That is the manner in which the Minister described the office of the Registry of Deeds. I agree that those in the registry have done and continue to do excellent work but we must move forward with the times, as Professor Wylie recently explained to that committee.If we are to make substantial progress in this area, there must be a strategy for getting all titles into the Land Registry. This has been done in England where a strategy was devised and now approximately 99% of the land-bank of England and Wales is on the register in the Land Registry. We should aim to do likewise here.I take this opportunity to compliment the Law Reform Commission and the officials in the Minister's Department, to whom the Minister referred, who work on the area of land reform. It is of paramount importance that they are given whatever resources are necessary to speed up and modernise land law and conveyancing law.The Bill provides for the replacement of all old legislation dealing with the Registry of Deeds dating back to 1707, or Queen Anne's time. It will put the Registry of Deeds on a sound footing. It also makes sense to make certain changes to the Registration of Title Act 1964 with a view to making e-conveyancing a reality.I commend the Bill to the House and I look forward to the implementation of the changes envisaged in it. I hope we will receive at the earliest possible opportunity the other part to which the Minister referred so that we will have an opportunity to examine it, make a contribution and amend it, if possible.
#DrMartinMansergh	unknown-#DrMartinMansergh-party	unknown-#DrMartinMansergh-dob	unknown-#DrMartinMansergh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-05 00:00:00	Prelude	94	I welcome the Minister and his officials to the House. I also welcome this important reforming and probably long overdue legislation. As the Minister outlined in his speech, much of the legislation dealing with deeds and land transfers is exceptionally arcane, if not archaic.I wish to address the legislation, first, from the point of view of modern needs and, second, as someone with an interest in history, from the point of view of some of the more archaic aspects. It is obvious that we need an efficient and much less cumbersome form of registration. I recall taking this view when I first became an adviser in 1981. We were in Opposition at the time and I was taken to lunch with a couple of solicitors by my then party leader. I was perhaps foolish, green and naive enough to make this suggestion, which was not welcomed by the solicitor friends. My leader, in his inimitable fashion, shut me up promptly. The need for these nice little earners, so to speak, for the legal profession no longer exists — I notice Senator Tuffy giving me a slightly icy look.Whatever about the situation in 1981, in light of the amount of business currently being transacted, one does not need archaic props to support the earnings of solicitors. Of course, if we want to be competitive in the modern world we must find far more efficient ways of dealing with issues. I look forward to the other pieces of the jigsaw such as the e-conveyancing which is promised. One of the drawbacks of the use of electronic means is that one must be able to draw down a permanent record at any time.The Bill involves the consolidation of an authority that goes back to the reign of Queen Anne. This has a certain family interest for me in that during her reign, in 1704, an ancestor of mine bought out a lease from the Duke of Ormond. I am sure the deed exists somewhere. This history is fairly complicated in that one is talking about Acts of Settlement, penal laws, restrictions on transfer of land, church disestablishment, the Land Acts, the burning of the Custom House, ground rents and so on. These are complicated issues, some of which many of us will have brushed up against either in a suburban context dealing with ground rents or dealing with the transfer of land from one generation to another.I will visit the King's Inns this evening for the launch of a book in connection with that infamous Chancellor Fitzgibbon. Whether he would have approved of what the Minister is doing is an open question. The Minister referred to galloping Smith and clearly we fell behind the posse in that regard. It is clear that in the Registry of Deeds there is a historical treasure trove in terms of social history. It is a bit like the present day Land Commission records which are not yet generally accessible.As a result of the opening of the Bureau of Military History, I have just finished reading a marvellous book in which the Minister's grandfather is mentioned. It is entitled Witnesses: Inside the Easter Rising by Annie Ryan. These documents can be used to illuminate political and social history. As we move into the electronic age, it is important that these ancient deeds are properly preserved and made accessible. I accept it would be a long-term project to have these documents recorded in electronic form so that they can be more easily consulted. Social history prior to the French revolution is heavily based on the study of deeds. We are far from having fully explored all aspects of local land and regional history. Future generations of historians can do an immense amount of work in this regard.Naturally the Minister and his officials are focused on the needs of a modern economy, and rightly so. However, I urge him to ensure that the heritage aspects are also properly looked after.
#FergalQuinn	unknown-#FergalQuinn-party	unknown-#FergalQuinn-dob	unknown-#FergalQuinn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-05 00:00:00	Prelude	95	I wish to share my time with Senator Norris. I am pleased to see the Minister in the House. I welcome the Bill because it is a decisive step to take us into the 21st century. I received a telephone call this morning from an Irish friend who happens to be in Australia. He wanted to compliment me on the words I used in the Seanad debate last night. I was very impressed because, even though he lives inMelbourne, he had already read The Irish Times and the report of the Seanad debate. It is a reminder of how technology has changed and how we have not necessarily used it.I welcome the Bill because it will make information much more accessible to citizens, particularly in regard to Government matters. On the face of it, keeping a land registry should be as simple as it is necessary. Given the importance of property and land in this country, this is something which has been made very difficult over the years, which is understandable. It has been difficult because it is paper based. Being able to move from a paper-based system to a new system is ideal.When I was 17 or 18 years of age my parents moved house and my father decided that I should own the house because I could get a lower mortgage rate than he could. When my parents died in the 1970s — I had never lived in the house — I sold the house. However, when the house was resold a couple of years ago, the new purchasers discovered that I had not obtained my wife's permission to sell the house. It was a house in which we never lived ourselves.Senator Mansergh referred to costly lawyers. It seems to be very difficult to transfer property unless one uses technology or very expensive methods. On that basis, what the Minister has done and what he is promising to do on Committee Stage will make the conveyancing of property much less expensive, as long as we are able to negotiate with the lawyers and others who have made the process so expensive.When preparing a few words on this subject, I noted that changing or buying a house should be no more difficult than buying a packet of cornflakes in a supermarket. Then I recalled a prototype supermarket, the Metro store, which I visited in Germany last week. My trip demonstrated what modern technology can do in a new supermarket. The supermarket has radio-frequency identification, RFID, whereby one can go to the checkout with €100 worth of goods and have their barcodes read in one second by radio technology. If one has already registered oneself as a customer of the store, one does not have to pay in the store. Retina identification is used to identify registered customers and the cost is immediately charged to their bank accounts. This sort of technology excites me.

They should be part of our history but should not be used in a modern era. Thanks to computerisation, we are now freed of the costly shackles that characterised the system. We can now begin to buy and sell property in a common sense way that reflects the underlying simplicity of the transactions involved. We should all heartily welcome the computerisation of the Land Registry and wish it God speed. It will bring about a change to the manner in which we do business.I regard the computerisation of the registry not just as one step but as one more step in the simplification and democratisation of the administration of this country. A modern country such as ours runs very much on information. Information is the very lifeblood of what we must do if we are to have a sophisticated civilisation. The manner in which we deal with information not only determines the efficiency of our system but also the extent to which it genuinely belongs to the citizens. Anything we can do to make information more readily available will bring citizens closer to Government.We now have available to us the technology to ensure that people can connect instantly with information that concerns them, particularly personal information. The idea that people should have to queue for hours to obtain their birth or marriage certificates is nothing short of ludicrous in this age. When future generations look back at how we did things, they will question how we lived as we did, just as our children question how we lived in the past.The purpose of one of the projects involved in the European Union's Lisbon Agenda is to spread the practice of e-democracy or e-governance much more widely throughout Europe. This was seen as a matter of competition with the rest of the world. However, it is even more important than this because e-governance has the potential to bridge the ever-widening gap that yawns between the State and its citizens, something we all deplore. Anything we can do to remove it is good. We should welcome and encourage measures in this regard as much as we can.This Bill is just one part of a jigsaw that is enabling us to bring citizens much closer to governance, to what we do in the Houses and to the State, of which they might otherwise be fearful. One challenge presents itself, namely, that of privacy. People are concerned about "Big Brother". If information is so readily available, we must find a way to ensure we can put our minds and those of the citizens at rest.I welcome the Bill and the steps the Minister is taking. I welcome even more his attitude, as indicated by his promise to table certain amendments on Committee Stage.
#DavidNorris	unknown-#DavidNorris-party	unknown-#DavidNorris-dob	unknown-#DavidNorris-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-05 00:00:00	Prelude	102	I thank Senator Quinn for making time available to me and I welcome the Minister to the House. The Minister is a very impressive performer in the House and we all appreciate his coming in person rather than sending a Minister of State. He has dealt with this matter in a very clear, forensic, detailed way that illuminates many of the issues we are confronting.I concur with the Minister's view on the removal of so much ancient and redundant statute law and his contention that this Bill is a significant contribution to the process of regulatory reform. The Government has committed itself to this. We have considered several Bills in respect of which the Minister took exactly the same approach, one of which we dealt with in recent weeks. We had some fun looking at the out-of-date material. It is right to get rid of this dead wood and make our system more efficient. The Minister put the aforementioned process in a global economic context. Even though we have quite a high standing in terms of efficiency — I believe we are 15th on the list — we are behind many other European countries in terms of the number of procedures required and the number of days it takes to process the material in question.The Minister indicated there will be Government amendments. This suggests that the Bill is open to amendment and therefore I will suggest one to improve efficiency and reduce the duplication that is involved in the legal process when searching for or confirming titles. This was touched on by Senator Cummins and perhaps by Senator Mansergh, but not in the detailed way I would like. I and probably every Member in the House have been through this legal process and it seems mad that one must pay to engage in it. Dusty deeds are taken out and the chain of succession is traced right back to the original owner of the property in question. All the information is examined and certified, after which the sale can proceed. However, if one wants to remortgage one's property, as I did, the same firm of solicitors may be asked to go through exactly the same rigmarole for a second time. Given that they have done so already and have been paid to do so, why should one have to pay a second time for a completely redundant exercise in nonsensical duplication?As far as I am aware, this matter is not addressed in the Bill. Sections refer to what is termed the "manner of searches". I wonder if the Minister believes it appropriate to table an amendment or accept one by me to ensure that searches would be carried out only once? When the Minister has very appropriately centralised the system in a new statutory body, it should be sufficient for a search to be completed once. Thus, there would be centralised registration and the relevant file would be stamped. If one wanted to remortgage, the registry staff would be able to say the necessary work has already been done. What on earth is the point in carrying out exactly the same search twice? It is to make money easily for firms of solicitors. Paying twice is not fair and should be addressed in the Bill. I hope this will be done because it would save decent people, who make the largest investment of their lives when purchasing a house, from having to accept extra and unnecessary charges. I ask the Minister to consider this.It is always interesting to hear the history of a Bill. The Minister has a habit, which I find delightful, of introducing a little antique information that gives us a sense of period.We are getting rid of a whole series of legislation spanning the reigns of Queen Anne, King William, the Georges, Queen Victoria and so on. The Minister mentioned the statute of 1707. I once considered tabling an amendment to abolish this statute. I could not imagine anybody opposing the abolition of a statute designed to stop"papists"— note the offensive language — from using their Protestant neighbours as a shelter for keeping land, when Roman Catholic citizens were not permitted to hold land or buildings above a certain value. That was a shameful, disgraceful and disgusting statute. It is wonderful, however, to see the human context behind the legislation, from which it is evident that decent Protestant people were prepared to act as surrogates to protect the landholdings of their Catholic neighbours. While there were many instances of such neighbourliness, sadly there were also Protestants who would pose as good neighbours and then grab the land.The novels of William Carleton record such cases. His work is largely forgotten now, but Valentine McClutchy and Fardorougha the Miser are replete with this type of legal chicanery. The statute shows, on the one hand, a heartwarming neighbourliness even in 1707 that a mean-spirited government tried to counteract. On the other hand, there were awful situations in which people grabbed their neighbours’ land.A final matter which may not be capable of being addressed is the question of so-called squatter's rights whereby people acquire title by lodging themselves on land. I can cite an example of this in my own family. An elderly Hungarian connection of mine came to live in County Wicklow. Her husband, my relative, was killed in a tragic accident leaving her traumatised. She had already been traumatised when her family lost a great deal on the collapse of the dual monarchy inAustria-Hungary, an event followed by the Nazi invasion and, worst of all for her, the communist invasion. She became an eccentric recluse and was made a ward of court because she was deemed incapable of controlling her money.Some neighbours began to encroach on her property and other good neighbours told me about this. There was a hearing in the local court to determine title. Although at this stage the lady would have nothing to do with me, I wrote to the court setting out her position and asking that the court protect her rights. Instead, the court appeared to award title to an encroaching neighbour. That is wrong.People in that situation should have their rights. I tried, as a connection of some kind, to protect her rights even though I did not have her authority to do so — we subsequently became close again. It is not right that vulnerable people should be subject to this kind of squatter's right and encroachment. I hope something may be done to remedy this problem.My principal point, with which there is general agreement, is to press for a system that would eliminate the nonsense of going through searches a dozen times. Let it be done once, stamped and centrally registered so one can find it on the Internet and see the searches have been made. That would be an important element of this Bill or perhaps of other legislation — the Minister might inform the House whether that is the case. Such a system would make the registration of title more efficient.
#JohnDardis	unknown-#JohnDardis-party	unknown-#JohnDardis-dob	unknown-#JohnDardis-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-05 00:00:00	Prelude	103	I welcome the Minister to the House. Senator Norris referred to incidents in novels but if he reads the life of Edmund Burke he will see the same events happened frequently in real life at that time. The lesson of this history is that the religion of the land is superior to the denomination to which a person belongs. Maybe this trait is still evident in Irish society. In Burke's time it was convenient to change religion to keep title.I echo Senator Mansergh's points about the arcane and archaic nature of many of the procedures associated with land transfer and tenure. I share his sneaking suspicion that some of these devices have continued in perpetuity to the advantage of people in lawyers' offices rather than to the advantage of their clients.This Bill is important and welcome. Almost everybody is at some stage involved either in a land transfer or in raising a loan against land or property. Loans have often been jeopardised by the time it took to register the interests of the bank or the lender on the deed. That has, however, sometimes acted to the advantage of the person borrowing the money, when the bank subsequently sought its security and found it was defective. I know of one particular instance where that was the case.Legislation needs to reflect the technology available to us. I am glad to see that development included in this Bill. When I entered the House in 1989 there were frequent complaints about the length of time it took to produce the Official Report. Now we can log onto our computers shortly after the debate and find the record there, which is a compliment to the Editor of Debates and her staff. That is an example of the speed with which work can be done.It is important to have the latest e-conveyancing and e-government systems available and properly used. There must, however, be a paper backup. There has been much discussion about that matter in regard to electronic voting. In this case the hard copy must exist to support the information on the hard disk in the computer because we all know what can happen to computers.The delay in identifying title to property has a bearing on infrastructural development. In building any long stretch of motorway, or the Luas line, there must be several properties without proper title. For example, establishing the title of a rural cottage handed down three or four generations by verbal agreement, poses extraordinary difficulty for the descendant who wants to sell the property when it has acquired significant value. While it is proper that it should be difficult to establish title, there is a need for a more orderly system.I was somewhat surprised, given the common tradition in the two countries, to hear the Minister say it takes five procedures to establish title in Ireland whereas it takes only two in the United Kingdom. It takes 21 days to register property in the United Kingdom and 38 days here, almost twice the time. The Minister explained this anomaly by referring to legislation introduced in the United Kingdom.The Land Acts of the 19th century, including the Gladstone Act, and the progressive Acts introduced by early Irish Governments performed the extraordinary task of transferring the title of numerous properties to the lessees and giving them freehold. The Griffith Valuation was another example of effective legislation at a time when people wielded quills but evaluated the land in a short period.The Minister mentioned the lack of provision for dealing with errors in the Registry of Deeds, where that error originated in the Land Registry. I had an experience with the sale of agricultural land in the 1970s. When we received the certified copy of the Land Registry map the piece of land for sale was not that identified on the map. It was across the road. I was not aware of the import of that until my solicitor pointed out to me that it would almost require an Act to rectify the situation if an error had not been made. He did not know of an error having been made, although one had in fact been made by the Land Registry. It turned out to be all right but it was a salutary experience, particularly as the Central Bank intervened with credit guidelines on the price of the land. Between the date of the sale and the date of the closing, the price virtually halved. That concentrated the mind wonderfully on some of the issues that we are discussing.The most important thing the Minister said was at the end of his speech, when he mentioned the creation of the Property Registration Authority. It is sensible for the Registry of Deeds and the Land Registry to be made into one statutory body. I very much welcome that and I look forward to seeing more detail.I wish to read from a letter that I received from a solicitor in the south east. The issue to which it relates is more concerned with the stamp duty offices rather than the registration of deeds, but it flows from that. It states:I am writing to you about the severe penalties being imposed by the Stamps Office in connection with the ‘late' stamping of Deeds.On the 27th September we sent off a Deed dated 30th July together with a cheque for €4,950 for stamping. Technically speaking Deeds should be lodged within one month of execution. You will see that the Revenue now impose a penalty of €610, almost 12% of the total amount of Stamp Duty. Because there can be a hold up in getting signatures etc., I feel that short delays do not merit such heavy financial penalties. The State or its Agencies are not that efficient in matters themselves, and they do not incur penalties for lengthy delays, not to mention slight delays of a month or so.Is there anything that can be done about this practice, as it is manifestly unjust and all the more so, in view of the huge amounts of Stamp Duty that are being paid in transactions at the moment?The Government is continually complaining about the prevalent ‘rip off culture' but when you see Revenue imposing charges at this level it is clear that greed now contaminates the State as well.Something should be done about this and reasonable rates should be imposed.Perhaps somebody in some relevant quarter might address that issue and investigate how it might be rectified. It appears on the face of it that those penalties are extremely severe.Having said that, I very much welcome the Bill, which is long overdue. It will make a significant improvement in how property is conveyed and title is established. I hope adequate staffing and resources will be available to do all the work. That is a central issue.The only thing left to do after all this will be to regulate the auctioneers. That will be the final piece of the jigsaw. The Minister has proposals in that regard.
#JoannaTuffy	unknown-#JoannaTuffy-party	unknown-#JoannaTuffy-dob	unknown-#JoannaTuffy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-05 00:00:00	Prelude	104	On the last point raised by Senator Dardis, as a solicitor who dealt largely in conveyancing, it is one of my bugbears that while auctioneers make much more money out of conveyancing than solicitors, they do not take on the same level of responsibility, liability and so on. For example, they do not have to certify title. Many people complain about solicitors' costs, but the same people do not often complain about their auctioneers' fees, which might be triple or more than triple those of——

#JoannaTuffy	unknown-#JoannaTuffy-party	unknown-#JoannaTuffy-dob	unknown-#JoannaTuffy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-05 00:00:00	Prelude	106	I am a solicitor and I have a vested interest in this, but I do not agree with the suggestion that solicitors would like the legislation to be delayed or that the type of conveyancing practice employed in the past has been in their favour. It is only the legislators who can delay the enactment of legislation. It is up to us to put the system right, not the people who work within it.Solicitors make a considerable amount of money out of conveyancing, and they have done particularly well over the past few years because of the success of the property market, which lies in the amount of houses that have been built or changed hands and in the increases in property prices. However, for solicitors to be really successful as business people, they need to get as many conveyances and other transactions through their offices as quickly as possible. Therefore, it is more in solicitors' interests to have a streamlined system for the registration of title.I very much welcome the legislation, but it does not go far enough. I do not mean to be critical, but it needs to be built on. I will be interested to see the Government amendments. It would be more satisfactory if we knew now what they will entail, as we will not have much time to consider them before we debate them in the House. I welcome any improvement to the legislation that the Minister proposes and we will also be considering our own suggestions.When looking recently at the Land Registry website I was reminded that the registry was set up in 1892. Since then there has been many legislative measures dealing with the registration of title, but we have not got very far, particularly when it comes to the compulsory registration of title. Compulsory provision was required for three counties, and it has been in place in them for a long time. It was intended that this would be built on and extended but that has not happened. The legislation does not address that but the matter should be given priority.The Registry of Deeds system is not a satisfactory way of managing the registration of title. We know that only the document is registered. It is not confirmed that a person has the title to the property, unlike the registration of title system. It should be our ultimate aim to rectify that. The Law Reform Commission recommends the legislation and effectively welcomes the steps taken by the Minister, but it has suggested that we ultimately need to make the Registry of Deeds system redundant. We have a long way to go in that regard.I will turn to how the legislation deals with the Land Registry. The Law Reform Commission has issued a consultation paper on conveyancing. At page 28, it recommends that what is termed a"tidying-up measure" needs to be taken. In fact, a great deal needs to be done to improve the system. There are gaps, and the legislation contains less detail than it might about procedures, which are governed more by rules. Section 26 of the Bill provides that the rules "may" be published by the relevant committee, but I would have thought they would have to be published. A transitional arrangement is to be put in place, whereby the present rules apply until the new rules are drawn up. Those rules should be given priority, and I hope that they will be comprehensive in improving the conveyancing system.Like many solicitors, I find the staff who work at the Registry of Deeds very helpful, and the building is a nice place to visit, with a nice atmosphere. However, the procedure of registering deeds is still cumbersome and the building is inaccessible. People might have trouble if something has gone wrong. That makes the process even more cumbersome. As Senator Norris said, the whole procedure of conveyancing using the Registry of Deeds system, as opposed to the Land Registry system, is cumbersome and unsatisfactory. All the deeds need to be gone through for each transaction, there is much more scope for error, the process is more time consuming and searches take longer and are more costly. We need to move more towards the Land Registry and the registration of title system.We can also make improvements to the procedures for the Registry of Deeds. One of the Law Reform Commission's recommendations that should be prioritised when the rules are drawn up is set out on page 163 of the booklet to which I have referred.It suggests having a statutory form of the necessary information for registration purposes, which could comprise the first page of deeds. It further suggests that the complications over executions of memorials and witnessing should be removed so that simplifications recommended for execution of deeds should also apply to memorials. These suggestions should receive priority in any new rules.The Land Registry has come a long way in making its forms more accessible and user-friendly. Senator Quinn said that land registration had become like other transactions but I do not think that matters have progressed that far. One is limited in what one can do electronically with regard to the Land Registry. However, it has put much work into its very good website. One can fill out form 17 online and get one's dealing number to send to the registry with one's deeds. Such measures are helpful. The website recently won the best central e-government category in the Irish e-government awards, which was well-deserved.I have not been working very long as a solicitor and my work is now very limited. I am mainly winding up matters and finishing registration. However, the Land Registry offices are a much nicer place to visit than in the past in that there are fewer queues and the staff can better deal with people. The way in which form 17 is presented means that one only needs to tick the boxes and it is very difficult to make a mistake. The Land Registry's corporate image has also improved.However, there is still much to be done. One must still physically send title deeds to the Land Registry. One can do so by post although I prefer to go into the office because then I know it will arrive on the day and I can get a dealing number there and then. We must aim for the type of scenario envisaged by Senator Quinn. Ultimately one should be able to transfer property and send one's deed to the Land Registry electronically.The investment the Minister has made with regard to digital mapping is very welcome. Currently, it takes a long time to get transactions registered and there are often delays in terms of mapping. Hopefully the digital mapping initiative will improve matters. South Dublin County Council made its services available electronically although this initially seemed difficult. It put its entire planning application system on-line so that one can look up every plan, map and specification. The council achieved this within a very short period of time. It was not available when I became a councillor in 1999 but now everything is on-line. Before this, one had to go to the planning counter in South Dublin County Council in order to get maps, the office was only open during certain hours and the whole process took time. The service is now available on the Internet. This type of initiative is needed with regard to the Land Registry in that one should be able to do everything on-line. It would improve our system of conveyancing and put an end to complaints regarding delays and searches and so forth.The main gap in the legislation relates to the encouragement of first registration. As a solicitor I got the hang of doing such registrations and carried out a number of them. Whenever I receive registration of deeds and title I always look to see whether it is possible to register it with the Land Registry. I do my best because it makes it easier for the next solicitor and I get a certain satisfaction from the job. I do not necessarily gain from doing this, but the next solicitor does. I like the idea that the title is tidied up, registered with the Land Registry and is very clear and certain.Other solicitors find the system of first registration very daunting and therefore do not use it. They will go to the Registry of Deeds instead, even though first registration is cheaper. The Land Registry could take measures in this regard. Searches can be daunting and if one gets them wrong, one must start all over again. Verified searches are also required which are not required for other transactions and are costly and cumbersome. The Land Registry must examine what it requires with regard to first registration. It could intervene in terms of the required searches to make it easier for solicitors. Why does it need verified searches? Surely, the Land Registry could check them rather than requiring the solicitor to get a verified search. Staff should be designated to promote the first registration system and assist people in getting through it. This will help increase the number of titles registered.The compulsory registration system should be extended, and we will probably suggest this as an amendment. I have my doubts in that it might be too much to ask that all land in the State be compulsorily registered. Forcing the issue will make people register but will require the help of solicitors. The Registry of Deeds and the Land Registry should also consider free first registration.The Land Registry system is more expensive than the Registry of Deeds system. If they integrate, the two bodies should consider balancing their fees to make it more attractive to register with the Land Registry.I query the change with regard to church lands which allows them to be non-compliant with compulsory registration. I realise there are good reasons for this provision which was recommended by the Law Reform Commission. However, this is a move backwards and is not generally desirable.Senator Dardis spoke of time limits with regard to the stamping of deeds and the penalties incurred if the deed is not stamped within a month. Solicitors will probably not want me to agree with this. One month is probably too short a period within which to stamp a deed. However, we must look at the issue of time limits with regard to land registration. There should be a time limit, and I am as much at fault as any other solicitor in terms of delays in registering. It would be good to have a requirement to register within a certain time. The period should be a couple of years instead of a couple of months. As it stands, some titles are not registered for ten years or more. Some are not registered at all until someone discovers the fact. A time limit should be considered but it should be a reasonable one.
#JimWalsh	unknown-#JimWalsh-party	unknown-#JimWalsh-dob	unknown-#JimWalsh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-05 00:00:00	Prelude	107	Cuirim fáilte roimh an Aire go dtí an Teach inniu chun an Bille seo a phlé. This simple Bill has generated much discussion and debate in the House, which is indicative of the important role land has played in the history of our country. Listening to Senator Norris I was reminded of my younger days and my grandparents complaining about their family being dispossessed during the Famine to make way for a Protestant family. The angst was as strong 120 years after it happened.I can see how such situations can give rise to many complaints. People were very poor then and, to a great extent, land determined their social status. It is understandable that this attachment to land and property is inherent in all of us. I welcome the Bill and am aware that the Minister has introduced this legislation so that we can move away from some of the archaic provisions currently in place and move into the electronic age. As the leading exporter of software in the world, it behoves us to be at the cutting edge of the implementation of technological developments. This is certainly such an area.The registration of deeds and registration of title systems are interesting. The Land Registry is the simpler way to register land and also implies ownership whereas registration of deeds does not do so in the same fashion. The process requires simplification but in so doing — I echo Senator Mansergh's comments, endorsed by Senator Quinn — it is important to preserve the heritage information contained in these systems. I have examined deeds from time to time and the amount of local history that can be gleaned from the records of ownership, going back several hundred years, is amazing . While this is not the primary function of the thrust towards electronic mapping and conveyancing, it is a strong secondary priority that people could access, perhaps through the Internet, the historical evidence that resides in the deeds. This could usefully be examined.I am also impressed that the Minister has outlined the results of a survey carried out by the World Bank to the House, which shows Ireland to be in 15th place using its criteria. Registration takes 38 days here as against the best practice in Europe, which I believe to be in the Netherlands, where it takes five days. It is important that in all aspects of public services, we perform benchmarks against best international practice. We should aim to achieve that. Over recent days, the merits and demerits of benchmarking have been debated. Benchmarking exercises should be carried out on performance, but unfortunately, we perform benchmarks on positions and levels of responsibility. If we carried out benchmarks based on performance, it could be an appropriate method to reward people. If one reaches a certain level on a league table or some other indicator, bonuses and benefits would accrue. This is how the private sector operates. I welcome the Minister's proposal to bring forward amendments to restructure the Registry of Deeds and the Land Registry into a statutory body which will operate along the lines of the Courts Service. This is a move in the right direction.I hope the property registration authority mentioned in the Minister's speech will in fact be referred to as an t-údarás cláracháin mhaoine, the Irish version. Terms such as An Bord Pleanála and Údarás na Gaeltachta are commonly used in everyday language. This encourages a familiarity with the Irish language and hopefully encourages people to use whatever Irish they have in everyday speech. Interestingly, one of the commitments in the Good Friday Agreement is to the Irish language as well as to Ulster Scots. There is a real need to keep the Irish language alive.The Minister's speech referred to a review of the conveyancing laws, which is long overdue. The statutes that underpin them date back to approximately 1925. The existing conveyancing procedures definitely require modernisation and simplification. We have a pyramid system of ownership in operation. Senator Norris referred to personal occupation, after which one progresses to the tenant, the lessee, the owner of the leasehold and the freeholder. There are myriad forms of ownership. In New Ross and other towns, historic estates exist which go back to the 15th, 16th or 17th centuries and consequently, land registration is problematic. New Ross is a prime example where we have the Tottenham estate which, because of the different forms of ownership, is an inhibition on development. The estate itself has title and is entitled to recompense for it. However, one has situations where people who pay ground rent and sometimes leasehold rent invest enormous amounts in improving the properties. Subsequently they find that if they seek to buy the freehold, if that option is available, it is at a valuation reflecting the major investment they made in the property. This issue should be examined as it is a blight on urban renewal in many of our provincial towns because of the difficulties it imposes. It applies to both the residential and commercial sectors but in particular to the commercial sector which might have invested large amounts of money over the years.The registry of deeds does not imply ownership. Perhaps that system should be examined. I hope the new property registration authority will attempt to establish how there could be some form of title certification within that procedure. Interestingly, I understand that in counties Carlow, Laois and Meath, there has been compulsory registration since 1969, whereby one is obliged to go to the Land Registry within six months. Why does that not apply to the rest of the country? I understand that similar obligations exist for the State and local authorities. This measure would be beneficial because it would tidy up the question of titles for people dealing with properties. Once a title is tidied, the process becomes very simple thereafter.As the Minister noted, the process requires simplification for economic reasons and to improve its fairness. I welcome this Bill which is a good first step in the right direction. I look forward to the Minister introducing further legislation in the House which will deal with the more substantive issue of conveyancing reform.
#JoeOToole	unknown-#JoeOToole-party	unknown-#JoeOToole-dob	unknown-#JoeOToole-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-05 00:00:00	Prelude	108	I welcome the Minister to the House and I also welcome this important Bill. I wish to raise the question of the level of involvement of lawyers in the process. I have examined the positions which have evolved in other European countries. Under the French system, the registration or transfer or conveyancing is performed by one particular solicitor. The notaire is usually appointed by the State and is required to ensure that the vendor is the owner of the property, that the property is compliant with the appropriate planning legislation and that there are no encumbrances or title demands on it by virtue of previous relationships such as marriage, divorce or children. The notaire establishes these facts as far as the vendor is concerned. The notaire also establishes that the person buying the property, who is to become the new registered owner, is in a position to do so. If a mortgage is involved, the notaire establishes whether the person has received a mortgage or has the wherewithal to buy it. After assessing all these questions, the notaire then brings notice of the intending sale, transfer or conveyancing to the attention of the appropriate local authority. One solicitor effectively acts as an honest broker and represents the state in the sense of ensuring that the transaction is carried out appropriately; that in all situations the people involved in the transaction are the ones who are entitled to be involved in it and that the transaction complies in every way with planning laws and any other legislation. The notaire is also responsible for bringing the fact that the transaction has taken place to the attention of the appropriate taxation and other state authorities.The French system is a very appropriate way of dealing with property transactions. It does not prevent either party to the transaction from also engaging his or her own solicitor but the notaire system means that he or she is not required to engage a solicitor and the state has oversight over the transaction and ensures that it happens correctly. Introducing the same system in Ireland would dramatically reduce the inconveniences of transactions.Under the French system there are also time limits on all these matters. For example, before registration, a pre-agreement and an agreement must be reached and there is a cooling off period after the initial agreement to engage in the transaction, which I think must be confirmed 11 or 15 days later and cannot be agreed before this period. The legalities of the conveyancing must be concluded within nine weeks of the second date. That introduces an element of certainty into the process. People always worry about such matters as whether the conveyancing has taken place or whether the deeds are lying around in the solicitor's office.I do not know if it is appropriate to mention this matter with regard to this debate but some European countries have a maximum amount as regards the cost of a sale. The total cost of State tax, land tax or stamp duty plus the cost of agents and legal fees cannot exceed a certain percentage of the price. In some countries, the figure is approximately 9%. Again, this provision brings an element of certainty and security to those involved in the transaction and is a welcome element. These issues should be taken on board and perhaps spelled out in more detail.The Taoiseach made a comment in the Dáil approximately 18 months ago when the cost of houses, land and development land and the difficulty of getting access to development were being discussed. He stated that he believed that the vast bulk of potential development land around Dublin was owned by a small number of people; I think he mentioned a figure of eight or nine. I was stunned by his statement and it confirmed what many people had been saying. I met him privately later on and asked him how he came by that figure. He said that the information he had led him to that conclusion.The problem to which the Taoiseach referred is one encountered by many of us when we try to address this issue. It also emerged during the various tribunals. Whereas land registration must take place legally, the question of options over the purchase of land is not recorded or registered anywhere. I have only skimmed through the Bill but I do not think this aspect is covered. The sale of options on the purchase of land should be recorded. The lack of data on the sale of options over the purchase of land is the reason why a number of shady developers have purchased options on the purchase of land in many parts of the country. I know of people who have sold options over the purchase of their land, yet there is no record of it.Similarly, people sign legal agreements to transfer, sell or change the ownership of property registered under one person's name while that person simultaneously signs another document agreeing to transfer that land at a future time to another named person whose name does not appear on any titles anywhere. This is why tracing ownership became so difficult in some of the tribunals. The question of options and agreement on land sale should be recorded, perhaps through a solicitor or agency. We need to address this issue some time in the future.Apart from that, I welcome the Bill, which considerably loosens up things and should be welcomed by people on all sides. I ask the Minister to consider some of the points I have raised.
#TerryLeyden	unknown-#TerryLeyden-party	unknown-#TerryLeyden-dob	unknown-#TerryLeyden-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-05 00:00:00	Prelude	109	This Bill is very important legislation and is particularly important with regard to the decentralisation of the Land Registry and the relocation of 230 staff to Roscommon. The Minister should ensure that this relocation takes places as quickly as possible. The relocation of such a prestigious office and so many jobs will be a major boost to a town the size of Roscommon. The possibility of moving a semi-State body to Roscommon was mooted at one point but I understand a similar structure has been proposed for this organisation.The relocation of the Land Registry is very welcome, particularly in light of the announcement today that 50 jobs will be lost at a local factory, Hannons Poultry Exports. When a blow, such as that which hit Dungarvan, hits a small town, it has a major effect and that is why the State has an important role to play in expediting the decentralisation process which will give a boost to Roscommon. Decentralisation will also create a spin-off for the Land Registry because, as Senator Tuffy is aware, a considerable number of agents in Dublin act for rural legal firms. They use the Land Registry to search titles and provide information to local legal firms. Decentralisation will create a major spin-off for small companies in Roscommon who will work for companies in Dublin and elsewhere.The Land Registry is an extremely important part of the State. It was first established in 1707 and my experience of dealing with it since the 1970s, as both a professional and a public representative, has been very positive. It is highly efficient, effective and thorough. There is no point in speeding up a process yet overlooking the fact that someone has a legal right to a property. It is a very detailed but very important process because property is so valuable. A case I am dealing with involves a woman who bought a house from her brother-in-law who was not registered with the Land Registry. In addition, the people from whom her brother-in-law bought the property were not registered and nor were the people from whom they bought it. The whole chain of unregistered ownership went back to 1934. Now, the woman is eager to get this issue resolved. However, she must ascertain whether all the people who benefited from that land still have a claim on it. It is a very detailed process and people do not understand how important it is.In other recent cases I dealt with, I found the Registrar of Titles to be most helpful. I would get in touch with the Land Registry on behalf of constituents where land would be transferred, for example, in respect of installation grants. In this case, the farmer can take up farming and must get full ownership of the property. The Cathaoirleach will appreciate the benefit of having this done properly. I wish to put on record that, as Senator Tuffy mentioned, the office staff are helpful, co-operative and fast. If one goes into an office, one can get a map quickly and the courteous and helpful staff will assist with the identification of the property. The office is an open plan, not a box in a corner of the room, and is a client-based service. When the new facilities are provided, it will be important to have similar facilities in Roscommon.I am delighted the Minister is here as he has a good grasp of the legal needs of his Department. An issue I intended to raise previously with the Minister is that the State does not have a register of wills. This is a significant disadvantage for many people. Wills are made in a local solicitor's firm and registered with them but they are under no obligation as far as I am aware. The Minister and other solicitors would be more familiar with this than I. A person may change his or her will with another firm in Dublin, for example, and the beneficiaries of the final will may never find out their entitlements. This Bill may not be the relevant one to incorporate this and I do not wish to delay it but I suggest that the Registry of Deeds should incorporate a separate register of wills. If it were a legal requirement that every solicitor register their clients' wills in this section of the Land Registry, it would be financially beneficial. Many people have been deprived of their rightful inheritances through the possible negligence of a solicitor. Many solicitors have died and their documents are lodged in the bowels of their offices gathering dust, and no one examines them.There is no better person than the Minister to deal with this issue because it has a financial benefit for the State. People would be prepared to pay for this registration. Furthermore, as AIB has decided not to hold documents in trust any more, these can now be registered properly. In the event of a will, people would know to go to the register of wills and determine where they stand. Will the Minister consider my proposal? I did not have an opportunity to raise this matter over the years but I often thought about it upon meeting people who did or did not inherit properly or who went from one town to another searching solicitors' offices to determine where their fathers or mothers made their final wills. Another member of the family could be searching somewhere else and whoever finds the final will, if it is the final will, is the person who will benefit.On the matter of squatters' rights and titles, this is a questionable way of acquiring a title. An Irish citizen who had set up camp and was resident in a valuable property in London for 20 years recently waived these rights. Is it appropriate that rights can be acquired in this manner? People have leased or rented properties for 11 months over the years, did not pay for the 11 months and continued living in the property from year to year without anyone objecting but this is an unfair and improper way of acquiring property rights. As someone who acquired a small piece of land when he was 19 years of age, my solicitor was helpful and allowed me to sign for it despite the requirement that one be 21 at the time. I will not go into this now but I have a legitimate title to this small piece of ground.For some solicitors who cannot find someone mentioned in a will, it is easier to "bump them off". For example, if people went to America in 1945 and cannot be traced, the easiest way to deal with them is to try to produce their death certificates to ensure the title can be secured. Such events occur and I am sure the Minister has experience of all types of shenanigans from his time as a senior counsel.I thank the Minister for introducing this important legislation. Property is very valuable now. The question of church property is also important because it is no longer exempt. Many old church properties, in particular those of the Church of Ireland with their small cemeteries, have been left without real ownership. The proper registration and acquisition of titles by local authorities is important. I am anxious to have the Land Registry transferred to Roscommon town and know the Minister is using his good offices in this respect. Being a resident of County Roscommon, he would benefit from possibly having a ministerial office in Roscommon town; this would be one means of counties Roscommon and Leitrim getting a Ministry.

If I can write off my house, it would be useful. I was also taken by Senator Leyden's comments about wills. That one can effectively revoke one document with another while the whereabouts of the revoking document is a complete mystery is an extraordinary system. Wills must be registered in some countries but there are implications to registration, such as the privacy of the testator. If, during the lifetime of someone who has made a will in favour of a nephew, a new will is discovered by the nephew upon consulting a register in Dublin, all hell can break loose among the legatees under the first will.

He suggested to the elderly relative that the testator was in the habit of soliloquising, a terminology the relative did not follow. The counsel suggested the testator was in the habit of speaking to himself when no one else was present. The witness looked at him for a time and said "to be honest with you, sir, I was never there when he was alone". Such events can occur in these circumstances.I will return to two particular aspects of the Bill's text. Senator Norris rightly raised the point of multiple searches. When one sees the pile of documents that accumulates through these searches, it is clearly ridiculous that they cannot be cumulative. One must search against the person from whom one is purchasing back to the point when one assumes the last authoritative search was undertaken. Searching on a continual basis seems unnecessary. This is not the time to deal with searches, as the heads of the relevant Bill will be published in July. When a search is carried out, it should be capable of being authenticated and be the end of the matter.Senator Tuffy and others made a point that is equally true. We should be moving away from the deeds and searches regime towards a title and land certificate.However, it is one thing to say it, but another thing to do it. It is the case that most modern developments of new housing are on registered land. It is also the case that State authorities opt for registration. The new Property Registration Authority will have to address this issue. One of the roles of the authority will be to set out a strategy to implement registration of title. I have always lived in houses built on unregistered land, with the exception of my house in Roscommon, which has its own problems ——

#MichaelMcDowellPD	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-party	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-05 00:00:00	Prelude	121	As someone who has always lived on unregistered land, however, it amazes me that we have such a complex system of proving title.I agree with another point in Senator Tuffy's contribution concerning lawyers. It is not in the interest of any lawyer that the land law should be so complex. There may be a few nerds in the legal profession who like this kind of work. However, the great majority of people whose time is valuable do not like going back through deeds in an attempt to ascertain who the relevant parties were and whether there is good title shown.I have spoken to members of the legal profession in the past who were worried that personal injuries claims work would dry up. I have never seen a prosperous society with poor lawyers and I have reiterated the point that things move on and change. It is not the end of the world if a particular line of business dries up because other lines will always open up for lawyers who are inventive enough to change their practices.I take note of the point made by Senators Tuffy and Dardis regarding the penalties for late registration of stampable deeds. However, in that context the point must be made that until relatively recently it was not necessary to stamp a document unless it was proposed to produce it in evidence or it required someone else to accept it as good title. It was quite possible in the past to convey property and consign the documentation to the bottom drawer. It is only in relatively recent times that the obligation to stamp a document contemporaneously came into its own and penalties were attached to the failure to do so. It is a major source of income for the Department of Finance and the Exchequer.It might be argued that the rates and penalties are tough, but the requirement that those involved in property transactions must deal with the matter in good time has greatly improved the flow of money to the State. Previously, where cashflow was difficult in the context of a transaction, the last body to hear about it was the Exchequer. Now the opposite is the case and the clock is ticking from the moment the deed is signed. I am not sure whether one month or two months is the most appropriate period of time, but I know the new system is better than the old one.I wish to address the question of fees raised by Senator O'Toole. It is widely assumed that there is no competition between lawyers regarding conveyancing fees. There are many legal firms offering price competition in this area. Some firms were stating that they would conduct conveyances, no matter how complex, for €999. That indicates very stiff price competition and nobody should be under any illusion in this regard.The situation is similar in the car insurance market. People should shop around and have the moral courage to raise the issue of the price for the service. As a lawyer, I am aware that some clients are reluctant to raise the question of fees because they assume there is a standard price for certain services. There is no standard price for conveyancing and every fee is, and should be, negotiable.A colleague in my party said recently that it would be a strange scenario if a plumber hired to repair a burst pipe in Shrewsbury Road made a quick mental valuation of the house before deciding on the appropriate fee. There is a notion abroad that it is reasonable for work to be carried out on a percentage basis but that is not necessarily the obvious means for deciding the price for a particular transaction.The auctioneering trade must also be taken into account. In that trade price competition is available if one hunts for it. It is only the unsuspecting and the naive who pay standard fees and do not ask for keener prices. The same principle applies to many other areas.I wish to emphasise that the opportunity for substantive change in land law and conveyancing procedure will arise in the context of the publication of the proposals for a new law of property Bill. That will happen in July. This Bill is modest in its extent.Senator Cummins asked why the House has been presented with part of a Bill and the reason I am producing the Property Registration Authority provision at a later stage. The answer is quite simple. The Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform has been working the proposal for the Property Registration Authority for a long period. The work was delayed because my Department was trying to convince the Department of Finance that the pension overhang for creating a new body and transferring public servants to it would not create the need for a capital payment as part of the establishment of this body. If that were the case, it would have had unacceptable implications for the Exchequer. Therefore, this Bill is effectively a reduced form of legislation because the other proposition was put in abeyance.However, all of the difficulties with the Department of Finance and its legitimate concerns about the establishment of a Property Registration Authority have now been overcome. We are in a position to go ahead with that proposal, but rather than withdraw this Bill and start anew, we decided that it was best to proceed with it so that the decks are cleared for further reform.Senator Leyden raised the issue of the relocation of the Land Registry to County Roscommon. That is still the intention and the fact that a new body is being established does not affect that in any way. The people of County Roscommon should be aware that it is still the fixed and determined policy of the Government to move the Land Registry to that county in the manner outlined previously. It will bring valuable employment to the town of Roscommon and will afford many families the opportunity to have reasonably priced housing, schools and a different lifestyle in a county that has many amenities ——

The purpose is to protect State property vested in the North-South implementation bodies. As the House is aware, the British-Irish Agreement Act 1999 established the six North-South implementation bodies: the Foyle, Carlingford and Irish Lights Commission; InterTrade Ireland; An Foras Teanga; SafeFood; the Special European Union Programmes Body; and Waterways Ireland. Two of the bodies are under the aegis of my Department, co-sponsored with the Department of Culture, Arts and Leisure in the North. These are An Foras Teanga and Waterways Ireland.The purpose of the Bill to remedy a possible technical defect in section 53(b) of the British-Irish Agreement Act 1999, which gives the North-South implementation bodies protection as State authorities under landlord and tenant, ground rents, legislation. The effect of such protection is that a lessee does not acquire the right to buy out the fee simple of a property on State land in respect of which a ground rent is paid. However, the reference in section 53(b) is to section 70 of the Landlord and Tenant Act 1980. This is, in effect, a subsequent amending provision. The original provision which shields State authorities is section 4 of the Landlord and Tenant (Ground Rents) (No. 2) Act 1978.The issue mainly arises for Waterways Ireland in view of its extensive property portfolio, but the Bill covers the other North-South bodies also. The issue only arises in the South. There are no implications for the operations of the bodies in the North because this is Irish legislation.The overall effect of the 1978 Act is to give a lessee of certain categories of property the right to acquire the fee simple, subject to conditions and exemptions detailed in that Act. Section 4 provides that this right does not apply in the case of properties leased from a Minister of the Government, the Commissioners of Public Works or the Land Commission. Section 70 of the 1980 Act is a subsequent provision, which modifies that general exemption by creating a right to buy out the fee simple in the case of dwellinghouses erected on land owned by a State authority, subject to the right of a State authority to prevent alienation of an individual property where it considers that the public interest so requires.This Bill removes any doubt that a North-South implementation body is not bound by the Landlord and Tenant (Ground Rents) (No. 2) Act 1978 and directly incorporates the exemption in respect of that protection for dwellinghouses contained in the Landlord and Tenant Act 1980 in the same terms as set out in that Act. The legislation does not apply to any notice of intention or any application made in relation to the acquisition of the fee simple before the passing of the Bill or any arbitration or appeal to the Circuit Court in respect of such a notice or application. Any such notice or application — I am informed by Waterways Ireland that it currently has 12 cases on its hands — and any subsequent developments, whether by way of arbitration or Circuit Court hearing, will continue as if this Bill had not been enacted.I stress that this legislation seeks to deal with a potential technical defect in the British-Irish Agreement Act 1999. The intention of the Oireachtas at that time is abundantly clear from section 53 of the Act. The intention was to put Waterways Ireland and the other North-South implementation bodies in the same position  vis-à-vis ground rent legislation as are the Office of Public Works or a Minister acting as State authorities. This means that the relevant sections of the 1978 (No. 2) Act and the Landlord and Tenant Act 1980 I referred to earlier would apply. It will be a matter as appropriate for the courts to interpret the current legislation and make decisions on any cases that come before them. Nothing I say today should be construed as a comment on any case that might end up in such a position, or a statement that there is solid ground for any such notice to be served or any case that might be taken.The Bill is being introduced today with a view to its passage through both Houses in one day and signature by the President later today. It has already been passed by Dáil Éireann. This is considered advisable in the interests of clarity with regard to this area of the law.The Bill is a short one and contains four sections. Sections 1 and 4 are technical. Section 2 refers to section 53(a) of the British-Irish Agreement Act 1999, which provides that a body is a State authority for the purposes of the Statue of Limitations 1957, and creates a new section 53(A) in the 1999 Act to expand and clarify the existing provision in section 53(b) of that Act. The new section clarifies that a North-South implementation body is not bound by the Landlord and Tenant (Ground Rents) (No. 2) Act 1978 and repeats the exemption in respect of dwelling houses contained in the Landlord and Tenant Act 1980 in the same terms as set out in that Act. Section 3 provides the appropriate savers in respect of any application made prior to the enactment of the Bill under the ground rents legislation or any appeal before the courts.Senators will have appreciated by now that the Bill is designed to put into legislative form the clear, unequivocal original intention of the Oireachtas to provide the North-South implementation bodies with the necessary legislative protection for the State property vested in them for the benefit of all. This is the kernel of the matter. Sometimes people deal with State assets as belonging to some distant body rather than as the property of the people. Assets vested in the State are held in trust by the State for the people. The Oireachtas is a trustee and it must ensure that it protects the people's assets from any possible unintended defect or loophole in the law. Tá súil agam anois go dtuigfear gur rud beag teicniúil atá i gceist anseo. Tá sé ciallmhar an leasú seo a thabhairt isteach gan fanacht go dtí go mbeidh fadhb ann. I gcomhthéacs eile le gairid bhí muid ag plé le tábhacht má tá dlíthiúil ar bith ann, ba cheart an t-amhras sin a leigheas trí reachtaíocht. Tá súil agam go nglacfadh an Teach seo leis an reachtaíocht.

Fine Gael will support this Bill because it is technical in nature. I thank civil servants for bringing it to our attention yesterday and briefing us in anticipation of today's debate. The real issue here is rushed legislation. I do not have the experience to decide whether rushed or unrushed legislation is better but history shows that rushed legislation is bad. Due to the Minister's back being against the wall and the possibility of court cases there was a need to rush this matter. However, it is important that this House does not set a precedent for rushed legislation. We have learned a hard lesson from the Health (Amendment)(No. 2) Bill 2004, which will cost the State €2 billion. It is obvious that rushing that piece of legislation was not in the best interest of the State.The public, upon being asked, does not know what Senators do or that the Seanad exists. The public perception of our role is not positive. It might be time that the Seanad, as a reflective Chamber, began to sell its wares. I was involved with the Minister on the recent Irish language Bill, on which we deliberated for a long time. The time spent by the Minister on that Bill was appreciated. He accepted some amendments and rejected others and we at least had an opportunity to debate. It is important that this House is used as a reflective forum for discussion.A precedent should not be set for rushed legislation. Passing legislation overnight is not fair to our electorate, the Civil Service and others who want to have an input. It undermines the entire democratic process. The Seanad should not be a rubber stamping facility. Many people have opinions which carry weight.

I compliment him and his officials on bringing it to our attention promptly and, as Senator McHugh remarked, for giving us a briefing which prepared us for today's debate. Nobody would disagree with the sentiments expressed by Senator McHugh. Members of the Oireachtas generally do not like rushed legislation. The Senator accepts that we are dealing with a technicality. I thank him for setting the tone of the debate.The Minister made the important point that when we talk about State property, we refer to the property of the people. This legislation reflects that the rights of the people are in question. It is important that no time is wasted. While it is possible that there will be no difficulties in the future, the Minister is right to be prudent. Sometimes legislative difficulties were not resolved promptly. There was a tendency to wait until the event happened. It is being demonstrated in this case that, once attention is drawn to matters, it is better to respond quickly. There seems to be unanimity on this matter and hopefully the earlier signature motion will also come before the House today.

I also welcome this Bill. In some ways it is reasonably remarkable that a Bill of this type has being brought forward in the current political circumstances. Despite all the difficulties it is a source of satisfaction that the North-South implementation bodies continue to operate, albeit on a care and maintenance basis. That is not entirely satisfactory in that it limits new initiatives. The most obvious one being the case of Waterways Ireland undertaking any serious work on the restoration of the Ulster Canal.There was great fear of institutionalised North-South co-operation right up to the conclusion of the Good Friday Agreement but, apart from the question of ministerial attendance in the North, that has been the least of the problems since the signing of the Agreement. Despite the interdependence of the institutions there is general consent on all sides for the implementation bodies to continue their work. Obviously, a stop-start situation would be totally unsatisfactory and it would be very difficult to get people to work for them on that basis. Given the work they are doing and perhaps the more valuable work they could do in the future, it is important to get the Good Friday Agreement working again. I am glad to say that both Governments are committed to doing that. I accept there is a slight question mark over one of those Governments today given that voting is taking place but the opposition in Britain is also committed to the Good Friday Agreement.The Minister did not make it clear in introducing the Bill whether there was any particular circumstance or specific concern that prompted the swift passage of this legislation or whether a flaw in legislation was identified. Under the precautionary principle, once a flaw has been identified it must be corrected as quickly as possible.I do not share the concern of Senator McHugh about the so-called rushing through of this legislation. This Bill deals with one specific technical point. It is not complex legislation being rammed through in a couple of hours. It is not comparable to that type of situation. It is correct that State property should not be alienated except where the State consciously and specifically decides it should do so.In the wider context of the stability of and the prospects for restoring the Agreement, I would like to make two brief points. I hope that when people analyse the results in Northern Ireland, whatever they may be, in the next few days and when people moan and perhaps wring their hands about polarisation, etc., we should be absolutely clear that one of the main contributory causes is the first past the post system. Bipolarity is built into that system, which The Economist last week described as brutal. There is no doubt about it. John Hume has argued this for a long time. That voting system is totally unsuited to a divided community in Northern Ireland. Whatever the outcome of the prospects of, say, the Ulster Unionist Party and the SDLP, it is highly unlikely that either party will fall below, or even necessarily anywhere near, 10% of the vote. However, the effects of the first past the post system may be to leave such parties with little or no representation at Westminster.I have spoken about this to the Secretary of State, Paul Murphy, in the context of the British-Irish Interparliamentary Body and I would like to think the British would do something about this system. It almost totally discourages cross-community voting which one would have thought one would wish to encourage in Northern Ireland on the basis that people would not harm their own community by expressing a lower preference on the other side. I have no illusions that this will happen because the interests of the two big parties in Britain is a bipolarity that squeezes all middle parties. People should not blame the Agreement, the Governments, various parties or the leaderships concerned, rather it is the system that contributes to the polarisation in Westminster elections.In the context of the stability of the Agreement, restoring it and so on, I wish some of our commentators would be a little more careful sometimes in the way they use language. I noticed yesterday in the context of coverage of those unhappy events in Cork where a couple was kidnapped, one of the people taken in for questioning was described as a "die hard republican". Without prejudice to the question of whether the person was involved and whatever about the word "die hard", I do not recognise that there was any republicanism involved in that type of kidnapping which was done presumably for money-raising purposes. It was suggested that the individual concerned had been expelled from a main paramilitary organisation a number of years ago. There were no principles of republicanism involved. It would be hard to believe that anyone involved in such actions had any understanding or conception of the needs of republicanism. I will finish on that point. I support the Bill.

There is an issue in that respect to be dealt with in the broader scope of how we organise the affairs of the two Houses. The most important Stage of a Bill is Committee Stage, which I am sure the Senator appreciates. The languages Bill was debated in this House in a timely fashion. The Senator may recall that I agreed to recommit the Dormant Accounts (Amendment) Bill to facilitate a full debate on it and no time limit was applied to that debate. That was appropriate as this is the House where issues can be teased out.Senator McHugh also mentioned the Health (Amendment) Bill. The difficulty in that instance was not with the Bill. The Supreme Court struck down that Bill but if we had been debating it for a year and a day, it would have been on more or less the same principle and it would have been struck down on the same principle. The problem with that Bill was that nobody rushed legislation through these Houses 20 years earlier to close a possible loophole. That is the reason we have been caught with the issue of the back payment.We are acting on the principle of prudence in regard to this Bill by saying that we do not know if there is a problem but there might be. Where there is doubt, it should be addressed and the possible loophole closed. This Bill deals with a minor technical point in regard to landlords, tenants and builders. That area is complex. I am not a lawyer and, therefore, I have to believe the experts when they advise me there is doubt in regard to an issue such as this one. When it comes to an experts' issue, my view is to take expert advice, but when it comes to a political issue, one should follow one's star and listen to the ordinary people. This is very much an experts' issue and that is why we have brought forward this legislation. The idea behind it is to ensure a problem does not arise in this area in the future and to ensure that State assets are not alienated.Luaigh an Seanadóir O'Toole teangacha. Aontaím gur cheart dúinn gaol níos láidir a chothú eadrainn féin agus muintir na Breataine Bige agus na hAlban faoi chúrsaí teanga. Tá cuid den obair sin déanta. Bhí mé féin agus an tAireWilson an-ghníomhach i mbunú Iomairt Cholm Cille. Tá obair mhaith déanta ach ó d'éirigh Brian Wilson as an aireacht níl an teagmháil céanna agus tá mé ag breathnú ar Iomairt Cholm Cille le feiceáil cén chaoi is féidir dlús a chur le leibhéal na polaitíochta. Tá sé ag obair ar an talamh ach bhí pointe ann nuair a bhí Brian Wilson anonn agus anall chugainn an t-am ar fad, rud an-dearfach.Bhí cruinniú anuraidh freisin den British Irish Council sa Bhreatain Bheag agus tá an spéis ag muintir na Breataine Bige i gcúrsaí teanga agus bhí cúrsaí teanga lárnach don chruinniú sin. Chuir mise roinnt tuairimí i láthair faoi cén chaoi a bhféadfadh ollscolaíocht i múineadh na dteangacha Ceilteacha a chur ar aghaidh taobh amuigh de na hoileáin seo ar fud an domhain. De bharr na cúinsí polaitíochta, níor éirigh linn an oiread dul chun cinn a dhéanamh agus ar mhaith liom.Ba mhaith liom tuilleadh oibre a dhéanamh faoi sin ar bhonn Éireannach agus fágfaidh mé an doras oscailte go dtiocfaidh daoine eile chugainn agus go ndéanfaimid chomh-mhaoiniú. Is mó saoirse maoinithe atá againn anois nó mar atá ag daoine eile.Co-operation at all levels between Ireland and Britain and between Ireland and the devolved legislative assemblies in Britain should be encouraged. I am always interested in working to find common ground. It is interesting that we recently had experts from Scotland who gave us positive advice on our island experience. However, they also examined what we are doing for the islands. They were interested in how we tackle problems. We had much to learn from them, but they also felt they could learn something from our approach. Sharing knowledge and co-operating costs no one anything.In regard to the Ulster Canal, what is happening is frustrating. We are sitting on a jewel in terms of Waterways Ireland.

The two jurisdictions have pooled a fantastic physical resource in a common interest. The Erne-Shannon Waterway has revitalised a whole region. The lift this has given the Leitrim and Enniskillen region is incredible. I would like to be the Minister who would initiate the process of restoring the Ulster Canal. However, that will not be possible until there is devolution in Northern Ireland.We are 11 years on from the ceasefire, and for the first time in our history Britain has made it absolutely clear that as long as we sort out our problems among ourselves, it will be happy. This is a unique situation but for some historic reason, which in my view is not compatible with true republicanism or the whole theory of Wolfe Tone, equality and sharing, people cannot reach out and make the final gesture that would set the process in motion. This breaks my heart. Whatever problems the Unionist community has in co-operating with the rest of the island, I agree with Senator Mansergh that this has reduced dramatically in recent years. We saw some evidence of this in the recent election debate in Northern Ireland.Utilising our waterways is one issue on which the communities in Northern Ireland and in the South agree. It would be marvellous to get into a boat either in Dublin or Limerick, travel through the canals, into the Shannon, up to Lough Neagh and out to the sea. It would be a real sign of North-South co-operation. We should examine the rejuvenation of the Ballyconnell Canal, which is now the Shannon-Erne Waterway. We are always talking about the damage the Border did to the Border counties, but this is one project that would totally rejuvenate these areas. Please God, following today's election, whatever the results, we can get back to the serious business of politics, which is about bringing together the people of the two parts of Ireland and exploiting the huge potential in the Good Friday Agreement for the benefit of all the people of Ireland, particularly those who live around the Border counties, North and South. Democracy is about the people speaking and then accepting and working with the result. None of us has a right to say that the people were wrong. Democracy is about accepting the result of any election.I commend the Bill to the House. I am pleased there appears to be agreement on the taking of Second Stage.

Recently the principal of St. Brigid's national school in Castleknock invited all the public representatives to meet with him and do a tour of the school. This school, which was built in 1971 as an eight teacher school, has now grown to a 35 teacher school. While it received summer work grants for 2004 and 2005, this represents a mere attempt to address some refurbishment. The school is in need of much more work.The school architect, Mr. Roger Hofler, expressed his concerns about some issues. These concerns are shared by the health and safety officer and the school insurers, Alliance. The general purpose room, which was built many years ago, is now totally unsuitable for the number of children in the school. Furthermore, in terms of today's standards, it is not suited to the types of PE activities in which children participate. It is in a very bad state. Teachers in the school are most unhappy and concerned about allowing children to use it with the result that PE is not undertaken there.Four teachers have no classroom facilities. A teacher of international pupils currently teaches three or four children in what was originally a broom cupboard. I saw this room while accompanied by the Minister of State at the Department, Deputy Brian Lenihan. The school has a large number of international children who need special attention. One resource teacher teaches in a converted toilet. Four resource or learning support teachers share two remedial rooms. We saw these rooms and noted they are separated by a partition. The teachers are trying to teach children who need special attention but the set-up in which they are being taught is not conducive to learning.The school needs and hopes to acquire two further resource teachers but it has no accommodation to offer them. The school also needs special security, which is difficult to provide in the present circumstances. The school has no storage facilities because the storage rooms are now being used for teaching. It has no storage facilities for PE equipment, video and audio equipment or classroom resources. All equipment of this kind is now being stored in corridors. The health and safety officer stated this is unacceptable.The school staffroom was built for eight teachers but must now cater for 35. The school's accommodation is no more suitable for teachers than it is for children. There is no multipurpose room or place to facilitate parent-teacher meetings, visiting dentists, doctors or psychologists.The school is located in a developing area. Approximately 3,500 thousand houses are to be built in the area, some of which are under construction. The school has received 172 applications for enrolment for September 2005 but there are only 90 places on offer.The number of pupils in the classrooms is far too high. This is a serious issue in all schools throughout the country. Teachers at the school in question are up in arms about class sizes, and this can be said for all other primary schools in the area. All the principals attended a meeting in this regard and all had the same difficulty. The problem needs to be addressed.A more urgent problem arose in recent weeks regarding health and safety in the school. Mortar is falling off the walls and this is a danger to children playing nearby and to passers by. The school is in need of major refurbishment. Senator Morrissey raised this issue on behalf of the school last week and the Department responded as follows:Last year, the Department of Education and Science received an application from the school authorities of St. Brigid's for the provision of a general purpose room, resource rooms, a multipurpose room and storage space. This application was assessed in accordance with the published prioritisation criteria for large scale building projects, which were revised following consultation with the education partners. The project will be considered in the context of the school building and modernisation programme 2005-09.This reply is incorrect because the school submitted an application initially in 2001. It is now 2005 and no significant moneys have been forthcoming to address the health and safety issues at the school. I hope the Minister will be able to give a more positive response today to address these issues. They need to be addressed quickly before an accident happens. We need to take seriously the accommodation needs of both teachers and pupils in 2005. It is unacceptable that they should have to teach and be taught in such conditions. I look forward to the Minister's response.

I thank the Senator for raising this matter as it provides me with an opportunity to outline to the House both the extensive action already taken by the Department of Education and Science and those planned to tackle the accommodation needs of St. Brigid's national school, Castleknock, Dublin 15.Modernising facilities in our 3,200 primary and 750 post-primary schools is not an easy task given the legacy of decades of under-investment in this area, as well as the need to respond to emerging needs in areas of rapid population growth. Nonetheless, since taking office, the Government has shown a sincere determination to improve the condition of our school buildings and to ensure that the appropriate facilities are in place to enable the implementation of a broad and balanced curriculum.The Department has progressively increased funding for the school modernisation programme in recent years to achieve our goal, with an aggregate total of almost €2 billion allocated for this purpose since 1998, the largest investment programme in the history of the State. Since the beginning of the year, the Minister for Education and Science has made a number of announcements relating to the schools building and modernisation programme. This year alone, €270 million will be allocated to primary schools and €223 million to post-primary schools for building works. This represent an increase of 14% on the 2004 allocation.The programmes supported will include the following: some 141 major building projects already on site and a further 28 due to commence in the coming weeks; 122 major schools building projects countrywide, for which tenders will be prepared and which will move to construction during 2005; 192 primary schools which have been invited to take part in the small and rural schools initiative and the devolved scheme for providing additional accommodation; up to 120 schools which have been given approval to rent temporary premises, pending delivery of a permanent solution to their long-term accommodation needs; 43 schools which have been authorised to start architectural planning of their major projects and 124 which have been approved to progress through the architectural planning process; and 590 schools which were given approval to complete essential small-scale projects under the summer works scheme.I am pleased to confirm that St. Brigid's national school, Castleknock, was successful in securing funding of over €90,000 towards the partial replacement of windows under the summer works scheme 2005. The school also received a grant of €225,000 in 2004 towards the replacement of windows. Senator Terry has her script and I have my script——

In the knowledge that Departments are accurate about these matters, I am sure the Department of Education and Science is correct in stating it received last year an application from the authorities of St. Brigid's for the provision of a general purpose room, resource rooms, a multipurpose room and storage space. If the Senator checks this, she will find it did happen.

The project will be considered in the context of the school building and modernisation programme 2005-09.As the Senator will no doubt recognise, one reason there is such pressure in schools at present is because there are so many extra teachers, remedial teachers and resource teachers, all of whom need space. An average rural two-teacher school now needs a third classroom because there are so many extra services being provided. This is great but, as the Senator knows, if extra people are employed, extra space is required. When people complain about the problems associated with the schools building programme, they often ignore the two main causes. The first is the population shift. When those of us who fight against urbanisation say we are pushing too many people too fast and that we have half-empty schools in one half of the country and schools that are too full in the other half, we are often berated.The second problem is that we have provided many extra services to schools. The third issue is the unprecedented growth in our population, for which nobody had planned. Had we planned for it we would have been dismissed as mad. We are dealing with these issues.The position with regard to class sizes is that the mainstream staffing of a primary school is determined by applying the enrolment of the school on 30 September of the previous school year to a staffing schedule agreed between the Department and the education partners. The system for allocating teachers to primary schools is based on ensuring an overall maximum class of 29 in each school. Where some classes in a school have more than 29 pupils that is generally because a decision has been taken at local level to use the teaching resources to reduce the numbers in other classes.In the 2003-04 school year, the last year for which details are available, there were 11 classes of over 30 pupils in the school to which the Senator referred. The average class size, however, in the school is 28. In accordance with the staffing schedule, the staffing of the school for this school year is a principal and 27 mainstream class teachers based on an enrolment of 761 pupils at 30 September 2003. In addition, the school has three resource posts, two learning support posts and two temporary language support posts.The Department will finalise the staffing schedule for the 2005-06 school year shortly and thereafter notify school boards of management. According to data submitted to the Department by the board of management, the enrolment in the school on 30 September 2004 was 766 pupils. The staffing for the 2005-06 school year will be determined on the basis of this figure and in accordance with the relevant staffing schedule.Once again I thank the Senator for giving me the opportunity to outline to the House the method used by the Department of Education and Science in determining in an open and transparent way how projects are included for funding in the schools building programme and to assure the House that this school and all others will be treated in a fair and equitable manner.

Many of these mothers are vulnerable and I ask that consideration be given to extending the programme to the greater Blanchardstown area where a similar scheme is needed.

The Health Act 2004 provided for the Health Service Executive, which was established on I January 2005. Under the Act, the executive has the responsibility to manage and deliver, or arrange to be delivered on its behalf, health and personal social services.The HSE has advised me that the community mothers' programme was established by the former Eastern Health Board and operated as a standalone centralised service. Following the establishment of the Eastern Regional Health Authority and the three area health boards, the community mothers' programme continued to be managed by the Northern Area Health Board on behalf of the three area boards.The HSE has further informed me that in 2003 the Northern Area Health Board had the programme independently evaluated. The main recommendations were that the service should be mainstreamed and that it required further development. The service is not uniformly accessible throughout the former Eastern Health Board area, namely, Dublin, Kildare and Wicklow, mainly owing to the major increase in population in recent years. To meet the immediate service needs, including the extension of the service to the greater Blanchardstown area, further investment may be required and the HSE is considering this issue.
#JimWalsh	unknown-#JimWalsh-party	unknown-#JimWalsh-dob	unknown-#JimWalsh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-05 00:00:00	Prelude	153	Cuirim fáilte roimh an Aire seo inniu.Before putting forward the case for Wexford General Hospital with which the Minister and the Tánaiste are familiar, it is appropriate to note recent investment in the hospital. This has included some innovations which are a credit to the former health board and to the staff, management and consultants in the hospital.A day care centre for elderly people was recently opened, making a significant addition to the facilities. A CAT scan was provided recently for which 50% of the funding was collected locally. The remaining 50% came from the Department of Health and Children. There is a cardiac diagnostic unit and a medical assessment centre which deals with pre-admissions to the hospital.While the hospital welcomes the increased population in the area, which has risen to 120,000, this increase entails infrastructural challenges. Over the past seven years since Fianna Fáil came into Government, the number of people treated in the hospital has increased by 25% or 26%. That has put a strain on the hospital as a consequence of which it is not unusual for the staff to resort to using trolleys and various locations, including the medical admissions centre forinpatient care.This poses a problem for those seeking admission and for outpatients visiting for diagnostic surgery or investigations. It is disruptive and should not be allowed to continue in the medium to long term.I am aware of the Government's commitment to the hospital and hope there will be an early announcement of an increase in bed capacity through the 19-bed unit under consideration. The outpatients department which accommodates five or six beds is adjacent to the accident and emergency department of the hospital which has seen an increase of over 50% in patient numbers in the past seven or eight years, imposing an inordinate strain on that section.To improve the accident and emergency area involves vacating the outpatients department and installing new units. There are tenders for that to the tune of €2.6 million. I urge that be done as soon as possible, preferably within the 2005 capital programme. If it is not to be included in that programme I urge the Minister and the Tánaiste to use their good offices to try to put that on the agenda as quickly as possible. Only by doing so can they address the over-crowding in the accident and emergency unit.Regrettably this issue has become highly politicised which detracts from many of the good news stories involving the hospital which is such a fine health facility for the area. This may also encourage people on the periphery of the county to use the regional hospital rather than Wexford General Hospital. The sooner these matters are addressed, the better.
#EamonOCuiv	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-party	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-dob	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-05-05 00:00:00	Prelude	154	The Health Act 2004 provided for the Health Service Executive, which was established on 1 January 2005. Under the Act, the executive has the responsibility to manage and deliver, or arrange to be delivered on its behalf, health and personal social services. This includes responsibility for the provision of services at Wexford General Hospital.There has been an increase of approximately 9% in attendances at the accident and emergency department of Wexford General Hospital between 2001 and 2002, a further increase of 9% between 2002 and 2003, and a 6% increase between 2003 and 2004. Overall admissions to the hospital have also increased by about 10% in the past two years, 15% in the past five years and 26% in the past ten years. Based on these pressures the former South Eastern Health Board identified the need to provide an additional 19 acute hospital beds.The detailed capital funding programme for hospitals for 2005 is currently being finalised in the context of the capital investment framework 2005-09. The process will be concluded in the near future. The Health Service Executive will then be in a position to progress its capital programme in line with the overall funding resources available for 2005 and beyond. A decision on the additional 19 beds will be made in the context of the agreed capital framework for the executive.As Senator Jim Walsh may be aware, it is the Tánaiste's intention to meet Members of the Oireachtas from the Wexford area once the capital investment framework has been approved. I am confident that the HSE will be able to address the need for additional acute beds at Wexford General Hospital. Gabhaim buíochas leis an Seanadóir as ucht na ceiste a chur agus tá súil agam go mbainfidh sé tairbhe as an bhfreagra.
