I appreciate him turning up to take this matter. A week ago, the people of Blarney and the surrounding area woke up to the news that their local GP is to resign at the end of this year. At a time when we know how difficult it is to get access to a GP, this has sent a shock through the community. This decision affects 1,600 patients, 600 of whom are public and 1,000 private, between medical cardholders and private patients. On hearing the news, I wrote to and contacted the HSE, as did a number of my constituency colleagues. We were assured by the HSE that the public patients will be looked after by an interim service within 8 km of Blarney for the foreseeable future, until such time as a new doctor is recruited. This is welcome and very much appreciated. I understand that one GP has already indicated interest in taking up the service and a number of other parties are also keen to express interest. I have taken the opportunity to write to all GPs within a 10 km radius of Blarney encouraging them to do all they can in helping in the interim and, in particular, to look after those 1,000 patients who do not have a service in the meantime. Despite all the usual scaremongering and politicisation of the issue locally, I seek some reassurance from the Minister of State that what the HSE tells me is true, that an interim arrangement has been made, and that the process of the advertisement of the post is being readied. If he could give any other pertinent details, it would be very much appreciated.
#FrankFeighan	unknown-#FrankFeighan-party	unknown-#FrankFeighan-dob	unknown-#FrankFeighan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-11-30 00:00:00	Ábhair Shaincheisteanna Tráthúla - Topical Issue Matters	2	I thank the Deputy for raising this important issue. As he is aware, GPs are private practitioners, although most hold contracts with the HSE to provide services under various health schemes. There are currently more than 2,500 GPs with General Medical Services, GMS, contracts for the provision of GP services without charge to medical card and GP visit cardholders. As they are private practitioners, GPs are free to establish their practices and work at a location of their own choosing. However, where a GP vacancy arises in a practice with a GMS contract, the HSE becomes involved in the recruitment of a replacement GP. At the start of November, there were 27 GP GMS vacancies, approximately 1% of the GMS GP panels. Some 13 of the 27 vacancies were in rural areas and 14 were in urban areas. On the expected GMS vacancy concerned, Cork Kerry Community Healthcare has advised that it is aware of the upcoming vacancy and is taking appropriate steps. Engagement is ongoing with local providers and an interim service is being planned to ensure continuity of services for the cardholders concerned from 1 January, while the campaign to recruit a replacement GP is ongoing. Once interim arrangements are finalised, the HSE will contact cardholders to inform them of the particulars of this arrangement. The HSE will contact cardholders again when a replacement GP is in place. The Government recognises the high demand for GP services and has taken measures to make working in general practice in Ireland more attractive. This will improve the recruitment and retention of GPs, increasing the number of GPs throughout the country. The rate of remuneration under the GMS scheme has been increased with additional annual investment of more than €200 million being provided under the 2019 GP agreement. For GPs, this means increased capitation rates, increased rural practice supports, and increased contributions to leave arrangements. Furthermore, budget 2023 provides for additional funding for practice supports in advance of the expansion of GP visit card eligibility from next April for those who earn the median household income of €46,000 or less. Specifically on rural practices, the agreement provides for a 10% increase in payments under the pre-existing rural practice support framework and a 28% increase in dispensing doctors' fees. Practices that receive rural practice supports attract the maximum allowable rate per practice to support subsidies and local contributions for leave taking. The number of doctors entering GP training has more than doubled in recent years from 120 in 2009 to 258 in 2022, with 350 training places planned to be available by 2026. This shows that the measures undertaken are having an impact and will increase the number of GPs working in the State. A strategic review of GP services is due to commence shortly and is to be completed in a relatively short timeframe. This review, with input from key stakeholders, will examine issues affecting general practice, including issues around rural GP vacancies, and will set out measures to improve provision of GP services.

I have much of that detail already from the HSE locally through community healthcare organisation, CHO, 4. The real reason I am here is that many elderly people are fairly distressed and fearful of losing their service. I am glad to hear the Minister of State assure the House that the HSE has taken interim steps. I am aware that a GP has been located locally to step in and fill the breach until such time as a new GP is appointed. All that is welcome but, unfortunately, that is not what is being filtered out through local media at present. There is scaremongering and politicisation of this matter. That is wrong, especially, as I said, when we have elderly people who are severely distressed and might be concerned about future appointments, or prescriptions to be made out or whatever. It is wrong on the part of those people who are trying to politicise this. I understand that a letter is to be sent this week to all patients affected detailing those interim arrangements. That will, it is to be hoped, at least reassure many of them that the HSE is doing all it can to fill this void. As already stated, it is unfortunate that private patients are in a situation where they face the prospect of having no GP over the Christmas period but I understand that a number of nearby GPs are already taking those patients on as well. I encourage anybody who is concerned to either get in touch with me or with other GPs in the vicinity, who are helping out where they can. The Irish College of General Practitioners, ICGP, is due to announce a scheme for the recruitment of non-EU GPs in the coming weeks. Thankfully, this is being supported by the HSE. Some 20 GPs for rural areas will be employed in the first tranche. A second tranche of GPs is already being lined up for CHO 4. This is being done as part of a pilot programme by the ICGP. More details about that will follow in the next few weeks. I am happy with the Minister of State's response. It reassures me. I hope it will also reassure people in my constituency that there is a process in place. We should be helping to ensure that process is followed rather than trying to undermine it.

The HSE's focus is on ensuring continuity of care. It is currently engaging with local providers to implement a plan for services in the interim. As the Deputy stated, we need to take steps to reassure people. Sometimes, the wrong message can go out. It can be difficult to get the right message out there. As the Deputy also indicated, the HSE will contact affected medical cardholders and GP visit cardholders to advise them when these arrangements are finalised. It will also contact them when the new permanent GP is in place. There is an increasing demand for GP services. Significant measures have been taken to increase the number of GPs working across the country. There are positive signs, including the increase in the number of doctors entering GP training as well as an increase in the number of GPs on the specialist register, that access to GPs will improve. The issues affecting rural GP practices and the difficulty in filling rural GMS vacancies will be examined as part of the upcoming strategic review of GP services. This review will set out further measures to improve the delivery of GP services. The Deputy mentioned that the ICGP will be bringing in some non-EU GPs. That is another step in the right direction. It may allow us to address this issue. As already stated, sometimes the wrong message can go out and it can be difficult to get a positive message out to people. However, what I am seeing is quite positive in the context of dealing with and trying to resolve the situation that has arisen. I again thank Deputy O'Sullivan for his co-operation and for his interest in this important issue.

While district heating systems are sustainable and should be encouraged and promoted, they are placing a major financial burden on residents. This is not acceptable. I will give an example of the exorbitant costs. In one area in my constituency residents estimate that the cost of taking a shower is €12. Households that have cut down sharply on the use of hot water and are washing by filling basins rather than taking showers are still seeing huge increases in charges. Those charges have tripled in just one month. My understanding is that district heating systems are charged commercial rates rather than residential rates for gas due to a failure on the part of the Government to introduce regulations to protect households. Will the Minister of State confirm whether this is the case? Residents, some of whom live with life-threatening illnesses, are coming down with infections. This is leading to costly visits to their GPs because they cannot access basic levels of heat and hot water. Residents in one part of my constituency are in a prepay district heating system. They are allowed to go into arrears of €10 and are then cut off entirely. They have no alternative. They cannot opt out and move to another system or provider. They have no choice. This means that some residents are living without heat, hot water or even fridges. This extreme situation cannot be allowed to continue and must be addressed as a matter of urgency. Replies to parliamentary questions I have submitted to date on this matter suggest the Government intends to address this issue at some point in the future. No timeline has been given, but, potentially, it might happen in a year's time. This is not acceptable. It is almost 100 years since local authorities began installing baths in local authority housing in order that social housing tenants could wash regularly without needing to resort to using basins in their kitchens. We are now back in a situation where social housing tenants are resorting to using basins to wash. They cannot afford to have showers because the Government has not addressed this issue. This is utterly unacceptable. Will the Government take action as a matter of urgency to protect households reliant on district heating systems? What is the Government going to do to sort out this problem? When will action be taken? What timeline is the Government working to? Will the Government rectify this matter urgently - before Christmas - in order that people living in these dire circumstances can access the basics they need to live dignified lives? Does the Minister of State agree that the current situation is completely intolerable and unacceptable? Does he agree it cannot be allowed to continue? When will the Government act to bring regulations or legislation to address this matter?

The Government is supportive of district heating because it contributes to the diversification of the fuel supply for heat and decarbonising the heat sector. Across Europe, the term "district heating" is generally applied to networks that serve neighbourhoods, towns or cities and cover a mixture of customers including public buildings, industrial and commercial sites and residential units. District heating networks can offer flexibility in fuel choice and the ability to adapt to changes in the economic and policy landscapes. They may see different combinations of energy resources used at different times during the lifetime of district heating network. District heating networks also offer the potential to expand the use of renewable energy sources and to assist with meeting decarbonisation goals. Group heating schemes are smaller scale operations that generally supply an apartment block or housing estate, as the Deputy outlined. In general, these schemes are supplied by natural gas purchased at a commercial rate by the energy system operator. Customers are supplied with heat, the sale of which is not currently regulated. The district heating steering group was established under the Climate Action Plan 2021 to ensure structured development of district heating. Analysis of the regulatory needs of the district heating sector has been undertaken by the economic and consumer protection working group working reporting to the district heating steering group. As part of that analysis, the issue of group heating schemes has been considered and further consideration will be given to including group heating schemes within a consumer protection framework. Under SI 350 of 2022, which transposed the 2018 renewable energy directive, the Commission for the Regulation of Utilities, CRU, has been appointed as regulator of district heating networks and will need to develop an extensive programme of work to consult upon and develop the regulatory regime. It is expected this work will commence following the submission of the district heating steering group report to the Government. The Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland, SEAI, has initiated a programme of pilot feasibility studies to examine the technical potential of moving group heating schemes that are fuelled by natural gas to renewable energy sources. The initial results of this work are expected to be available in the new year. More broadly, to help to alleviate the impact of the rising costs of living, the Government has put in place a series of measures and has made funding of €2.4 billion available. Further once-off measures worth €2.5 billion were announced in budget 2023, including the electricity costs emergency benefit. Primary and secondary enabling legislation has been put in place, with the first of three €200 electricity credits, inclusive of VAT, being paid to more than 2.2 million domestic electricity accounts from November 2022. While not all consumers use gas, electricity is supplied to all households, ensuring that this is a universal benefit.

There is a lot of useful information in that and that I had not received to date, so I am grateful for it and it is helpful. I understand that in a normal situation things take time and go through processes, and before the current crisis this would have made sense. The issue I have is that the current crisis around how commercial gas rates have increased and with prices being at a much higher rate than residential gas rates has left people in district heating systems in a particularly vulnerable situation that is intolerable. There needs to be an emergency response on this from Government to protect these residents. That is what I am asking for. I appreciate the longer process and that would have made sense before the events of this year, but for people who cannot shower, who are living in some very dire situations, and we are talking in particular about how this is affecting many people on low incomes, in social housing, and with serious illnesses. This is an intolerable situation that needs an urgent response now. That is what I am asking for. Second, the Minister of State's reply mentions the measures the Government has brought in in terms of the electricity credits and so forth. The reply I received from the Taoiseach last week seemed to indicate some people in district heating systems would not have been benefiting from these measures. Is there clarity on and certainty that people in district heating systems are benefiting from those measures?

The issues affecting customers of group heating schemes is primarily a matter for the consumer and the energy provider. The package of financial supports made available under budget 2023 includes the electricity emergency benefit scheme and will assist vulnerable households in the context of the cost of living. I do not have the detail regarding clarity but we will be able to work on that if the Deputy sends an email to the Minister for the Environment, Climate and Communications, Deputy Ryan, or to me. I have no problem with determining what is the best outcome. Unfortunately, all EU member states have been affected by recent high global energy prices to various degrees. These impacts have been felt, especially by vulnerable citizens and small and medium enterprises that are striving to recover from the Covid-19 pandemic. Nevertheless it is important to have a clear and shared understanding of the current situation. The Deputy has rightly said we need to protect these residents, and I agree we need to do as much as we can to protect them and get them out of the vulnerable situation they find themselves in. A central part of the solution lies with cost-effective energy efficiency measures and accelerated deployment of renewable energy sources. It is very important we proceed swiftly with the treatment of the Fit for 55 package to achieve climate neutrality by 2050, and a well-managed energy transition is part of the solution to keep prices affordable and predictable. The Government is working to expand district heating in Ireland to contribute to decarbonisation goals and to provide improved comfort and energy efficiency in homes. An expansion of district heating can also create skilled jobs in the areas of district heating systems, construction, and network operation and maintenance. An appropriate regulatory framework under EU legislation that also takes into account the Irish operational environment will be developed with advice from the district heating steering group to ensure protection and transparency, including for users of group heating schemes. I thank the Deputy for raising this important issue.

I want to explain to her what is wrong with the way the Department is applying DEIS school status in Ardee. There are four schools in Ardee. One of them, a post-primary school, has DEIS status, so every student who is over 12 or 13 and who goes there has DEIS status. They have special educational supports. There are three primary schools in the town. One, the Monastery National School, is essentially a boys' school. There is an Educate Together school, and there is Scoil Mhuire na Trócaire, which is essentially a girls' school. Two of the primary schools I mentioned, the Monastery National School and Scoil Mhuire na Trócaire, have been opened up to boys and girls from this year. The difficulty is that two of the schools have DEIS status, so every boy in Ardee, whether going to school in primary or secondary school, has DEIS status and has those supports, but not every girl does, because there are 288 girls who attend Scoil Mhuire na Trócaire and they do not have DEIS status. Their brothers and the boys in the other schools have a hot lunch during the day. Girls are being discriminated against because they do not have DEIS status and they do not have a school meal because one is predicated on the other. I visited the school along with Councillor Dolores Minogue, who is a very active councillor in Ardee and who attended that excellent primary school, Scoil Mhuire na Trócaire. We spoke to the principal and the facts are that 60% of the girls attending the school have siblings attending a DEIS school. In first class, 73% of the students, who are essentially girls, have a brother or sister in one of the DEIS schools. In third class, 80% of pupils, and in sixth class, 76% of pupils have a sibling in a local DEIS school. From the very first day when a girl goes to school in the town of Ardee, she is discriminated against by DEIS decisions. DEIS is supposed to be delivering equality of education but it is actually delivering inequality, gender bias and an unacceptable situation. The school staff tell me, and unfortunately, with the cost-of-living crisis, this is endemic in our society, that they know a number of children - that is girls - come to school with no lunch or an inadequate lunch. In fact, they are sourcing food locally and keep sliced pans and other food in their freezer for children in need. Something must change here, because the Minister is perpetuating inequality in our society - gender inequality. I am a grandparent with boys and girls as grandchildren, and by God I would not stand for that: that the boys get the lunches and get the DEIS and the girls get nothing. That has to change. I know the school put in an appeal which was turned down. In the words of the Department, it was a fair and final decision. Well, it is not fair and it is not final. The children are entitled to a hot school meal or food and water in this primary school they go to. It is absolutely disgraceful and I cannot stand over this. I appreciate the Minister attending and await her response.
#NormaFoley	unknown-#NormaFoley-party	unknown-#NormaFoley-dob	unknown-#NormaFoley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-11-30 00:00:00	Ábhair Shaincheisteanna Tráthúla - Topical Issue Matters	10	I thank the Deputy for raising this Topical Issue matter. It has been raised with me previously by Senator McGreehan and others. At the outset I point out that Delivering Equality of Opportunity in Schools, DEIS, is the main policy initiative of the Department to address concentrated educational disadvantage at school level. The Department provides a wide range of supports to all schools, DEIS and non-DEIS, to support the inclusion of all students and address barriers to students achieving their potential. Supplementing these universal supports, the DEIS programme provides a targeted and equitable way to address concentrated educational disadvantage that promotes equity across the primary and post-primary sectors. As the Deputy referenced, I announced a major expansion of the DEIS programme in March, which means that for the first time since 2017, programmes have significantly expanded to an additional 322 schools. The programme now includes more than 1,200 schools, and in effect this means one in four of all students are now supported in the DEIS programme. Schools added to the programme earlier this year were identified for inclusion in the DEIS programme through the refined DEIS identification model, which is an objective, statistics-based model. The DEIS identification process is based on the principle of concentrated disadvantage, and that is the issue. There may well be disadvantage in various schools, but it is the concentration of disadvantage in a particular school at the particular time of the undertaking of the model that is considered. It considers the proportion of students from disadvantaged backgrounds within a school and the relative disadvantage within a given school. The development of this model involved an extensive body of work by the DEIS technical group, which included officials from my Department, the Department's inspectorate and the Educational Research Centre. The model used information from the schools' individual enrolment database and the 2016 national census data as represented by the Pobal HP deprivation index. It also took into consideration the significant educational disadvantage experienced by Traveller and Roma learners and by students residing in direct provision or emergency homeless accommodation.A detailed document outlining the refined DEIS identification model is published on gov.ie. Schools were not required to apply for inclusion in the DEIS programme and all schools in the country were considered for inclusion under the model. It is possible for two neighbouring schools to have a different profile in terms of proportion of students from disadvantaged backgrounds and the relative weighting of disadvantage apportioned in each school. The designation of neighbouring schools to different DEIS bands does not mean that there is no educational disadvantage present in one school but that the concentrated level of educational disadvantage of the two schools is different. Schools that were not satisfied with the outcome following the application of the DEIS identification model to their school enrolment data were provided with the opportunity to have that outcome reviewed. While the school in question did appeal this decision, there was no change to the outcome of the initial application of the refined DEIS identification model. However, my Department will continue to support the school community to deliver high-quality, inclusive teaching and learning to the students and young learners. The DEIS programme will continue to be supported by my Department and following the national census of 2022 held on 3 April last, it is envisaged that an updated HP deprivation index will be generated by Pobal and will be available in quarter 3 of 2023. The Department will engage with Pobal regarding this process. The updated Pobal HP deprivation index, when available, can then be considered by my Department to inform future resource allocation to tackle educational disadvantage. During my term as Minister, I am please to say I have increased the funding for the DEIS programme significantly. In fact, in 2023 the funding will be in the order of €180 million. This reflects a strong commitment to addressing educational disadvantage.

There has obviously been no change in the Department. I urge the Minister to inquire again into the issue of gender inequality that is arising here. I appreciate her reply but ask her to listen to the point that no girl going to a primary school in Ardee is getting DEIS support, not one, while every boy is. That is not acceptable. Every boy attending primary school in Ardee is getting a hot meal at school while no girl attending is. Twins coming from the same address with the same mum and dad walk down the street and one goes to the boys' school while the other to the girls' school. The girl asks her mammy what is wrong with her that she cannot get the additional educational teaching supports. What is wrong is the formula. The formula is wrong. I urge the Minister to look at that issue again for the people and parents of Ardee and the girls. I swear to God, I cannot believe it. I am shocked and appalled that this is the outcome. It may be an exceptional outcome and Ardee may be the only town in Ireland where it is happening but it is happening today and is going to happen tomorrow. Funnily enough, on becoming 12 years of age, they will all be disadvantaged and then will be in a DEIS school. There is something radically wrong here. I urge the Minister or her departmental officials to meet the principal of the school for a constructive engagement to discuss this issue. We have to find a solution. The pupils must be treated equally. The present DEIS is discrimination in education and it is also gender discrimination in this particular case. There is no doubt at all about it.
#NormaFoley	unknown-#NormaFoley-party	unknown-#NormaFoley-dob	unknown-#NormaFoley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-11-30 00:00:00	Ábhair Shaincheisteanna Tráthúla - Topical Issue Matters	12	I note the Deputy's concerns. The extension of the DEIS programme progresses the programme for Government commitment to complete the new DEIS identification model and to extend DEIS status to schools serving the highest concentration of pupils at risk of educational disadvantage. The concentration is the issue. The recent expansion will add an additional €32 million to the Department's expenditure on the DEIS programme for 2023, bringing the overall Department of Education allocation for 2023 to €180 million. I am very conscious of the benefits of the DEIS programme, as has been articulated. Analysis has shown that since the programme began in 2006, it has helped to close the gap in achievement between schools serving the highest levels of educational disadvantage and those serving populations with little or no disadvantage. However, I recognise there are students at risk of educational disadvantage in all schools, not just DEIS schools and therefore under budget 2023, I secured funding for a number of measures that will support all children in this regard. This includes over €50 million to provide, as a permanent initiative, free books for all students in primary schools. I have also further improved the staffing schedule for primary schools to a ratio of 23:1, the lowest it has ever been, to benefit all schools. It is also important to note that the extension of the DEIS programme to new schools is just one phase of work in my vision for an inclusive education system which supports all learners to achieve their potential. The next phase of work will explore the allocation of resources to schools to tackle educational disadvantage. This will consider all schools within and outside the DEIS programme. Part of this scheme of work will involve consultation with all relevant stakeholders. I want to be clear on this point. Where a school does not achieve DEIS status, it does not mean that educational disadvantage does not exist but that the concentration of educational disadvantage between two schools is different. Unless there is a 100% reflection of the same students in each school, then both schools will be different. The issue here is not educational disadvantage but the concentration of it in one school over another. The system is open and fair. It uses the HP deprivation index with two additional weights for children who come from a background where there is homelessness, or children from a Traveller or Roma backgrounds.

I thank the Minister for being here. I understand she has a meeting later today with the stakeholders to discuss this very important issue. It is an issue that is escalating quite significantly. The Minister will be aware of its seriousness but for the benefit of the House and the record, I will say that we have a severe crisis in teacher supply at present in both primary and post-primary schools. In my view, this is primarily caused by the cost-of-living crisis, which is at its most severe particularly in Dublin but also in the other major urban centres. Teachers, particularly lower-paid younger teachers, cannot afford the rental costs and have very little prospect of being able to manage a mortgage in those big urban centres. There are multiple examples here in Dublin in particular. In Coolmine Community School, the school has had to take a decision not to offer subjects such as woodwork and metalwork and has had to combine classes for other subjects. This situation is replicated in other schools. Members may have seen the situation in St. James's Primary School in Dublin city on the "Six One News" a number of nights ago, where on 28 November, three teachers were out sick but only one substitute teacher could be found, leading to a number of classes being combined. St James's is also a base school for the supply panels. I am very supportive of supply panels as an idea but because of the existing supply issues, they are under-resourced. The school advertised for a position on that supply panel but absolutely no applications came in; there were zero applications. Some 60% of spaces on the supply panels in Dublin are vacant. Fundamentally, this is about housing. I appreciate the Minister is the Minister for Education but she has a collective responsibility for the housing situation and I hope she can use her voice at Cabinet to try to address that. While the Minister cannot address all these issues on her own, are there things the Department of Education can do, in and of itself? I believe there are and they need to be considered. I acknowledge that some of these actions have been taken but there are others. At post-primary level in particular, it is about the creation of additional positions. We have too many teachers who are on insecure temporary contracts and who are underemployed. That is a key part of addressing the supply issue at this level. At primary level, there are similar issues. During the Covid-19 pandemic, the requirement for teachers who trained in Britain to complete their induction in Britain was waived by the Department. Something similar should be examined here and I ask the Minister to look at that at today's meeting. Foremost, I ask the Minister to examine the following.This Christmas hundreds of teachers will return home from Britain, Scotland and the Middle East. They would love to be teaching here in Ireland but they cannot be offered a permanent position after 1 October at post-primary level and 1 November at primary level. If these teachers want to stay at home after Christmas their best chance is to take a temporary contract until the summer, go without pay over the summer months and then take their chances on getting a permanent position or a contract of indefinite duration in September. Would it not be far better, as was the case until approximately eight years ago, if the Department could allow permanent contracts to be offered to them? This would mean those teachers returning from Dubai, England or wherever could come home and be offered a permanent job and get paid over the summer. They would stay in the system. Will the Minister look at this? Can we offer permanent jobs to the hundreds of teachers, and perhaps more than this, who are working abroad at present?

Newly qualified teachers, however, represent an additional source of supply for substitute and full-time posts in 2022 and 2023, with more than 3,600 primary and post-primary newly qualified teachers registered with the Teaching Council. Significant additional posts have been allocated to the primary substitute teacher supply panels in areas where significant challenges in sourcing substitution continue. This brings the total to 610 posts on 151 panels covering more than 2,840 schools. These panels were introduced as a pilot from 2019 and have significantly expanded since their introduction. While these panels work very effectively in many instances and are fully staffed in more than 90% of cases outside of Dublin I am conscious there is always room for improvement. To this end I have asked officials to review fully the operation of the supply panels. I have asked them to consider whether their use could be made more effective to support schools and whether additional measures could be taken to recruit teachers where there are vacancies. We have taken steps to alleviate some of the substitute supply pressures faced by schools. For the current school year job-sharing teachers may be employed to work in a substitute capacity. The limit on substitute work applying to teachers on career break has been suspended. Third and fourth year student teachers can register with the Teaching Council. More than 2,100 student teachers have applied for registration in this respect. Once registered, student teachers can be employed by a school to cover substitution of vacancies. As an example, approximately 800 second year Hibernia College professional master of education students have completed their latest school placement block and are available to the school system for the coming weeks. At post-primary level the Department has recently put in place a scheme that allows teachers to teach additional hours in their subject area over the usual 22-hour limit, up to a maximum of 20 additional hours per term. Retired teachers who maintain their Teaching Council registration can also provide substitute cover. The Department has agreed a waiver of abatement with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform for such teachers for up to 50 days in each of the three calendar years from 2021 to 2023, inclusive. The Department also runs a comprehensive programme of work to support the supply of teachers and engages closely with school management bodies and other education stakeholders to inform this work. Today the national consultative forum on teacher supply, co-hosted by the Teaching Council and the Department of Education, is meeting as the Deputy referenced. This will include all of the key stakeholders in this area. Higher education institutions have developed new four-year initial teacher education programmes in a number of post-primary priority subject areas, including Irish, maths, computer science and modern foreign languages. In addition, the Department fully funds teachers to participate in upskilling programmes in maths, physics and Spanish. The first cohort of participants, approximately 170 teachers, is expected to graduate from these programmes this year and more than 300 teachers will graduate in 2023. We are also commencing the development of new upskilling programmes in other target subject areas, such as Irish. The Department also has a scheme to allow post-primary schools to share teachers, the aim of which is to recruit teachers in high-demand subjects and give teachers a full-time teaching contract. I strongly urge schools to explore this option as a means of supporting recruitment. These measures are underpinned by the Teaching Transforms campaign which promotes the teaching profession and encourages students to follow a career in teaching. The campaign is supported by the dedicated webpage on gov.ie. It is acknowledged that despite these important actions, which have helped to some extent, work remains to be done to address the teacher supply challenge, particularly to ensure the availability of sufficient substitute teachers. The Department of Education will continue to work closely and intensively with stakeholders on this important matter.

I have acknowledged that some actions have been taken, albeit more in the primary area than the post-primary area. The Minister has acknowledged that despite these actions, which have helped to some extent, work remains to be done to address the teacher supply challenge and particularly to ensure the availability of sufficient substitute teachers. I imagine these actions have made some difference but, as the Minister said, they are clearly not fully addressing the problem that exists. I note with a little concern mention of reviewing the supply panels. I am not sure there is any need to review them. The only thing wrong with the supply panels is that it is not possible to do the miracle of the loaves and fishes. There are just not enough to go around. They are a good idea. They are something sought for some time by the INTO. If there is a bean counter in the Department encouraging the Minister to think they are not great or not the best use of our money I encourage her to push back against it. It is a good idea provided there are enough teachers coming through to them. The problem, particularly in urban areas, is that younger teachers and newly qualified teachers cannot afford to live and work in Dublin. This is the fundamental problem. I urge her to engage with the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage. The fundamental issue is the cost of housing. This is why teachers choose to go abroad and teach outside of the major cities. The Minister has a responsibility in this regard. More particularly, I would like a response from the Minister on the following matter. I have made a number of suggestions, including a particular suggestion regarding teachers coming from abroad. Will the Minister look at this and allow them to work, if not permanently then perhaps for a couple of years? It was the case until eight years ago that teachers could be offered a permanent contract after 1 October or 1 November, depending on whether they were at post-primary or primary level. It makes perfect sense. It is challenging to compete with areas such as the Middle East where teachers can be offered high wages. The least we should be able to do is to offer those teachers a permanent position and to be paid over the summer. Otherwise we are asking them to take their chances if they want to stay here after Christmas. I am not sure they will do this.

I appreciate his active engagement on this and his acknowledgement that many initiatives have been introduced to mitigate where there are issues. Notwithstanding this, I absolutely accept there are particular challenges in some areas more so than others. The significant action that has been taken ensures that, for example, we have the third and fourth year students coming onstream. We have more than 1,700 of them now registered. As we speak, if we were to take one higher education institute as an example, more than 800 students are now available from Hibernia for substitution. We have looked at retired teachers and provided the abatement for them. More than 800 of them have made themselves available for substitution work. We have lifted the restrictions on those job sharing and on career break. As the Deputy is aware, post-primary teachers can work additional hours. The Deputy referenced the review of the operation of the panels. No one knows more so than me the importance of having extended these panels. In 2019 there were six panels. Over the past two years this has increased to 151. This has been a very positive move. However, I am fair enough to acknowledge that clearly there are issues for some of the panels. It is important that we do a full review of how the panels are implemented and what potential there is to do things differently as we go forward. I understand the value of the panels and I want them to work better and more efficiently. Perhaps there is scope going forward. I also want to acknowledge, and we need to look at it in the round, that significant development and enhancement in education has taken place in the past two years. Over the past three budgets I have consistently reduced the pupil-teacher ratio to an historic low of 23:1. This has meant more teachers are being employed. We have administrative leave days for teaching principals. This means more teachers are being employed. Equally, where there are two special classes in a school there is automatic installation of administrative principal status. This means more teachers are being employed. More and more teachers are coming into the system. Obviously we have to look at the issue of substitution.We have made significant strides in initiatives in that regard. There is a meeting today and there will be more throughout the week. We are open to looking at everything that might address the issue.

— despite the significant number of people who abuse drugs and suffer from a mental health illness, our mental health services and addiction treatment centres are still not organised to holistically treat people with a dual diagnosis; and— the Programme for Government: Our Shared Future committed the parties in Government to convening a citizens' assembly on drugs but, despite the Taoiseach's stated intention to do so in "the latter part of this year", there is so far no indication as to whether or when it will be held;agrees that:— overall, there has been a lack of visibility at Minister or Minister of State level, a lack of joined up thinking between Ministers, Departments and State agencies, and a lack of focus, energy and urgency in spearheading the State's response to drugs;— the policy of criminalisation of the user has failed, nationally and internationally, the resources of the State are wasted on inappropriately processing medical addiction cases through the courts and prisons, and a health-led and patient-focussed alternative is needed;— the previous international consensus in the West on a law-enforcement approach to drugs is now collapsing, and over 30 countries have decriminalised drug possession for personal use in some form;— the worst harms of a criminalisation policy are experienced by people and communities who are already disadvantaged and marginalised, and a reformed approach must operate in the context of strategies to combat poverty and marginalisation;— a community-based health-led alternative response would target the adverse health, social and economic consequences of drug use and would provide harm reduction services to address disease transmission and overdoses; and— the 2001 Portuguese initiative of decriminalising possession of drugs and introducing a health diversion scheme, with a resulting significant decline in drug deaths in Portugal while they continue to rise across the EU, merits particular study; andcalls for:— a firm date to be fixed for convening the citizens' assembly on drugs, with the assembly requested by its terms of reference to:— make central to its deliberations the lived experience of individuals, families and communities who have directly experienced the impact of drug abuse, so that harm reduction and recovery strategies are developed in collaboration with those most directly affected;— ensure that, while it may legitimately join with other EU countries in considering whether to legalise possession of cannabis for personal use, this question does not distract from the separate and urgent debate about changes in policy and approach needed in order effectively to promote the rehabilitation and recovery of persons addicted to harmful drugs; and— specifically consider a policy that continues to tackle organised crime gangs involved in drug trafficking and dealing, but offers a non-criminal and comprehensive public health treatment, rehabilitation and recovery alternative for persons in possession of drugs for personal use;— emergency amending legislation to facilitate mobile supervised injection facilities, for both urban and regional sites;— regulatory oversight of all addiction treatment services, with a commitment to client centred and evidence-based recovery programmes;— a significant increase in funding for Drug and Alcohol Task Forces and the conferring of an added educational remit, in liaison with schools and in community settings; and— the expansion of the work of the Criminal Assets Bureau to target and seize smaller assets in local communities with the full resources of An Garda Síochána targeted at organised crime gangs, traffickers and dealers.I send my best wishes to my former colleagues and the children, staff and school community of St. Laurence O'Toole's National School, which I used to teach in, who are opening their new school building today. I believe the Minister for Education, Deputy Foley, will be opening it. I cannot be with them because of this debate, but they know I love them very much and they are with me always. If we were to invite a family member of every individual who died from a drug overdose last year to sit in this Chamber, we would not have enough room for everyone. This is the most famous room in Ireland and these seats have been filled by famous people over the past 100 years or so. If we were to invite a single family member of every individual who had died from a drug overdose in Ireland to sit here, we would not have enough room. They would have to sit in the Public Gallery. In 2017, 235 people died from drug overdoses. That figure has got worse year on year. We have one of the highest drug overdose rates in Europe. If those family members were to sit in these seats, what would we say to them? I suppose we would want to understand the complexity of the issue and show compassion. We would want to listen to experts, who say that there are overlapping issues of poverty, disadvantage and alienation that lead someone into drug use and addiction. We would want to understand all of that. If we were honest, though, we in the political system would look at those family members and tell them that the people they loved and who died were criminals. This is at the centre of what we are trying to change through this motion. The Labour Party wants to stand with those family members. It wants to stand with those in addiction, those who are suffering and those who are in recovery. It wants to tell them plainly and simply they are not criminals. The criminalisation of drug users is part of a stigma and a shame culture. It is a deliberate act of public policy. It is not drugs that kill people as much as bad drugs policy does. The Labour Party believes we do not need a war on drugs. Rather, we need a war on bad drugs policy. Criminalising and stigmatising people in addiction leads to people in the political system undermining and dehumanising people who need support and compassion. It leads to a then Minister throwing leaflets around her constituency telling her constituents that the newly opened medical centre in her area would not be dealing methadone. It leads to a backbencher using dehumanising language when speaking about someone in addiction. It leads to the most ineffective and absent Minister and Minister of State with responsibility for this area in a generation. The feeling from the political system is that what drug users are doing is criminal and what they are is worthless. It is not just the political system that feels this way. The medical system feels this way too. My colleague, Senator Sherlock, tells me that, in Dublin, only 28% of GPs are involved in the methadone programme. That is replicated throughout the country. It leads to a bizarre situation where, as Fr. Peter McVerry told us on Monday night, people are travelling from Wexford to Dublin to get their methadone. I know this to be true because I once met a woman called Lisa. Lisa was living in Portlaoise. She was a young mother who used to travel by bus from Portlaoise to Dublin every day to get her methadone. The sad thing is that, when engaging with Lisa, I had the feeling she believed she was not worth any more than that and could not demand a better service because she felt on some level she was a criminal and was worthless. We forced this young mother to go from Portlaoise to Dublin every day on a bus to get her methadone. When I called into that centre a number of months later, I asked about Lisa. I was told she had not survived. We killed her. She was not a criminal. She was not worthless. I knew a man called Paul who had a daughter with cystic fibrosis. The Minister of State should have seen the way they spent time together. They loved each other deeply. There was a sparkle in her eyes when she saw him. He was not well and she was not well. She did not make it because of her illness. As a result, he did not make it because of his. He was not a criminal and he was not worthless. The Misuse of Drugs (Supervised Injecting Facilities) Act was passed by the Oireachtas in 2017. What would any of us say if we came across a dead body following a heroin overdose in a laneway and we held that body in our arms? Would we say to that person that the planning application was tied up in the High Court and there was nothing we could do? People are dying in the alleyways of our capital city but we have not made the necessary intervention to save their lives, that being, a mobile facility implemented through emergency legislation. We are the criminals. We are the ones who are useless. It is our inaction that is criminal, not the actions of those who are dying. Mr. Philly McMahon, a former Dublin footballer whose brother died of drug-related issues, says we need a tribe for change. I can speak of people in this House who are part of that tribe. I remember trying with my Labour Party colleagues to get the injecting centre idea over the line. It was people like the Minister for Finance, Deputy Donohoe of Fine Gael, and former Deputy Jonathan O'Brien of Sinn Féin who were supportive. Even today, I hear people like Deputy McAuliffe from Fianna Fáil making good speeches on decriminalisation. Colleagues like Deputy Hourigan of the Green Party, Deputy Cairns of the Social Democrats and Independent Senator Ruane are speaking seriously about this issue. I think of people like Deputy Gino Kenny, who has been a warrior in this field. We absolutely need a tribe to change this conversation from being about criminality and worthlessness to one that replicates what happened in Portugal 20 years ago when it decriminalised the drug user.After 20 years, it has half the number of people in drug-dependency programmes and has reduced its drug overdose rate by 75%. The Labour Party's call today is quite simple. We stand with those affected by this issue. You are not criminals. You are absolutely not worthless. We need people to understand and to completely recast their view of this debate. The Government has promised a citizens' assembly on drugs. We need to hold establish that assembly because people are dying on our watch. It is our inaction that is criminal.

It is disappointing that other than Labour Party Deputies, the only other Member present is the Minister of State charged with responding to the motion. What our spokesperson, Deputy Ó Ríordáin, has done in crafting this comprehensive, thoughtful motion is shine a light on an issue that impacts on all communities in our country, including every village, town, city and rural area. Everyone in this House knows that. We know we have a massive issue with drug abuse, drug-related illnesses and drug-related deaths. We also know there is unimaginable hurt and pain being felt by families in all our constituencies every day and Deputy Ó Ríordáin has just described some of that. Due to the nature of this issue, it is almost unspeakable; it is silent. This is a hurt that needs now to be addressed. The core statistics set out in our motion should shock each of us because these cold facts tell us one thing, namely, our current strategies are not working. The situation is getting worse. I have been policy focused for my entire career here. In any other sphere of public policy, when faced with those sort of realities, that inescapable truth, the response is to change tack, to see what actually works internationally and to implement change. This is an uncomfortable discussion for many. When faced with challenging societal issues in the past, we put in place a most useful device, namely, was the citizen's assembly. It was an idea originally championed by my party's former leader, Eamon Gilmore, and is one that has proven its worth. It has helped Ireland rethink difficult issues based on fundamental evidence and fact. We urgently need that now. We must have the long-promised citizen's assembly on drugs. We must hear from those affected. We must hear from those dealing with the drugs issue from the health side, the rehabilitation side and the administration of justice side. We will hear a tale that is both harrowing and instructive. Whatever angle people come at this issue from, they will come to the same conclusion, namely, that we need a change of policy. Marginalisation and criminalisation have failed here and elsewhere. The experience in the US is instructive. There is a political pressure, dating back to Bill Clinton's time, to be strong on drugs. There has been a policy of mass arrests and incarceration. The prison population has mushroomed beyond all imagination. Enormous resources have been deployed and communities ghettoised to no good effect. Other countries, as Deputy Ó Ríordáin stated, have done much better. The Portuguese experience is instructive. Portugal decriminalised the user while maintaining criminal penalties for those trafficking and selling drugs. It developed a comprehensive system I do not have time to go into, but it is instructive. We should look at and learn from it. Our motion calls for a change of tack and for a focus on this issue, which impacts on all of us. I ask the Government to look positively at it, to act instantly to create the citizen's assembly, to let the voices of the thousands of our citizens who are hurting be heard and to let us see what we can do to make things better for them rather than continuing on a path that is self-evidently not working.
#SeanSherlock	Labour	18256	Cork East	speech	unkown-language	2022-11-30 00:00:00	Ábhair Shaincheisteanna Tráthúla - Topical Issue Matters	22	I am glad to put my name to this motion, which states: "during the past 25 years of a law-enforcement approach to drug abuse, drug-related deaths have increased by 225 per cent, compared to a 68 per cent reduction in road deaths in the same period, with the total number of such deaths well exceeding 10,500." That is 10,500 lives and 10,500 families. The multiplied consequences of this are horrific to imagine. The motion also states:— Ireland now has the joint-highest rate of drug-induced deaths among 16 to 64-year-olds in the European Union (EU);— the number of people prosecuted for possession for personal use has increased over that period by 484 per cent, with more than a quarter of a million convictions recorded for that offence;— in the same period there has been a substantial overall increase in drug use, with use of cocaine rising by [approximately] 10,376 per cent, benzodiazepines by 1,824 per cent and cannabis by 263 per cent;— drug abuse and its harmful effects, including crimes of violence, intimidation and extortion aimed at addicts, their families and their communities, are no longer urban phenomena and are spread across the State; I represent the constituency of Cork East. I have first-hand experience of witnessing deals taking place within my neighbourhood. I also have first-hand experience of seeing the prevalence of recreational drug usage, especially of cocaine. Such behaviour has become normalised in our society. We cannot keep burying our heads in the sand. I would have been an advocate for stronger policing but the criminal justice response has not worked. If I look at crime statistics of the sort issued to joint policy committees such as those on Cork County Council, detections of possession of drugs for sale or supply across the city and county fell by 351 between January and August last year to 263 in the same period this year, which represented a reduction of 26%. The dogs on the street know drug use and sale and supply are increasing but the policing response, anecdotally, is moving away. The resources are not there. We now need the community health response. If one speaks to members of An Garda Síochána privately and off the record, they will say the same thing. It is beyond policing and beyond a criminal justice thought process or framework in relation to how it is being tackled. Having said that, the motion is very clear that we must still ensure we go after the drug cartels and the "Mr. Bigs" of this world.We now see their influence seeping down into communities. Money procured from recreational drug use by middle class kids and kids of all persuasions - when I say "kids" I am speaking about young adults and older adults - is now going into laundering, such as through the procurement of buildings and other property throughout the State. That needs to be tackled forthwith. The Portuguese model offers a solution. It involves a long-term commitment but it is something we can embrace. If we embrace and establish the citizens' assembly, we will hear what the citizens have to say. We will be surprised at their response.

As Deputies are aware, it is a health-led approach to drug and alcohol use in Ireland from 2017 to 2025. As Minister of State, I am responsible for co-ordinating the implementation of the national drugs strategy. By treating the use of substances as a public health issue rather than solely a criminal one, we can better help individuals, their families and the communities in which we live. I very much agree with Deputy Ó Ríordáin that we have to take away the stigma and shame when it comes to those who use drugs. A health-led approach is the right one. As Deputies are aware, the programme for Government includes a commitment to convene a citizens' assembly to consider matters relating to drug use. We are committed to establishing a citizens' assembly on drug use, along with a citizens' assembly on the future of education, at the earliest opportunity. The timelines for the next citizens' assemblies will, ultimately, be a matter for the Oireachtas to agree, but it is anticipated the Government will consider the matter early in the new year and it will be put to the Dáil and Seanad for debate. It is to be hoped we will have that citizens' assembly up and running as quickly as possible. Following a mid-term review of the national drug strategy, I agreed six strategic priorities for the remaining period of the strategy, that is, from 2021-25. The priorities reinforce the health-led approach to drug and alcohol use and capture the commitments in the programme for Government, as well as reflecting our support for the EU drug strategy and action plan 2021-25. The six priorities are to strengthen the prevention of drug and alcohol use among children and young people, enhance access and delivery of drug and alcohol services in the community, develop harm reduction responses and integrated care pathways for high-risk drug users, address the social determinants and consequences of drugs use in disadvantaged communities, promote alternatives to coercive sanctions for drug-related offences, and strengthen evidence-informed and outcomes-focused practice, services, policies and strategy implementation. Strategic implementation groups have been established to identify actions to implement these priorities under the auspices of the national oversight committee. These groups reflect the partnership approach and give a stronger voice to civil society in the implementation of the strategy. Deputy Howlin referred to prison and the need to reduce harm and remove the stigma. A lot is being done by the Garda, such as through its adult caution scheme, and we are trying to work with the Department of Justice on its health diversion scheme. In addition, a significant amount of work is being done under the radar as well. Deputy Sherlock referred to the situation in Cork East. It is obvious that drugs are in every village and town. It is not just an issue in urban areas; it is across Ireland and we have to deal with that accordingly. We will do so through a health-led approach, an education approach and maybe a justice approach as well. The most recent national drug and alcohol survey, for the period 2019-20, shows that, overall, the use of illegal drugs has remained at a similar level to that recorded in the 2014-15 survey. Unfortunately, the survey identified an increase in the use of cocaine and ecstasy. The most recent data available in respect of drug-related deaths show there were 376 drug-induced deaths in 2017. The number of deaths has fallen in recent years, from 401 in 2013. Every death is deeply regrettable, for the individuals, their family and friends and their community. Deputy Ó Ríordáin poignantly outlined that we would not have enough room in this Chamber for a single family member of every person who has died from a drug overdose. I very much agree with him in that regard. Recent data from the national drug treatment reporting system show that 17,628 cases received treatment for drug and alcohol use in 2021, which represents an increase of 14% on 2020. The majority of those cases were treated in outpatient facilities. This increase in treatment services reflects the Government's commitment to a public health response to drug use, as well as the additional resources committed to services. We need to do a lot more on prevention and education for children and young people in respect of drug use. That is one of the crucial elements of the remaining years of the national drugs strategy. I recently announced a €1.5 million allocation for a three-year drug and alcohol prevention and education programme. This funding programme is a key deliverable under the national drug strategy, which aims to strengthen the prevention of drug and alcohol use and related harm among children and young people. This is the first time national funding has been made available for drug prevention with a holistic approach, considering both drug and alcohol use, with the overarching aim of reducing the harmful use of both substances from an early age. This initiative will build on local and sectoral initiatives, such as Know the Score, and draw on evidence from Europe to professionalise and elevate drug prevention practices in Ireland. The programme will fund projects in five prevention settings, including schools, youth and general community, family, environmental and third level institutions. Funding of the national drugs strategy has increased significantly through the past three years. Budgets 2021, 2022 and 2023 allocated an additional €21 million to expand the provision of drug and alcohol services, encompassing residential and community-based services. More than €2 million has been made available through the community services enhancement fund towards the provision of community-based drug and alcohol services. Of the funding, 25% is ring-fenced for services for women, ethnic minorities and the LGBTI+ community. A further €500,000 is provided for the community services enhancement fund, CSEF, in 2023. Budget 2023 also provides an uplift of €3.5 million in core funding for community-based drug and alcohol services in order to maintain existing levels of service. This is the first increase in core funding since 2013. A priority of the national drugs strategy is to develop integrated care pathways and harm reduction responses for high-risk drug users. High-risk drug users have complex health and social needs that make them vulnerable to drug overdose and, ultimately, premature death. In 2022, €850,000 was allocated in recurring funding for a HSE-led initiative to reduce the health-related harms associated with the use of cocaine and crack cocaine. This funding will support services in delivering evidence-based interventions and will increase training opportunities for staff in addiction services nationally. It will also improve the support provided to those affected by adverse health consequences of cocaine or crack cocaine use. Community-based services and community healthcare organisations, CHOs, were consulted in developing these initiatives, reflecting the partnership approach at the heart of the national drugs strategy. A drug monitoring pilot programme was successfully implemented at the Electric Picnic festival this year as a response to drug use by people in the night-time economy, who have traditionally been difficult for drug and alcohol services to reach. In response to the Covid-19 pandemic, people with addiction issues and those who are homeless and marginalised were classed by the National Public Health Emergency Team, NPHET, as vulnerable groups to whose health and safety Covid posed a risk. Significant additional funding was provided to the HSE to provide for opioid substitution treatment, OST, in 2020 and 2021. A further €4.2 million was secured in budget 2022 for the continued treatment of an additional 1,000 clients on OST. They were given access to OST in 2020 and 2021 under the Covid-19 contingency plan for people who use drugs. In 2022, €10 million was provided to consolidate and maintain the enhanced provision of healthcare services for people who are homeless. These services have greatly minimised the expected number of deaths among the homeless population during Covid-19.I have outlined the Government's approach to drug use, which is a health-led response. Under my leadership, the Government has provided significant additional funding to implement national drugs strategy. Deputy Ó Ríordáin will be aware that I have engaged with all stakeholders, including community-based drugs and alcohol services to identify clear priorities for the remaining years of the national drugs strategy. I am disappointed with one issue, which is the national injecting facility. The Government is committed to the establishment of a supervised injecting facility in Dublin city centre. Legislation has been passed and we have identified an area in Dublin. Unfortunately, there are issues with this. We hope this gets up and running as quickly as possible. We are waiting on a decision from An Bord Pleanála. The facility will bring drug injecting into a medically controlled and supervised setting, with health and other benefits for vulnerable individuals. I am delighted to debate this issue here today. Cross-party, cross-Government and across the community, we must work together to try to address this very difficult issue.

It has been an evergreen answer for politicians over the years. Sometimes it is the right answer. With organised crime, murder, public order, cybercrime, and burglaries then yes, we need to resource the Garda. In the case of a drugs policy and tackling people with problematic addiction, more gardaí is not the answer. In this motion and led by Deputy Ó Ríordáin, we are trying to move this conversation, along with others, as Deputy Ó Ríordáin has said, to build a tribe and build a group that will push this to where it needs to be, that is, as a health-led approach to harm reduction and recovery. The justice-led and Garda-led approach has failed and is failing. The statistics are there to prove it, in that 70% of all drugs cases before our courts are for the personal use of drugs. How many times have we as politicians, particularly in recent years, discussed the logjams in our Courts Service as all of these things need to go through our courts, when 70% of drugs cases are for personal use? Beyond that, this is about dignity. It is about providing dignity to the individual, to the person who is suffering, to the person who is in need. Yesterday, I was driving in here at about 9:30 a.m. and I was stuck in traffic in the city. My eye was drawn to a Garda car that was pulled over to the side of the street. One garda was in the car and one was out of the car and searching an individual. I do not know the back story but I would make a judgment call, based on what I saw, that the individual had problematic drug use. Given my mind was in preparation for this debate today, what I saw spoke to one thing, which was the indignity with which that young man was treated. He was being searched and he was being patted down with his arms out. He had no bags or anything with him and he was wearing a tracksuit. When it got down to the mid-section of this young man, the garda pulled the young man's trousers down to his knees to search in and around his boxer shorts area. This was a busy street, in massive traffic, in full view of me and I do not know how many others. The traffic moved on, I moved on, and I do not know what the outcome was. I know one thing. That Individual was not best served by what happened to him on the side of that busy road yesterday morning. This is happening thousands of times. Nothing was done and nothing is being done to assist that individual in terms of that interaction yesterday. All that was done to that individual was the stripping of his dignity and criminalising him. Unless we get this conversation right, and unless we build on this and move on it, a lot of people would have looked at that incident yesterday and probably thought "Well good enough for him and that is how we need to tackle it - with more gardaí". This is what we need to try to move on from. This is why we need the health-led approach, the resources and the facilities. All of the evidence is there. We do not need to build the evidence. We know the models that have been successful, including the Portuguese model. Ireland's policy on this is failing and we do not need any more "Prime Time" documentaries on it. We just need to listen to the people on the front line. We need to go within our own selves and ask how we want fellow citizens to be treated. These are our family and our friends. There but for the grace of God, that could be my son, my brother or my best friend. That could be them. Drug addiction can hit anyone. It can strip away everything in a person's life and leave that person so vulnerable. We as a society are failing in this regard. We are failing in our drugs policy, we are failing communities and we are failing individuals who are on the front line. I ask the Minister of State to please not dismiss this. Let us put energy into the citizens' assembly. Let us put resources into it. Let us change policy and let us change it here. There are people on all sides who support this. This motion has cross-party support. Let us push it through. I commend Deputy Ó Ríordáin on leading on this on behalf of the Labour Party and we look forward to working with people to bring this further.
#GeraldNash	unknown-#GeraldNash-party	unknown-#GeraldNash-dob	unknown-#GeraldNash-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-11-30 00:00:00	Ábhair Shaincheisteanna Tráthúla - Topical Issue Matters	25	I am incredibly proud to be a member of a party that has drafted this motion, and to call myself a comrade and a friend of Deputy Ó Ríordáin, who has pioneered reform in this space. It is beyond time that we woke up as a society and as law makers to the stark reality of drugs in our society. We have to face the world as it is, not as we would like our ideal world to be. The world of today, in the Ireland of the 2020s, we simply have to face the facts that by the law of averages, someone we care about, someone in our family or in our group of close friends, took illicit drugs last weekend. They may have taken them yesterday and they may take them today. That is a reality. It is about facing up to those facts. Can we also admit that none of us would like to see the people we care about have a criminal record for consuming something that is readily available on the streets of every town and village in the land? We have a problem but it is not one that can be fixed with more gardaí, more prison cells, more prosecutions, or more convictions. Addiction to drugs is a health problem. For us to admit that the so-called war on drugs has manifestly been a failure is okay. It is okay to admit that. We are spending more than ever on the Garda and on resourcing the wider criminal justice system, yet drug use is rising. Deaths caused by drugs are high and the continuing threat of convictions associated with drug use has not prevented the use of cocaine rising by 10,000% in 25 years. As Deputy Howlin intimated earlier, when a policy is not working we have an obligation to change it. To do otherwise is criminal neglect. I represent an area where gangs fight over the drugs trade. I have seen people shot dead and many more maimed and butchered, homes destroyed by arson attacks, kids traumatised and decent people that I represent living in constant fear. I have been at the forefront of crafting a multi-agency response to this crisis in my community but I have also demanded a tough response against criminal gangs who make fortunes from the drugs trade. Thanks to our community and the members of the Garda in the Drogheda area, we have had that tough response. I make no apologies for demanding that we be tough on drug gangs and smugglers. Gang crime may have been quelled in my own area but drugs are still being dealt, despite the valiant efforts of the Garda. This is a reality for us everywhere. There is no inconsistency in taking on the gangs and their ill-gotten gains and supporting that strategy, while at the same time wanting to see a sea change in our treatment of sick, isolated, and poor drug user who is at the end of that supply chain. With all of the money spent on so-called crackdowns, we will still see many people needlessly dying. Some people that I have known all of my life have died because of heroin addiction. We have seen and know too many people in our community who are now nothing short of ghosts occupying hollowed-out sick bodies. People are ill and bereft of hope. They are wandering our streets stigmatised and shunned. They have a health problem. If we met somebody on the street was apparently having a heart attack, we would go to help. If somebody is clearly sick because of their addiction to drugs and because of problem drug use, we shun them, stigmatise them and ignore them. In so many cases, prosecution after prosecution simply has not deterred them. We are locking up too many people whose real need is for a treatment bed, not a prison cell. We pride ourselves in this country on being progressive but in the case of drugs policy, we certainly are not.If we were to spend just 20% of the money we spend on the criminal justice side on intervention and treatment, agencies like the Red Door Project in Drogheda would not have to go cap in hand to the HSE every few months for short-term funds to retain critical social workers and outreach workers, positions the Red Door Project was, in fact, provided with because of the crisis in my town. This is short-termism at its best. Services like this should be provided simply as a matter of course. They should be de rigueur if we are to take the time to take an evidence-based health and patient-led approach to the use of drugs. Can we all have that difficult, challenging conversation and democratic dialogue we need to have in a citizens' assembly format, drop the exhausting moral outrage we hear, take that evidence-based approach and deal with the world as it is, not how we think it should be?

We can all agree that there is an exceptionally serious issue with drug use and its links to organised crime throughout Ireland. Some people will seek a numbness to whatever trauma they have in their minds, and quite often the only way they can get that is through the use or misuse of drugs. I read through some of the recent European drug report, which stated that Ireland has the EU's joint highest rate of drug-induced deaths among those aged 16 to 64. We certainly cannot be proud of that as a society. The report indicated that there is growing use of crack cocaine throughout the city of Dublin, particularly, and in many other areas. The national drugs strategy has provided a deliverable pathway forward to secure people out of drug misuse, but the Government has failed to implement the policy and failed to fund it properly. The thrust of the motion before us relates to the securing of a timeline for a citizens' assembly on drug use, and that is to be welcomed, but it cannot and should not be spoken about in a vacuum. We see in our communities every day people who have sought comfort from trauma in the use of prescription drugs and illicit drugs alike. As one of my colleagues said yesterday, this is the only coping mechanism some people in addiction have because mental health services, unfortunately, are simply not available for many people and they turn to illicit drugs. The option of the Portuguese model, which has been considered and talked about for many years as a way forward, needs to be considered further. At the same time, we all also recognise the huge harm the drug gangs have done to communities throughout the country, the blight they are on communities and the terrible devastation they bring. I have spoken to parents and grandparents who have been threatened because of young people's drug debts. That is a trauma in their lives as they look at young people with hope, vision and ambition before them reduced to nothing because of their addiction to drugs. Someone once described it to me as suicide in slow motion. That is a very good image. If any of us were to meet a suicidal person, we would immediately recognise the need to intervene and to do something for that person, yet very often all sorts of very difficult and wrong language is used about people who are addicts. I will outline Sinn Féin's stance on the citizens' assembly. We are supportive of a citizens' assembly on drugs. It is something we have called for in the past. We have also supported the introduction of the medicinal cannabis compassionate access programme because we want those patients who can safely benefit from cannabis-based treatments to do so. Our most recent alternative budget pledged €45.2 million for addiction and recovery service provision. That is over ten times the total amount the Government proposed, €4 million, to enhance the service. Harm reduction and prevention have always been and will continue to be Sinn Féin's principles in our development of future drug and alcohol strategies. Part of the harm reduction approach will be to tackle organised crime directly, not the vulnerable foot soldiers, often addicts themselves, who are used by unscrupulous drug barons. Criminalising addicts is not the way to tackle organised crime. I hope the Government, when it introduces a timeline for the citizens' assembly, will take all these factors into account and recognise and accept that while there is a criminal element to the problem we have to deal with, many people who are addicts are often themselves involved in feeding their habits by selling drugs and are sucked into that criminal underworld. We have to recognise that the first thing they are is an addict and treat that first and then deal with the rest of it. Citizens' assemblies are one of the best ways we have developed over the past decade or more to deal with complex and divisive issues, to bring experts in and to get the opinions of people who are at the coalface and who can deal with the issue at hand. It is to be hoped we can come out of that with a solution which will serve well not just the general public but also addicts and future generations. We cannot continue this notion of a war on the supply side of drugs, which is what it is. It is only on the supply side. We need a war on the demand side. We need to reduce demand by having appropriate services in place for people who are vulnerable and people who could possibly in the future fall into the traps of drug addiction, as so many have done in the past.

This Government's treatment of and support for people in recovery, recovery services and people at the coalface of addiction have been shocking. Deputy Martin Kenny made the point that in the alternative budget Sinn Féin put forward, we pledged €45 million for this. A sum of €45 million would not solve everything, but it would be an ambitious start to support people, something which I do not think this Government is serious about. I thank the Labour Party for bringing forward this motion. I, like others in Sinn Féin, have advocated in respect of the need for a citizens' assembly because this is a complex issue but it must be dealt with. Sometimes you have to face the hard and unpopular questions. There are no votes for the Labour Party or anyone else in supporting this because some people's attitude towards people in addiction can be very aggressive or very nasty, but these are human beings we know personally. I know people who have died. I know families that have been destroyed. I knew two people who were in the throes of addiction and who took their lives this year because their families were being threatened because of drug debts - two young men who hanged themselves. I had written a speech. We have to do something, and it needs to be done now. It should be the first thing to happen early in the new year because there are people out there who need support. The number one reason people are in addiction is poverty and trauma. We cannot prevent that but we can support the people on the ground, the people in the throes of addiction and their families. I know this personally. Will the Minister of State bring forward the citizens' assembly on drugs, and will the Government step up? Drugs task forces have been waiting 12 years for their funding to be restored. If this Government had any bit of sincerity about tackling drugs and helping those in addiction, that is the first thing it would do.

This is a really important issue and affects every section of society. We need more discussions as to how we approach the use of drugs in this country. We need to hear from everybody. Everybody has to have a voice on this. Whether we agree or disagree with them, we have to ensure that people are engaged in this discussion. The best place for that, as has been said, is in the citizens' assembly. It is really important. A citizens' assembly allows people to have a voice. It teases out all the complex issues. We have to ensure, as I said, that nobody's point of view is considered invalid. So many families and individuals are directly affected by the failed approach this State has taken to drug use. We need a step change in how we approach drug use. We need to see a health-led approach that has harm reduction and prevention at its core, not the criminalisation of those with addiction problems who need help and support.Someone who robs a bank is a criminal. Someone who has an addiction is not a criminal. Someone who smokes some weed occasionally is not a criminal. We need to treat this as a health issue. Portugal introduced decriminalisation and the sky did not fall in. People's lives were saved because the level of overdoses reduced. This proposal is not radical. What we are calling for would not make us an outlier in terms of European policy. It has become an essential change of policy and we have to adopt it. During the Covid pandemic, we regularly heard that we have to believe in the science. I understand the World Health Organization recommends decriminalisation. Just as with Covid-19 and the surrounding issues, we must ensure that we believe the science around drug use and decriminalisation.

This is an area that has been neglected and left unchanged and unchallenged. It is tied up with restrictive, punitive policies and narrow legislation. The consequences of criminalisation, particularly of many young people, leads to life-changing disadvantages including being denied travel to certain countries, employment in some jobs and sometimes, the loss of supports from communities and friends. The Government is far behind the curve on this issue, particularly in the use of medicinal cannabis. The introduction of the medical cannabis compassionate access programme in 2017 was very welcome. However, that notable victory mostly belongs to Vera Twomey and her incredible fight for access to medical cannabis for her daughter Eva. Without her courageous stance against the system that denied her daughter access to medication that worked for her, this programme would not have come about. To continue this struggle, we believe it is essential that this compassionate programme includes the widest range of medical conditions, including the relief of chronic pain. The other essential component in improving things and facing societal change is the convening of a citizens' assembly on drugs. Sinn Féin totally agrees about this. We believe such an assembly should be held as quickly as possible and that the Government should fix a date for its inauguration. I also want to raise the treatment of dual diagnosis. The existing model of care for people with dual diagnosis is appalling. A person with a dual diagnosis is one person who is engaging in substance abuse and has a mental health issue. Many ask for support for addiction, only to be told they must sort out their medial illness first, while many ask for mental health supports, only to be told to stop using substances despite their lives being out of control and that substance being the only support they feel they have in the whole world. Falling between mental health conditions and alcohol or drug addiction, they are shown a revolving door. Funding must be forthcoming and €4 million is totally inadequate. Programmes for drug and alcohol use must be combined and client centred. Finally, we would like to see the examination of a model similar to that in Portugal for Irish law. Again, I call on the Minister of State to initiate the setting up of a citizens assembly on drugs. I fully support the motion and I hope all other Deputies do so.

It is a huge topic. A person would need two and a half hours rather than two and a half minutes to try to address some of the issues. The drug crisis is something that I have seen in the community in which I grew up in the north-east inner city and in the community I moved to in west Dublin. In some ways, there is a common denominator in both communities. They are working class with large pockets of disadvantage with poverty, unemployment, early school-leaving and decades of trauma. Mostly, it is young working-class people who are criminalised even though drug use is widespread in the entire population. We can never underestimate the extent of drug use. It is in every town, village, club, bar and sports club. Now, more than 40 years since Ireland experienced its first wave of drugs in the early 1980s, it is worse than ever. While heroin use might have reduced, along with its impacts, crack cocaine is the most dangerous drug we face in the coming weeks. I recently read a report on Ballymun on this which is utterly frightening. However, I remain optimistic that we can turn the corner in drug abuse and misuse but we need to change the way it is tackled. First, we need to talk about funding. Funding is critical. The organisations on the ground need the funding that has been cut from them over the past ten years or so. However, one transformative thing we can do is to recognise in the law that people who are using drugs are not criminals and should not be criminalised. If we are genuinely to treat drug addiction as a health issue, then we need to provide the services to support people and not jail them for the possession of drugs. That serves no purpose whatever. If it served a purpose, it would have worked. We can see that it has failed miserably.  There are people who are not here today because injection centres have not been delivered. There are hundreds of those people. We need to deliver that as quickly as possible. Finally, I commend every person who is out there on the front line in services fighting every single day and also the families who are with them fighting against drug addiction. We need to support them. This is a timely motion on how we go about doing that.

He is a comrade of mine who, like myself, has worked in addiction services right across Dublin over the years. In all those years we have seen so many of our citizens fall between the cracks. The culture of drugs use has changed. Years ago, people who took drugs had a primary drug of choice but polydrug use is now the norm. It is almost impossible to get a detox bed if you are a polydrug user. The bar for getting into treatment is set very high. Going cold turkey is not an option for people who consume large amounts of alcohol or benzodiazepines because to stop taking them straight away could be fatal. We need to reimagine how people can enter treatment.  But any changes in legislation must be matched by resourcing our communities. If the law was changed tomorrow and we were sending people to treatment rather than prison, it would not work because the resources and the services are just not there. Years of underinvestment by successive Governments has seen to this. Community drug projects cannot strategically plan as resources do not allow. We must put in the resources to allow our communities to respond. We also need to have an adult conversation around dual diagnosis. We need to have a no-wrong-door policy for people with dual diagnosis of addiction and mental health.  While we are talking about decriminalisation, what is a crime is that the only inpatient dual diagnosis facility in the State, Keltoi, has been closed for over two years. I have had many discussions with the Minister of State on this. I will not second-guess any reshuffle that might take place after the new Taoiseach takes office but if the Minister of State is one of those to move, I would ask him that as his parting shot, he do the right thing and reopen Keltoi as a matter of urgency. That needs to happen. We fully support a citizens' assembly on drug use but we must make sure our young people voices are heard there. The Department of Health held a consultation to gather the views of young people recently. They have asked to make sure that their voices are heard at any future citizens' assembly. We must not lose the youth voice on this debate.

Over the past 25 years, almost ten people a week have died in the State as a result of drug taking. Along with Sweden, Ireland has the joint highest rate of drug-induced deaths among those aged 16 to 64 years in the European Union. Deputy Martin Kenny already mentioned that. The harmful affects of drug abuse, including crimes of violence, intimidation and extortion of addicts, their families and communities used to be confined to the inner city and working-class suburbs. Now the effect is felt in all our rural towns and villages. Sinn Féin believes that harm reduction and prevention should be the guiding principles in the development of future drug and alcohol strategies. Our alternative budget pledged over ten times the amount proposed by the Government, €45 million compared with a paltry €4 million. The Government's policies on drugs are not working because of its indifference or, worse, its negligence. The national drug strategy is a list of missed targets despite the best efforts of the various agencies. Deputy Martin Kenny also mentioned how Sinn Féin has called for a citizens' assembly to discuss this issue. We supported the introduction of the medicinal cannabis compassionate access programme because we want those patients who can safely benefit from cannabis-based treatments to do so.We believe this programme must be reviewed and extended to include the widest appropriate range of medical conditions, including chronic pain. The number of people prosecuted for possession for personal use has increased almost fivefold over the past 25 years, with more than 250,000 convictions in this category. We need to focus on treating addiction as a healthcare issue first. We need to treat the root causes of drug abuse. It is no accident that the effects are felt more deeply in working-class areas, which are suffering from years of Government neglect and where there is little to occupy idle hands. In these areas, the rate of leaving certificate completion has dropped significantly, never mind getting inside the door of a third level institution. The lack of education results in a vicious circle involving imprisonment. The stigma associated with having been imprisoned leads to difficulties in securing employment and, as a result, to even more prison time. We need to break the cycle of intergenerational incarceration and support those in prison to free themselves from addiction and educate themselves so they can remain free from both prison and addiction.

It is important and I am delighted we have the opportunity to speak about the matter. It is often said, and has been said several times today in the Chamber, that the war on drugs has failed. All of us with good intentions see that it has failed in that it has not done anything to alleviate the suffering of affected communities. When I think of this, I think of the Latin phrase "Qui bono?", which loosely translates as "Who benefits?". Who actually benefits from the so-called war on drugs initiated by US President Ronald Reagan in the 1980s? It is certainly not the communities in the north inner city that I grew up in and represent, nor is it the communities destroyed across Ireland, the UK and America as a consequence of the current approach. The legal profession has benefited from the war on drugs. Consider the circumstances of an addicted young person who has grown up in my constituency and who has been arrested several times for the consumption of something that is ostensibly taken to deal with trauma, addiction and pain. Consider also the number of people imprisoned for the possession of heroin or crack cocaine. When arrested, be it once, twice or three times, they usually have in their possession an amount of drug worth no more than a couple of hundred euro. The drug becomes monetised, as does the person's suffering and pain, meaning he is brought to the courts. His solicitor gets paid and a judge and barrister also get paid. The person is brought to prison and the couple of hundred euro all of a sudden becomes the €82,000-plus that it costs to incarcerate a person in this country. In prison, the individual probably receives the treatment he or she should have got beforehand, but that also costs money. The doctors cost money. The couple of hundred euro worth of drug the person had in his possession to deal with trauma, suffering and pain is all of a sudden magnified into hundreds of thousands of euro to the benefit of a class of people who do not reflect the community he came from. I sometimes ask myself whether the war on drugs has failed or does what neoliberalism always does, that is, monetise poverty and pain. The latter has continued for the past four to five decades. It will continue unless we call stop, call it insanity and point to the very reason we must fight so hard just to have what is medical best practice when it comes to the decriminalisation of drugs. The reason we have not done it yet is that a class of people benefit, but I promise it is not the class of people being discussed today. Until we establish that, we will not combat the problem. Therefore, let us just call it out for what it is. There is no war on drugs; there is a war on poverty, but not in the way we imagine it should be done. There is a war to continue as we are doing because people benefit from it. The beneficiaries are not those who suffer. We have to call it out. When we think about models that work, we hear a lot about the Portuguese one. I am aware that Deputy Feighan is approaching the middle of his term as Minister of State responsible for drugs. I would love him to tell me whether he believes the model in this country, which we often describe as healthcare led, works. We cannot have a healthcare-led model while still criminalising people at a basic level. When the Minister of State reflects on this, regardless of whether his role is to change, I will be interested in hearing whether he believes the Portuguese model works. It has its flaws, of course, but I want to know whether the Minister of State believes it is a better model than ours. What are his measurements for success in this regard? The Portuguese model results in fewer convictions and takes more people in the throes of addiction out of their pain into recovery. It results in fewer young people becoming addicted at the level in question and fewer recorded as having offences. Why have we not implemented this model? I believe I already know the answer. I support the citizens' assembly, as does everybody else in this Chamber. In 2023, I hope we will have many experts around the table with citizens and they will tell us what a body of evidence that is probably decades old indicates: criminalising people for addiction does not work. That will be true in 2023 but it was true in 1993, when the evidence also existed. Despite the evidence, we still have not done what I suggest. Even though centre-right parties, including Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil, tell us they are now more progressive in their outlook and despite our hearing about expert-led activity and medical best practice, the Minister of State will still stand here today and say that, while the Government will not oppose the motion introduced by the Labour Party and supported by all of us, it will not do anything about it. Next year, despite the fact that this motion will have been passed, people will still be injecting themselves with a poison or taking crack cocaine to deal with trauma and they will be looking over their shoulders because gardaí who will have been taken away from essential duties or from addressing burglaries will be sent down laneways to catch them to incarcerate them and put them through a process that generates huge amounts of money for those who do not live in the communities that suffer. This is because we fail to do what is right and medically and scientifically proven. The hypocrisy of it. I roll my eyes to the back of my head when a politician says he smoked a joint in college and congratulates himself. We pat such a person on the back, put him on the front of magazines and state how cool he is, but he is safe and protected because he comes from a class of people who are protected from the criminalisation that would apply to a person from the north inner city who said he took drugs when younger. The latter would be considered a criminal. Politicians and those from middle-class professions who say they did of course smoke a joint in college are not criminalised for it and do not get a lifelong conviction that would affect the type of job they might get. The hypocrisy of it is scandalous. I want to talk about a compassion-led approach to drug addiction. The first step is to take the hypocrisy away from it and call it for what it is. The current approach generates considerable revenue for people who are not in the communities in question, yet the Government will do nothing after it allows this motion to be passed. It is absolutely scandalous. If we do rejig the Ministries, another Minister of State will probably come in and do nothing also. We will patronise the affected communities, saying we have invested so much in them. What will be the outcome? I guarantee the money invested in communities will not be the same as the amount by which middle-class communities will benefit through their work in the legal profession and everywhere else. Poverty pays but it does not pay the people who suffer. It pays other people. It makes meal tickets. We know that, as do the communities and people who are affected. Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil Ministers know it too, as do those in the legal profession. Until we call truth on this, the war on drugs will be a war on poverty. We will all say the war on drugs has failed but it has not; it has succeeded in that we have made wealth out of it and monetised poverty. Until we call that truth for what it is, we are just lying to ourselves and patronising communities. We are saying we have invested so much but we have sustained the problem. The income keeps flowing into the more middle-class communities, which actually benefit from the suffering and trauma of other people. It is absolutely scandalous.

He has a good track record in dealing with the issues surrounding drug reform, which is very welcome. Reading the motion, you do not know whether to cry in despair or keep your head up pushing for reform. It is a damning indictment of successive Governments that what has occurred has been allowed to happen.It is extremely sombre to consider that 10,000 people have died of drug-related causes over the past 25 years. These were people's brothers, sisters, mams, dads, other family members and friends. Addiction is very complicated and it can be messy. I am sure lots of those people could still be alive today if there had been a different policy. I am sure of that. I had friends who definitely would be alive today if not for the marginalisation and social deprivation they experienced. When people experiencing addiction also experience the depths of despair, it is one way to hell. That is what individuals, families and communities have suffered. As I said, some of those who succumbed to addiction could still be alive today if there had been a different policy in place. I am 100% certain of that. If we look at different jurisdictions around the world, particularly Portugal, people are being saved. If we can save one life, it is worth changing the law. It is worth fighting for that. The Government has paid a lot of lip service to having a health-led approach. That terminology is welcome but the question is whether it counters situations in which people find themselves, whereby they are criminalised, brought through the criminal justice system and marginalised. In fact, it simply does not work. The evidence shows we need a different kind of narrative around this issue. The availability of drugs since the 1970s has increased incrementally, not only in Ireland but across the world. The market for drugs is worth hundreds of billions of dollars every year. Our current laws, which originated 42 years ago, are not a deterrent against people taking or supplying drugs. More than 80% of the people in our prisons at this time are there for drug-related crime. They take in the whole pyramid of activity, from the very top to the very bottom. This tells us the current laws do not work. We need to do something different. We can talk about a health-led approach, harm reduction and all of that, but there needs to be a change. Attitudes in this country have changed dramatically. We need only look at what has happened in the past ten to 15 years in regard to women's right to choose and same-sex marriage. There have been social advancements in Ireland but, sometimes, this House has not moved on. People's attitudes to drug reform have changed. They do not see criminalising people for personal drug use as legitimate. There must be a different approach. This House is way behind public opinion on the issue. The days of prohibition and the Misuse of Drugs Act, which, as I said, is 42 years old, are coming to an end. We must do something very different and that starts with changing the laws around drug use. I do not know whether the Minister of State will still be in office in six weeks' time. We might have a new Minister of State. Policy in this area emanates from political choice. Why have successive Governments allowed what has happened to continue? Those Governments have largely been made up of Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil. The question I always ask when considering the issues dealt with in the motion is why this has been allowed to happen. There are vested interests and so forth but, at the end of the day, there is no political will or courage to change what is happening. This is largely affecting working-class communities. The vast majority of people who have died are from certain postcodes in Dublin and certain areas elsewhere in the country. They are largely working-class people. If this was happening to people in a different postcode in Dublin, there would be a completely different response. If we do not have political will on this issue, people do not have a voice. Those who have succumbed to all this horribleness around addiction have been let down by successive Governments and a lack of political will. That can be changed and the change can be achieved in this House. We need political will from the Government to say that this can no longer continue and something very different must be done. We need to look at other countries that are changing their models around drug reform. After decades of doing things that do not work, they have recognised there must be a changed approach. Countries in Europe are changing their policies, as are the US, Canada, countries in Asia and even countries in South America, which have been terribly affected by drug wars. They have realised the status quo does not work. As long as that status quo continues, people will be criminalised and people will die. Why allow that to happen? There is a tiny percentage of people who have enriched themselves through massive profits from the drug trade. What comes with that is the grotesque violence to which communities are subjected. We must do something. The days of the Misuse of Drugs Act are coming to an end. It may take another couple of years to make a real change but we must look upon the past four or five decades as an absolute failure. If we act now, future generations will say that at least the current generation did something about the madness that happened in the previous four decades.

I thank the Labour Party for bringing forward this motion. This is my first opportunity since being elected to the Dáil to speak about drugs and the plight of those who have an addiction to drugs. There is more than one part to this issue but first, and most important, are the victims, young and old, who have succumbed to the use of drugs and been caught up in addiction. Their situation is terrible. For families in which a son, daughter, brother or sister has developed an addiction, whether to alcohol or drugs, it creates devastation within that family and the family network. Often, there is a feeling of helplessness in trying to deal with it and wondering how to advise because it is a very complicated issue, as other speakers noted. Drug addiction is a killer and it is killing people in this country. What is more worrying is that it is becoming more common in modern times. When my children were in secondary school, they could tell me who was dealing drugs in their school and who was taking drugs. They had that knowledge. Thanks be to God they never got involved in that and nor did any other of my family members. Drugs are prevalent now everywhere in this country, including rural parishes, such as the one in which I live, towns and cities. Drug-taking is not confined to the big cities; it is widespread. There is a kind of general acceptability that this can happen. The villains in all of this are the drug lords and others who sell the drugs and manipulate the minds of those who are addicted in order to make profit. There is something wrong when a young person can tell me who is dealing drugs today in Tuam or wherever. They can tell me how and where it is being done. There is frustration that the policing of all of this seems to be helpless in bringing these people to court. There is always an effort to target the supplier, but the reality is that there are a lot of people making a great deal of money out of the pain and misery of others. I wonder why that is.We have a lot of people in jail at the moment, as Deputy Gino Kenny said. He said that about 80% of those in jail are there for drug-related offences, but the majority of them could be the victims of as opposed to the people who profit from drugs. It is important that we look at how we are doing things. When you look back at the past four or five years, there has been a huge increase in drug taking. We need to increase the number of youth residential centres in the country. We do not have enough of them at present. There is a lack of dual diagnosis and a refusal to make dual diagnoses. You might have people who have depression or other illnesses who take to drugs as a solace. The sale of drugs is being done openly on the streets of our towns and villages, and there is something wrong with that. It is important to remember that babies are being born today who are addicted to drugs or alcohol because of their parents' addictions. We have a huge problem and it will take a lot of resolve it. We need to get going with it at this stage.
#MattShanahan	unknown-#MattShanahan-party	unknown-#MattShanahan-dob	unknown-#MattShanahan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-11-30 00:00:00	Ábhair Shaincheisteanna Tráthúla - Topical Issue Matters	36	I am happy to contribute to this motion from the Labour Party on decriminalisation and drugs policy. We have been speaking about a drugs crisis and drug abuse in our society for many decades. It is funny that we use the word "crisis", which suggests that something is short-term in nature, when the problem has been going on for decades as well we know. It is having a terribly destructive and detrimental effect on all parts of our society. It is largely thought that it is confined to poorer communities that are disadvantaged when in fact it is spread right across society. Those who are most vulnerable seem to pay the highest price, socially and economically. We can see the fallout of drug abuse and addiction and in our city we do not have to walk too far from this Chamber to see it in its physical form. As other Deputies highlighted, it is right across our country and drug abuse and dealing are endemic in our society, which is sad to say. Unfortunately, it is hard to know what is driving that per se because in a lot of cases it is in affluent parts of our society as well. For those who feel the sharp end of the drugs culture it robs them and their families and children of any bright future. It is largely driven by greed and we have the ignominy in Ireland of having two of the largest drug-dealing gangs in the world operating from bases in Spain but that also have significant ties to Ireland. We also have a two-tiered drug society. We have one group who think of themselves as recreational users of cannabis and cocaine. They see snorting cocaine as not being part of the drugs industry but they look at those who are injecting drugs as somehow being a major part of the problem. Unfortunately, everything is part of the problem because it is adding to this conflagration of drugs that is rampaging across our society. If you speak to psychologists and psychiatrists, they will say they are seeing problems with cannabis use, particularly among the youth, and that paranoia and extreme psychosis are becoming problems for young teenagers who are just dabbling in cannabis. Yet, cannabis is not considered by many to be a gateway drug. We have a significant amount of work to do on our drugs policy in this country. The citizens' assembly on drugs has to happen as a matter of urgency. We need to get a better defined sense of public opinion on what the problems are and what our population thinks the Government and State can do in terms of adequate responses. Criminalising people for possessing small amounts of drugs seems a retrograde step. We must do something in the area of education. For anybody who spends any time watching television, there is a programme on Netflix which shows the fallout of drug abuse across the north-eastern United States, particularly in Hyannis Port and Cape Cod. One of the things that is stark in that programme is the affluence of the families involved. These families are engaged in sport and have high achievers who started dabbling in drugs, particularly cannabis, at the early stage. They ultimately ended up at the far end of the spectrum taking opioids. That is because if you are dealing with drug dealers, they will present you many options. People who are dabbling in drugs will ultimately move from one thing to another. First and foremost, we need far better education and teeth in the judicial system going after the high-level dealers and the importers of hard drugs.

I have heard different speakers talking about people taking drugs, the number of deaths there have been and the fact that they feel that if taking drugs was legalised, this would not happen. It is hard to figure that one out in my mind. I was in the centre of Dublin city recently. That is a rare thing because usually we are up here during the day, but I was here at night and it was shocking to see what was going on down side streets in our capital. I am not a person to have much fear, but I was looking over my shoulder continuously. If we legalise it, will matters get better? I have my doubts. It is important to raise in the Dáil the subject of medicinal cannabis and the difficulties relating to it. Everybody knows the story of Vera Twomey. I worked closely with her to get medicinal cannabis for her daughter, as did our Rural Independent Group, but the only other Member who put his neck on the line was Deputy Gino Kenny. He worked very hard to make sure that the child got the medicinal cannabis oil she needed. To say the least, it was shocking to see the lengths to which Vera Twomey had to go in order to get something that would help her child legalised. We are talking about making drugs more acceptable in law. At the time in question, which is not that long ago, we were fighting to make it more simple for a mother to save her child's life. How many more people with multiple sclerosis and other ailments who need medicinal cannabis are finding it difficult to access? That is the legal side of medicinal cannabis. Vera won her battle for Ava. I take this opportunity to wish Ava a happy birthday. She turned 13 four days ago. The battle relating to her case led to her mother shedding blood, sweat and tears. For any woman to have gone through the Trojan effort she made for her daughter and others is something that should never be forgotten in this State. It is seldom I get a chance to read a book. I would advise anybody who is on about medicinal cannabis or anything else to read For Ava, the book that was compiled by her mother on the fight that she and Ava's father, Paul, undertook to save their daughter’s life. Somebody mentioned smoking joints earlier and how something like this might be opposed and that anyone who opposed it should smoke a joint. Sometimes I find that attitude difficult because I have never smoked a joint in my life. I never felt I needed to do that. I used to have great fun when we used to hit the streets long ago for a few drinks. It was innocent fun and it seems to me that we are taking on each level and accepting new and heightened levels. We accept alcohol use and a certain amount of drug use, but where will it stop? I would like to know where this is going to stop and if it will add extra pressure to a system that is already overly pressurised. A gentleman came into my clinic recently in Skibbereen. He was stressed because he had been caught growing cannabis for his own use. He was strong in asking that I would air the view in the Dáil that at least he was not supplying it in the locality. The law of the land is there, and there is not much I can do when the laws are the way they are. I advise people to look at Vera Twomey's story, which is more interesting than any other part of the debate.

Setting up a citizens' assembly seems to be the fashionable thing to do for every issue. I do not believe in that. There is plenty of evidence available regarding drug use and abuse in our country. It is shocking and we all know it. Deputy Michael Collins mentioned O'Connell Street in Dublin, but I can go to towns and villages in my constituency and the problem is there.Nothing has been done to tackle the suppliers and the so-called gangs that are looked up to. They manipulate, use and destroy young people's lives and the lives of their families. They are glamorised and glorified. We see the proliferation of that right throughout the country, and we must deal with it. We must deal with all drugs, including alcohol, and their overuse. Many of us, myself included, can overindulge, so we must look at ourselves and our own practices and what we are giving to people as well. As regards the Garda and seizures, €34 million worth of drugs were seized in the first nine months of this year. That is only the tip of the iceberg in terms of what is coming through. This murky business is very lucrative. The judicial system does not seem to be able to cope. Whereas the Garda does sterling work and brings people before the courts, as is the case in respect of many matters, the judicial system has not caught up. It is way behind in many areas, by decades if not a century, compared with what it should be. I do not say that we should lock people up and throw away the key. We must have drug support workers, but there are no supports other than the likes of C-SAW in Clonmel and Tipperary town, voluntary organisations and private counselling. I recently raised the sale and use of drugs on O'Connell Street and adjoining streets, lanes and car parks in Clonmel. Ordinary shoppers are being intimidated, and there is a lack of gardaí. The Tipperary division is short of gardaí and the drug squad is operating on reduced numbers. For a time, we did not have anyone in the drugs squad in Clonmel. Now we have one or two officers who do good work, but we just do not have enough. They do not have supports and when they go through the revolving doors of the courts they meet the offenders back out on the streets. They are on continual bail and continual free legal aid. We must wake up and smell the coffee. We must provide support. Sadly, the HSE is lacking in staff. Positions are vacant all over my area in south Tipperary. Some positions in north Tipperary have not been filled for years. We can employ managers and anybody we like but we do not have the personnel who are so badly needed, who are dedicated and will help families. I support all the voluntary groups and also some ordinary individuals who get involved and try to help. I salute Deputy Michael Collins and the efforts he made with Vera Twomey. Our group assisted where we could. I wish Ava a happy birthday. We can see the battle she went through for medicinal purposes. The Minister had to be dragged, kicking and screaming, and then the medication had to be sourced abroad and it had to be signed off by two consultants. That is so difficult and so arduous. The Minister of State, Deputy Feighan, was in Clonmel yesterday launching a strategy. It is not easy to be in the constituency on a Dáil sitting day. We are elected to be here to legislate. A lot must be done here, and I do not think another talking shop of a citizens' assembly will sort it out. We need dedicated action. All the pious platitudes in the world, and even legislation, are worthless if we do not have the Garda and the agencies to support people who might slip into the pattern of drug use and need assistance. We do not have counsellors to help them and their families. It is pointless passing legislation here and changing it if we do not have the resources to help people.

It is the start of a conversation that must go much deeper than what is outlined in the motion. I will explain that in a moment. I seek a commitment from the Minister of State that a citizens' assembly on drugs will be put place in the first quarter of next year. If it is the case that one is to set up, a motion to formalise the position must come before the Oireachtas in early January. That would allow the citizens' assembly to move forward. I hope it could start its work in March or April of next year. We know that people in all walks of life use drugs and can be affected by addiction, but the evidence is clear that there is a strong and consistent link between serious drug problems and poverty. Therefore, there is a need to frame our discussions on drug policy in the context of a broader response to addressing poverty, inequality and marginalisation, and to provide the resources in communities to do this. Evidence tells us that making someone a criminal for using drugs brings no benefits, causes significant harms and results in stigma and discrimination. There is a need to consider whether the current legal framework under which substances are prohibited and people using drugs are criminalised is working for communities or is causing further harm. When we set up a citizens' assembly on drugs, we need a commitment to include the voices of people who have been most impacted by the drugs problem. That is crucial. I will read a synopsis of a submission from the group, Youth Workers Against Prohibition. This is where the conversation has to go. The synopsis states:At present youth workers are supporting over 380,000 young people in communities across the country. We see first-hand, on a daily basis, the untold damage that criminalising young people has on their life opportunities in Ireland.[...]We fully support decriminalisation but we feel it does not go far enough to tackle the issues we see. Decriminalisation of all drug possession and cultivation for personal use is an important first step, but it will still leave the supply of drugs in the control of criminal gangs, and young people will still be at risk using unknown, unregulated substances.The time has come to have an adult conversation about the need to regulate all drugs, (not just caffeine, alcohol and tobacco), and to create a model that keeps our young people in Ireland safe.[...]Under the current policy of prohibition, the drugs market is run by criminal gangs who operate through fear, intimidation, and the exploitation of youth. Under prohibition there is, and always will be, a thriving unregulated drug market and the longer we continue to hold on to the illusion of beating it, the longer we will have to see young people, families and communities suffer the consequences.

That is with one possible reservation, which is the reference to a citizens' assembly. It seems that there is an unusual degree of agreement in this Chamber. I understand that the Government is not bringing forward a countermotion. Why can we not just deal with the issue? Why do we have to have a citizens' assembly to prompt us to deal with every single difficult issue when we are essentially an assembly of citizens elected, for a finite period, to represent other citizens? Could we just deal with this issue? I do not think anybody would disagree with that. There might be disagreement as to how we deal with it, but it is something that we must deal with. I had the benefit of studying law at University College Cork, UCC. I was taught jurisprudence by Tim Murphy, who was an excellent lecturer. He concentrated very much on contemporary schools of jurisprudence. From that perspective, he wrote a very short book that was published the year I left UCC. I obviously read his book, which informed my thinking very much from then on. It is called Rethinking the War on Drugs in Ireland and it was published in 1996. Ireland was a different place in 1996, as Deputy Paul Donnelly, outlined earlier. Inner-city communities were ravaged by drugs. However, the problem of drug abuse was pretty much contained in inner cities. The Henry scene - the party scene - was going in Cork and middle class students were taking drugs, but they were not being stigmatised in the way that people in poorer communities were, but drugs were beginning to move out into the broader community. Since then, I have seen many successes of the war on drugs: the Collopys, and the McCarthy-Dundons were just learning their trade on the streets of Limerick at that time. They went on to become major drug dealers. The Garda took them on and put them away. George "The Penguin" Mitchell was jailed. John Gilligan was jailed. The Kinahans are now on the run. Has all of this led to the war on drugs being won? Are there no more drugs on our streets? No, there are far more drugs on our streets, and they are in every community in Ireland. They are in every village in Ireland now - Bodyke, Scariff - every town and village in Ireland now has a thriving drugs trade. I question the waste of Garda resources chasing these people. They are evil and the trade is very much in their hands, and they are making money out of it, but the answer is not to continue to chase them, it is to take the trade out of their hands, to legalise drugs and to deal with the fact that there is a huge and growing market for drugs. That is a health issue, and it must be dealt with in the same way that we deal with the appetite and demand for every other substance - cigarettes, alcohol, etc., instead of fighting a losing war, which we are very clearly losing, despite the best efforts of the Garda. I commend Deputy Ó Ríordáin and the motion, but I would like to see action in the House.

I commend the Labour Party on using its Private Members' slot for this motion. I also commend an Teachta Gino Kenny on the introduction of his Bill last week. They are all positive measures on this important issue and, crucially, they create the space for discussions to take place in this House. I speak as a representative of the people of Clare but also as a mother, sister, daughter and someone whose partner has been impacted by this issue. I know at first hand the negative consequences of criminalisation, namely, the lasting effects, the anxiety, the shame, the fear and the isolation that come with it, not to mention the stigma. The number of people prosecuted for possession for personal use has increased over the past 25 years by 484%, with more than 250,000 convictions. Criminalisation simply has not worked, end of, and there is the social cost of relying on punitive measures that do not deter drug use. They drain services that could be invested in evidence-based services and, in some cases, they have forced these users into the Prison Service, which, as we have known for many years, is a school of criminality. Behind the user there is more to the story. There may be physical health issues, trauma, mental health problems or abuse. Criminalisation does not address these issues. The medical cannabis access programme, MCAP, when introduced, was a positive move but it is far too restrictive, especially when compared with approaches in other high-income countries. Thousands of people on this island who suffer with chronic pain, for example, still cannot get access. Instead, they are criminalised. Ireland now has the joint highest rate of drug-induced deaths among 16 to 64-year-olds in the European Union, whereas countries throughout the world are expanding the decriminalisation of drugs. Portugal led the way, as we know, and 20 years later, 31 countries have decriminalised drug possession for personal use in some way, so Ireland would not be an outlier. We need the immediate establishment of a citizens' assembly on drugs and a commitment for it to commence its work in January.

In particular, I thank the Labour Party for providing time for the debate. The Government is fully committed to a health-led approach to the drugs issue and believes that people with problematic drug and alcohol use issues should be treated with compassion and care. As Deputies will be aware, the programme for Government includes a commitment to convening a citizens' assembly to consider matters relating to drug use. The Government is committed to establishing a citizens' assembly on drug use, along with one on the future of education, at the earliest opportunity in 2023, following the completion of the workload in which the assemblies are currently engaged. The timelines and terms of reference of the next assemblies will ultimately be a matter for the Oireachtas to agree on. It is anticipated the Government will consider the matter early in the new year, following which motions will be put before Dáil Éireann and Seanad Éireann setting out timelines and terms of reference for the new assemblies. The Department of Health has commenced preparations for the citizens' assembly on drug use. Discussions regarding the assembly have taken place at meetings of the national oversight committee for the national drugs strategy. The Government is very positive about the potential contribution of the citizens' assembly to its health-led response to drug use. Drug use affects all members of society, whether directly or indirectly, and imposes significant social and financial costs. Involving citizens in decision-making on drugs policy is, therefore, appropriate. There are two issues, in particular, that the citizens' assembly on drug use could consider, namely, how better to meet the diverse health needs of people who use drugs and how to prevent the harmful impact of drugs on children, families and communities. It would also be beneficial to have an international component to the citizens' assembly in order that there will be an exchange of good practices from the British-Irish Council work sector on drugs and the EU's drugs strategy and action plan, especially with regard to alternative approaches to coercive sanctions. The voices and perspectives of young people on issues regarding drugs policy should also inform the deliberations of the citizens' assembly on drug use. Officials from the Department of Health are engaged with their counterparts in the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth to undertake a consultation with young people on this issue. The Government is committed to pursuing a health-led approach for people in possession of drugs for personal use through the health diversion programme. The programme will divert people caught in possession of drugs for personal use away from the criminal justice system and connect them with the health services. The health services will provide assessment and onward referral as necessary to provide a pathway to recovery and to allow participants to avoid criminal convictions, which can have far-reaching consequences, particularly for younger people. This health-led approach is reflected not only in the roll-out of the health diversion programme but also in other alternatives to coercive sanctions that are currently in place, including the drug treatment court and the drug treatment services of the Probation Service. A health diversion programme implementation group, chaired by the Department of Health, is finalising plans for the commencement of the programme, including legislative amendments and operational procedures. To support the establishment of the programme, the HSE is expanding its capacity to provide support, ask and assess, offer assistance and refer, SAOR, screening and support for people who are found in possession of any drugs for personal use. I emphasise the points the Minister of State, Deputy Feighan, made in his opening remarks regarding funding for the national drugs strategy. It has increased significantly over the past three years and budgets 2021, 2022 and 2023 allocated an additional €21 million to expand the provision of drug and alcohol services, both residential and community based. Budget 2023 also provides an uplift of €3.5 million in core funding for community-based drug and alcohol services to maintain the existing levels of service. This is the first increase in core funding since 2013. It is also a priority in the national drugs strategy to develop integrated care pathways and harm reduction responses for high-risk drug users who have complex health and social needs that make them vulnerable to drug overdose and, possibly, premature death. As we know, drugs can have a wide-ranging and devastating effect on communities, which can exacerbate underlying issues of poverty and social exclusion. The Government is committed to a joined-up, cross-departmental approach in addressing the complex issues faced by communities, and drug and alcohol task forces have an important role to play in supporting the response to drugs at a community level. The drug-related intimidation and violence engagement, DRIVE, initiative is an interagency response to tackle drug-related intimidation and violence in communities that are most impacted. It is led by the drug and alcohol task forces in conjunction with An Garda Síochána, the Probation Service, the HSE, family support services and civil society organisations. The initiative has been funded by the Department of Health for a three-year period. To support the roll-out of the DRIVE initiative, funding of €250,000 was allocated in budget 2023. This funding will support its work programme including the development of a suite of training and capacity-building resources, a national DRIVE liaison network, a shared learning network and referral pathways to support victims, awareness raising, community initiatives, targeted interagency programmes and a national data collection system. The Government is committed to the establishment of a supervised injecting facility in Dublin city centre. We have passed legislation and provided resources for this harm-reduction and life-saving service. We have identified Dublin city centre as the optimal location to pilot this service, based on the concentration of drug-related deaths in the area. The establishment of the service is subject to the granting of planning permission by An Bord Pleanála. The supervised injecting facility is an important public health response to drug-related death and illnesses and will offer a compassionate, person-centred service that will reduce the harm associated with injecting drug use and can help people access appropriate services. The facility will bring drug injecting into a medically controlled and supervised setting, with health and other benefits for vulnerable individuals. It will also reduce the negative impact of public injecting and drug-related litter on local communities and businesses. We cannot be complacent about the dangers of drug use to individuals, their families and their wider communities. The Government is committed to implementing a health-led approach that is person-centred and compassionate. The forthcoming citizens' assembly on drug use will provide an opportunity to take stock of drugs policy and to identify further improvements for the next drugs strategy.

This is an incredibly important motion and I commend my party colleague Deputy Ó Ríordáin on bringing so many people along with him on this over the years.It has been a passion of his and something for which he has been fighting for many years in our Labour Party based on his knowledge and personal experience. It is now on the floor of the Dáil in advance of a citizens' assembly. Really, however, we need to educate and get the message out that our current policies on drug abuse in Ireland simply are not fit for purpose. They do not work. They are not compassionate. Simply put, they are failing society and failing so many people. One thing I want to stress today as somebody who comes from a rural county is that this is not an issue just for urban centres. This is an issue in every village, town and county of Ireland. I say that with some experience. It is in my own village. It is in the local clubs in my own town. It is everywhere. Young people in particular now are taking drugs in a way that is very different from before. Many of them play sports and find that taking certain forms of drugs gives them a high rather than taking huge volumes of alcohol. What happens then is they develop an addiction. The way in which we are dealing with this issue needs to change. The idea that 10,000 people are arrested every year for personal drug use is absolute madness. I represent Templemore. If the Minister of State were to talk to any gardaí, they would tell him it is a waste of resources. They do not even want to be doing it. They feel sorry for the people. We really need to change policy. We need a change in policy that shows compassion but also deals with this in a realistic way. This is not about arresting people. We have seen changes in recent times with regard to criminalisation and the three strikes rule. That is a move in the right direction but that is not working either. It is not working for people who are addicted to various different types of drugs. Ultimately, this motion is about people. It is important to get the message out that this does not mean we are legalising drugs. Those who engage in criminal activities need to be prosecuted in accordance with the laws in every shape and fashion. This is about the ordinary users. What is the point in arresting them? What is the point in doing it as a criminal justice issue? This is about health. It is about looking after people in a more humane way, which requires a complete change in policy. We need to get that across to the people because I believe, at this stage, they will wholeheartedly support it.

I thank colleagues across the House for the strong support that has been shown today for this important motion. I commend my colleague Deputy Ó Ríordáin, who is also our justice spokesperson. Long before he was our justice spokesperson, however, he led for us on the policy of decriminalisation and on bringing people with him to ensure we see a more practical, compassionate, humane and evidence-based approach to drug policy in this country. I also commend Labour Youth, our youth wing, which has been to the fore in leading for us on this within the party. In particular, I thank Mr. Conal O'Boyle, Mr. Hugh Murphy and Mr. James Kearney, who have really led the campaign within Labour Youth and who join us in the Gallery. I commend the many front-line support workers working in drug rehabilitation and treatment, many of whom have worked with us on shaping and supporting this motion. I thank the CityWide drugs crisis campaign, Ana Liffey Drug Project, Coolmine Drug Rehab Centre and Merchants Quay Ireland. I commend all the work that has been done there. I will also mention the Ringsend and District Response to Drugs in my own constituency. I thank all of those who work so hard to deal with and address those who are enduring addiction. This is an issue that is very close to my own heart. For many years, I practised as a barrister. I did a lot of criminal defence work and much work in the District Court. Many of my clients were themselves in addiction. Their addiction had been a pathway into criminality. I saw very close-up the immense destruction and devastation wreaked as a consequence drug addiction. I always think of one young mother I represented in court who was in and out of prison. She was convicted time after time of theft-related offences because she was stealing to feed a habit. She was in and out of prison. The only time she looked healthy was when she had spent time in prison and was securing medical support for her addiction. When I thought of the harm caused to all the victims of the crimes committed by clients of mine and others, the enormous harm to the families of those in addiction and the huge physical and mental health impacts upon those people as a result of their addiction, it certainly made me realise the need for a change in policy. What we have heard across the House today is a recognition by all of us as legislators, both in and out of Government, of the need for change in policy. It is very welcome that the Government is not opposing this motion. It is very welcome to hear the Minister of State's colleagues speak about the legislation on supervised injection facilities, which has been in place since 2017 and which was driven by my colleague Deputy Ó Ríordáin. It is very welcome to hear some lip service being given to a health-led policy to addiction by this Government. What we are not seeing is the drive and political will necessary to deliver that very necessary change in policy to a health-led, evidence-based approach and to a policy where we can decriminalise the user and see addiction as a health issue for which we can put in place the necessary State supports to bring people out of addiction and rehabilitate them, and treat addiction in a compassionate way as a health-related issue. This is an issue throughout the country, as my colleagues have pointed out. I was in County Limerick recently with Ana Liffey Drug Project, which told me that this is all across the country. We are not only seeing this in urban settings but in rural settings too. It is an issue in my constituency. I recently met with communities, businesses and households in the south inner city who have been impacted very much by the devastation wreaked by criminal gangs and drug gangs. We need to move it out of this. The war on drugs has not been won. The criminal justice approach is not achieving the necessary results for communities and individuals. We need to move to a different approach. The criminal justice approach, which is a criminalisation model, has not stopped criminal gangs from terrorising communities in urban and rural areas alike. It has not stopped people using drugs because, as our motion points out, we are seeing widespread usage. It has not stopped people dying and, indeed, the figures are very stark. More than 10,000 lives have been lost in the past 25 years in this country as a result of addiction. That is a dreadful figure we simply cannot continue to tolerate. We have moved beyond stigmatisation. We moved to a situation where we can now talk very openly about deaths due to subjects that were perhaps stigmatised in the past, such as suicide and so on. Now, however, we need to talk about how we save those lives and how we save families whose loved ones have been lost through addiction. Criminal justice policies have not prevented deaths. What they have done, unfortunately, is create unnecessary stigmatisation, particularly of young people. We are seeing so many prosecutions, arrests and convictions for possession for personal use. As others said, this is not a good use of Garda time. This is creating unnecessary stigmatisation for young people, in particular those in disadvantaged communities. In 2020 - a pandemic year - there were nearly 15,000 arrests for possession of drugs for personal use in this country. This is not the right way nor a practical or compassionate way to approach issues around addiction, which should be dealt with as healthcare policies. The Minister of State in his speech referred to what happened this year at the Electric Picnic festival in County Laois with the pilot model of adopting what was genuinely a health-led approach, which saw the HSE launch a landmark drug testing facility that enabled festivalgoers to forfeit their drugs anonymously for testing. We saw a huge media focus on this and on the various pitfalls that were predicted. The programme was successful by any measure, however. Dangerously potent substances were found in some of the samples submitted, including three entirely new psychoactive substances. The findings immediately led to three communications to festivalgoers advising them of risk. That experience speaks for itself. It speaks to how a genuine harm reduction model can save lives and provide a new and better approach to drug policy. I will finish by noting that this is not a new debate. I was a member of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality in 2015. We produced a report that again achieved cross-party consensus on the need to move to the Portugal model, about which others have spoken, with a focus on decriminalisation of the user. Let us see the Government grab the nettle and take the initiative now. Let us hear the Minister of State name a date for the setting up of a citizens' assembly. There is huge support for it across this House. He should name the date. Before Christmas, let us hear a date being set in order that we can move towards a genuine, compassionate, evidence-based and health-led approach to drug policy in this country.

It is a saga that has rumbled on for two decades. We have already seen the cost for the hospital balloon and almost double. Despite all this investment, the children of Ireland still do not have their hospital. It was supposed to be open by 2014. Then it was August 2022. Now we are told it might open in mid-2024. Ten years after it was supposed to open, we still wait with real uncertainty, even around the 2024 date. If this debacle was not bad enough, this morning we woke to more worrying news. It is reported that the Department of Health seems to believe that there will be additional funding required from the Government and that it is bracing itself for a sharp increase in costs that will push the final bill beyond €2 billion. Remember that there are some 900 claims from the developers to tune of nearly €500 million which have not yet been resolved. This whole saga has been an exercise in kicking the can down the road and God only knows where all of this will end up. Years after planning was granted, nearly three decades since the idea the children’s hospital was first proposed, and after €1.1 billion has already been spent, the Government still does not know what the final cost will be, or when the hospital will be completed. Let me be very clear on this. Ireland needs its children’s hospital. It is a vital part of our national health infrastructure but it has not yet been delivered. We have witnessed an ongoing saga of bungles, incompetence and broken promises. Meanwhile, we have 100,000 children on hospital waiting lists. This includes children waiting for ear, nose and throat, ENT, treatment, dermatology care, and those children waiting in agony for scoliosis surgery. We know that delivery of the national children’s hospital would provide the capacity needed to get these kids off waiting lists and into theatres for their life-changing operations. Still, they wait and wait, the costs of the children’s hospital go up and up, and the delay goes on and on. If anything is emblematic of this Government's inability to forward-plan and deliver modern infrastructure on budget and on time, then surely the national children’s hospital is it. There has rightly been much focus on the Government's inability to build houses, but clearly, it is not very good at building hospitals either. The question people ask is this: who sets out to build anything, no less a national hospital, with no idea of how much it will cost and no idea when it will be finished. Leanann scannal ospidéal náisiúnta na leanaí ar aghaidh agus ar aghaidh. Caithfidh muid an costas deiridh a fháil. Cathain a bheidh an t-ospidéal críochnaithe agus cathain a bheidh sé oscailte? The Government and the Minister for Health need to get their acts together. We need clarity and answers. When will the Taoiseach get to grips with this debacle? What will the final cost of the national children’s hospital be and when will it be finished and operational?

For future generations of children and the children of today it is one of the most important projects that is being managed by the National Paediatric Hospital Development Board, NPHDB, and that the Government is clearly overseeing. I am in no doubt as to the benefits to be derived for the children of Ireland from building a first class, world-class hospital which we need. That is the first point I make and it is the objective of the Government to complete this hospital. That said, this is a commercial contract and, yes, the developer has submitted a whole range of claims. Deputy McDonald has mentioned 500. Many of those claims made earlier on were not substantiated, there is arbitration and a process has been put in place. The developer or contractor may very well submit a claim, and they are entitled to do so, but equally the NPHDB, the hospital development board, is entitled to defend those claims which it considers inappropriate and which is in line with the provisions of public works contracts. The Deputy has asked me to give an estimate of the ultimate cost. That would be a mistake because if one is interested in costs, a person does not announce to the contractor the level to which one wants to go to. That is the wrong approach to take now. The approach we have taken, and I am very clear on this in government, is that we proceed to have the hospital completed and have a parallel process where if claims are made in respect of costs, they are defended by the hospital development board. In many ways I take the view that I will not go into any ballpark figures and have no intention of doing so because to do that would only disadvantage the taxpayer-----

The facility at Connolly Hospital in 2021 saw over 11,000 urgent care attendances and 13,000 outpatients. Within one year of the opening of the Connolly facility, there was a 65% reduction in general paediatric waiting lists. There are issues. The war in Ukraine and the cost of building materials will impact, as they have on all construction projects. The Deputy is correct in saying €1.1 billion of the Government’s-----

I am not just speaking about the 11,000 people we now know are on the homeless list, including many thousands of children. That is bad and shocking enough as a figure, but there are many more living in precarious accommodation, facing eviction and who do not know where they will have to move to. Last week I raised the plight of residents of a shared house in Rathmines Road in my constituency faced with an eviction notice where a landlord wishes to sell, with no inkling of where they will be able to move to. Today, I raise another group of people in my constituency, a stone's throw from where I live, in the ironically named Liberty Lane off Camden Street. I commend Kitty Holland in The Irish Times on writing of their plight this morning. I visited Liberty Lane this morning. There is a prefabricated structure that looks like a temporary office block in which 27 people live. These 27 people are being charged between €500 and €600 per month and are sharing three toilets, two showers and one kitchen in a prefab structure that is now being closed down as a fire hazard. They work and study here, and contribute to our economy. They are people from other countries who cannot source appropriate accommodation anywhere in Dublin. This is one example of the sharp end of the housing disaster.  Yesterday the Residential Tenancies Board, RTB, revealed that the rental market has shrunk by 43,000 homes in the last five years, with many landlords seeking to exit the market. That gives a clear picture of the acute and desperate crisis facing renters. There is precarious accommodation, in many cases unsuitable or inappropriate. If ours was a functioning housing system, many of those in such precarious accommodation would have been housed in public housing on public land. Instead, we saw four wasted years between 2016 and 2020, where Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael squandered prosperity and did not put investment into building the necessary homes.  What can be done now? Yesterday, our colleague, Senator Moynihan, in the Joint Committee on Housing, Local Government and Heritage asked the RTB if it could alert local authorities to renters in receipt of housing assistance payment, HAP, or rental accommodation scheme, RAS, so those individuals could be prioritised for the tenant in situ scheme. In other words, the RTB could assist councils to ensure people are saved from homelessness where there is an eviction. We got in response from the RTB a confirmation that this was not in its power to do and it was a matter for Government to make a change in policy to require it.  I raised this last week and the Taoiseach told me the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage was examining the matter of the tenant in situ scheme and whether the RTB and local authorities can work together to address the issue. Will he give us an update on the issue?

The Government is on track to meet its targets for completions this year as set out in Housing for All and could well exceed them. Supply is ultimately the most effective way to deal with the housing crisis. We need to increase supply on an annual basis of all types of housing, including cost rental, social housing by both approved social housing bodies and local authorities, affordable housing and the private market. On the issue the Deputy identified from The Irish Times story this morning by Kitty Holland, I commend the planning section of Dublin City Council on taking the necessary enforcement action. That is an enforcement issue. No one should ever be put in such accommodation------

That is an enforcement issue. I commend the council on taking action because it is dangerous. Lives could be lost in a situation like that if proper fire precautions and provisions are ignored and a fire certificate not issued. I was concerned when I read the article. I think the council is pursuing the issue and taking the necessary steps. That can happen at any time but that it happens in the context of a significant housing crisis is reprehensible. On the broader question, we have the eviction ban in place for the winter. It is significant legislation. About 17 Bills have been passed in relation to housing in the last two and a half years, substantial numbers in terms of rent and rent restrictions, restricting increases in rent to 2% and extending rent pressure zones, RPZs, across the country. On the in situ issue, the Minister has made it clear to local authorities that they can and should buy houses where somebody risks being made homeless by the sale of that home. About 600, since the Minister contacted them, have so far been purchased or are in the process of being purchased. I spoke to the Minister again this morning about that and he reiterated it. The message is clear to local authorities that they can use resources to buy houses where houses are being sold and tenants could be left homeless. This is an important piece of work.  On social housing, this year we are on target between build, lease and acquisition, hopefully, to provide 10,000 social homes. That would be a high number.

That is absolutely right and I agree with the Taoiseach on that, but the fact people were living in such circumstances shows the desperation faced by many seeking accommodation who simply cannot find decent accommodation to rent in the city because of the enormous shortfall. It is an indication of the increasing desperation of many families and individuals who cannot find a secure home. That is the problem the Government needs to address. All the legislation the Taoiseach described has not addressed that fundamental crisis and shortage. Supply is the long-term answer but let us see practical measures from Government on the tenant in situ scheme. Let us see the gap the RTB identified addressed. The Government must ensure the RTB has a direction to communicate to local authorities who is most at risk of homelessness in order that we see joined-up thinking between the RTB and local authorities in keeping people out of eviction when the winter eviction ban ends. Finally, let us see the Labour Party's renters' rights Bill adopted by Government because that would provide greater security and protection to those in the most precarious accommodation at present.

In the budget, we gave additional resources through the tax credit for renters which is beneficial. Over half of all new purchases this year were by first-time buyers, which illustrates the importance of the help-to-buy scheme and the first home scheme, which were opposed by many in this House on the Opposition side. Yet, both those schemes have helped significantly in enabling people buy their house for the first time and in terms of affordability. The issue ultimately is to build more homes of all types. The focus must be on more social homes, more affordable homes and more cost rental into the future. That means schemes like the one in Shanganagh. I hope Labour will support the upcoming planning and development foreshore (amendment) Bill which makes amendments in respect of An Bord Pleanála. There will also be an amendment in there to facilitate rapid-build social houses on public land. There will be an emergency provision enabling the Minister to do it and to accelerate the planning. I hope that we will get the support of Deputy Bacik and her party on that.

That is to say double the population of this Dáil die every year as a result of overcrowding in accident and emergency departments. However, new research in Britain has shown that this is likely to be an underestimate. The Emergency Medicine Journal found that there was a significant increase in the death rate for patients who had to spend more than five hours in an accident and emergency department. Senior clinicians have now also indicated a clear link between those who have to wait on trolleys and on chairs in accident and emergency departments and excess deaths. Thus far this year, 100,000 people have had to wait on trolleys in hospitals, which is a record level. Thus far this year, we have also seen record waiting times for people who were seriously ill, with some people waiting 13 hours for admission in hospitals. Pets in this country are currently seen quicker by vets than patients are in accident and emergency departments throughout the State. Last year 75,000 people left accident and emergency departments in this country without being seen or treated. Accident and emergency departments are such a disaster zone in these places that seriously ill people and seriously injured people who went to accident and emergency departments waited for hours and then in their thousands left without being treated whatsoever. In my area, sick people are being brought by ambulance from Navan to Drogheda to wait for hours, only to then be brought by ambulance back to Navan to be treated, such is the pressure in Drogheda at the moment. Long wait times in accident and emergency departments and the proliferation of trolleys are actually killing hundreds of people in this State. I will repeat that. Long wait times in accident and emergency departments and the proliferation of trolleys are killing hundreds of people in this State every single year. All we have seen from the Government on this is inaction. It is as if we have reached a tolerable level of death in terms of hospital overcrowding and accident and emergency department waiting times. Nobody is being held to account in HIQA. I have asked HIQA to investigate the effect that overcrowding has on excess mortality in this country but it said it was not even allowed to do that. HIQA cannot even investigate that particular issue. Worse than this, when we have accident and emergency departments such as those in Navan and Drogheda literally out the door in terms of patients, when staff are leaving the health service in their droves because of the pressure and in the middle of the winter surge, the HSE has decided to close the accident and emergency department in County Meath. This is the same HSE which has now announced a two-step plan to close the accident and emergency department in Navan, which was start on 12 December and will be completed in the new year. The HSE has given the figures to the Minister for Health a number of times over the last year. It looks like it is using the Cabinet reshuffle and the maternity leave of the Minister, Deputy McEntee, to force through its plan to close the accident and emergency department. Will the Government sit on its hands on this or will it represent the people that elected them in County Meath?

Certainly, in the last two decades and possibly the last three decades or longer, the Irish health service is actually increasing survival on all the main killers of people. With cardiac disease, cancer, stroke and chronic diseases generally such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, COPD, the outcomes are now much better than they would have been 20 years ago. The survival rates for cancer, based on the National Cancer Registry 's latest report, are very impressive. We need to be careful and balanced in our description and analysis of the Irish healthcare service. There are challenges and problems, certainly in emergency departments. However, it is wrong to give the impression that the Irish healthcare service is actually killing people. It is not doing that.

Cancer care has improved dramatically because, and I stress this point, of the concentration of services. I saw all the protests against the concentration of cancer services in regions all over this country. I saw the pickets and large meetings that people like the Deputy excel in. While people in the Deputy's position are entitled to their view, I am not sure that the position the Deputy was articulating at any given time was in the best interests of patients. I can remember petitions coming in looking to keep the cancer service in a particular local hospital and keep the heart treatment in another hospital. We now know that having concentrated cancer services through the national cancer control programme and having brought skill sets together through multidisciplinary teams, we are getting better outcomes for patients with cancer. We want to be more ambitious into the future. We are getting better outcomes for patients with heart disease. We are getting better outcomes for stroke patients with some dramatic improvements there. We need to do more on COPD and there is much more. We need to analyse who is going into emergency care and who is not. The enhanced community care programme is the way to go. We need to prevent many people going into accident and emergency departments by getting in earlier and by preventing. In my view, there is no point in senior citizens going to an emergency department which is overcrowded and which does not benefit them when they could get a better faster service and the health service is working on that. Regarding Navan and the ambulance bypass protocol, the Deputy knows that Our Lady's Hospital already has an ambulance bypass programme for patients who have suffered a stroke, heart attack and major trauma.

The Taoiseach is hiding behind the issue of patient safety when it comes to Navan's accident and emergency department. However, this is the HSE that created a warzone in University Hospital Limerick by closing the accident and emergency departments in Nenagh and Ennis. This is the HSE that has presided over the increase in adverse incidents in this country from 79,000 in 2017 to 105,000 last year. This is the HSE that has paid over €1.4 billion in negligence claims in the past ten years. This is the HSE whose plan to close Navan accident and emergency department has been condemned by dozens of clinicians who are actually working at the coalface, not managers in the HSE itself. This is the HSE which has refused to carry out a feasibility study into what it would take to provide the consultants cover in Navan accident and emergency department to make it safe. This is the HSE which struggled during the Covid pandemic because of a lack of ICU beds and is now closing ICU beds in Navan. I am asking the Taoiseach to get a grip of the HSE and stop the closure of Navan accident and emergency department.

My understanding is that there is currently a registrar with 9 am to 5 pm cover, a consultant provides out of hours cover and there are four emergency department registrar posts which have not been filled. This has resulted in the use of locum staff. These are important issues that need to be aired in my view and it-----

There is a whole range of reasons why certain hospitals, because of size, nature etc. will dictate to a large extent outside of the control of any authority where junior doctors will go into service. We need to have a more realistic debate about it. Fundamentally, if we can do it from the objective that the patient gets the best care and the best outcome, surely that is what we should all be agreed on in this House. I look forward to the debate on that.

The Minister with responsibility for immigration, Deputy Roderic O'Gorman, responded to say that we are currently providing accommodation to 64,000 people, many of whom are from Ukraine. He went on to list the 17,000 people who have come to our shores are fleeing from wars elsewhere. He listed in his response wars in Syria, Afghanistan, Ethiopia and Eritrea, from where people have come seeking international protection. The Minister failed to mention Georgia where 2,300 applicants have come in the first ten months of this year, representing a tenfold increase on 2021 figures. He failed to mention Algeria, which has seen the numbers of asylum seekers increase from less than 100 in 2021 to a staggering 1,318 for the ten months of 2022, an increase of more than 1000%. There are similar figures from Somalia, Nigeria and Albania. I am not sure if the Minister did not know the figures or if he was being deliberately misleading in his response. The Taoiseach dodged the question and he passed it to the Minister, Deputy O’Gorman, so I am asking the Taoiseach the question today. The International Protection Office, IPO, has witnessed a staggering 516% increase in new arrivals seeking asylum excluding those coming from Ukraine. That is an important figure, as these are not from Ukraine. No country can sustain such levels, particularly when we are in the midst of an unprecedented housing crisis, a massive health capacity crisis, which we have just spoken about, and a savage cost-of-living crisis. Shockingly, 3,254 persons arrived in this State undocumented in the first eight months of this year. This is from a reply I received from the Minister for Justice who admitted that these passengers had presented documentation at their point of departure but were no longer in possession of such documentation when they reached immigration services in Dublin Airport. That is a scandalous situation, and they are the figures from the Department of Justice. Every sovereign nation has right to protect its borders and every State has not only a right but a duty and obligation to balance the needs of its citizens and its communities with the needs of those who are seeking international protection. A distinguished medical consultant in Tipperary, Dr. Mary Ryan, has expressed huge concerns about our immigration policy and the impact that it is having on the already overstretched and disastrous health service, and she has called for a pause. She is a well-recognised woman. I am once again asking the Taoiseach if we can have an urgent debate in the House on this important matter or if a special committee can be established urgently to examine the impact the ongoing numbers of migrants into this country is having on our already overstretched and failing state services.

The first point I make is that we are in unprecedented times and the world is not in a good place. There is a terrible, immoral and illegal war being waged on the people of Ukraine by President Putin and by Russia, which is causing untold killing and untold damage to energy infrastructure. It has weaponised food and migration and it is causing huge uncertainty across the Continent of Europe and across the world in terms of economic development. The most fundamental outcome of the war is that so many young people are losing their lives on the front. It is quite shocking in the modern era that we are witnessing a humanitarian disaster on a scale that has not been seen since the Second World War on the Continent of Europe. Since last October, the Russians have been targeting critical energy infrastructure and water facilities. Millions of homes in Ukraine are experiencing power outages. Supply of electricity to Moldova has been affected. That is the context in which we are having this discussion. It is terrible and the result has been millions and millions of Ukrainians have left their country. Ireland has welcomed and taken in Ukrainians, along with other European members states as part of the European temporary protection directive. We have directly housed 47,000 people who are fleeing the brutal war but the State as a whole in terms of private accommodation and so on about 65,000 refugees from Ukraine and from the rest of the world have been housed directly by the State. That includes international protection. That is not easy. It is unprecedented and it is challenging. We have never before had to deal with numbers of that kind or in that volume. On the Ukrainian situation, the vast majority of people have been mothers and children. Many communities across the country and many people have opened up and welcomed Ukrainians in, given the circumstances from which they are fleeing; they are leaving family behind. It certainly creates huge pressures on our services. In my view, however, in a wartime situation like this, there is no choice here. We have to work with other European countries in respect of this. The most effective thing would be if Putin called off this war and if he stopped it. At the moment, they are trying to freeze and starve people. It is quite shocking what is going on.

We therefore need a serious examination here. The Taoiseach spuriously waited until the end of his three minutes to mention the 17,000 people who did not come from Ukraine and the many who have not come from war-affected countries. Migration both outward and inward has been a part of our nation’s history for generations and there is no denying that. There are many benefits to immigration and migration and we accept the desire of young people to get expertise and travel. Many have left our shores and have benefited from that. Many thousands of doctors and nurses have come to our shores at all levels in medicine. I was in St. Vincent’s University Hospital for six days last week and I got exceptional care in that public hospital. It was delivered by many new people from India and from all over. I want to say that they are playing a valuable role. However, we should take off the blindfold. The Taoiseach is not blindfolded and he knows better than anyone about what is coming in. It is downright unacceptable and he will not deal with it. He is part of it and he is obsessed with the word “Ukraine”. He is obsessed with it. I accept that we have to take in people from Ukraine. I am asking about the 2,300 people who came into Dublin Airport and who had no documentation. Surely, we are not a free-for-fall, or freeloaders completely and that they are not sent back. We cannot go anywhere without our passports. It is as simple as that and that is the way that it should be. We have to have respect for our people and for our communities. The Taoiseach is denying that. It is causing strife and it will cause more strife and angst if we do not deal with it.

Farmers had sought a regulator with real teeth to tackle the cartel-like behaviour of factories and others, particularly in the meat sector. The Government's draft Bill for an office for fairness and transparency was roundly criticised for lacking the necessary enforcement powers. The Minister promised that the new office would be in place by the end of 2021. That did not happen. He then promised it would be in place by summer 2022, but that did not happen either. This Bill went to Cabinet only yesterday. When will it be progressed and, crucially, will the Taoiseach give a commitment to positively consider the amendments Sinn Féin and others will bring forward to address the remaining deficiencies in the Bill and protect our family farmers and consumers in the market?

That general scheme was approved by Government in March. The Minister met with the committee, which subsequently met with other stakeholders on two separate occasions in July. The agrifood regulator that will be established under the Bill will be an office with real teeth and will be a strong advocate for farmers, fishers and all food producers. It will shine a light on the sector to help improve the position of the primary producer, will bring about greater transparency and fairness and will enforce those principles for agrifood suppliers.

I have corresponded with the Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth, Deputy O'Gorman, on the specific issue of a crèche closure in my constituency. This closure is indicative of a much broader problem, namely, that there is a real shortage of childcare and crèche places for families throughout the country. I was contacted by a family last week who were shocked to discover that their local childcare facility has a waiting list of in excess of 400. In the mums' WhatsApp group, the mother involved was advised that she should have reserved her child's place before she was 12 weeks pregnant if she wanted to secure a spot in the facility. This situation indicates the severe shortage of childcare facilities across the country. Will the changes being introduced by Government, which we have welcomed as they move us towards a more secure and publicly funded service, lead to a guaranteed preschool place for every child? Will we see the sort of equal approach to early years childcare that Labour has been advocating for so long?

More than 4,000 services have signed up for core funding. That equates to 93% of all eligible services. The aim is to get to a position where every child will be able to access a place in a crèche or childcare facility. We want to continue to advance this agenda in next year's budget in order to increase provision and achieve the targets Deputy Bacik has outlined.

More than 900 children died in the care of the nuns at Bessborough. The burial place of more than 800 of those children is unknown. The commission of investigation found that it was very likely that the remains of infants and children are on the site. I raised this point with the Taoiseach two years ago when a similar application was proposed. We now have the Institutional Burials Act 2022, which allows the Government to engage with survivors to examine the site or to ensure appropriate memorialisation. Will the Taoiseach please use the powers available under the Act to engage with survivors in respect of the site urgently, before any planning application is decided upon?

Their main concern was that the site they feel makes up the burial grounds - as the Deputy will know, the site at Bessborough is very large - should not be used for housing. If I am right, a previous application was rejected. The planning aspect is obviously an operational issue for the council but we will certainly continue to engage with the survivors regarding their needs, their perspective and their objectives. At that stage, they were not focused on excavation or anything like that, although they wanted the site preserved for memorialisation.

In the face of police repression, thousands of young people are protesting against the dictatorship of Xi Jinping by holding up blank A4 sheets of paper, as I am now doing. They are demanding freedom of speech, an end to a rigid and extreme Covid policy and democratic rights. China's capitalist dictatorship is facing its most serious challenge in more than 30 years. One of the groups that is trying to co-ordinate international solidarity, Chinaworker.info, reports that the revolt began with a workers' protest at the world's largest iPhone factory. I agree with the group's argument that a general strike of workers and students would be the most powerful weapon available in the context of protest. Here in the West, capitalist governments have been keen to a fight a new cold war. Socialists stand for a class war against the capitalists, east and west. Will the Taoiseach voice support for the Chinese protests and for the solidarity protests planned at embassies internationally?

The Deputy used a very interesting term, "class war". That would not be my vision for this country or for Europe. We consistently raise with the Chinese Government the need for human rights to be affirmed and for the citizens of China to have access to the same human rights as people in the West. Those rights were nurtured and developed by the liberal democracies of the West. We particularly call for people to be allowed to protest peacefully and to articulate their viewpoints without those perspectives being suppressed.

Despite a growing body of research evidence indicating that many patients with long Covid have neurological issues, the HSE has recruited only one neurologist for long Covid patients throughout the country. The only other clinic managing patients with neurological issues, based in the Mater hospital, is set to close at the end of next month due to the HSE's failure to even respond to the business case submitted to it last July. This clinic has already treated some 1,500 people this year. I ask the Taoiseach to intervene to keep this clinic open.

An additional €6.6 million will be invested in 2023. The HSE has an interim model of care to provide long Covid services nationally with the first priority being to ensure that both long Covid and post-acute Covid clinics operate with each hospital group in order that there will be a national service. I am informed that the long Covid clinics that have been established are based in St. Vincent's University Hospital, Tallaght University Hospital, St. James's Hospital, Beaumont Hospital and University Hospital Galway.

That means it has been five years since any additional capacity was added to the residential services children with disabilities can be referred to. In the same response, the HSE confirmed that 13 families have requested residential services for their children while there is also a cohort of children in the care of Tusla who will need these services. South east community healthcare is operating with limited resources and is not getting any extra. In this same letter, the HSE confirms that respite services are at capacity and that families requiring urgent respite are waiting longer than six months for a single night. That is an appalling legacy for the Taoiseach. He says he has only been in office for two years but he was involved in a confidence and supply arrangement for five years before that. In fact, he has always been involved because he set up the HSE. That is what we have now.The Government has failed the children with special needs and it is shocking. Waffling answers are no good. The Taoiseach has money for everything else but has no money for these desperately needed services.

This week I was approached by the parents of a young man who is doing his leaving certificate this year. He is a high academic achiever but he is going nowhere because he can go nowhere without supports. In 2020 he was assessed and none of the interventions that was recommended has been provided. He will soon reach his 18th birthday and after that he does not have a legal right to supports and he cannot go on to third level education without some of the supports. Those parents are in the very east of the county. On the western seaboard of the county I was approached by the parents of a young child in infant class. They struggle every day to get him to go to school. It is a major struggle. They get him to school and he stands inside the gates alone, locked in his own world and he stays there for the day. They cannot even get him assessed. They are being referred from pillar to post, and from one service to another, despite the fact that early intervention is key to dealing with autism and is key to unlocking the potential of that young child, as it is for his leaving certificate counterpart. Supports are key to unlocking the potential of his leaving certificate counterpart on the other side of the county. Whatever moneys are provided they are not trickling down and services are not being provided. What hope will the Taoiseach offer to the parents of those children and to parents right across Clare and the country?

The Deputy also raised the issue of a younger child. No child should be standing alone in the yard in any primary school and there is no necessity for that. I was in schools recently where children with severe and profound disabilities are in the classroom and are in the school. I can follow this up with the Deputy again.

That is a good move and is an acknowledgement of the financial pressure they are under. I acknowledge that. They should also be able to access the means tested fuel allowance. Up until now they have been precluded from the means tested allowance on the basis that they are on a short-term payment. Really, people just want to recover their health and get back to work and a somewhat normal life. In the meantime, however, when they are off work with their health condition, they still have financial commitments: the mortgage must be paid, the car loan must be paid and so many commitments. Unless the employer is giving them a top up they are in a difficult financial position. Given that the acknowledgement is there now for the Christmas bonus, and given the pressure that people are under, can this be taken a step further so people who are receiving illness benefit for more than 12 months will get the means tested fuel allowance?

That was on top of a whole range of additional payments that have been made since the summer and since autumn began, right through to Christmas with the cost-of-living package. Of course, once we make additional moves the call is to go further again and further again. It is all within a very substantial envelope of more than €11 billion. It is, however, an issue we will keep under review. The Deputy has suggested that people on illness benefit from more than 12 months could be considered. I will revert back to the Minister on this but I think we have made a lot of progress so far.

A nine year-old boy suffered what can only be described as horrific injuries on Sunday afternoon when he was savagely attacked by a pit bull dog while playing football with his friends in the green area at the estate where he lives in Wexford. The little boy remains in a serious condition in hospital following the attack by a dog that was not under the control of its owner. Nor was it muzzled. There has been a significant rise in the number of dog attacks on humans in the past five years, with more than 1,700 of these attacks reported from 2016 to 2021. They have had difficulty in finding the dog's owner. The full forces of the law need to be applied where an incident such as this that alters a child's life occurs. Do we need to do more to target the owners of these dogs that are listed as dangerous breeds, and which continue to be in public areas without a lead or a muzzle? Does the legislation need to be strengthened to make dog owners accountable for these dangerous breeds that pose a risk to humans?

I think that we should go back to the drawing board. I do not have the full panoply of legislation in front of me but we do need to go back to the drawing board. What has happened is one child too many. We all have pets but there is no need for this and it needs to be seriously examined. I will revert to the Minister to examine whatever cross-departmental approach we should take. The first thing to do is make sure there is enforcement. The second issue is the whole area of what is driving this and why there is a necessity for it.

The practice has almost 2,000 patients, between medical card holders and private patients, and it will mean the loss of a GP service in Blarney. Will the Taoiseach instruct the HSE to put a locum in place in the current clinic? I know of a GP who has offered the HSE to take over that practice as a temporary measure until someone is appointed. At the moment we have the closure of a GP practice in Blarney, when somebody is willing to keep it going. Will the Taoiseach notify the HSE and instruct them to do that? These 2,000 patients could be sent to Ballincollig. The Taoiseach is a Cork man, as is the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Michael McGrath, who is sitting next Taoiseach.

There was some revised guidance from the data protection officer recently. However, uncertainties remain and primary legislation is required. Will the Taoiseach advise as to when he expects Second Stage of the Garda Síochána (Recording Devices) Bill 2022 to be taken? Will he ask the Minister for Justice to examine extending the use of body cameras to private security staff?

The Garda Síochána (Recording Devices) Bill was published in August. The Government asked the Minister for Justice for more information on the potential inclusion of facial recognition technology, FRT, by means of amendments on Committee Stage. A report has been prepared for the Cabinet and will be published in the near future. The proposal to provide for An Garda Síochána's use of FRT is in line with the proposals contained in the report of the Commission on the Future of Policing in Ireland, which recommended the digital transformation of the Irish police service to enhance front-line policing capability. It is hoped that the report will be published shortly and that it will shed some light on this and get matters moving.

We know from recent data released by my colleague, Deputy Martin Kenny, that Garda membership across the State has fallen since 2009 while the population has grown by over 11% in that time. Since 2009, Garda numbers in Galway have increased by just 19. The wider division of Mayo, Roscommon and Longford has got 17 additional gardaí in the past 13 years. Those are three mostly rural counties. Crime is on the rise. Burglaries are up 47% in Roscommon and Longford, which is a really frightening statistic. Antisocial behaviour, not just in our cities but also in many rural towns, is on the rise as well. Some towns are really suffering and people are living in fear. We need a deliverable policing plan in conjunction with our communities, and it needs to include additional gardaí on the beat, especially in rural towns. Will the Taoiseach commit to that policing plan?

That will continue. I accept that there are challenges, particularly in the context of antisocial behaviour and in rural Ireland. We want to strengthen and support An Garda Síochána. Funding for 1,000 gardaí to be recruited next year was provided in the budget. I am informed by the Garda authorities that, at the end of August of this year, there were 14,283 Garda members, supported by more than 3,117 Garda staff. That is an increase of about 12% since 2015, when we had 12,816 Garda members throughout the country, so there has been a significant increase since 2015. The budget this year is €2.14 billion. We have to get the recruitment campaign going. About 11,000 people applied to join the service in 2022.

This project is a game changer for the region and one for which I was delighted to get Government approval in 2019, when I had the honour to serve in Cabinet. As the Taoiseach will no doubt be aware, in order to facilitate the early opening by him, a temporary roundabout at Carrigaphooca has been installed at an additional cost of €1.2 million. The plan is to remove that temporary roundabout in a few months when further progress is made on the remainder of the road. Instead of the roundabout being dismantled, will the Taoiseach take the necessary steps with Transport Infrastructure Ireland, TII, to ensure that a permanent on-off junction is provided at this location, thereby facilitating the local communities at Mons, Carrigaphooca, Lissacresig, Kilnamartyra, Reananerree, Ballingarry and beyond to Bantry and the Beara Peninsula in order to facilitate their easy access to the new road?

We will engage with the county council and TII in respect of the Deputy's suggestion.

They have very serious concerns about this unauthorised structure. Planning enforcement from Dublin City Council, DCC, has ordered it to be closed, and 27 people will be without homes in the week before Christmas. My question to the Taoiseach is what consequences in respect of criminal negligence there are for a landlord like Cathal Garrad, who rented this unauthorised structure to 27 tenants knowing that it was a fire danger? Will the State move against landlords who exploit the housing crisis to profiteer from it in this way in order to prevent anybody else doing what this landlord has done? If there are no consequences, why would others not follow suit?

The works carried out by this workforce include emergency maintenance to the terminal and surrounding areas, where qualified personnel can respond day or night at short notice. These redundancies will have a severely negative effect on the local economy and on the economy of west Cork in general. The State cannot idle as these workers are railroaded in the context of their rights. Whiddy Island is our national oil storage base. I ask the Taoiseach to call on Zenith Energy Bantry Terminal Limited to step back and to do all it can to save these jobs. A full strike has now been called for 13 December by SIPTU members, who served notice this week to the company. This action results from the decision of the company to dismiss workers with long service from today. Strike action is always a last resort, but it is now obvious that the compulsory redundancies Zenith Energy is seeking are not necessary. Since I raised this matter with the Taoiseach a few weeks ago, what efforts have the Government made to help to save these jobs?

That motion got unanimous backing from all parties. It took off and made its way to the Government. I was delighted on election to the Dáil to be able to meet with the Minister of State, Deputy Chambers, the Minister for Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media, Deputy Catherine Martin, and Fáilte Ireland and to keep a bit of momentum going on this matter. I have been speaking with the famous Seán Kelly about it. We really want the Tour de France to go down the Wild Atlantic Way. I am delighted the Government is pursuing this. The Taoiseach is surrounded by many west of Ireland Deputies. We will count the Taoiseach in that bracket as well as a Cork man. We would love to see the Tour de France go down through Galway, Clare, Limerick, Cork and Kerry - down the Wild Atlantic Way. I hope the Taoiseach will turn around and ask our friend and colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Chambers, that a Tour de France grand départ on the Wild Atlantic Way in 2026 or 2027 become the Government's position. We do not want it going from Dublin to Belfast this time. We want it in the west of Ireland. The Leas-Cheann Comhairle might agree.

That is 340 per Garda division or almost one per day. The Mental Health Commission recently referred to a 2009 report recommending 24-7 social work services and enhanced training for Garda members.

Some 55% of the Gardaí in one station in Kildare are out sick, mainly due to injuries sustained in the line of duty.

The HSE has still not responded. The response from the Department referred me to the HSE, which has not responded. My constituents are, understandably, very worried about the future of the health centre and of their town. Dunkineely has seen closure after closure in recent years, including the post office and the Garda station, so the town is understandably anxious about the sudden closure of yet another service. However, this does not seem to be a priority of the HSE. It is just another example of the lack of concern or care for our national service and another example of the lack of concern or care the Government has for rural communities. Patients have nowhere to go as doctors in surrounding practices of Killybegs, Mountcharles and Donegal town have been unable to take new patients for a while due to high demand and a lack of GP services in south Donegal. What will the Government do to make sure these services are restored and available?

I have been told repeatedly that the HSE has a pipeline of students due to graduate who will become public health nurses. However, this has not materialised. In particular, it has not materialised for us in Dublin. That means parents are still stressed out about this and children and toddlers are still missing milestone developmental checkups. It is simply not good enough. Will the Taoiseach commit to looking at the recruitment process to see if policies and procedures need to be changed so that we can get public health nurses more quickly, especially into Dublin, because something has to change?

That impacts on the pilot schemes Deputy Daly wants extended, particularly the relationship with mental health, dealing with mental health call-outs and so on. The overall aim of the Government is to increase significantly the number of gardaí in order that the Commissioner can operationally deploy them in accordance with his priorities. I will engage with the HSE in respect of Deputy Pringle's question. I do not think he outlined the reasons the centre is closing. There must be some background to it but I will check it with the HSE and that the Deputy raised it. I will also check with the HSE in respect of Deputy Higgins question. That is a recruitment and retention issue in the HSE more generally. More specifically, the CHO 7 area is not one I am au fait with but I will raise the matter with the HSE.

The national risk assessment has been prepared since 2014 and provides an opportunity to identify and discuss significant risks which may arise for Ireland. The national risk assessment 2021-22 was published last December. The experience of recent years has brought home the importance of work in the area of risk management and preparedness. By promoting an open and inclusive discussion on the major risks facing the country, the national risk assessment plays an important role in this work. Work is now under way on the latest version of the national risk assessment, and it is intended to publish a draft list of risks for public consultation in the coming weeks. This will provide an opportunity, as has been done in previous years, for stakeholders and Oireachtas Members to contribute to the development of the final report early next year. Many of the proposed strategic risks will have been identified in previous assessments. However, there will likely be a number of new proposed economic risks, and a number of other previously identified risks will have evolved significantly in the context of the Russian invasion of Ukraine and current cost-of-living challenges. It is important to note that the national risk assessment is just one element of the overall system of preparedness and resilience planning for Ireland and is not intended to replace or displace the detailed risk management and preparedness carried out across Departments and agencies. It is, however, an important opportunity to reflect on strategic risks facing the country in the years ahead.

#MaryLouMcDonald	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-party	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-dob	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-11-30 00:00:00	Ábhair Shaincheisteanna Tráthúla - Topical Issue Matters	207	One of the criticisms of the current national risk assessment is that it does not adequately provide for poverty-related risks and includes an inadequate analysis regarding social exclusion. Of particular relevance today is the criticism that forced displacement does not feature as a risk. It is mentioned only fleetingly in the analysis. Social Justice Ireland has observed that forced displacement, whether due to conflict or climate change, presents a serious risk for all countries. Poverty, too, is dealt with only briefly and is certainly not acknowledged as a risk. It is a genuine risk. Over 11% of the population live in poverty, more than 160,000 of whom are children. If the Government agrees with Social Justice Ireland’s analysis that a thriving economy is not a goal in itself but a means to social development and well-being for all, surely the significant risks of poverty in Ireland should be given greater consideration.

I refer specifically to the enormous risks to Ireland and elsewhere posed by Russia’s brutal invasion of Ukraine, which the Taoiseach has referred to. It poses an enormous humanitarian risk to so many people displaced by war as well as posing many economic, strategic and security risks. I am asking specifically about the risk to national security associated with the continued presence in Ireland of so many officials operating under diplomatic cover in the Russian embassy, Orwell Road. I am conscious the Government has already moved to expel some of them. I and others have called upon the Taoiseach to expel the Russian ambassador and indeed the other officials in light of the continuing brutality of Putin’s invasion of Ukraine. I renew that request. Will the national risk register identify the real risk to national security associated with having so many officials in the Russian embassy, Orwell Road in Dublin?
#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-11-30 00:00:00	Ábhair Shaincheisteanna Tráthúla - Topical Issue Matters	214	For the past nine months, the world has witnessed the horror of the war inflicted by Russia on Ukraine. Apart from the loss of life and suffering, we have seen the adverse effect on economies and the hardship caused to families by cost-of-living increases. As we know, small and medium enterprises are the backbone of our economy and of particular importance in our smaller towns, villages and rural counties. Many of these enterprises, be they involved in retail, manufacturing, processing or distribution, are being crippled by increased energy costs. Substantial Government support has been made available and is appreciated by business. The Government will need to continue to ensure adequate and additional support will be made available, if needed, to assist small and medium enterprises, which are vital to employment, to remain viable in these turbulent economic times.

In one area of my constituency, residents estimate it now costs €12 to take a shower. Households are no longer taking showers as a result; they are washing with basins of hot water. They have no alternatives and cannot opt for another provider. They are in a prepay system. If in arrears of more than €10, they are cut out. This means some residents are now living without heat or hot water. This is extreme and cannot be allowed to continue. It needs to be addressed urgently. Replies I have received on this to date suggest the Government will take action in the coming months or even years, on the basis that there is no urgency. Will the Government, as a matter of urgency, act on this and ensure those in district heating systems and without access to heating or hot water at affordable rates will be protected?

This is an issue I have raised many times. I want to deal with the risk posed by poverty. We know about the issues we are dealing with, the general cost of living and the absolute housing emergency. We must consider early family interventions and supports. While there are many good projects, we are very good in this State at coming up with pilots that work very well alongside families to bridge the gaps, but then, without adding resources, we just add a workload that cannot deliver. We know education and employment are the way to break poverty, but a very large number of people need to be given supports so the gaps can be bridged long before we talk about youth diversion or other initiatives. What has occurred represents an absolute failing of the State over many years. What I propose is something we need to do.

The lack of social or any other housing options is seriously jeopardising the health of very vulnerable people. I gave the Taoiseach some examples yesterday. Here are some more. One relates to a 59-year-old man with severe Alzheimer’s disease in a housing assistance payment, HAP, residency. He has been moved seven times in the past nine years. His doctors have specifically said he needs one location in which to live so as not to aggravate his medical condition. I received an email today from a couple with two twins. There are four young boys. The mother is getting cancer treatment, namely, chemotherapy, and she is also getting multiple infections because the family is living in mouldy, damp conditions. In all these cases in Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council, it now takes up to a year for the medical assessment to happen, never mind giving people places to live that are suited to their health conditions. Will the Taoiseach addresses this as a matter of urgency?

They are uncertain about their hours and annual income. There is pay inequality for post-2011 entrants, no opportunity for progression and no pay rise after years of service. This has long been an issue, starting with the Workplace Relations Commission in 2014. In 2020, the Labour Court instructed the Department to make an offer to the workers. In July 2022, the Department promised it would make an offer before October, but there was still no offer from it then. The workers have had enough of the many years of begging and asking the Government to do the right thing. They have decided to protest this Friday at 1 p.m. outside Government Buildings.
#BridSmith	unknown-#BridSmith-party	unknown-#BridSmith-dob	unknown-#BridSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-11-30 00:00:00	Ábhair Shaincheisteanna Tráthúla - Topical Issue Matters	219	I want to talk again about the risk to tenants who have to live in accommodation under reckless landlords. The tenants of Liberty Lane, Dublin 8, have for two years been paying €500 and €600 per month for a tin box with wires dangling around the kitchen area and bathroom area, and with two showers between 27 of them. Twenty-seven people now face homelessness in the weeks before Christmas. Would the Taoiseach join me in calling on the landlord, who is one of our own, to do the decent thing? Nowadays people go on about who is our own and who is not. He is one of our own, an Irish landlord who is putting at risk the lives of 27 people. There should be criminal negligence charges brought against him. Furthermore, I argue that every penny given to him in rent from the illegal unauthorised dwelling – a dwelling representing a fire safety risk – from which he profiteered, should be handed back to the tenants so they can at least find some comfortable accommodation before Christmas. I ask the Taoiseach to join me in calling on the landlord, Cathal Garrad, do the decent thing, hand back the money and face whatever consequences should be faced because of his activity.

Overall, the national risk assessment deals with strategic risks facing the country from external sources, including hybrid threats, terrorism, armed conflict and war. These were identified for the period 2021 to 2022. Risks referred to include the rise of a multipolar world; the future direction of the European Union; Ireland’s relationship, after Brexit, with the United Kingdom; and armed conflict, terrorism and hybrid threats. The economic risks listed relate to economic scarring, economic risks coming out of Covid, the public finances, the financial system, labour shortages, and supply chain capacity. These are all the issues that were identified, along with environmental risks. Social risks include risks to social cohesion, which relates to poverty, and risks associated with housing and sustainable development. The risk assessment makes the point that each Department and agency will have to carry out more detailed risk assessments.The Department of Social Protection, in particular, and the Departments of Finance and Public Expenditure and Reform need to do that in respect of issues pertaining to poverty. We will be publishing information shortly on the strategic risks identified for 2022-23 and we will be engaging with the Oireachtas in that regard. We can discuss those issues in more detail, including the more global strategic risks to the country and the risks in respect of individual areas within the country, such as forced displacement and so forth. Deputy Bacik raised the issue of Russian officials in Ireland. We do not get down to those specifics in terms of risks but we have expelled certain officials and we are advised by the National Security Committee on occasion in terms of potential risks to the country from external forces. Those issues are kept under constant review. Deputy Brendan Smith raised the impact of the war on Ukraine on Ireland's economy and the energy crisis, particularly for small and medium sized enterprises. We are very seized of this matter. The temporary business energy support scheme will be announced shortly and we hope funding gets out to companies before the end of the year. We will keep it under review to ensure we keep jobs intact, especially in the domestic services sector and particularly in hospitality and retail, which are areas the Deputy mentioned, as well as other manufacturers and so on. We will keep an eye on that because we want to retain as many jobs as we possibly can in small and medium sized enterprises. I will come back to Deputy O'Callaghan on his question about district heating systems, which was also raised by Deputy Ó Murchú. We are not talking about waiting months or years for action to be taken. The Minister is of a mind to come back quickly in respect of this. We cannot wait months or years. Deputy Ó Murchú raised the issue of household poverty, which I dealt with. In terms of early interventions with families, that would be an issue for the Department of Social Protection, other social services and housing services. They need to work with local authorities, Tusla and the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth in respect of early intervention and support services for families who are at risk and are challenged. There is a whole range of work that must be done at national level by Departments and agencies. On Deputy Boyd Barrett's question, I do not know why it takes 12 months to assess somebody in the circumstances he outlined, for example, in the case of a cancer patient with children. That should not take 12 months.

It seems to me that certain local authorities might have different approaches. The Deputy said a man had been moved seven times over the past nine years.

We are getting far more social houses built now, but there is room for local authorities to house people with medical conditions of that kind. Particularly in the situation the Deputy outlined, one would have thought a solution would be found by now for that individual.

Deputy Murphy raised an issue in respect of adult education tutors. My understanding is that this would come under the remit of the education and training boards and it would take responsibility for it. The issue must ultimately be determined through the labour relations procedures and processes we have. Deputy Bríd Smith raised the issue of tenants in Liberty Lane and the more general issue of landlords who are reckless. There is legislation dealing with those issues. Dublin City Council has moved to enforce the law. In situations like that, I do not want to prejudice the outcome of any case that may arise following the pursuance of this issue by the council. We should be in no doubt that accommodation of this kind should never have been offered in the first instance where there is a threat to tenants. BS Does the Taoiseach agree the tenants should have the rent returned to them?As I said, I am not going to prejudice the outcome of anything that may ensue here.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-11-30 00:00:00	Ábhair Shaincheisteanna Tráthúla - Topical Issue Matters	227	I propose to take Questions Nos. 19 to 29, inclusive, together. The Covid-19 and health unit of my Department supports me and the Government in developing and implementing health policy and related matters and co-ordinating the Government's response to Covid-19. This includes supporting the work of the Cabinet committee on health, the Cabinet committee on Covid-19 and the associated supporting senior officials groups and structures. In addition, the unit provides me with speech and briefing material on health matters and Covid-19 for Government meetings, Cabinet committee meetings, Oireachtas business, attendance at events and engagements with a wide range of stakeholders, including representative bodies and members of the public. The Cabinet committee on health oversees the implementation of programme for Government commitments in regard to healthcare, receives detailed reports on identified policy areas and considers the implementation of health reforms, including Sláintecare. The committee last met on 14 November. The date of the next meeting has not yet been set but the meetings are regular. In addition to the meetings of the full Cabinet and of Cabinet committees, I meet with Ministers individually to focus on different issues. I meet regularly with the Minister for Health to discuss priorities in the area of health, including Sláintecare. Budget 2023 provides the highest allocation of funding to the health and social sector in the history of the State. It is designed to facilitate better access to affordable, high-quality healthcare and to advance further our ambition for universal healthcare for all. The budget delivers on our commitment to continue to expand the core capacity of our acute hospitals by providing more health professionals and more acute hospital beds. It includes a €443 million funding package to treat tens of thousands of people on waiting lists and reduce the waiting times faced by all. Among other eligibility measures introduced this year, we removed inpatient charges for under-16s and we will remove them for all patients in 2023. Next year, we will widen the eligibility for the GP card, which will allow many thousands more people to be covered. Additional eligibility measures include the provision of €10 million for access to IVF treatments, the expansion of the entitlement to free contraception to women aged 26 to 30 and, subject to legal advice and consultation, to 16-year-olds, and an allocation of €5 million to introduce free oral healthcare for children up to seven years of age. Major increases in mental health services will be implemented, support for older people with a range of needs will be extended, and nearly €30 million in new funding has been allocated for expanded disability services. Coupled with these service improvements, we are also reforming how and where we deliver services. The enhanced community care programme continues to develop healthcare at a more local level, closer to where people live, thereby reducing pressure on hospital services. We will continue to advance these reforms in 2023, with work progressing on the establishment of six new regional health areas and on the elective care centres in Dublin, Cork and Galway. While it faces very serious challenges, our health system has expanded dramatically and is treating far more people and with better outcomes than ever before.

Will the Taoiseach give an explanation as to why the long Covid clinic at the Mater hospital in Dublin is to close? What is the basis for that decision, which seems deeply unwise? Second, I refer to community disability services, which have been caught in a debacle around the transfer of functions from the Department of Health to the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth. The reality is that unless matters are resolved speedily, we will have a real crisis in the delivery of services. As the Taoiseach knows, €65 million in one-off funding has been agreed but, so far, the Ministers, Deputies Donnelly and O'Gorman, have not allocated those moneys. This has left the Taoiseach's colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, between a rock and a hard place. Community disability services will haemorrhage staff by year's end if this funding is not released. I spoke to one service provider that is looking at losing six staff members by the end of next month. That is how critical this issue is. Will the Taoiseach intervene on the matter?

Will the Taoiseach confirm whether the funds allocated in the HSE budget under the progressing disability services, PDS, programme will be used to reinstate services in special schools? I continue to be contacted by parents about this. Are there emergency measures that can be taken to speed up assessments? There remain serious problems with obtaining a primary medical certificate from the HSE to confirm severe or permanent disability. Many cases are coming to my office in which applicants have been declined without medical assessment.Since the entire Disabled Drivers Medical Board of Appeal resigned in November 2021, no new board has yet been appointed. I ask that this be addressed without delay and a guarantee given that applications for a primary medical certificate from the HSE will be properly assessed.

I raised this issue this morning with the Minister of State, Deputy Feighan, as a Topical Issue matter. My constituency colleagues and I have all been written to and told that an interim arrangement for cover has been provided for public patients. I know this and Deputy Gould knows this but he continues to politicise this issue. That is wrong and I need to call it out for what it is. Many people are concerned, elderly people in particular, and they are worried about their service. The HSE has responded to us and I got the response again this morning in my Topical Issue matter that interim arrangements will be in place. The issue I want to raise is related to a programme that the Irish College of General Practitioners, ICGP, is hoping to establish. It has doctors from non-EU countries, including South Africa, Sri Lanka and India, ready and available to come to Ireland. Can I get a commitment from the Taoiseach and the Government that they will support this pilot initiative in community healthcare organisation, CHO, 4 to bring those much-needed GPs to our shores?

Cope Foundation in Macroom was to have a seven day per week service to support clients and their families. While that was approved, it is still not possible to deliver it because Cope Foundation has not recruited people. Similarly, there is a serious situation with care assistants and home help workers, in that up to 20% of posts in the Cork and Kerry region remain vacant. These are vital services to support people who want to live at home and in their communities in order that they can avoid hospital. It is also an issue of backing up carers. It is an issue that is constantly raised with me in my office by people who are approved services but who cannot find people to deliver the service. The HSE has confirmed that there is a particular issue locally in Ballincollig, Dunmanway, Macroom and Millstreet, where it is struggling to recruit home help workers. Can the Cabinet subcommittee bring a particular focus or plan to ensure that community services continue to be provided?

This week, three years and three months after the recommendation was made by the MacCraith report, the HSE has confirmed to RTÉ that conversations are ongoing with a small number of women as part of this continuing care. What does this mean? I have asked the Tánaiste and he said the Minister will come back to me but the Minister has never come back to me on this. What does "a small number" mean? Does this small number of women have cancer? Do any of these patients have a terminal illness? Has there been open disclosure in each of these cases? Have any of the delays in speaking to them affected their ability to treat their cancer or their survival chances? It is extraordinary that three and a half years after that recommendation of the MacCraith report, none of this information was forthcoming until we in Aontú raised it last week. Can we have the details today?

Most student are doing over 60hors a week. It is costing 9euro a day in parking alone without including petrol and lunches. To add even more to this disappointment, I am yet to receive the thousand-euro nurses' bonus promised to us in June. something needs to change to help our health system and it is not for the lack of nurses training, it is the treatment we receive that people leave Ireland seeking better conditions.She particularly asked, as do her colleagues, what has happened to the recommendations for an enhanced reimbursement scheme for student nurses arising out of the McHugh report and other recommendations, including the provision of uniforms and a payment for the cost of laundering uniforms and so on. It must be remembered that we have record numbers on trolleys. We have the highest number of patients on trolleys on record for this month of November. When we treat our student nurses in this way, is it any wonder we cannot get the staff we need in the health service?

It is the last day of November today and it is the worst November on record. It has also been the warmest November on record so God knows what we will face when the weather gets really cold. We need to look at the health service in a very serious light. Figures tell us that in comparison with the EU, we have 2.7 beds available per 1,000 of the population, while the average in the EU is 5.7 per 1,000. Yet, our expenditure per capita is many times higher than most EU countries. There needs to be an entire review of what is going on in the HSE and the health service. In particular, according to the Irish Nurses and Midwives Organisation, INMO, which we all agree with, it is vital that the HSE focuses on recruitment, retention, accommodation and capacity for nurses and doctors as a matter of urgency. This applies to the mental health services as much as it does to children's health and general hospital care.

There will be a test of whether the Government means that. Deputy Gino Kenny has brought forward a Bill to decriminalise the possession of small amounts of cannabis. All personal drug use should be treated as a harm reduction matter and not a criminal one. This Bill is a necessary step, it will begin a conversation and it will provide a stepping stone for a more progressive drugs policy in Ireland. The truth is the war on drugs simply does not work. If the Government is serious about reducing drug addiction, then the answer is to launch emergency interventions to combat poverty and deprivation to tackle the housing crisis and the crises of service provision. Will the Government support our Bill to decriminalise the personal possession of small amounts of cannabis? Can the Taoiseach confirm when the citizens' assembly on drugs will be taking place?

Among them are constituents of mine who lost loved ones at the Ballynoe nursing home. These families are calling and campaigning for the introduction of safeguarding legislation that would cover all care settings. They are calling for staffing-patient ratios in nursing home to be mandatory and set at a mandatory minimum rate. They are also calling for all records to be made available to families without delay. I support the calls and campaign of these residents and I would like the Taoiseach to comment on the issues they are raising.

I do not have the reasons here but the Deputy is suggesting it is closing. I will make inquiries with the HSE on what is happening there and what the background to the situation is. In the notes I received earlier, the indication was that this clinic is still operating. On the transfer, I have spoken to the relevant Ministers and Ministers of State and my understanding is we can bring that to conclusion relatively quickly with the transfer of disability service functions from the Department of Health to the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth because substantial additional funding has been made available for disability services for 2023. We want that funding and the additional services provided as quickly as possible and I will revert to the House on that issue when it is brought to a conclusion. Deputy Bacik raised the issue of special schools and the provision of therapy services within them. We will convene a meeting of the Ministers responsible for education, health and children in respect of disability services. I have said to the HSE that we want therapists restored to special schools. The progressing disability services programme is a different philosophical approach and model of care. It might be more accurate in dealing with disability services but one of the consequences of that was taking therapists out of special schools. We need a multidisciplinary approach within special schools. That has been agreed and that is being worked on by the HSE in terms the restoration of therapists to special schools. There is a broader recruitment process under way in disability services more generally.I will come back to the Deputy on the medical board of appeal. The appointments should have been made by now. My understanding is that there would be moves on that front.

It does not augur well if people are coming in knowing the solution to the problem they raise. What he is saying is that he clearly has it in writing that the HSE has already organised interim GP arrangements for the catchment area. Deputy Gould raised it earlier. I thought the implication was that it had not but it is clear now that it has. All Deputies have been informed of that. That is progress. I appreciate Deputy O'Sullivan alerting me to that. I will examine the issue of doctors from Zimbabwe, South Africa and other locations with the ICGP. I would be supportive of being able to facilitate that in terms of the general shortage. I will talk to the Minister for Health in respect of it. I have not seen the proposal yet. I will follow that up with the Minister for Health. In the healthcare area generally, work permits are provided to allow people to come into the country. This is an Irish College of General Practitioners initiative, which means that the college is supporting it also, and that would give an added credibility to it and would be an important endorsement. Deputy Aindrias Moynihan raised recruitment to disability services. I do not know whether the Cope Foundation has advertised for the position in Macroom, but there is an issue generally. More people have been recruited to the health service in the past two years than in previous years. It has been quite dramatic. Never before have so many people been recruited, but there remains a specific issue for recruitment of therapists to services for children with disabilities. Other services across the full spectrum of services within the HSE and within the health service more generally tend to have more success in getting therapists. The disability sector for children is problematic and it needs a specific focus, which we have said to the HSE. That covers Ballincollig as well as Macroom. I came across a home help the other night who is not working her full hours. We have expanded the home help hours dramatically and existing home helps should be availed of to the fullest extent possible by the HSE if they are available. That point was made to me. I will follow up on Deputy Tóibín's point but I did not quite catch it. Did he say there is an ongoing conversation between the HSE and some women in respect of the IT glitch highlighted by the MacCraith report?

Again, the degree programme-----

Deputy Bríd Smith raised the trolley crisis and bed capacity. We have improved bed capacity by close to 1,000 beds in the past two years, which is quite significant in itself, but we need to expand more. Post Covid, we have increased ICU beds and critical care beds significantly. Recruitment is the big issue within the HSE.

I have not examined Deputy Gino Kenny's Bill in detail, but the relevant Minister will, and the Minister will then come back to the Government in respect of a recommendation on it. The broader point is that from a healthcare perspective, treatment and treating addiction is a core issue for those who are addicted to drugs more generally. We must acknowledge that drugs do cause harm. We cannot resile from that either. We must examine the provisions of the Bill and what they are designed to do. More broadly speaking, we favour a healthcare-led approach. I hope we can get the citizens' assembly on drugs established early in the new year, following completion of the one on biodiversity, which has sought a couple of weeks' extension. The Citizens' Assembly on a Directly Elected Mayor for Dublin is more or less completed. We are in a good position to proceed with the citizens' assemblies on drugs and education early in 2023. Deputy Barry raised the public inquiry in respect of nursing homes. Again, at this stage I would not be minded towards a statutory public inquiry, but I know the Minister for Health has established a public health reform expert advisory group on the lessons that can be learned, an evaluation of how we performed in the pandemic, incorporating the lessons learned into a continued response to Covid but also potentially future pandemics and general preparedness in terms of the public health front. We do need a wider evaluation from the country's perspective in terms of how we manage Covid-19, covering all aspects of it, because that again would enable us to gain from the experiences of the Covid period.

On 10 November, I welcomed a delegation from the US House of Representatives for a courtesy meeting at Government Buildings. The delegation was led by Congressman Bill Keating, a member of the Congressional Friends of Ireland Caucus and chair of the House Foreign Affairs Subcommittee on Europe, Energy, the Environment and Cyber. Congressman Keating was accompanied by Congressman Brian Higgins and Congressman Juan Vargas, all recently re-elected members of Congress. The delegation was visiting for a four-day programme in Ireland and Northern Ireland, which included a number of economic, civil and community engagements, with a particular emphasis on education and social inclusion. At my meeting with them, the delegation was accompanied by the US ambassador, H.E. Claire Cronin. Our discussions covered a broad range of issues including the political situation in Northern Ireland, prospects for implementation of the protocol on Ireland and Northern Ireland, international support for Ukraine and the outcome of the recent midterm elections in the United States, as well as Ireland-US bilateral relations. We also discussed cybersecurity, data privacy, and the global energy crisis. Congressman Keating and the other members of the delegation expressed their firm commitment to peace, prosperity and progress in Northern Ireland. They accepted that there are genuine concerns about aspects of the implementation of the protocol among some parts of the community in Northern Ireland, but shared our assessment that these can be addressed through substantive good-faith engagement by the United Kingdom with the European Union. We noted the decision of the British Government to introduce legislation to delay the need to call elections in Northern Ireland and welcomed the space this creates for reaching agreement solutions that facilitate the formation of an Executive. We also discussed the programme of work of the shared island initiative since its launch in October 2020, including its aim of building a shared island agenda, fostering inclusive civic dialogue, commissioning research on the future of the island and delivering beneficial all-island investment projects, backed by a shared island fund of more than €1 billion. I expressed my appreciation for the continued unequivocal support of the US Administration and both Houses of Congress for the peace process and for the Good Friday Agreement. This has been of enormous value over decades and reflects the deep and historic ties between our countries.

All those motions have referred as well to the need to ensure that this international agreement is not diminished in any way as a result of Brexit. They have outlined clearly the parameters of a potential British-US trade agreement. In all engagements with US politicians, be it from the President to members of his government or with Members of Congress, we must always emphasise the urgent need to make progress on regularising the status of the undocumented Irish in the US.The best estimates are that there are fewer than 10,000 people but the overwhelming majority of those Irish people are working, paying their taxes, rearing families and contributing very well to US society, yet they do not have residency status. We need to make progress in that regard. President Obama brought in legislation but, unfortunately, it was rejected by the US Supreme Court. Subsequently, the House of Representatives passed a motion but it was delayed at the last minute. We need to have that legislative agenda moved on again.

As far as Ireland is concerned, we enjoy close ties and historical bonds with the US. Irish people follow US politics closely, including the recent midterm elections. In this context, I pay tribute to the Speaker of the House, Nancy Pelosi, on her upcoming retirement from politics. She was a great friend and ally of Ireland. The US has an important role to play as regards Brexit, the Northern Ireland protocol and the protection of the Belfast-Good Friday Agreement. Several US politicians have stated that there can be no free trade agreement between the EU and the UK unless these issues are resolved. Does the Taoiseach agree it is very important for the Government to continuously press its case on Capitol Hill, because there is no doubt other parties coming from a different perspective are also doing this?

On that note, will the forthcoming proposal to reopen the Irish Embassy in Tehran be reviewed? This has been raised in this House previously, and the Taoiseach and others indicated that the idea the Government might even contemplate reopening an embassy in Tehran, Iran, would now be under review in light of what is going on there.

He is one of 47 children who have been murdered by Israeli forces just this year, as well as a massive escalation that has claimed the lives of hundreds of Palestinians. When the Taoiseach met the US congressional delegation, or whenever he talks to his American counterparts, does he ask them the very simple questions as to why they continue to arm the Israeli State to carry out these criminal and murderous actions against Palestinian people, why they continue to give billions of dollars in military aid and why they continue to veto every effort to bring sanction against Israel for its crimes against innocent children going to school and being shot down by murderous Israeli forces?

I have studied the Salient Rulings of the Chair and I believe the Taoiseach was clearly out of order in describing Deputies Boyd Barrett and Barry and me as puppets of Putin. Salient Ruling 417 states, "Member may not say that another Member is taking orders or instructions from outside interests or is representing or speaking for such interests". It is clear that was the smear involved in the comment "puppets for Putin's regime". Salient Ruling 413 states, "If an allegation impugns the character, integrity and good name of a member it must be withdrawn". Salient Ruling 412 states, "Chair protects Members against innuendo, insinuation and allegation". I am asking the Leas-Cheann Comhairle to instruct the Taoiseach to withdraw those remarks.

Westminster is pushing ahead with its Troubles legacy Bill, which will give amnesty for the murder of Irish people. Before the Taoiseach leaves office, will he say to the British Government that the Irish Government will take it to the European Court of Human Rights if it proceeds with that Bill? I was also in Washington with the Good Friday Agreement committee, speaking to senators and congressmen and women. They expect to come to this State for the anniversary of the Good Friday Agreement next April. All the political views in the North at the moment expect there is going to be no Executive in place on the 25th anniversary of the Good Friday Agreement. Will the Taoiseach start the process now of changing the manner in which the Executive works so that it cannot be crashed or stopped ever again? That work has to happen now; otherwise, we are going to bust through the anniversary of the Good Friday Agreement with no functioning Executive.

We never lose the need to continue to raise those issues. Deputy Brendan Smith raised the issue concerned the undocumented Irish in the United States. We have been close previously to getting a resolution to that issue, falling short by just one vote on one occasion. We will continue to pursue that because it is very difficult for those who are undocumented. I agree 100% with Deputy Haughey in regard to pressing our case on Capitol Hill and the need to continue to do so, because others also press their case and we need to keep the Irish perspective on these issues to the forefront of legislators’ minds on Capitol Hill and those of American representatives on both sides of the aisle, as well as that of the US President. I concur with the Deputy regarding the fulsome praise he gave to the Speaker of the House, Nancy Pelosi, on her intentions to retire from politics. She has been a great friend of Ireland and has been steadfast, loyal and supportive of the Irish cause on Capitol Hill. She has also been very influential on the protocol issue and on trade issues more generally, as the delegation was also. Turning to Deputy Bacik's questions, we did not discuss in great detail the human rights situation in Iran, although we had a general discussion about the global situation. On the issue of the embassy in Tehran, I would advise some caution. We might need to have a debate in the House about diplomacy more generally and what we mean by it. Diplomacy is not an endorsement of a regime. If we were to base policy on whatever transpires in a given country at a given time, we might end up ending diplomatic relations on a number of fronts. I think that perhaps we need to give a bit more thought and reflection on the purpose of opening diplomatic channels. In the context of our broader understanding of the world and of how the world works, our diplomatic network is very important and gives us insights into what is happening in various societies across the globe, as well as serving the needs of Irish citizens in different locations around the world through consular services and so on. There is an issue we need to examine and I would respectfully put that forward as an issue meriting more reflection and debate. To respond to Deputy Boyd Barrett, we do raise human rights issues in respect of Palestine. We have been very forthright-----

The horse and greyhound racing industries make a valuable contribution to a balanced regional economy. It is estimated that the thoroughbred industry has an annual economic impact of €1.84 billion and provides direct and indirect employment to 29,000 people. The greyhound sector benefits an estimated 10,000 people. The thoroughbred industry in particular brings a high level of international investment into Ireland. Government funding, in addition to supporting these key industries, presents an excellent opportunity to yield a high return for its investment, leading to a flow of income right through the economy, thereby providing widespread benefits to society. Support for certain strategic industries is important for future economic growth and provides widespread benefits for our society as well as for our economy. Successive Governments have acknowledged the importance of these industries and have supported them through legislation and consistent policy initiatives. The support provided by public funds through investment in these industries has enabled Ireland to develop a world class reputation for excellence in horse racing, greyhound racing and breeding. The horse and greyhound racing industries receive financial support from the State through the Horse and Greyhound Racing Fund, under section 12 of the Horse and Greyhound Racing Act, 2001. Payments are made from the fund to Horse Racing Ireland, HRI, and to Rásaíocht Con Éireann, RCÉ. In the period from 2001 up to now, a total of €1.54 billion has been paid from the fund to the horse and greyhound racing industries in accordance with the provisions of the Act. The cumulative upper limit on payments from the fund, provided for under the relevant regulations, has been reached. Exchequer support provided from the fund is crucial to the continued development of the horse and greyhound racing industries. In order to give effect to the provisions of this year's budget for 2023, this cumulative upper limit must be increased by regulation, which is why we are here today. The Estimates for the Department, passed by both Houses of the Oireachtas as part of budget 2023, include an allocation of €91million for the Horse and Greyhound Racing Fund. This will be distributed in accordance with the provisions of the Act, with 80%, or €72.8 million, going to HRI and 20%, or €18.2 million, going to RCÉ. In order to allow the Department to provide the moneys allocated in the budget, it is necessary to comply with the technical requirement under the Act, to increase the cumulative limit on the amount payable from the Horse and Greyhound Racing Fund by €91 million to €1.64 billion. This is achieved by way of the regulations submitted to the House today. The aggregate limit on the Horse and Greyhound Racing Fund was increased in this manner in 2004, and from 2009 to 2022. In the context of the horse racing industry, the Deloitte report, Economic Impact Of Irish Breeding and Racing 2017, which was commissioned by HRI, indicates that the total economic impact and stimulated direct expenditure of the Irish breeding and racing industry is estimated at €1.84 billion, based on 2016 figures. In addition, it was estimated that the industry supports the direct and indirect employment of 29,000 people. Horse racing generates a very significant return to the rural economy in Ireland and a positive international profile for the country also. Of course, behind all the facts and figures are very much the thousands of men and women who directly and indirectly make our Irish racing industry what it is and what it has been built up to be. As proven to date in 2022, Irish owners, trainers, jockeys and horses are setting standards globally as has been the case in all years, and their stellar achievements and enduring influence underscore our country's international prominence in the industry. We are the second largest producer of bloodstock in the world by value sold after the USA and we have the world's third highest number of thoroughbreds foaled each year after the USA and Australia. Statistics released by HRI for horse racing and breeding in the country for the first six months of 2022 point to a continued resilience in the industry.While some metrics are down year on year, many figures compare favourably with the first six months of 2019, which was the last full comparable year prior to the Covid pandemic. A strong welfare and integrity foundation is crucial and this is recognised throughout the industry. We continue to work with HRI, the Irish Horseracing Regulatory Board, IHRB, and other relevant stakeholders to ensure the highest standards of integrity and welfare are maintained. In that regard, in November last year, the Joint Committee on Agriculture, Food and the Marine published a report on horse racing in Ireland. At the committee's request, an international equine anti-doping expert, Dr. Craig Suann, was commissioned to conduct an independent review of the IHRB's equine anti-doping programme. This review concluded that the programme does "at least match international best practice in most respects and has made significant advances in recent years." Nevertheless, further improvements are always possible. HRI has informed the Department that it spent some €5.4 million on a suite of equine welfare initiatives in 2021 and has indicated a €5.8 million welfare spend for this year. These initiatives include support for animal welfare bodies to identify new careers for horses when they exit racing, infrastructural improvements at race courses to mitigate risks to horses and support for the Irish Equine Centre. According to the 2021 Power report, the greyhound racing industry provides and supports considerable employment directly and indirectly. It is estimated that the industry supported more than 4,000 full-time and part-time jobs in the economy in 2019. In addition, there are over 6,000 active greyhound owners. The total number of people deriving economic benefit from the sector was estimated by the report at over 10,000. I commend the regulations to the House and look forward to listening to the contributions of Members, following on from the significant engagement we had at the Oireachtas committee recently.

Cuirim fáilte rompu uilig. Nobody disputes, or at least the vast majority of people accept, that horse racing and greyhound racing are important aspects of our rural communities and generate significant economic input in such communities, many of whom have few other economic generators. Few dispute that the State is right to support both sectors financially. Sinn Féin supports the principal of supporting the horse and greyhound racing sectors in order to ensure they contribute to the greatest possible extent to rural communities and our domestic economy and to ensure we can insist on the highest standards of integrity, transparency, accountability and animal welfare. We are debating today a proposal to deliver taxpayer funds of €91 million to those sectors. No rationale has ever been provided for arriving at that figure. It is a huge sum of money. The Sinn Féin amendment requests that the Minister conduct a full review of all funding in respect of this fund. Such a review should analyse: the economic impact of the fund, including its efficacy in supporting the development of both sectors, the broadest cohort of those involved in the sectors and rural communities; whether the portion of the funds used, particularly by HRI, to subsidise prize funds is the best value for money; and the efficacy of the funding in ensuring the highest animal welfare standards. A similar motion and amendment was brought forward last year and the Minister rejected it on the basis that this type of analysis is conducted all the time. There is no evidence that such an analysis has ever been carried out by the Department and nobody has ever provided a rational basis for a fund now approaching €100 million per annum that is divided 80% to 20% between HRI and RCÉ regardless of the circumstances. We asked the Comptroller and Auditor General to look at this. It is the only aspect of State funding we can find where two distinct and separate organisations have their funding linked on a pro rata basis to this degree. It makes no sense. The Minister told the committee last week that he looks at the business cases provided by the organisations and then decides the horse and greyhound funding for the subsequent year.It is impossible to accept, and is verging on the unbelievable, to suggest that every single year two separate business cases are brought before the Department and every single year those cases make a sufficiently worthy appeal to get taxpayers to fund the tune of tens of millions of euros based on an 80:20 split. It does not make sense and it does not stand up to scrutiny. It certainly does not inspire confidence that this fund is subjected to the highest levels of accountability and transparency we should expect in respect of funds. The conditionality that is associated is incredibly limited. There are no results-based criteria on which this fund is dependent. Either organisation can say it is spending a portion of the fund on animal welfare but there is no basis on which we can actually assess whether that level of funding has made an impact on improving the reputation which has been tarnished by animal welfare issues which have been made public in recent years. It has been well rehearsed that there have been issues within the greyhound sector. I accept that many within the sector have gone to great lengths to address those issues. We also know that there have been issues in respect of horse racing which have damaged the reputation of that industry. Again, those activities have been carried out by a minority. The need to address that reputational damage is not helped when the Minister cites an independent expert who carried out a review of the anti-doping measures. His assessment from his report is that Ireland meets the highest of international standards. That would be all well and good if that international expert had actually set foot on the island of Ireland while conducting that exercise. However, it was an entirely computer-based model without attending any racetrack, without attending any stables and without speaking to anybody directly involved in the sector or on a farm. Concerns have been raised. As a substantial amount of taxpayers' money is involved, it is not good enough to say that because we support certain sectors, we support whatever sum of money the Department decides without knowing the basis for how it reached that sum of money. The Minister has not explained the increase from what was allocated in 2017 to the sum of money proposed today. He never set out precisely how he came to the conclusion that €11 million in additional funding is needed today as opposed to four years ago. On what rationale is that based? How did he come to the decision that it should be distributed once again on a perfect 80:20 basis? I urge the Minister to accept our amendment to ensure we have higher standards of accountability and transparency for this public money. We need to restore public confidence in both sectors and ensure both sectors and everybody involved benefits from this funding as well as the communities in which they live.

The horse and greyhound industry plays a significant role in my county of Tipperary. Whether it is the small operator with a couple of dogs or horses or the larger operators, the contribution they make to my home county cannot be understated and must be supported. These sectors provide great employment. When we are asked to approve the expenditure of such an amount of taxpayers' money, we must be sure there is full transparency, not just from the organisations that distribute it, but also from the Department in terms of how the fund is delivered and overseen. It needs to be guaranteed to deliver the social, economic and animal welfare benefits it is supposed to. It is with these matters in mind that we have submitted the amendment to which Deputy Carthy has referred. I will speak on this shortly. Last year, when a similar amendment was rejected by the Minister, I asked him why he was so opposed to it. That is the purpose of making these contributions today. Last year I questioned how effective the fund is in supporting the smaller operators in both of these sectors. I pointed out that this was not just my view but also the view expressed to me by those operating in the sectors. I expressed the perception that the money given through the fund does not make its way to the small operators in the manner many believe it should. That question stands. Figures from last year show that the lion’s share of the horse racing prize fund was shared among a small number of the owners and trainers who could not be described as anything but elite. In the greyhound sector, there is discontent at how private tracks are more or less expected to make their own way in life, and that the level of engagement with them by GRI is minimal and funding is piecemeal. This, of course, affects the smaller operators, who say they do not see the benefits of substantial State funding. I cannot go any further before discussing the importance of adequate oversight and transparency on the Department’s side when deciding on the fund without taking animal welfare into account. Confidence in the sector hinges upon satisfaction with welfare standards in both horse racing and greyhound racing. The majority of those involved treat their animals with the highest level of welfare standards in mind. Is the Minister confident the manner in which the fund is used is as effective as possible in assisting this? Is he satisfied the board is engaging with stakeholders to the extent those operators would deem adequate on greyhound rehoming for example? When deciding upon the level of funding, what account did the Minister take of the slow pace with which CCTV is installed in stables at racecourses? We need to ensure the level of detail the Minister applies to these matters and a range of others is as firm as the industries and the public in general demand. My final point relates to the arbitrary way the fund is divided, and the approach the Department has taken in deciding that Horse Racing Ireland gets €72.8 million and Greyhound Racing Ireland €18.2 million. As I said, the 80:20 split seems arbitrary, and I question if the needs of one sector versus the other is taken into account. We in Sinn Féin support the sectors and we want the sectors and the public to have confidence. That is why we are proposing a full review of the Exchequer funding to the fund with a view to examining its social and economic impact and its effectiveness in supporting the development of both sectors and the rural communities to which they contribute. We are also proposing that this be done to examine whether the use of the fund to subsidise prize funds represents best value for money and its effectiveness in ensuring the highest levels of animal welfare standards. This can be done by the Minister reporting to the Dáil within six months of these regulations being adopted. I earlier asked if the Minister rejects our amendment to outline why he is so opposed to it.

Traditionally the Labour Party has supported this fund but as the years go on, we need to look at how it is functioning. It is out of place with how the budgetary process works. It was put in at a certain time. The formula by which the calculations are made are locked from that time. In this year of all years the Minister needs to look at it before it comes through a budgetary cycle next year. Along with Deputy Carthy, I am a member of the Committee of Public Accounts. We do not know of any other sector with a formula used in this way. We support funding for both industries. I come from Tipperary, literally a few fields away from where Tiger Roll was bred. It is probably the biggest county in Ireland when it comes to both horse racing and greyhound racing. While supporting the funding, we need to look at the formula by which this is achieved. We also need to look at how this fund operated vis-à-vis other Government funding such as sports capital and funding given to sporting and other organisations. There seems to be a mix-and-match approach rather than an actual holistic approach. That needs to be looked at in its totality to verify the fairness in distribution. In looking at how the fund is administered by both relevant organisations, on the greyhound side of things, much of the funding goes towards administration rather than prizes, while the opposite is the case with the funding going to the HRI. More of the actual fund and prizes in particular need to drift towards a fair distribution. Particularly when it comes to horse racing, formulas need to be put in place to ensure the small breeders, trainers and owners get a fair crack of the whip. I can speak very locally about that because where I come from there are many small breeders and trainers who raise this with me on a regular basis.When it comes to animal welfare, in whatever formula or process is used into the future, there needs to be ring-fenced funding. When it comes to the greyhound board, and I ask the Minister to look specifically at this, somebody should be put on that board with a specific interest in this area who will increase the percentage of their funding that is used for welfare. That is a good recommendation and I imagine most people in the House would support it. In our amendment, we are asking now, at this stage and after all of these years, that we look at how this fund, which is obviously of huge economic benefit to rural areas and counties as well as to urban areas, can be more fairly distributed. Furthermore, we need to look at how the fund can ensure higher standards in animal welfare. Something that is often forgotten - in fact, I think I am the only Member who keeps raising this issue year in, year out - is that we need a sectoral order for employment rights, particularly when it comes to horse racing. Thousands of people are employed. I am concerned about some people - the number is small - who work in that industry and who are being treated very unfairly. They have very low rates of pay and do not have good working conditions or terms and conditions. A sectoral order in that area would be an important component. We also need to see how we can ensure, overall, this fund can be distributed more fairly and how it can be integrated across all other sports funding. I ask the Minister to do this quickly, because I do not want to before the Committee of Public Accounts asking all of these questions again during next year's budgetary cycle. I would like to have this sorted out. It is going to keep coming up because it is unique. Furthermore, the time is right to do it now, given the gambling regulation legislation that is also coming into place. There is an overlap between the two issues, so the timing is optimal.

It is only legal in a handful of countries, one of which is the US, where it started. Now it has been banned in most states there. This is a cruel industry that has no place in modern society. No matter where this industry is, it is plagued with animal welfare concerns. Of course it is, when it is based on the overbreeding of dogs solely for speed. While in jurisdiction after jurisdiction the industry is being banned, the Irish Government continues to invest millions of euro in it every year. I do not think that any one is surprised by Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael’s unwavering commitment to this cruel and unpopular industry. It is safe to say, however, that people are surprised and disappointed by the Green Party’s newfound support of it. The Green Party’s general election manifesto committed to phasing out public funding to the greyhound racing industry, the exact same thing the Social Democrats are calling for. It is incredible to me that, in 2022, most of our political parties in government and in opposition support this industry.

The facts as outlined in RTÉ’s documentary “Greyhounds - Running for their Lives” remain the definitive record of the appalling standards and cruelty of the industry. Up to 6,000 dogs are bred annually to be killed. I have to raise the same questions every year. In whose interest is this? It is certainly not in the public interest. Why is €18 million being transferred to the industry? Is it because of its close ties with Government parties and others in this House? Organisations such as Irish Guide Dogs for the Blind and Autism Assistance Dogs Ireland only get a tiny fraction of that amount, and this is disgraceful. The funding of more than €18.2 million sees an increase of €600,000 in this year. In our alternative budget, the Social Democrats called for State funding for greyhound racing to be phased out over the next three years, with an annual reduction of between €6 million and €7 million between now and the end of the Thirty-third Dáil. We all know that the €18 million could be spend so much better. It is deeply regrettable that the Government did not take our proposal on board in this budget. It is also significant that Dogs Trust has now called for a phased end to greyhound racing in Ireland. That is despite it having worked with the industry for many years to improve conditions for dogs involved. The charity says there are welfare issues that have not been resolved. Greyhound Racing Ireland and its supporters in this House are eager to point out a new system of traceability and welfare inspections while ignoring the deep irony of their position. These measures are only necessary because the record of the industry is so appalling. We know of thousands of dogs that were bred and then destroyed because they did not make the cut. Overbreeding in the industry continues to be a major concern. The Committee on Agriculture, Food and the Marine’s recent report on dog welfare noted there is virtually no oversight and transparency concerning canine artificial insemination. The Government does not have a list of canine fertility establishments. We have no idea who is involved in this area and if they have any qualifications. This is especially relevant to greyhounds, who are known to be subject to horrific overbreeding. Under official regulations, non-veterinarians can carry out artificial insemination in greyhounds. Greyhound Racing Ireland is responsible for these regulations, and enforcement is carried out by the Irish Coursing Club, ICC. Why are these bodies given this power? Where is the oversight of them? This motion, despite all of the glaring issues, will comfortably pass. Not only is this wrong, it is also completely at odds with public opinion. Most ordinary people are not being represented on this matter. I am calling for an end to public funding of the industry. If it is so important to rural Ireland and if it has such great welfare systems, then let the industry survive on a commercial basis. The Minister does not want that and neither do people in this House, in this Government and on Opposition benches, because they all know that the industry would collapse without its annual handout. When will this madness end?

This is incredible. This is compared with €15 million total in core funding for sports organisations in this country, including the FAI, the GAA, Swim Ireland and the Olympic Federation of Ireland. The Government wants to hand over €91 million, the Green Party is going against its professed position to support this, and the Labour Party and Sinn Féin are shamefully sitting on the fence, trying to have it both ways. As has been pointed out, this is wildly out of touch with the views of ordinary people. A poll in 2019 showed that 80% of people who had an opinion agreed that the Irish Government should stop funding greyhound racing. That poll was done before this year’s discovery of the greyhound skeletons that had been dumped 2 km from the Newbridge Greyhound Stadium and before the recent confirmation that, in horse racing, €42 million in public funds were paid out in prize money to multimillionaires at horse races last year. Over the past 20 years, we have transferred a reported a total of €1.54 billion to both industries. What could €91 million do? It could double, to 282, the number of refuge spaces for those fleeing domestic violence and we would still have money to spare. The figure of €91 million is more than the total that is being allocated to the retrofitting of local authority social housing in 2023. It is a scandal that the Government prioritises funding for greyhound and horse racing over any of these vital issues. There is rightly much debate on the issue of greyhound racing every year, but the question of horse racing and where this money is going will increasingly come into question as well. The Minister and I debated this. The truth is this money ends up in the hands of multimillionaires.According to the horse racing industry's most recent fact book, the top three winners are J.P. McManus, Michael O'Leary and John Magnier, people who are all already millionaires. They are the ones who are ending up with this money. Some 72% of the prize money goes to the racehorse owners. Only 10% goes to jockeys and trainers and only 8% to stable staff, charities and industry organisations. Cruelty is widespread in the greyhound industry. We have seen the 2019 RTÉ documentary reporting that the industry was breeding up to 1,000% more puppies than it needed, resulting in 6,000 dogs per year being killed because they were deemed not to be fast enough. Within the industry, this is referred to as "wastage". It is incredible and outrageous that, year after year, this Dáil agrees to give almost €100 million to these industries.
#MickBarry	unknown-#MickBarry-party	unknown-#MickBarry-dob	unknown-#MickBarry-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-11-30 00:00:00	Ábhair Shaincheisteanna Tráthúla - Topical Issue Matters	302	I will focus on the proposed funding for the greyhound industry. The proposal before us provides €91 million to the horse and greyhound racing fund with €18.2 million of this to go to the greyhound industry. You cannot have a greyhound racing industry without animal cruelty. There is loads of information to back that up. Speakers have said that a minority is against the industry. It is a lot more than a minority. It is a very strong opinion within Irish society. Attendances at the stadia are falling very significantly. This money is being used to prop up the industry. What could €18.2 million be spent on? Funding for combatting gender-based violence and for shelters and so on could be increased by more than a third. Some 466 nurses could be hired at the starting salary or 50 new hospital beds could be provided. These are much better ways to spend the money. The Green Party's animal welfare policy, published in 2019, just before the election, states "The Green Party seeks to cease the use of state funding for Greyhound racing and re-purpose a portion of this budget allocation towards the welfare and re-homing of Greyhounds impacted by such a change." It is amazing the change that can come over the Green Party when it gets a few ministerial seats. Is it Mercedes or bicycles its Ministers get? We will be watching very carefully how Green Party Deputies vote on this.
#MichaelLowry	unknown-#MichaelLowry-party	unknown-#MichaelLowry-dob	unknown-#MichaelLowry-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-11-30 00:00:00	Ábhair Shaincheisteanna Tráthúla - Topical Issue Matters	303	The tradition of horse racing and greyhound racing is ingrained in the Irish psyche. Ireland is recognised across the globe for its exceptional standards in breeding and training racehorses and greyhounds. As an industry, horse racing has generated billions for the Irish economy. My home county of Tipperary is steeped in the tradition of the industry. Horses and everything related to horses are of fundamental importance to our local economy. The core breeding and racing industry in Ireland is estimated to generate an astounding €1.8 billion in gross expenditure every year. The industry directly supports almost 10,000 Irish jobs and indirectly provides employment for thousands more in areas such as equine science, veterinary services, farriery, transportation and stabling. It also supports jobs for thousands who work whole-time or part-time in areas such as on- and off-course betting, the maintenance and servicing of racetracks and catering and in a myriad of other enterprises allied to the operation of this lucrative industry. Racing tourism is a major asset to the Irish economy in its own right. The Irish National Stud is a prominent tourist attraction and records substantial footfall from both overseas and Irish tourists every year, generating vital revenue for transport and local businesses. Race meets are also major occasions in this country. Thousands of enthusiasts from within and outside Ireland flock to enjoy our renowned events, generating revenue for hospitality and other businesses.  One of Ireland's greatest claims in international equine circles is that more than 20% of the top 100 flat horses in the world were bred here in Ireland. Our reputation for breeding has been commended for generations. Coupled together, our world-renowned stables, our temperate climate and our calcium-rich soil provide perfect conditions for raising young stock. The €72.8 million allocated to horse racing for the future represents a 3.5% increase. In light of the revenue consistently generated by the horse industry in Ireland through employment, tourism, hospitality, travel and, not least, focusing a spotlight on our excellent reputation on the world stage, this allocation pales in comparison with the benefits this sport delivers. I support the greyhound industry. Welfare issues have been addressed and oversight is being strengthened. The industry needs continued support. I wholeheartedly endorse the allocation.
#VeronaMurphy	unknown-#VeronaMurphy-party	unknown-#VeronaMurphy-dob	unknown-#VeronaMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-11-30 00:00:00	Ábhair Shaincheisteanna Tráthúla - Topical Issue Matters	304	In a 2017 report, it was estimated that more than 5,000 were in employment either directly in the greyhound industry or as an indirect result of it. The greyhound sector is worth more than €300 million to the Irish economy and the funding provided to it comes from a betting tax that is used to fund both greyhound racing and horse racing. The sports are therefore self-financing. With the employment figures I have mentioned and the industry's value to the Irish economy, it appears the funding is money well spent. In County Wexford, Enniscorthy Greyhound Stadium is the hub of the sport, with race meetings taking place twice a week to the enjoyment and entertainment of its many supporters and participants. The sport of greyhound racing has received no shortage of criticism from opponents in recent years. There are some in this Chamber and beyond who want the sport banned for a variety of reasons. Unfortunately, there are unscrupulous and greedy people in every walk of life and every industry. The sport of greyhound racing is no exception, but great strides have been made in recent years to root out those who are involved in the maltreatment of dogs and to introduce programmes to help rehome and support retired dogs. It is important to note that my general support of the greyhound racing industry will not prevent me from holding officials to account or from ensuring funds made available to the industry are being spent and managed appropriately. As a member of the Committee of Public Accounts, I recently had the opportunity to question members of Rásaíocht Con Éireann about a variety of issues. I will continue to do so at every opportunity. I believe the vast majority of greyhound owners and trainers are animal lovers and treat their dogs brilliantly. I hope the industry continues to thrive and improve. I will continue to support the Irish greyhound industry but I will also continue to ensure full transparency and accountability in respect of how the Greyhound Racing Ireland is doing things. I echo Deputy Kelly's call for someone with sectoral experience to be appointed as CEO of the board. We need to stabilise the position. There has been far too much turnover. For the good of the sector, the good of the dogs and the good of everybody involved, that would be an appropriate measure.

I have no truck with or trust in any of the unscrupulous breeders out there, who make up a tiny minority. I acknowledge the prowess we have in the horse racing and greyhound industries in Tipperary. As was said, the horse racing industry directly supports 10,000 jobs in the country and indirectly supports a great many more. The naysayers here, who are just anti-everything really, are against this. They would have us afraid to speak. I was speaking on an issue during Leaders' Questions and, within 30 seconds of me speaking, one of these same heroes tweeted that I was dog-whistling. Who do they think they are to control this democratically elected Parliament? I, for one, will not be silenced by them with regard to any of my views or opinions. I thank the Leas-Cheann Comhairle and the Ceann Comhairle for their protection in that right. These people talk about polls. Where are these polls done? They pay students and young people to picket and to do other things around the town of Clonmel. We have a wonderful greyhound stadium in Clonmel and another in Thurles. Very significant investments were made in them. They are a source of entertainment for rural people. There is an industry around them made up of the veterinarians and the suppliers of medicines and everything else. Families all over Tipperary and the country have love for their animals and for horse racing. As I said, I have no truck with people who neglect or mistreat animals. I support the animal shelters out there. They do not get half enough money. Some Deputies here who come out protesting think lurchers are greyhounds. That tells you what they know about the business and what is going on in it. I commend the motion and support it wholeheartedly.

It is important to ensure they achieve their maximum potential as they contribute to widely distributed economic and social development.The horse and greyhound racing industries make a valued contribution to a balanced regional economy. In overall terms it is estimated that the thoroughbred industry has an economic impact to the value of €1.84 billion, with direct and indirect employment of 29,000 people. The greyhound sector benefits an estimated 4,000 full-time employees. The thoroughbred industry in particular brings a high level of international investment into Ireland. The purpose behind the Exchequer funding model for these respective sectors, in addition to supporting these key industries, presents an opportunity to yield a high-return investment, leading to a flow of income right through the economy. The Irish equine breeding and racing industry is extremely competitive at a global level and is a real beacon of excellence. Ireland is the third-biggest producer of thoroughbred foals in the world. The support provided by public funds through investment in these industries has enabled Ireland to develop a world-class reputation for excellence in horse and greyhound racing and breeding. We hear a lot of people objecting, and sometimes one feels it is the same people all of the time, but I would strongly suggest they go to see where dogs are being kept, farmed and trained. The dogs are loved and cared for. I went to see one at Church Cross, Skibbereen, last year. I just rang and asked if I could call over and have a look in my own time. They were not expecting me to land in the yard. I had a walk around and my God, they are treating their dogs a lot better than the Irish are treating their own humans in the streets. Their animals are treated with the utmost respect. They are walked, they are trained, and they are bedded beautifully in warm surroundings. It is very easy to look at the negative side without at least looking at the positives there. I will be fully supporting this motion.

I come from a greyhound family and I grew up with greyhounds. In our house we had up to 26 greyhounds and they were better treated than I was myself, because if they were not walked and fed then I did not get fed. That was how much passion my father and family had for the greyhound industry. I was disappointed to see that the last time people were having a go at the greyhound industry, they said they brought a greyhound here to the front of Leinster House. It was a lurcher they brought to the front door. They did not even know what a greyhound was and yet they are against the greyhound industry. Previously, the Opposition in Sinn Féin voted with the Social Democrats against the greyhound industry in this House. I hope that the next time there is a vote on this they will actually see what the greyhound and horse racing industry can provide for this country and for the people and businesses of this country, and show the well-being in which these animals are held, how much people love their animals and how much they take care of them. I support the greyhound industry and I support the horse racing industry. I believe everyone else in the House would support them if they understood what they are. I do.

It is important that the issue is fully considered, that the funding is fully considered, and that there is very strong oversight of it. Certainly in relation to the Horse and Greyhound Racing Fund, that is very much the case. Unlike many other funding streams, this funding comes before the Oireachtas committee every year for a full examination and a full discussion. It is also subject to a full discussion here in the Dáil. I will go to the Seanad in half an hour for a full discussion in that Chamber also. There is a lot of transparency and oversight in relation to the expenditure. I am aware there are different views on this among many in the Chamber. It is absolutely fair that people would have different views. The Government is very clear and strong that the funding is something that should be in place and that it is very important for the two sectors. Indeed, the horse and greyhound racing sectors have developed over the years by virtue of the strong Government policies that have been put in place, and strong funding that is in place. In his contribution, Deputy Carthy outlined that Sinn Féin does support the Horse and Greyhound Racing Fund. He was very clear and very strong on that. I will be going to the Seanad now where no doubt Senator Boylan will be a lot less clear and a lot less strong and it and will give the impression that she is very much against the funding. I do not know from Deputy Carthy's contribution whether he will actually vote for the fund this year or not-----

The Deputy is trying to ride two horses at the one time, or as Deputy Cairns has said, to run with the hare and hunt with the hound. That is a difficult thing to do and it exposes the Deputy as not having a position on it. If the horse racing and greyhound sectors, for whom this funding is massively important, are depending on Sinn Féin to continue to fund the sector then they would be very concerned-----

On Deputy Kelly's contribution, the Deputy has been a consistent supporter of funding. He again makes the case about the 80:20 funding split and whether that is an appropriate way to do it. That is a fair view to have. Again, any Member can come forward with legislation on this. From my point of view, that level of consistency is actually constructive.

I am pleased to address the House on Second Stage of the Health Insurance (Amendment) Bill 2022. This is an annual technical Bill comprising eight sections, all focused on the specific area of health insurance. This legislation is required each year to revise the amounts of credits and levies, ensuring not only that the risk equalisation scheme operates in a consistent and fair manner but also that it generates sufficient income in order that it is self-financing. The amendments outline in the Bill will ensure the ongoing sustainability of the private health insurance market, with the aims of avoiding overcompensation being made to insurers and having fair and open competition in the market, as required under the EU framework for state aid. I will outline briefly the background and purpose of risk equalisation before outlining the specific provisions, which will apply next year. Over 46% of the population of Ireland holds private health insurance. That amounts to 2.4 million people and represents a total annual premium income of approximately €2.97 billion. Health insurance in Ireland is provided according to four principles: open enrolment, lifetime cover, minimum benefit and community rating. Unlike with other types of insurance, in our health insurance market customers are not charged based on their risk profile. That means that the premium charged for a particular health insurance product is the same for everyone. Insurers cannot take into account personal circumstances like health status risk or age, in which case older and sicker people would pay much more for health insurance than they currently do. Risk equalisation is a mechanism designed to support the objective of a community-rated health insurance market. The risk equalisation scheme has operated in the health insurance market since 1 January 2013 and is provided for under the Health Insurance Acts. Under the scheme, insurers receive risk equalisation credits from the risk equalisation fund to compensate for some of the additional costs of insuring older and less healthy members. Risk equalisation credits are funded by stamp duty levies. The levies are payable by health insurers on all health insurance contracts written and are paid into the risk equalisation fund. None of the stamp duty on health insurance contracts goes to the Exchequer; it is all used to fund risk equalisation credits. The risk equalisation fund is managed by the Health Insurance Authority, the independent regulator of the health insurance market. A health insurance Bill is necessary each year to update the amounts of risk equalisation credits paid to insurers and the stamp duty levies required to fund them. The rates of credits and levies are based on recommendations from the Health Insurance Authority following an evaluation and analysis of health insurance claims. The Minister for Health has approved the risk equalisation credits to apply in 2023 and the Minister for Finance has approved the corresponding stamp duty levies. As the risk equalisation scheme is deemed to be state aid, it must be approved by the European Commission. It was last approved in March 2022 to operate until March 2027. In addition to the standard technical amendments, this year's Bill provides for the specification of the end date of the act of entrustment. The act of entrustment is the legislative mechanism under which the risk equalisation scheme operates. This is a requirement of the European Commission as part of its approval of the risk equalisation scheme earlier this year. The Bill makes further provision for the appointment and powers of authorised officers of the Health Insurance Authority, thus strengthening the enforcement powers of the authority in carrying out its role as regulator of the private health insurance market. I will now outline the sections of the Bill. Section 1 defines the principal Act as the Health Insurance Act 1994. Section 2 amends the principal Act by inserting a new section 6B. The new section specifies the end date of the act of entrustment, the legislative mechanism under which the risk equalisation scheme operates, as required by the European Commission as part of its approval of Ireland's risk equalisation scheme. The end date for the period of entrustment should be viewed as a technical end date required under European law. The date matches the duration of the Commission's approval of the operation of the risk equalisation scheme. This section provides for an order-making power for the Minister to specify a new date after consultation with the European Commission and the Minister for Finance. This power will provide the Minister with the authority to extend the duration of the period of entrustment in exceptional circumstances in order to ensure the continuity of the risk equalisation scheme. Section 3 amends section 11C of the principal Act to provide for 1 April 2023 as the effective date for revised credits payable from the risk equalisation fund. Section 4 amends section 18E of the principal Act by making further provision for the appointment of authorised officers of the Health Insurance Authority. The amendments outline in more detail who may be appointed as an authorised officer and when the appointment may cease. It follows, insofar as possible, the Central Bank (Supervision and Enforcement) Act 2013, as amended. Section 5 amends section 18F of the principal Act by extending the current legislated enforcement powers to non-registered businesses purporting to be carrying on health insurance business in Ireland. This amendment bridges a limitation of the existing legislation, which permits investigation only of registered undertakings. Again, this section follows, insofar as possible, the Central Bank (Supervision and Enforcement) Act 2013, as amended. Section 6 replaces table 2 in Schedule 4 to the principal Act. The table revises the applicable risk equalisation credits payable from the risk equalisation fund in respect of certain classes of insured persons. The amounts are applicable on or after 1 April 2023. The Bill provides for a decrease in the age-related risk equalisation credits payable across approximately half the age groups over 65. These decreases are to facilitate the redistribution of high-cost claims credits, which result in a more targeted distribution of credits based on health status rather than age. Section 7 amends section 125A of the Stamp Duties Consolidation Act 1999 to specify the applicable stamp duty rates to apply to the market in 2023. As I outlined earlier, the risk equalisation scheme is Exchequer-neutral. It is not funded by the State, and the State does not derive any funds from it. The amount of stamp duty levy is calculated to offset the costs associated with the payment of risk equalisation credits. The Health Insurance Authority recommends the amount of stamp duty levy to the Minister, having regard to the risk equalisation fund sustaining surpluses or deficits from year to year.The amount of stamp duty payable on a health insurance contract depends on whether a contract is advanced or non-advanced. Non-advanced contracts provide for mostly public hospital cover, while advanced contracts provide a higher level of cover and cover in private hospitals mainly. For next year, the stamp duty payable on non-advanced health insurance contracts from 1 April 2023 will be €109 per adult, which is a decrease of €12 from 2022 rates and €36 per child, a decrease of €4. On advanced health insurance contracts, the stamp duty will be €438 per adult, this is an increase of €32 from 2022 rates and €146 per child, an increase of €11. A surplus of €55 million, or 7% of the fund, is expected next year as there was a lower level of claims on the fund than anticipated. The Health Insurance Authority recommended that this €55 million should be used to reduce the amount of stamp duty to be charged from 1 April 2023. The rates of stamp duty payable incorporate the €55 million surplus. This surplus has built up because of lower claims due to lower levels of hospitalisations as a result of Covid-19, and an increase in expected stamp duty receipts due to higher numbers of people entering the health insurance market than had been projected. Section 8 provides for the Short Title, commencement, collective citation and construction of the Bill. To summarise, this Bill allows us to maintain the community rated health insurance market. The provisions of the Bill increase the effectiveness of the risk equalisation scheme. Risk equalisation credits based on age are reallocated to those based on health status, in the form of high cost claim credits, without increasing the stamp duty payable, which is a fundamental support to the market. Importantly, the programme for Government commits to retaining access to private health care services for people in Ireland, ensuring choice for those accessing healthcare. This Bill continues our policy of ensuring solidarity with and affordable premiums for less healthy people or older people. These policy aims are supported by the public according to a 2021 Health Insurance Authority national survey, where 79% of those surveyed agreed that premium prices should not be dictated by a person's current health. The same survey confirmed 72% agreed that older people should not be charged more for health insurance.  Finally, while the Government continues to maintain the community rated private health insurance market, I will conclude by highlighting the Government's commitment to improving public health services under the Sláintecare programme. As access to these services improves, the Department will monitor the impact on the health insurance market over time. I commend this Bill to the House.

It is an annual Bill to review the risk equalisation mechanism that supports the community-based health insurance market. It revises the stamp duty levy on policies and the risk equalisation credits payable to insurers for 2023. It is a self-funded system. Risk equalisation as a principle ensures that costs are constant across the life span of the individual. It seeks to ensure where possible that age, gender and health status do not influence the cost of an insurance product. In 2021, 47% of the population was covered by private health insurance. That is not always because they want to, but because they feel that they have to. Many of the people I meet are not inclined to private market solutions to healthcare but such are the challenges in the public system that they feel they have no other choice. This is relatively constant across age cohorts but significantly lower among adults under 30 years and among people aged over 85 years. Even in the depths of the recession, 44% of the population retained their private health insurance and with more than 1.3 million people on some form of health waiting list, it is no wonder that half of the population hold onto their private health insurance. There are 897,000 people on hospital waiting lists. That is up 18,000 since September last year. More than 200,000 people have been waiting over a year and while I recognise that figure is down from last year, it is still nowhere near what needs to be done. There are also more than 200,000 people waiting for a diagnostic scan. More than 97,000 children are on hospital waiting lists and more than 100,000 children on community waiting lists and 18,000 on children's disability network team waiting lists. Behind every one of those numbers are real people with families who, in many cases, are waiting for access to care which should be provided much more quickly and better.  Because we are discussing health, I must point out that the Minister's waiting list strategy is failing. The targets that were set have not been met. They have been missed and they were too low in the first place. It was never going to succeed without a multi-annual plan. We are now reaching the mid point of this Government. There is a lot of talk about whether there will be a switch in different Departments. The switch in Taoiseach is certain; to me it is inconceivable that we would keep in place a Minister for Health who has served up waiting lists of 1.3 million people; where we have the challenges in the children's disability network teams and those in accessing home care for people because of the recruitment and retention issues and the myriad problems in the health service that simply have not been addressed. There is no multi-annual capital funding. That is necessary to deliver quicker delivery of hospital expansions. There is no strategic workforce plan. It is accepted by the Minister and the Government that the targets that we set ourselves in recruitment and training of healthcare professionals are too low. There is still no plan to deliver universal GP care or to expand primary and community care, other than the Minister throwing out big figures on budget day. There is no real plan behind any of it. There is no plan to address the shortage of home care supports, as I said earlier, or transitional step-down beds which is partly causing the problems in our hospitals. There is no roadmap to remove out-of-pocket charges and make all health and social care free at the point of use. That is certainly true at least of the charges that are non-hospital related. What we need is a much different plan for the healthcare system. Here today, we are dealing with the private health insurance market. If I get the chance of being Minister for Health, maybe that will happen and maybe it will not, I would want to do more to dismantle and disentangle private health insurance and the private health sector from the public system. That would be basic public service, whereby we would not have this deeply unfair but also very messy set-up we have in this State in which public and private healthcare are joined at the hip. Even in public hospitals we have huge amounts of private sector activity. There are consultants on contracts who do a mix of public here and private there. Recently, I had a case involving a chap I know who needs serious surgery. He went into the outpatient appointment and saw the consultant who told him he needed a certain procedure and that he could be waiting between 14 and 18 months. He had a follow-up appointment some weeks later and having thought about it, he said he would go to a private clinic in Waterford. He asked if he should get his GP to refer him to the private clinic only to be told by the consultant that he would make the referral because he would be the consultant carrying on the procedure in the private hospital. That is what is happening. That is the unfairness in the system. It makes no sense whatever for the patient. It might make sense for those who are profiting from our healthcare system but from a fairness and equity point of view, that is one of thousands of examples of people who are not getting the care that they need. Even those who have private health insurance do not always get full value for what they put in. They still have to pay. There are all sorts of surcharges when they go to hospital and they still have to pay for GP visits and lots of other out-of-pocket expenses for their healthcare.In some cases, those who pay for private health insurance to cover them if they become seriously sick, which is why people get private health insurance, pay not only a second time but also a third or fourth. During a cost-of-living crisis, that is not what we should be allowing. Once and for all, we must ask ourselves the fundamental question as to when we will get the break and seriously move towards decoupling private healthcare from the public system. I am in favour of public-only hospitals delivering public-only care. We need the new public-only contract in place. There should be a full-time contract for whatever number of hours a consultant must work in the public system. What consultants do outside that is a matter for them. I do not have a difficulty with that as I am pragmatic in that sense. The contract has to be for the public system, and the consultant has to do public work. That is the only way we are going to have truly public hospitals. We also have to substitute the private income that hospitals are getting with State funding to wean them off giving preferential treatment to private patients or those who might have private health insurance. Once and for all, we must grapple with the big dilemma in the healthcare system, acknowledging it is unfair, inequitable and not working. There is an awful lot to do and a long road to go before we realise the big promises of Sláintecare. I understand from the INMO that the number of patients on trolleys today was possibly the highest in the history of the State, or certainly close to it. This winter, we are going to have several pandemics or epidemics at the same time. We will have Covid on the one hand and the flu on the other. We have had a very mild winter to date but it will become much more difficult in the months ahead, yet I do not see any plan from the Minister for Health to invest in the public system other than to provide more outsourcing and money for private healthcare and medicine, which drives many to obtain private health insurance. I do not see the necessary investment being made in the public system to ensure we can deal with the challenges. We do not have the step-down beds to allow people to be transferred from hospitals. We do not have the beds we need in the first place. There are patients going to the wrong place at the wrong time for the wrong care rather than what Sláintecare promised, which was the right care in the right place at the right time. There are people going to emergency departments because they cannot gain access to out-of-hours pharmacy or GP services. They have no choice. Once and for all, we must deal with all these issues. The Bill is welcome insofar as it goes because it provides equalisation. Of course I support that but there are many things that need to be done in healthcare and far too many challenges for me to say any more than that. I contend, without wishing to create fear, that we could be heading into one of the most difficult winters ever faced by the Irish healthcare system. We are asking healthcare professionals, who are already burnt out, to step up to the plate again, to provide a line of defence and mask over all the failures of politicians and the Government. That will result in a bad outcome for patients and healthcare professionals. Much more should have been done.
#MartinKenny	unknown-#MartinKenny-party	unknown-#MartinKenny-dob	unknown-#MartinKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-11-30 00:00:00	Ábhair Shaincheisteanna Tráthúla - Topical Issue Matters	351	Of course we support the legislation before us, recognising there has to be a system in place to ensure equalisation for people with health insurance. Very many have health insurance because they feel they have no choice, their incomes being above the threshold under which they would be eligible for a medical card. It is not that a medical card is wonderful in many cases because patients still end up waiting for very long periods, particularly if they are seriously ill. The card gives them, or attempts to give them, the comfort of having something to fall back on or having their medical expenses covered if they have a serious illness or accident, and the comfort of being seen faster. The latter is the main thing people want. They wish to be seen faster and dealt with more efficiently and effectively in the private system, although this is often not the case. However, the insurance gives people a certain amount of comfort. The reality is that we have a public health system in chaos. The Minister of State, Deputy Feighan, and I know about the circumstances in Sligo University Hospital, which is in our constituency. Many of the consultants in the hospital, including senior ones, have been writing to the Minister for Health about the major problems in the hospital, the people on waiting lists who cannot get beds and the chronic overcrowding in the accident and emergency unit. All the time, we are told it is down to having more facilities, beds and staff. However, we have been promised these for years. I am aware that the Minister of State and my other constituency colleagues are all on the same page when it comes to delivering for our constituents but we must ask what has been delivered for the hospital since 2011, from which year the Minister of State's party has been in government. Very little has been delivered. The waiting lists are getting longer and longer. This points to why people opt for private insurance. A man said to me recently that although you pay taxes all your life, you have to write a cheque again when you get a health problem. That should not be the kind of society we have. We must do, and need to be, better than that. Another point I want to make on private health insurance concerns mental health. Many who have had a mental health difficulty find it very difficult to get private health insurance. That needs to be investigated very closely. It is the same for mortgage protection insurance. When people take out a mortgage or want to buy a home, if they can afford one in this country, they naturally have to get mortgage protection insurance. If they are truthful and state they have had a mental-health-related incident, such as depression, at some stage, it is very difficult to get the insurance. This is freezing those people out of the possibility of progressing in their lives. These issues are genuine ones that people deal with daily. Let me return to the matter at hand. I spoke to someone recently who said they had a scare with cancer but did not have health insurance. The person was really worried because they were told they would have to wait several months for an appointment with a specialist. In the context of the major crisis and the trauma for the family, the person rang VHI and got health insurance immediately so they would have it if things got worse. We need to recognise that we have to be better than that. We have to have a system that delivers for people when they need it, such that when they think they may have a problem with their health, they will not feel so scared that they take out their lives' savings and spend vast amounts on health insurance.  When anyone purchases anything in this country, he or she pays VAT on it. It is not just those who are in employment who are paying very high taxes; everyone is paying tax all the time and it all goes into the same pool. It should be available to help everybody, particularly those in need of health services at any time in their lives. While we support what is being done in the legislation – it has to be done because it is part of the system – the fact that we need the system is a poor reflection on our society. We should have a proper public health service, delivered to everyone on the basis of need and not the wealth they happen to have.

That is not a reality that we savour or are heartened by. In truth, we have a very poor model, a model that is expensive and ineffective because of the duplication that exists in the public and private systems. This is the case with several public services, unfortunately. We should have a system in which you pay your taxes based on your income and consequently expect decent public services, but the system we have means you pay your taxes and then, on top of that, pay €60 for the general practitioner, pay an inpatient fee, potentially pay for health insurance, pay a voluntary contribution to the school, pay third level fees and pay any amount of additional charges. My attitude is that people should be entitled to public services on the back of the taxes they pay and should not be asked to pay twice. The latter seems to be the model of the State. Nowhere is it more obvious than with health insurance. I support many of the calls my colleague Deputy Cullinane has made.It seems the Government is not pursuing the implementation of Sláintecare and its vision of a public healthcare system with anything like the vigour and enthusiasm that are needed. I urge the Government to move forward with the public-only consultant contract. It is a crucial step that must be taken. It will not be cheap by any means but it is an important investment in the future shape of our healthcare sector. It is absurd that having consultants working only in public hospitals with public patients would be a new development, but that is the case. It should not be beyond anyone's expectations for such a system to be in place but, unfortunately, the way our healthcare system has operated means it would be a radical departure. That is where we need to get to. I raise a specific issue relating to an anomaly that arises out of the Covid period. I will forward the details to the Minister of State. Many health insurance plans cover private procedures in public hospitals. There is good and bad in that system and it is not ideal in many ways. However, those are the policies that exist and are purchased by people. During the course of the Covid crisis, the State, in effect, took over many of the private hospitals. In fact, I would say it was, to a large extent, a formal takeover. Those hospitals performed public procedures. I had an X-ray in one of the private Cork hospitals as a public patient during that time. A person who contacted me had a procedure for glaucoma in a private hospital during the same period. He anticipated, as did his GP, that he would be refunded for it because the hospital to which the GP referred him for the purpose of undergoing the procedure was operating as a public hospital. Unfortunately, his insurer has taken a different view and despite the fact the facility was operating as a public hospital at the time, is not covering the procedure as what it was, namely, a private procedure in a public hospital. This is grossly unfair and I am sure this person is not the only one who has been caught by this. I will forward the details to the Minister of State and I ask that it be addressed. I have serious concerns about the healthcare system in the coming months. The number of people on waiting lists, at 897,000, is enormous. It is the guts of 1 million people. The number includes 97,000 children waiting for procedures, some of them very serious. A total of 200,000 people are waiting more than a year. I want to bring a particular focus on the 106 people who are on trolleys in Cork. It is important to note that we are far from being into the worst of the bad weather or the worst of the flu season. I have been calling for a number of months for a specific plan for Cork, which seems to be among the worst-affected areas in terms of pressure on beds. Some of that is because of the lack of follow-on facilities. We have fewer step-down beds now than we did before the Covid period, which is a huge problem. We need a tailored response for Mercy University Hospital and Cork University Hospital because the situation seems only to be getting worse. Cork has had some of the highest numbers of patients on trolleys in recent weeks and months. I urge the Minister of State to take that on board and to work with the INMO and the two Cork hospitals to put in place a dedicated plan to ensure we do not have more than 100 people on trolleys every day for the next couple of months. I do not mean to be alarmist but that danger is there and it is very concerning.

#DuncanSmith	unknown-#DuncanSmith-party	unknown-#DuncanSmith-dob	unknown-#DuncanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-11-30 00:00:00	Ábhair Shaincheisteanna Tráthúla - Topical Issue Matters	358	I thank the Leas-Cheann Comhairle. We have the same debate annually in which we amend the Health Insurance Act to modify the regulations governing the private health insurance sector. The whole goal of health policy at this time is the delivery of Sláintecare, that is, the delivery of a universal, single-tier healthcare system, with access for all and service free at the point of use. Sláintecare is silent on health insurance because the gamble is that once it is delivered, people will be so impressed, looked after and cared for in the universal one-tier system that the need for private health insurance will diminish. That is a big gamble to make. Until Sláintecare is delivered and we see the proof of the pudding, we do not know what the long-term future is for our private health insurance system. As long as we have such a system and it remains as large as it is, with 2.2 million Irish people having private insurance, we will have private healthcare in this country. As long as there is private healthcare, we will have a two-tier system. It is an unvirtuous circle. Until Sláintecare is truly able to deliver in our communities across a whole range of primary and community services, we will be back here every year dealing with this legislation and with what we have now, which is a health service that is across two tiers and is not functioning as well as it should. As a previous speaker stated, people who have private health insurance sometimes do not get the care they expect to get. In some instances, where people are let down by the public system and have private health insurance, they still cannot get the care they need. I refer specifically to speech and language therapy. There is a huge issue in communities all over the country whereby parents of young children who are facing speech and language challenges are told to go private. The first thing they do is call their private health insurer only to be told they are not covered for that service. They pay their taxes and are let down by the public system. They pay for private insurance and are let down by that system. They are in the private system off their own bat only to find the waiting lists are out the door. Even if they get an appointment and access to a service, they are paying on the triple for it. This is not good enough and it is another example of how our health system is fundamentally failing people at the point at which they need it. We are not getting the delivery of care right in the community. Most people in the country who understand and are engaged with the health service are 100% behind Sláintecare. They want to see it delivered but they are losing faith that the Government will do so. They do not see the required staffing numbers coming through or the levels of student intake that are needed in our third level institutions. The public sector unions that represent nursing and midwifery staff, healthcare assistants, doctors, physiotherapists and occupational therapists say we are not educating and delivering enough staff into the workplace. The healthcare staff who are coming through cannot afford to live in this country, cannot afford housing and are going abroad. We are not retaining enough of the people we are educating to Further Education and Training Awards Council, FETAC, and degree level. The staff who are currently in the system are being forced out of it. If they are in the capital city, they have to move down the country or go abroad. We are fundamentally failing in the delivery of the core part of our health system, which is about providing a workforce that can deliver Sláintecare and everything else we need. The Sláintecare progress reports we receive every quarter from the Minister include lots of green, amber and red indicators. The green lights seem to refer to administrative issues. They are not indicative of the delivery of services in primary care centres, healthcare centres, emergency departments or speech and language therapy clinics across the country. A version of this technical Bill comes around every year. I have a question on policy for the Minister of State, which I hope he will respond to at the end of the debate. Will community rating still be needed if Sláintecare is delivered? We do not know the answer to that. How much money is collected for risk equalisation under lifetime community rating due to loading penalties paid by people aged between 35 and 50 who do not take out health insurance before the age of 34? We recognise that this Bill must go through, but the fundamentals remain the same. We have more people on trolleys this month than we ever had before. December will likely be worse and January worse again. The perpetual crisis in healthcare, the lack of progress on Sláintecare and the fundamental continuation of our two-tier health system, underpinned by a massive private insurance system, are unsustainable because they are not delivering for the people of Ireland.

It is an issue that is dealt with in a similar Bill around this time every year to provide for risk equalisation. Risk equalisation is a mechanism designed to give effect to the objective of a community-rated health insurance market where customers pay the same premium for the same health insurance plan, regardless of age, gender or health status. The Health Insurance Acts provided for a risk equalisation scheme in 2013. Under the scheme insurers receive risk equalisation credits to compensate for the additional cost of insuring less healthy or older members. Some 45% of the population is covered by private health insurance. Those people pay over €2.5 billion per year in premiums. The Irish market is dominated by three main players. The statutory corporation, VHI, has a 51% market share, Laya has 28% and Irish Life Health has 21%. For many workers and families, health insurance is an unaffordable luxury. They make great sacrifices to pay for it, hoping they will not have to use it. Many people with health insurance scrimp and save to make up the consultant fees necessary to start the journey towards getting a procedure done under their health insurance. The only reason to pay is our health system. It is so bad that people fear the long waiting lists in public hospitals. There are hundreds of thousands of people on long waiting lists. The Government has no credible plan to address this. We need to fix the imbalance in healthcare in order to remove private healthcare from our public hospitals and our public healthcare system. Sláintecare is on life support and needs a major focus from Government to keep it going. We need to move away from a two-tier health system. There are many people falling through the cracks and earning too much to qualify for a medical card and too little to afford health insurance. Ability to pay should have no bearing on how you are treated by the healthcare system. People are languishing on waiting lists and getting sicker, while those with health insurance are fast-tracked to the front of the queue. In some cases, they are treated by the same doctors and even in the same hospitals. For those who have to wait their mental health is suffering and in some cases their life expectancy will be lowered. That is simply not good enough. Health insurance exploits a failed public health system, a public health system that Government policy has been trying to kill off for years because it favours a private health system. Treating our health service as a commodity is hurting those who need it the most, namely, the elderly and the working poor. My office is inundated with people who are in great pain and waiting for badly needed treatment. If delivered, this treatment would be life-changing. It is a disgrace that people have to go to their local Deputies to get letters sent to the Minister to wait weeks for a reply because the issue is brushed off to the HSE. The Minister of State needs to take responsibility for the mess and sort it out urgently.

The Bill also prolongs the scheme until 2027, following the European Commission's approval under state aid rules, and provides for changes to the appointments criteria and powers of authorised officers in the Health Insurance Authority. As a starting point it is interesting to look at some of the statistics that are emerging in health insurance. In 2021, premiums paid for health insurance totalled almost €3 billion, which were paid by almost half of the public. This was essentially a health tax . It completely disregards the social contract whereby people pay their taxes according to their means and get access to proper public services in return. That contract does not apply in this country. The Government is levying €3 billion on the public in order for them to get timely access to healthcare; that is what this amounts to. We have this symbiotic relationship between the private health service and the public health service where the weaker the public health service the better it is for business in the private health service. Sláintecare is all about creating a properly functioning public health service in order that people will have a right and a legal entitlement to access to timely healthcare. This would negate the need for private health insurance.
#SeanSherlock	Labour	18256	Cork East	speech	unkown-language	2022-11-30 00:00:00	Ábhair Shaincheisteanna Tráthúla - Topical Issue Matters	368	I move amendment No. 1:In page 3, after line 29, to insert the following:
“Report on provision and cost of community welfare officers
4. The Minister shall, within 6 months of the passing of this Act, lay a report before both Houses of the Oireachtas on the currently prevailing levels of provision of, and accessibility to, community welfare officers and on the additional recruitment and other costs that would be entailed in ensuring that a community welfare officer was available for consultation by members of the public in all social welfare offices during ordinary hours of business.”.I tabled this amendment because I wish to raise again the issue of community welfare officer service in the context of ensuring that people who need face-to-face meetings with community welfare officers will have that option available to them. I appreciate that last night the Minister categorically stated that such a service exists whereby if somebody wants to make an appointment, he or she can do so. We all recognise the vital service that community welfare officers provide. There is a sense, however, from my perspective as a typical constituency Deputy, that there are places throughout this State where this service existed once upon a time but where it no longer exists. In those areas, the service is moving away from the customer. The supplementary welfare allowance scheme is extremely important. The figures up to the end of September 2022 show that there is a range of services provided, including: support with bills; child-related payments; support with clothing; support with funerals; support with general housing needs; illness expenses; and urgent needs payments. Up to the end of September 2022, nearly €40 million was paid out.It is a vital service of which we are all very protective, including the Minister, because it gets money to people who need it the most: those who are at a risk of poverty. It is such a flexible way in which to resource people who so badly need resources across a plethora of payments. The discretionary element of it is so vital that it must be protected. The basis of the amendment is to ask that the Minister would lay a report before both Houses of the Oireachtas on the current prevailing levels of provision of and accessibility to community welfare officers, CWOs, and on the additional recruitment and other costs that would be entailed in ensuring a community welfare officer is available for consultation by members of the public in all social welfare offices during ordinary hours of business. The Minister may tell us that people have access to Intreo offices. We can take as a given the fact that most people have transport now, but not everybody does. I have witnessed scenarios where people do not have access to either public or private transport, who rely on taxis. For them to move away from the clinic type arrangement that once existed to now having to go to their nearest town, which could be 20 km or 30 km away, to avail of an Intreo service puts the service that bit farther away from them. All I am calling for in this amendment is that we would at least have some degree of an assessment of how the service is working and recognise the importance of it.

I would prefer not to put amendments on reports into legislation. That is my first point. When I say I will do a report, I will do it. Deputy Kerrane will agree with that. If I say I will do a report, I will do it, and I did do it last year. Like many Deputy across the House, I realise the important service provided by community welfare officers. Members will be aware from last night that a full-time community welfare office is located in all Intreo offices nationwide from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m., Monday to Friday, and in addition, community welfare officers remain available to attend clinics. They can talk to people over the phone and, where needed, they can also arrange to visit a person's house by appointment. We are genuinely doing everything we can to facilitate and help people. A client does not have to attend the office in person to make a claim or to make an inquiry about a claim. If it is more convenient for them, a client can call the community welfare service freefone line. A case can also be escalated if urgent local action is required, such as an immediate cheque payment. Where it is clear that a person has an immediate need, every effort is made to ensure he or she receives the payment on the same day. The delivery of a locally based community welfare service will continue to remain a key aspect of the service. That will not change. I am happy to do the report.

When we hear of unconfirmed reports about the creation of hubs within the Department itself on decision-making procedures, dare I say that we naturally become paranoid and suspicious. Paranoia in politics is no bad thing, as long as it is in small micro doses. We all have very good relationships with individual officers right across the system. It is an excellent Department that delivers so much for citizens. The supplementary welfare allowance legislation goes back to Frank Cluskey. The Minister will appreciate where the Labour Party stands in terms of protecting the supplementary allowance scheme and the role of the community welfare officer. I welcome the Minister's response and on that basis I shall not press the amendment. I am quite happy to withdraw it on the basis of the commitment I have been given.

It is very important. A number of Members in the Opposition have raised concerns, as have Government backbenchers, about community welfare officers and accessing them. As well as those of us in the Opposition, organisations like the Society of St. Vincent de Paul have raised concerns about accessing community welfare officers. We have been raising the issue for some time, so this really needs to be done. CWOs are going to be under huge pressure, as are people seeking their support in the days and weeks ahead. It is a pity this work has not been done by now. I am aware of two cases. They are not from my constituency but they were brought to my attention by colleagues. In one case a lady's fridge was broken and in another the cooker was broken. They relate to two separate areas of the State. They were both told they needed to get an engineer into the house to do a report to say the cooker and fridge were broken. In one case it was a very elderly lady. If she did not contact the local Deputy, she would probably have just done without. I do not know how many community welfare officers are raising this with people but I have heard of two cases. That is alarming. The committee suggested to the Minister she would have a ten-minute online meeting with all CWOs. That is very much needed if some CWOs are suggesting to people they must get an engineer to come in, look at the fridge and say it is broken. That is frightening. In terms of access to CWOs, in County Roscommon, for example, the Intreo office is in Roscommon town. One cannot get there from the likes of Ballaghadereen, where we have Ukrainians, Syrians and Afghanis, who all need support at different stages. The family resource centre is crying out for supports on their behalf. There is no CWO in the public health centre, which there had been previously. Does the Minister know how many people are available to take calls on the freefone line? I know she will not be happy to hear about requests for engineer's reports. Neither am I, but I am just making the point that it is important this is looked at. I would be very worried if elderly and vulnerable people were to be given messages like that by CWOs, especially at this time of year.

I have asked my officials to look into it. I was surprised when I saw it. Having said that, community welfare officers are compassionate people who do their best. We do not know all the details in the particular case, but I am having it checked as we speak. We will get to the bottom of it. I thank Deputy Sherlock for not pressing his amendment. I am happy to do the report, which will be done very promptly. The fund for community welfare officers is an open-ended one. There is no limit or cap on the money that is available. It is demand-led. That is the State's safety net. We all appreciate there must be some checks and balances in terms of how the money is paid out, but there is a safety net to help people who find themselves in difficult and emergency situations. We are here to help people at the end of the day.

I compliment the Minister and her colleague, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy McGrath, on a very comprehensive social welfare budget to tackle the high cost of living. I know from dealing with constituents that they very much welcome the increases that have been announced, which have already been paid out. It was right and proper the Government was in a position to do that. I share the concerns of other speakers about CWOs, not that they are insufficiently flexible or compassionate but that they are simply snowed under with the volume of work they must do with the new people who have moved to Ireland and the increased pressures on residents locally.They are not even able to process some of the applications in a timely fashion, but the purpose of being able to present to the CWO relates to being able to get access to those funds in a timely fashion. The Minister will be aware I raised a specific case with her office regarding a family who require an exceptional needs payment. They work part time and are subsidised by the working family payment. Their eldest son is 22 years of age, and because of the cut-off, they cannot get an adult dependant on the payment any longer despite the son going into his fifth year of studying medicine. He is still in full-time education and the family still have the same costs associated with that, but they are down €2,500 per annum. They have been unable to get a social welfare payment or an exceptional needs payment. I might share with the Minister an extract from a text message I received from the son's mother the other evening. It states:I don’t feel the social welfare will grant me exceptional needs payment and at this stage I need to know as the stress over the last number of weeks has been awful on us as a family wondering from day to day is my son staying or leaving college. I had a chat last nite where I just broke down and cried uncontrollably for what seemed a long time. My 22 year old son held me and told me it was ok [because] he knows I do everything in my power to keep him in college but the system is flawed - at aged 22 no longer considered a dependant. That needs to change for others in the future. I am a broken woman but my son is my best reward and we have both now accepted he won’t become the doctor he dreamed of being. I can’t go through this for another 2 years; I just can’t. What a waste of almost 4 years of college, and a waste of the government money too.She went on to thank me for my intervention. We need people to deal compassionately and flexibly with these kinds of issues. I understand the cut-off of 22 years because most college places last for four years rather than five or six years, but someone studying, say, medicine, dentistry or veterinary medicine will have to attend college beyond the age of 22 years. We need to respond to a case such as this when it is raised with us. We need to consider extending the age bracket beyond 22 years if the applicant is in full-time education and is not repeating a year. If that is not permissible, we need to intervene and give some financial support for the likes of this young man, who has, against the odds, come from a lower socioeconomic background, studied exceptionally hard, achieved an exceptional leaving certificate, was admitted to study to medicine, has passed the first four years of his course and is now potentially going to drop out because we cannot make the necessary intervention. If we cannot do that, we are failing this family and I do not want to see that happen. I do not want to undo all the exceptional good work the Minister did in the lead-up to this budget and in previous years, and I ask her to take a personal interest in this file and to ensure this young man will get to realise his ambition and become a doctor.

The text message he received is very emotive, and we all deal with cases of people in difficult positions. There is a cut-off age here. I acknowledge the Deputy tabled an amendment but it was ruled out of order because, if I am to change the rules in the way it sought to do, that would have considerable budgetary consequences. Twenty-two is the cut-off age, and if I changed it to 23 or 24, that would involve a massive call on resources. I would say to that family that there a number of supports, through the Department of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science, such as the Student Universal Support Ireland, SUSI, grant. Additional resources and money have been provided for that and there has been a reduction in the fees. I do not know what else I can say. There are supports and that is what we are doing. We are trying to help people but I cannot change the rules for one specific person, as I hope the Deputy will appreciate. The cut-off age for the qualified child allowance is 22 years of age. I have a copy of the request he sent to me. To be fair, it relates to an ongoing cost as opposed to an exceptional needs cost, so I think the family probably need to examine whether there are any other routes they can explore. I know the Deputy will be more than willing to help them do that to see whether any other options might be available to them.

#SeanSherlock	Labour	18256	Cork East	speech	unkown-language	2022-11-30 00:00:00	Ábhair Shaincheisteanna Tráthúla - Topical Issue Matters	380	I move amendment No. 3:In page 4, between lines 6 and 7, to insert the following:
“Report on impact of employee PRSI contributions on minimum wage employees
5. The Minister shall, within 6 months of the passing of this Act, lay a report before both Houses of the Oireachtas on the impact of employee PRSI contribution rates on workers earning the national minimum wage, having regard both to the pending increase in the national minimum hourly rate of pay and to the proposed transition to a Living Wage.”.We are back to the issue of reports but, unfortunately, we are now restricted to that in legislation of this nature. They are the only way we can have scope to push back at the Government. On Second Stage, the Minister stated:Weekly earnings in excess of €410 attract employer PRSI at a higher rate of 11.05%. The earnings threshold increase from €410 to €441 in section 4 is designed to take account of the forthcoming increase in the minimum wage from €10.50 to €11.30 per hour.Employers with employees benefiting from the increase in the national minimum wage will continue to attract the lower rate of employer PRSI.The amendment seeks to provide for some sort of an assessment of how that increase is impacting on both the employer and the employee in terms of the potential perceived loss of real income as a result of the increase in PRSI contributions. I seek some clarity from the Minister on where she and the Department are in respect of how, in real terms, the increase in the minimum wage will work. We do not want to have a negative impact, in real terms, on real income whereby increasing wages will be offset by increases in PRSI. I anticipate the Minister will tell me that, in real terms, that will not be the case and there is a provision for that, but in putting forward the amendment I am seeking further clarity on whether, if there is to be an increase in the national minimum wage, it will be worthwhile for an employee to receive that increase whereby it will not be taken away in taxation.

The recent Government decision regarding the introduction of a national living wage stated the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, in conjunction with the Low Pay Commission, which is under its aegis, will pursue options to improve median wage estimates with the Central Statistics Office and the Revenue Commissioners. Officials in my Department have produced analyses of proposals to address the employee and employer PRSI step effect that arises when the national minimum wage is increased, and this is being shared with officials in the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment. My officials and I will continue to work with the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment and officials at that Department on this issue, but given that work has begun and is ongoing, I do not propose to produce another report on the issue. Nevertheless, I will keep the Deputy informed.In fact, was the Deputy not a former Minister in that Department? I think he was. Maybe he was not; I am sorry. He is very familiar with the system anyway. I will share that report and whatever we have with the Deputy. I get his point, however. We do not want to increase the minimum wage and then maybe make somebody worse off. That is not what we want. It is not what we are about. I understand that at the minute, a person must pay PRSI on anything over €350 per week, but it is then tapered and gradually increased up to €424 per week.

I do not propose to withdraw the amendment. I propose to press it because I think it is vital. I note the Minister's response with regard to the work that is ongoing with the CSO, Revenue and various line Departments. I want to ensure that tapering tax relief issue is essentially nailed down, however. Obviously, there is an impact for the employer as well that cannot be underestimated, particularly for small employers and small companies, entities and holdings. It is, therefore, my intention to press the amendment.

“Report on extending availability of full Parent’s Benefit to Lone Parents 
9. The Minister shall prepare and lay a report before the Houses of the Oireachtas on extending the availability of the full duration of Parent’s Benefit to lone parents to examine the effect that enabling all children to equally avail of the full duration of this Benefit would have and the report shall be presented to the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Social Protection within 9 months of the enactment of this Bill.”. This is an issue I raised with the Minister previously, which relates to parent's leave and benefit. At the moment, there is a leave period of seven weeks which, of course, is welcome. In the case of a lone-parent family, the newborn will have seven weeks with the parent whereas a two-parent family will have 14 weeks. I do not believe that is fair. It would be positive and welcome if the Minister would agree to look at this. This would affect a very small number of people and, therefore, would not cost a lot. It is not fair that a child in a lone-parent family should be disadvantaged versus a child in a two-parent household. Those parents only get half of the same leave entitlement and time spent with their child at such a young age. In fairness, it should be looked at.

I will point out that in line with the provisions of the EU work-life balance directive, parent's leave is not transferable between parents. That comes under the EU directive, which recognises the importance of equality between men and women with regard to labour market opportunities and the equal importance of men and fathers in bringing up their children. It should encourage an increase in men taking leave and equal participation in care work, thus achieving gender equality and investing in the development of children. A provision to allow one parent to take the dual entitlement to leave would place an increased burden on that individual's employer. As the Deputy is aware, an employee's eligibility for parent's benefit follows his or her eligibility for the associated leave. Assuming the contribution and other qualifying conditions are met, the arrangements regarding parent's leave are a matter for my colleague, the Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth. Of course, this leave must be taken in the child's first two years. As I said, there is a report on the matter, which I will be very happy to share with the Deputy as soon as I get it.

I understand the issues around having both parents and equality and all of that. It is not fair on children who have just one parent, however. A child with two parents will have 14 weeks whereas a child with one parent will have only seven weeks. It is not fair on a child who for whatever reason has one parent, even if, God forbid, the other parent is deceased. That is not fair on the child. Given that the report is being done, however, I will accept that and withdraw the amendment.Section 9 agreed to.

Section 69(1) of the Principal Act is amended, in the definition of “medical examination” by the insertion of the word “virological” after “bacteriological,”.”. I will speak to amendments Nos. 5 and 6 because they are the same. I do not wish to tick tack back and forth on the same set of amendments. I tabled amendments Nos. 5 and 6 on the issue of long Covid, about which I spoke at length during Second Stage of the Bill. I want to see long Covid designated as an occupational illness for all front-line workers who contracted the virus due to their employment. We need to see long Covid listed as an occupational illness, allowing front-line workers to avail of long-term income assistance until they are actually fit to return to work. At present, only healthcare workers who were out sick prior to 15 November 2021, which was prior to the Omicron variant of SARS-CoV-2 being detected, are able to avail of paid leave. This will cease in June of next year if they have not made a recovery that allows them to return to work within that period. This applies only to public sector workers who contracted the virus prior to 15 November of last year. All other front-line workers, including healthcare workers who are out sick due to having contracted long Covid as a result of picking up the virus in work, are now excluded from any support through their employer. This applies to any front-line workers outside of the public service who contracted long Covid as a result of their employment, as they are also excluded from the occupational illness schemes. I understand from a EUROSTAT survey carried out last year that the only two member states of the European Union that have categorically ruled out making provision for long Covid as an occupational illness are ourselves and Greece. Denmark, Italy, Latvia and Slovenia have put in place specific provisions. Other countries such as Norway and Israel have also done that. It acknowledges the fact that people who were in front-line, people-facing jobs during the pandemic and subsequently contracted the virus and ended up with long Covid are getting support.We asked them to run our hospitals and supermarkets and support people with disabilities. We are talking about a very small cohort of people as a proportion of all those who contracted the virus, but we are now turning our backs on those individuals. That is not fair or right. I know healthcare workers have taken this up with the Minister, Deputy Donnelly, and that he has come back to the workers in correspondence advising that officials in the Department of Social Protection, who operate the national occupational injuries benefit scheme, said Covid-19 does not constitute a prescribed disease or illness as set out in the Social Welfare Consolidation Act, of which we are aware, and that these officials have no intention of revising this position. That is not good enough. For healthcare workers, an arbitrary date of 7 February 2022 has been chosen, prior to which they had to be out of work for 84 days. I have asked for the basis for choosing the 7 February date and for the 84 days prior to that, which brings us back to 11 November 2021. There is no basis for it. These dates have literally been plucked out of the sky and we are completely excluding from any support anyone who contracted the Omicron strain of the virus, which was the most contagious strain of the virus, even if that person was a healthcare worker. Other front-line workers are also being excluded. Long Covid is costing at least half a billion euro in lost work and welfare costs alone. The data provided by the Minister to me have shown that 0.81% of all those who contracted Covid-19 and who claimed enhanced benefit were still out of work 12 weeks later. If that were to be extrapolated to the population, it would equate to €586 million in lost welfare payments and wages. Some of these healthcare workers - I gave an example in the House on an earlier occasion - have gone to very significant financial cost themselves in trying to manage this illness. I gave the example of one young fit woman, a specialist clinical physiotherapist, who has gone to a plethora of private clinics, which she has paid for, and now has a monthly bill for medication of €270, which is not covered under the General Medical Services, GMS, or the drug refund scheme. She is receiving zilch from the State, even though she worked right the way through the pandemic. Because she ended up with the Omicron strain and subsequently ended up with long Covid, she is being ignored. There are hundreds more people in a similar situation. Will the Minister seriously consider acknowledging that long Covid is debilitating and that, in a certain number of employments, the infection has in all probability been developed and picked up through those employments? Those people need to be acknowledged by the welfare system and I very much ask the Minister to consider these amendments.
#SeanSherlock	Labour	18256	Cork East	speech	unkown-language	2022-11-30 00:00:00	Ábhair Shaincheisteanna Tráthúla - Topical Issue Matters	399	I wholeheartedly support Deputy Naughten’s proposed amendment because more of us are interacting with people who are definitively feeling the effects of long Covid. The amendment is a reasonable one in that it seeks to have a report laid before the House on particular measures, especially, as stated in the amendment, in designating long Covid as an occupational illness. We all have first-hand experience, based on our interactions with our constituents, particularly front-line workers. If something can be devised or constructed to recognise that formally within the Department of Social Protection to ensure there is a payment process in recognition of it, that would be wholeheartedly welcomed.

We have a duty of care to health workers, cleaners etc., in particular, to those workers we asked to work in retail shops, and to all those working in areas on the front line. If we received a report on this, we might then seriously consider there should be an occupational illness for people with Covid-19. I have met so many people in my constituency who have contacted me about being ill with neurological symptoms, and not so much issues with the lungs. This has been consistent and one particular woman, Miriam Cullen, who was in the Dáil when Deputy Naughten’s Bill was going through in Private Members’ time, has been out of work since the very start, practically, in March 2020. All of her family got it because her mother was ill at the time and was in a nursing home. She cannot and has not been able to work since then. This is something we should look at seriously. This is a new illness and we should be recognising it.

I will speak, as the Deputy himself has, on the next two amendments together. I am not prepared to accept the first amendment, and I will explain that shortly, but I am prepared and happy to do a report. My Department is monitoring the work and the recommendations of the European Commission in this regard, and I understand the Commission has published its recommendations on occupational diseases this very week. I can assure the Deputies that my Department and the other Government bodies concerned will give very careful consideration to the Commission recommendation, which I have not seen myself. The Deputy’s proposed amendment provides for the inclusion in the definition of the medical examination the terms “virological” and “bacteriological”, and I am happy to consider that in the context of the report. The report will require consultation with the stakeholders, the Department of Health and the Health and Safety Authority, following consideration of the EU Commission’s recommendations. I am not averse to arranging for such a report to be conducted and I assure the Deputy I will do that. The Chief Medical Officer of my Department, however, has warned that because Covid-19 was so widespread, adding long Covid as an occupational illness in the Statute Book could be difficult. We are happy to look at it. Conducting a report on this important issue is timely and I will be happy to do that. As part of that report, I will look specifically at the Deputy’s proposal and I am happy to see what we can do at that stage. If we change this legislation now before we do the report, that would, in a manner of speaking, be putting the cart before the horse. As I have said, I am happy to do the report and to take into consideration the Deputy's proposed amendment. I will talk to the Minister for Health and to the Chief Medical Officer.

I would love if we had a situation where we could amend the legislation. We cannot propose that, as the Minister knows. She is meeting me halfway and I acknowledge that. I accept this is not a black and white situation. Covid-19 was widespread. My point, however, is that, in all probability, the vast majority of those front-line workers contracted that virus through their employment. We have the position where, on the basis of probability, the State has paid in respect of medical conditions. A precedent is there for that. I will make one final point.This was adapted unanimously by the House at the start of this month when we brought forward our proposals. One was that healthcare workers would get proper provision now and beyond June 2023 and the second was that provision would be made in the occupational illness scheme.  On the basis of the response the Minister has given, I am prepared to withdraw both amendments and we will see what the Minister comes back with.

“Report
 13. The Minister shall, within 6 months, lay before both Houses of the Oireachtas a report on the application of the provisions contained in this section to TÚS and Rural Social Scheme Supervisors and Assistant Supervisors.”. The amendment seeks equality of treatment for community employment supervisors. There is provision in the legislation under sections 12 and 17 for the ex gratia scheme for community employment scheme supervisors and assistant supervisors. The same provisions should be made for Tús supervisors, rural social scheme supervisors and assistant supervisors. We should not force those cohorts of supervisors to go through the same long and protracted Labour Court negotiations to end up with the same result at some stage down the road. More and more of those staff are coming close to retirement and the same principles reply for Tús and rural social scheme supervisors as for community employment scheme supervisors. I ask the Minister to take this amendment on board and make provision for an ex gratia payment for all the supervisors across these schemes.

However, I have to set out some facts relating to the ex gratia payment. It is a complex issue as community employment, CE, workers are not State employees. This agreement was reached with both unions representing supervisors, SIPTU and Fórsa, arising from a 2008 Labour Court recommendation on pensions for CE supervisors and assistant supervisors. The agreed ex gratia payment is in respect of workers covered by that recommendation and not any other group. It does not apply to rural social scheme or Tús workers. The agreement I reached with the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Michael McGrath, to enter discussions with unions to resolve this long-standing and complex issue was strictly on the basis that any agreement reached with unions was ring-fenced for this group of CE workers. At all stages, both unions agreed that the discussions and any agreement only applied to the group of workers covered by the 2008 Labour Court recommendation. Following a ballot of members, both unions confirmed agreement to the settlement reached by my Department in consultation with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and that settlement resolves any issues relating to the 2008 recommendation.  I am pleased to say the processing of claims received to date is well under way. We have received around 624 claims for the payment and 480 are processed and ready for payment. It is my intention that these payments will issue following the enactment of the Bill. Hopefully, we will have them through to them before Christmas. I will report to the Oireachtas on the matter.

The Minister knows I raised this last week and before that. Age Action Ireland has performed a strong analysis and found that the increases in the pension and working-age welfare payments have lost their spending power. Based on inflation to date and the Government's projected rate of inflation for 2022 and 2023, working-age payments will have lost €32.27 per week in spending power by the end of 2023 and the State pension will have lost €42.54 per week, despite the additional €12 from January. This loss of spending power is so extreme because of the cumulative effect of inflation. A nominal €10 in December 2023 will only afford a person what €7.76 would have bought in December 2020. By the end of 2023, a working-age welfare payment of €220 will buy 15.9% less than €203 would buy in December 2020. The €265.30 State pension income will buy 17.1% less than the €248.30 payment bought in December 2020. Raising welfare by €20 in 2023 would not erase most of this lost spending power but is the least that must be done to limit the inevitable increase in poverty and deprivation next year. I am not arguing that the one-off payments are not helping people. They are, but we are talking about a baseline. There have been calls before to keep pension and working-age payments in line with inflation. We have not seen the type of inflation we have seen in the past year or year and a half, so it is more important that we look at it and bring forward a report on it. I will give the Minister some figures for the working-age payment by year. In December 2020 it was €203. There was no annual loss of spending power. In December 2021, it was €203, that is, for two years there was no increase. The loss of spending power was €10.62 per week or €554 per year. In December 2022, it was €208. The loss of spending power per week was €20.71, which was €1,080 for the year. In December 2023, it will be €220 and the loss of spending power will be €32.37 per week or €1,688 per year. The figures are strong and warrant a serious look. There should be a report on indexing of social welfare payments with inflation.

As part of the Roadmap for Social Inclusion 2020-2025, the Government committed to finalising an approach for the benchmarking and indexation of pension payments and to consider and prepare a report for Government on the potential application of the benchmarking approach on a wider basis to other welfare payments. I am happy to share that report with the Deputy when it is complete. Work is ongoing on it. In September, I announced a series of landmark reforms to the State pension system. The measures provided by the Government are in response to the recommendations from the Commission on Pensions and represent the biggest ever structural reform of the Irish pension system. As part of this, a smoothed-earnings method to calculate a benchmarked, indexed rate of State pension payment will be introduced as an input to the annual budget process and will be submitted to the Government by the Minister for Social Protection in September each year, starting in 2023. As the Government has approved this approach to pension payments, potential benchmarking approaches to other social welfare payments will also be examined. We are doing this as part of the roadmap for social inclusion and I hope to publish it early in quarter 2 of next year. While I am not accepting the amendment, I have already committed to prepare a report on the benchmarking and indexation of social welfare rates. I give the Deputy my word that it will be done.

“Report on rates based on Minimum Essential Standard of Living (MESL)
16. The Minister shall carry out a review on introducing social welfare rates which are benchmarked to the Minimum Essential Standard of Living (MESL) to study the effect that adequacy of social welfare rates could have on addressing poverty levels and the report shall be presented to the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Social Protection ahead of Budget 2024.”.In light of what the Minister has just said about a report in quarter 2 of next year and the potential benchmarking and indexation of social welfare rates beyond the State pension, as already planned, will the minimum essential standard of living, MESL, be looked at in that regard? I have raised this issue many times. It is important to have our social welfare rates at a level where they protect people from poverty. That should be the basis of any social protection system. I ask the Minister to clarify that.

Regarding the MESL, my Department has used this research as a key input into consideration of budget options in recent years. I value the insight this research provides and it will form part of the consideration of next year's benchmarking review. Improved access to services such as the extension of the GP-visit cards for children and the affordable childcare scheme can result in significant reductions in the minimum income standards needed by households. In this respect, the MESL relates to issues wider than just social welfare rates and it would not be appropriate to carry out a review in isolation. However, consideration of MESL will be included in the review that I mentioned earlier. On this basis, I have already committed to preparing a report on benchmarking and indexation of social welfare rates and that will be done. I am happy to do that report.

I am satisfied with that in respect of amendment No. 10. As I have mentioned to the Minister many times, I believe the blind pension, in particular, needs to be looked at and I welcome that it will be reviewed through the work already under way. I have used this example before. I have a lady in the office who is blind. Her partner got a promotion at work, which was great news, but as his income increased, she lost her blind pension. She is blind, but as far as the Department is concerned that is just tough. That needs to be reviewed. I welcome that work will be under way. I intend to withdraw amendment No. 10. Regarding amendment No. 11, the Minister will have engaged with disabled artists and disabled academics regarding artists in receipt of the disability allowance and the blind pension. With this amendment I particularly want to focus on one issue. If an artist in receipt of blind pension or disability allowance wins a bursary or an award of funding through the Arts Council, that is great. However, it is taken in its entirety as income and assessed in its entirety by the Department regarding their income support. That part of the amendment should be looked at because winning something or getting an award should not be treated as income when it comes to disability allowance and blind pension for artists. It impacts the development of artists and I ask the Minister to look at it. The group has brought this to the Minister. It has also made suggestions on the creation of a disabled self-employment support scheme and there are other issues. However, the classification of income should change. Bursaries, commissions, awards and grants awarded by the Arts Council should be disregarded when it comes to blind pension and disability allowance. Let us allow the artists in receipt of those income supports to continue with their art and if they do well, they should enjoy that award or that bursary without its impacting on their income support on which they are heavily dependent.

I said I would review all those schemes. This review will with cover the treatment of income and disregards across schemes generally and will therefore include the examination of thresholds and their impact for both the blind pension and the disability allowance scheme. I take the Deputy's point about somebody who has won a grant to do a particular piece of work as an artist. I understand where she is coming from now. Regarding the disabled artists assistance that the Minister, Deputy Catherine Martin, introduced, it is very hard for me to say that that payment should not be taken into account as income if there is a different treatment for a disabled person who is not an artist working another job. It is very hard to say that one disabled person is more deserving than another. It is a difficult space to be in. I did change Catherine's Law when we established that Catherine Gallagher had a disability and was going to lose out on her bursary to finish her education. We were able to do something on that. I will do this review and I will take on board at what the Deputy has said. The disabled artists made a pre-budget submission and attended the pre-budget forum. We will look at that when we are doing the reviews.

“Report on extending the provision of Disability Allowance to agents in the case of the bereavement of a child
16. The Minister shall review the rule regarding the continuation of Disability Allowance payment where a person is the collecting agent for their child who passes away and prepare a report on extending payment of the payment for six weeks in these circumstances in line with the provision made for payments such as Domiciliary Care Allowance and the report shall be presented to the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Social Protection within 9 months of the enactment of this Bill.”.I have raised this case with the Minister previously and she is well aware of it. Tracy McGinnis raised it on the death of her beloved son, Brendan Bjorn, earlier this year. Because he was over 16 and therefore in receipt of disability allowance as opposed to domiciliary care allowance, his payment was automatically stopped on his death. The payment of domiciliary care allowance continues for up to 12 weeks. There is an error in the amendment. What I asked and indeed the amendment I sent the Minister back in June or July is for those 12 weeks to align disability allowance with domiciliary care allowance. I do not believe this will cost much. It is only for those cases particularly where there is an agent, in this case it was Tracy McGinnis, Brendan's mother, who collected the payment on his behalf. In raising this issue as we approach Christmas, I am also conscious that it will be a really difficult time for Tracy and her family. I ask for this issue to be looked at. When I raised it back in June and July, there was a commitment to look at it. I understand the Department is looking at. This is something really positive we can do so that when a young person aged 16 or over on disability allowance in the care of parent passes away, there would not be that cliff edge there. I do not mind how many weeks it continues for but it should continue on for a number of weeks just to give that recognition and to ensure that there is not a financial cliff edge for a parent when a child passes away. As far as I am concerned it does not matter if they are 16, 17, 18 or 20.

We think about her and we extend our thoughts and prayers to her as she faces Christmas without her son, Brendan. It cannot be easy for her. I was in touch with her recently about a separate issue. I appreciate where Deputy Kerrane is coming from on this matter. She is coming from a good place and I recognise that, but there are two main issues here. Domiciliary care allowance is paid for three months after a child passes away, but it is different. First, domiciliary care allowance is a monthly rather than a weekly payment. Second, domiciliary care allowance is paid to the family, not the individual. Disability allowance is different in that it is a weekly payment and it is paid to the person with the disability in their own right. It is important to say that if a person is providing care to a child with a disability, then carer's allowance will continued to be paid for 12 weeks after the child passes away. This is one of the issues that we will look at as part of the reform of the long-term disability payments. As I outlined last night, I intend to publish a straw man proposal on those reforms for consultation shortly. That straw man proposal will look at everything, including linkages and the interplay between domiciliary care allowance and disability allowance. I have not forgotten about the matter. It will be looked at as part of those wider reforms of disability payments.

“Report on including apprenticeships as education for social welfare payments 
17. The Minister shall prepare and lay a report before the Houses of the Oireachtas reviewing the inclusion of apprenticeships in the definition of “full-time education” and with regard to how this is approached in determining eligibility for Social Protection payments and the report shall be presented to the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Social Protection within 6 months of the enactment of this Bill.”.This is an issue I raised with the Minister earlier in the year. I had been contacted by a parent who is in receipt of the guardian's payment. She looks after two children and she has done for most of their lives. In the case of the son, he wants to do an apprenticeship. The guardian's payment continues up to the age that the child turns 22 if they are in full-time education, but apprenticeships are not listed as full-time education. I appreciate that apprentices are paid while they are on the job, but for the guardian, there is a cost when their child goes into or continues in full-time education. Whether they are in school, in an apprenticeship, or in college, there is a cost there. The guardian's payment is not very high and I think consideration should be given to what I am suggestion. We are at the stage now in the State whereby we really need to be encouraging apprenticeships. In fairness, the Government has made moves to do so. That is welcome. Yet, I do not think we should be differentiating, particularly when it comes to the guardian's payment. There are cases where there is a guardian who is taking care of a child and they choose to continue in education, but if they choose an apprenticeship over going to college, the payment will not continue. I ask that the Minister might look at this again. I do not think that there will be a huge number of people concerned because I do not believe that the guardian's payment involves a major amount of money. I ask the Minister to look at that, especially at a time when we are encouraging apprenticeships.
#SeanSherlock	Labour	18256	Cork East	speech	unkown-language	2022-11-30 00:00:00	Ábhair Shaincheisteanna Tráthúla - Topical Issue Matters	421	I support Deputy Kerrane's amendment. This is a time when the Government, to be fair to it, and the Minister for Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science, Deputy Harris, are putting particular emphasis on apprenticeships. There is now a clear Government policy around resourcing apprenticeships. We want to see more apprenticeships coming from right across the demographic spectrum, particularly in instances where people have not attained points for third level institutions and they may be thinking about apprenticeships to create that environment where they are encouraged to take up apprenticeships without the loss of any element of their household income. In that context, I support the amendment.

As the Deputy knows, the overall policy responsibility rests with my colleague, the Minister for Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science and his Department. This year, the National Apprenticeship Office was established jointly by SOLAS and the Higher Education Authority. It is the lead agency responsible for apprenticeships on behalf of the Government. In general, a person who is participating in an apprenticeship is not eligible to receive a jobseekers' payment. I am advised that apprentices are primarily considered as employees and that apprenticeships are undertaken under contracts of employment. For the majority of apprenticeships, the rate of pay is agreed between the apprentice and the employer, with the employer paying the apprentice during both on-the-job and off-the-job training elements of the apprenticeship. Apprentices earn while they learn and they have employment contracts. They are paid for the duration of their apprenticeships and they can access other social welfare supports. An apprenticeship is not an obstacle to, for example, claiming one-parent family payment, provided that the other conditionalities of the scheme are met. In the case of craft apprenticeships, periods of off-the-job training are funded from the National Training Fund. Payments are made by the education and training boards during such periods. In some instances, the education and training boards will also contribute to travel and accommodation costs. Deputy Kerrane specifically referred to the guardian's payment. I will certainly look at that but I cannot accept the amendment.

However, the Minister for Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science redirected me to the Minister, Deputy Humphreys, because of the impact it would have on social welfare supports. I understand that there can be some income supports when one is on an apprenticeship. The Minister cited the one-parent family payment in this regard.

I believe that because of that it should be looked at. The Minister has agreed to do that, which I welcome. In that case, I will withdraw the amendment. I thank the Minister for agreeing to look at the guardian's payment.

This matter was raised on Dáil Committee Stage and, having examined the issue, I will bring these providers into the scope of the scheme. As the Government amendments address the substance of the related amendments tabled by Deputies today, amendments Nos. 93, 96, 98 and 99, I will not be accepting those related amendments.  Amendment No. 102 seeks to require that, in developing a scheme, coimisiún na meán shall have regard to developing impartial journalism through the medium of Irish. In the context of this particular scheme, which is directed towards training in respect of good journalistic practices, I do not believe it necessary to make reference to the language in which that journalism is provided to the public. However, while I do not accept the amendment, I do agree with the objective of developing journalism through the medium of Irish. The purpose of amendments Nos. 4 to 6, inclusive, is to clarify that the definition of "programme schedule" in the Bill encompasses both audiovisual programmes and sound programmes and that references to "programmes" in the definition of “sound broadcasting service” are references to sound programmes. Amendment No. 7 corrects a typo in the definition of "video-sharing platform service". These amendments are being proposed as a result of engagement with the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel. The purpose of amendments Nos. 8, 9, 16, 18 to 27, inclusive, 30, 31 and 33 is to align the wording in the Bill regarding the roles of the Minister with responsibility for coimisiún na meán and the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform in respect of certain financial and staffing matters with the wording in the public spending code. As such, they are technical amendments and do not have any substantive effect on the Bill. Amendments Nos. 51, 74, 79, 128 and 129 fix a number of typos and clarify punctuation.

During the course of Committee Stage, I undertook to come back to Deputy Ó Snodaigh on the proposal to substitute "Coimisiún" and "Coimisinéir" for "Commission" and "Commissioner" wherever mentioned in the Bill. As the Deputy referred to, I wrote to him in this regard on 16 November. As he has said himself, I understand and agree with the underlying intention of the proposed amendment but, at this stage, it would require more than 500 individual amendments to be read, moved and voted on, which would be onerous and burdensome. However, I will seek Government approval to bring forward a single amending provision to affect the necessary changes for inclusion in future legislation as soon as is practicable.This would be an efficient and effective way to achieve the intended aim. As I set out in the letter, the current approach in the Bill fulfils the requirement of section 9D(1) of the Official Languages (Amendment) Act 2021, once sections 4 and 5 of that Act are commenced, because it provides that the legal name of the new regulator is to be coimisiún na meán. The reference to commission and commissioner is for interpretive purposes for the English language version of the Bill. Is í fírinne an scéil ná gur féidir an cuspóir atá taobh thiar de na leasuithe a moladh a bhaint amach trí leasú amháin ar an mBille nuair a achtófar é. Ag an bpointe seo, bheadh os cionn 500 leasú ag teastáil chun an leasú mar a bhí beartaithe. This is the reason, as Deputy Ó Snodaigh has said, that once this becomes an Act it can be done with one amendment in the future.

Currently, independent academic researchers, digital analysts and policy experts cannot access the data from social media companies they need to do their job to protect the interests of the public. As I highlighted on Committee Stage, the purpose of amendment No. 10 is to address this by giving the commission or headquarters of online regulation the power to deem appropriately what information should be given over and the power to compel those companies to do so. This issue was also highlighted in the joint committee work in pre-legislative scrutiny where the committee recommended that provision be made in the legislation to enable public-interest research based on data provided by regular platforms. Amendment No. 35 is a new amendment based on discussions that took place on Committee Stage on this issue. I accept that the issue is difficult to legislate for, but I do not believe we should leave this legislation today without having made some inroads on the issue. The amendment is a simple one that calls for experts within the commission to examine the issue as was raised by the joint committee and by several witnesses, and to make recommendations on same.

It should be explicitly linked to its functions. This is why the Bill provides for these powers in relation to designated online services and their compliance with online safety codes. Under the Bill it will be an offence for them not to do so. On amendment No. 35, the Digital Services Act sets out a detailed process by which this may be done. The Digital Services Act came into force on 16 November. My colleague, the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, leads on the implementation of the Digital Services Act in our national law. Dealing with this in the Bill would duplicate and pre-empt that work. Therefore, I do not accept these amendments.

Baineann an leasú seo le ceist chur chun cinn na Gaeilge sna meáin agus ról ceart a thabhairt don choimisiún. Táimid ag díriú isteach ar shraith mhór leasuithe. Is mór an trua é gur dhiúltaigh an tAire, i ngach uile chás, an Ghaeilge a chur cinn sna meáin nuair a bhí na leasuithe seo os comhair an choiste ní rófhada ó shin. Bhí sí den mheon go raibh roinnt acu unnecessarily restrictive. Ba é an rud a bhí i gceist againn ná cinntiú go mbeadh na daoine a bheidh i gceannas ar na meáin Ghaeilge in ann an Ghaeilge a labhairt. Ní fheicim conas a bheadh sé sin ródheacair a thuiscint. Ní raibh an tAire sásta fiú a rá sa Bhille gur chóir don choimisiún aird a thabhairt dá chuid polasaithe féin maidir leis an nGaeilge agus leis an nGaeltacht. Maidir le leasú Uimh. 12, ní bhfuair mé freagra maidir leis an bhfáth a tharla sé sin sa choiste. Ní raibh an tAire sásta go mbeadh an Ghaeilge san áireamh i ráiteas straitéiseach ach oiread. Is rud simplí é sin a mbeidh gá leis amach anseo. Ba é an freagra a tháinig ar ais chugainn arís agus arís eile sa díospóireacht ar na ceisteanna seo ná gurb é an fáth ar diúltaíodh glacadh le haon leasú lena lorg muid tuarascáil ón gcoimisiún nua ná go bhfuil athbhreithniú cuimsitheach ar sholáthar seirbhísí trí Ghaeilge sna meáin molta ag coimisiún eile, coimisiún nach ann dó níos mó, agus go dtabharfaidh an coimisiún faoi seo ag am éigin amach anseo. Bhí muid ag triail a dhéanamh cinnte de go mbeadh sé sin mar cheann de na chéad dualgais a bheidh ag coimisiún na meán agus go dtuigfeadh an coimisiún go mbeadh air aird a bheith aige ar a dhualgais atá air maidir leis an nGaeilge a chur chun cinn, go háirithe ó thaobh na meán Gaeilge, thar an tréimhse ina mbeidh sé ag obair. Mar sin, cén fáth nach bhfuil fiú tagairt don athbhreithniú cuimsitheach seo sa Bhille? Luadh nach raibh gá leis an leasú toisc go bhfuil an t-athbhreithniú ag tarlú. Tá sé tarlaithe ach níl sé le feiscint ina iomláine sa Bhille seo.  An mbeadh cumhacht ag an Aire athbhreithniú a lorg ón gcoimisiún amach anseo fiú? Beidh an coimisiún neamhspleách. Is féidir linn athbhreithniú a lua ach ní féidir déanamh cinnte de go dtarlóidh sé sin toisc go bhfuil coimisiún na meán neamhspleách. Má tá eagras neamhspleách, ní féidir le hAire ach treoir a thabhairt dó. Ní féidir leis nó léi dualgas a chur air é sin a dhéanamh. B'fhéidir gur féidir an t-airgead atá ar fáil don eagras a tharraingt siar nó ainmniúcháin a bhaint ó bhaill an bhoird ach tá sé sin deacair agus is é sin an fáth gur chóir go mbeidh na spriocanna agus na róil iomlána leagtha síos i dtús báire. Chinnteodh leasú Uimh. 13 go mbeidh athbhreithniú straitéiseach ar an nGaeilge sna meáin. Má tá an tAire dáiríre faoin athbhreithniú ar an nGaeilge sna meáin, ba chóir di tacaíocht a thabhairt don leasú seo ach go háirithe. Má ghlactar le leasuithe Uimh. 28 agus 29, beidh coiste bunaithe ar a mbeidh daoine le Gaeilge amháin chun tabhairt faoin obair seo. Tá gá ann go dtuigfidh an coimisiún cad atá ag teastáil ag daoine faoi mhíchumas, Gaeilgeoirí faoi mhíchumas san áireamh, nuair atá codanna nua a chur le chéile aige. Ba chóir nach mbeadh fotheidil i mBéarla amháin. Tá tráchtaireacht fuaime ag teastáil sa dá theanga oifigiúil. Is é sin an tuiscint a dtagann ón moladh atá againn i leasuithe Uimh. 65 agus 67. Tá gá le leasuithe eile chun an ceart an Ghaeilge a úsáid ar líne a chinntiú. Is é sin an fáth go bhfuil leasú Uimh. 81 ann. Dúirt an tAire ar Chéim an Choiste go mbeadh sé unfair to single out any language nuair a bhí sí ag cur i gcoinne an leasú sin. I am not singling out any language. Táim ag cur chun cinn an teanga náisiúnta, ceann den dá theanga oifigiúil.Tá dualgas ar leith ar an Rialtas agus ar an Aire, mar an Aire atá freagrach as an nGaeltacht agus as an nGaeilge, an Ghaeilge agus an Ghaeltacht a chosaint agus a chur chun cinn. Tá leithcheal á dhéanamh ar pobal labhartha na Gaeilge agus na meáin Gaeilge in Éirinn, agus is faoin Aire atá sé é sin a chur i gceart. Sin iarracht dul tríd na leasuithe sin chomh gasta agus is féidir.

As I set out on Committee Stage, I believe the intention of amendments Nos. 11 and 12 is already provided for in paragraphs (c) and (e) of section 7(3) of the Broadcasting Act, as substituted by section 7 of the Bill. Mar sin, ní mholaim glacadh leis na leasuithe seo. I will not accept amendment No. 13 because an coimisiún will undertake a comprehensive review of the provision of Irish language services across the media system on foot of a recommendation of the Future of Media Commission.  I thank the Deputies for proposing amendments Nos. 28 and 29. Section 19 of the Broadcasting Act 2009, as inserted by section 8 of the Bill, provides that an coimisiún may establish committees to assist and to advise it on matters relating to its functions or on such other matters as it may determine. The effect of the amendment would be to mandate an coimisiún to establish a committee that would monitor and report on compliance with obligations and propose recommendations on the use of the Irish language across the media. While I appreciate the intentions behind this amendment, I cannot accept it. I have some worries about mandating the establishment of multiple committees in legislation as, notwithstanding the language used, that tends to fix the subject matter of the committee to a moment in time. Accordingly, I am advised that it is more appropriate to allow an coimisiún the flexibility to define the terms of reference of any committee established pursuant to section 19. I do not propose to accept amendment No. 34 because, as I said on Committee Stage, it may imply there is a hierarchy of objectives of an coimisiún. It is intended that an coimisiún fulfil all its statutory functions, from online safety to the promotion of programming in the Irish language, and set them out in its statement of strategy accordingly. Amendment No. 53 would infringe on the editorial freedom of both advertisers and media service providers and, in any case, we are addressing this through section 10A of the Official Languages Act, as amended, which will, when commenced, require public bodies to spend at least 20% of their advertising budgets on Irish language advertisements, with at least 5% to be placed through Irish language media. Amendment No. 36 seeks to make statutory provision for a consultation on the provision of a dedicated Irish language youth radio service. As I have previously noted during this Bill's passage through the House, I will not accept this amendment because the Future of Media Commission recommends that coimisiún na meán undertake a comprehensive review of the provision of Irish language services across the media system. The results of the review will inform the development of any actions necessary in this area. Amendments Nos. 43, 48 and 50 are similar in intent to amendments proposed in the Seanad on gender and nationality quotas in respect of musical works. I carefully considered those proposals and, on foot of legal advice from the Attorney General, decided not to introduce any provision for them on Committee Stage but, instead, sought and obtained Government approval to draft amendments to provide that coimisiún na meán may make media service codes to promote gender balance on news and current affairs programmes broadcast by broadcasters and made available by providers of audiovisual on-demand media services and to promote the broadcasting of musical works that are composed or performed by women in programmes broadcast by providers of sound broadcasting services. The issue of quotas raises complex legal questions. There are already clear avenues for us to take action to support Irish language programming through increased funding and supports. For example, I have increased funding for TG4 by 40% since I entered office, from €37.2 million in 2020 to €52.2 million in 2023. That is the basis for my rationale for not accepting these amendments. I thank the Deputies for amendments Nos. 65 to 67, inclusive. These amendments would have the effect of requiring media service rules relating to accessibility to reflect the needs of Irish speakers. While I fully welcome the intent behind the amendments, I am of the view that it would be appropriate to defer the introduction of such a measure until coimisiún na meán, on foot of a recommendation of the Future of Media Commission, undertakes a comprehensive review of the provision of Irish language services across the media system. This would allow coimisiún na meán to assess fully the capacity of the broadcasting sector in respect of the accessibility of Irish language content. This review could then inform future updates to the rules coimisiún na meán makes in respect of accessibility. Mar a dúirt mé cheana, ba é ceann de na moltaí a rinne an Coimisiún um Thodhchaí na Meán ná go ndéanfaí athbhreithniú cuimsitheach ar sheirbhísí agus ábhar Gaeilge ar fud chóras na meán. Ghlac an Rialtas leis an moladh sin. Déanfaidh coimisiún na meán an t-athbhreithniú seo, agus táthar ag súíl go dtógfaidh sé 18 mí chun é a chríochnú. Leag Coimisiún um Thodhchaí na Meán roinnt ceisteanna amach ina thuarascáil ar ceart don athbhreithniú díriú orthu, lena n-áirítear ról RTÉ, TG4, Raidió na Gaeltachta agus soláithrithe ábhair. Ina theannta sin, moladh go scrúdódh an t-athbhreithniú deiseanna do chomhoibriú agus do chomhpháirtíocht amach anseo, straitéisí le haghaidh rannpháirtíochta óige, cláir óige agus oideachas. Cé nár mhian liom talamh slán a dhéanamh de mhionsonraí athbhreithniú neamhspleách an choimisiúin, bheinn ag súil go mbeadh an próiseas leathan go leor chun na ceisteanna a d'ardaigh an Teachta a chlúdú. Táim ag súil freisin go ndéanfaidh an coimisiún, go háirithe an coimisinéir um fhormhaoirsiú na meán, agus an coiste Oireachtais plé ar an ábhar seo. I thank Deputies Ó Snodaigh, Munster and Mythen for amendment No. 81. As I set out on Committee Stage, I cannot accept the amendment because it would be inappropriate to pick out only two EU languages in the context of this Bill transposing the audiovisual and media services directive. As important, though, the amendment would appear not to reflect the fact that Irish and English are separate languages and that a word or phrase which may be functionally equivalent in one language may carry entirely different implicit meanings or connotations in the other, which may cause either or both to fall within a particular category of harmful online content. I therefore cannot accept this amendment.

Tá roinnt rudaí le plé agam agus tuigim cad atá á rá ag an Aire. Ní raibh mé ag súil go mbeadh athrú poirt aici inniu ón méid a bhí ráite roimhe seo ar Chéim an Choiste. Tuigim go bhfuilimid ag iarraidh go mbeidh coimisiún na meán chomh neamhspleách agus is féidir. Fós féin, táimid ag leagan síos na dualgais atá ag an gcoimisiún sin agus is é sin an méid a dhéantar i reachtaíocht. Ba chóir go mbeadh an ról iomlán atá ag an gcoimisiún seo i bhfad Éireann níos soiléire maidir leis an nGaeilge agus cur chun cinn na Gaeilge, í a chosaint, agus mar sin de. Is é sin an iarracht a bhí á déanamh againn sna leasuithe seo. B'fhéidir nach bhfuil siad chomh soiléir is a shíl mé a bhí siad ach ní raibh aon rud ann ag teacht salach ar an neamhspleáchas sin. Ní raibh ach tuairiscí i gceist agus aitheantas a thabhairt don ról agus don stádas atá ag an nGaeilge thar an ról agus an stádas atá ag an mBéarla, toisc gurb í an Ghaeilge an teanga náisiúnta. Tugadh ról bunreachtúil don Ghaeilge agus ba chóir go mbeadh an chosaint agus an cur chuige sin ann di ón tús.  Féadfaimid dul tríd na leasuithe ar fad ach níl mé chun moill a chur ar Theachtaí eile dá bharr sin agus déanfaidh mé iarracht teacht ar ais ar an ábhar seo ar Chéimeanna eile. Mar a dúirt an tAire, tá na coistí againn agus beidh tuairisc nó taighde cuimsitheach ag teacht amach anseo. Déanfaidh mé iarracht a dhéanamh cinnte de sin nuair a bheidh an coimisiún ag teacht os comhair an choiste, agus nuair a bheidh an tuairisc acu amach anseo. B'fhéidir gur cúpla bliain a bheidh i gceist sula mbeidh an coimisiún os comhair choiste Dála agus go mbeidh roinnt de na ceisteanna seo le freagairt aige maidir leis an méid atá déanta ag an gcoimisiún maidir leis na gnéithe seo.  Críochnóidh mé leis seo ach maidir le leasú Uimh. 36, dúirt an tAire ar Chéim an Choiste go mbeidh tuarascáil ón Broadcasting Authority of Ireland, BAI, faoin stáisiún Gaeilge, an cainéal raidió do dhaoine óga, roimh dheireadh na bliana. Dúirt sí le déanaí ansin ó shin go mbeadh sé sin curtha gcrích i meán mí Eanáir. Níl a fhios agam cén uair atá sé i gceist aici é sin a dhéanamh. Aithním an obair mhaith atá déanta maidir le TG4 féin agus an dul chun cinn ansin ach cuirim ceist anseo maidir leis an stáisiún Gaeilge do dhaoine óga.

As I set out on Dáil Committee Stage, the Bill already addresses the issue, which is essentially about the co-operation of regulatory bodies on the issue of gambling, by setting out that coimisiún na meán must co-operate in relation to the regulation of gambling with any public body concerned with that matter and this will enable an coimisiún and the gambling regulatory authority when established with the flexibility to determine as independent regulators their necessary level of co-operation and engagement. This means that on establishment, an coimisiún will co-operate with the existing public bodies responsible for gambling and will also co-operate with the gambling regulatory authority when it is established.

Pléadh na leasuithe seo cheana féin. Ba chóir go mbeadh Gaeilge ag na daoine atá freagracht acu sna meáin agus ba chóir go mbeadh dualgas ar leith ann ó thaobh líon na gcoimisinéirí a bheadh Gaeilge acu. Ó thaobh líon na foirne de, tá Acht na dTeangacha Oifigiúla (Leasú), 2021 tar éis a mhaíomh go mbeadh Gaeilge ag 20%, ar a laghad, díobh siúd a bheadh earcaithe roimh 2030. Tá mise ag lorg go mbeadh Gaeilge ag 20% den fhoireann agus sin an fhoireann atá ann faoi láthair san áireamh. Chomh maith leis sin, ba cheart go mbeadh Gaeilge ag 50% de bhord RTÉ. Tá sé sin simplí, soiléir agus sothuigthe, ach go háirithe toisc go bhfuil an dá theanga oifigiúil ann agus toisc go bhfuil teanga náisiúnta againn sa Bhunreacht. Tugann seo meas agus aird ar an nGaeilge i dtús báire. Dá nglacfaí leis seo b'fhéidir go bhféadfaí neamhaird a thabhairt ar na leasuithe eile a bheidh mé ag cur chun cinn mar b'fhéidir nach mbeadh gá leo mar go dtiocfadh sé go huathoibríoch ó Ghaeilgeoirí go mbeadh gá meas, tacaíocht agus cosaint á dtabhairt don Ghaeilge agus don Ghaeltacht. Seo rud nach dtarlaíonn go minic ar bhoird Stáit nuair nach mbíonn Gaeilge ag an bhfoireann ar fad nó ag duine ar bith acu.

Ní ghlacaim le leasuithe Uimh. 15, 17 nó 69, toisc, mar a luaigh mé ar Céim an Choiste, go ndéanann siad macasamhail d’fhorálacha Acht na dTeangacha Oifigiúla, 2003, mar a leasaíodh é, nó, i gcás leasú Uimh. 17, go bhfuil sé sriantach gan ghá. Amendments Nos. 15, 17 and 69 all seek to require a minimum number of members of staff or commissioners in coimisiún na meán to be competent in the Irish language. It is important to set out the overarching legislative background that has been in place since the enactment of the Official Languages (Amendment) Act 2021 last December.  Section 18C(3)(b) of the Official Languages Act 2003, as amended, now provides that the Irish Language Services Advisory Committee established under the Act shall have regard to the objective of increasing, by 31 December 2030 at the latest, the number of staff of public bodies who are competent in the Irish language such that at least 20% of staff recruited are competent. As I have previously indicated, the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland is specified as a public body in the First Schedule to the Act and so, by virtue of the transitional provisions of the Bill, coimisiún na meán will be considered a public body under the Act. On that basis I cannot accept amendment No. 15, which seeks to replicate the provisions of section 18C(3)(b) of the Official Languages Act within this Bill.  Similarly, I cannot accept amendment No. 17, which would require that no fewer than 30% of commissioners and 20% of staff of coimisiún na meán would be proficient in Irish. The Official Languages Act provides the basis for an objective which applies across public bodies. I do not see the merit in seeking to apply a specific requirement to coimisiún na meán.  As the Irish language services advisory committee continues its work over the coming years, consideration could be given to requiring competency in the Irish language for one of the commissioner posts. However, it is important that we retain flexibility in this regard to ensure the widest array of candidates are available on establishment of coimisiún na meán. Accordingly, the best way for providing for that recruitment is through the recruitment process for commissioners, rather than in legislation. Amendment No. 69 would require that no fewer than 50% of the board members of RTÉ be proficient in the Irish language. As I noted on Dáil Committee Stage, a provision of this kind would be at odds with provisions for membership of State boards more generally.  With regard to the criteria necessary for consideration as a member of the board of RTÉ, section 82 of the Broadcasting Act 2009 already provides that candidates must have “experience of or shown capacity in”, among others, “matters pertaining to the development of the Irish language”.  I do not believe that specific provision as contemplated by the amendment, over and above that already provided for, or in addition to the provisions for membership of State boards more generally is necessary.  As Deputy Ó Snodaigh noted, the new chair of RTÉ who was appointed yesterday, Siún Ní Raghallaigh, is a former chair of TG4 and a fluent Irish speaker which I think will stand to her in her new role.

Níl a fhios agam an ardú céime é ach tá súil agam go mbeidh ról mór millteach aici sna meáin. Tá a fhios agam go bhfuil sí tiomanta an Ghaeilge a chur chun cinn agus go bhfuil sin tábhachtach. Ní shin an cás a bhí ann thar na blianta ar bhoird Stáit dhifriúla timpeall na tíre. Sin an fáth leis an leasú seo. Ní ag caitheamh anuas ar aon duine atá i phost faoi láthair nó roimhe seo atá i gceist leis seo. Níltear ach ag déanamh cinnte de, nuair a thagann athruithe amach anseo, go mbeadh muid cinnte go mbeadh an cathaoirleach líofa sa Ghaeilge nó inniúil ar aon chaoi; go mbeadh an coimisiún timpeall orthu; agus go mbeadh an Ghaeilge le tuiscint acu siúd a bhíonn ag obair ann. Gan an tuiscint sin bíonn sé i bhfad Éireann níos deacra déanamh cinnte de go bhfuil an Ghaeilge i lár an phoirt nuair a bhíonn céimeanna á nglacadh ag an gcoimisiún, nuair a bhíonn tuairimí á roinnt nó nuair a bhíonn moltaí á ndéanamh. Sin an fáth go bhfuilimid ag déanamh iarracht sa chás seo déanamh cinnte de go mbíonn an Ghaeilge agus an Ghaeltacht i lár an aonaigh maidir leis na meáin. Ba chóir go mbeadh seo mar cheann de na gnéithe a mholtar maidir leo siúd a roghnófar amach anseo. Chuala mé go bhfágtar an Ghaeilge go dtí an próiseas roghnúcháin. Ní leor sin. Ba chóir go mbeadh sé leagtha síos i bhfad Éireann níos luaithe agus ba chóir go mbeadh an Ghaeilge chun cinn.

When I was the Minister responsible for communications and during Committee Stage of this Bill, I argued, having regard to the costs associated with and the regulation of broadcasting, that we need to acknowledge the vital role of local radio in providing a public information service. I have given the Minister examples from the time of Storm Ophelia and the Beast from the East, which were in 2017 in 2018, respectively, when we did not have the Internet, electricity, television or mobile phone coverage. The only communications service to which people had access was the radio. It was not possible for any national broadcaster to give local information on what was happening by way of road closures, electricity supply, the closure of schools, etc. The local radio stations provided that service. Within the legislation, there needs to be an acknowledgement of that. Having engaged with the Minister's officials on this, I note the legislation provides for a reduced levy for the local radio stations. The difficulty, however, is that local radio has its back to the wall. It has gone through considerable pressure and strain in the past couple of years as a result of Covid. The advertising budgets available to local radio stations have been squeezed and squeezed. I request, therefore, that the levy be suspended for 2023 while the new commission is being established. I am not asking for the levy to be abolished but for a reduction for one year and one year only, namely 2023, to acknowledge the seriousness of the situation facing the local radio station network across the country. The cost of the reduction or suspension of the levy would be approximately €2.5 million for 2023. This is a small fraction of the substantial subsidy given to the newspaper industry through the VAT reduction, which was an acknowledgement of the impact on the print media owing to the loss of advertising revenue. There has been no acknowledgment of the local radio stations. I ask that we acknowledge the very serious financial challenges and the current financial environment of local radio stations across the country. They have been put under severe financial pressure. They are not being helped now by the pressure on advertising budgets across the board as a result of contracting budgets right across our economy. To acknowledge the vital public service role that local radio stations play, I request that the levy be suspended for 2023. I plead with the Minister to take on board this proposal. We do not want to divide the House tonight. Right across the House there are many Members who support the proposal. Let us come to an agreement to waive the levy in 2023 and start afresh in 2024, when the new commission will be established.
#CiaranCannon	unknown-#CiaranCannon-party	unknown-#CiaranCannon-dob	unknown-#CiaranCannon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-11-30 00:00:00	Ábhair Shaincheisteanna Tráthúla - Topical Issue Matters	477	I am aware from speaking to the Minister that she is more than aware of the value and power of local radio to engender a deep sense of community and solidarity in rural areas. She is from County Monaghan so she will understand this. She has spoken to me numerous times about the power of local radio. Deputy Naughton quite rightly mentioned the power of local radio to disseminate crucial information at times of crisis in rural regions. This became crystal clear to me during the pandemic. On Galway Bay FM, the morning current affairs programme hosted by Keith Finnegan essentially became the go-to repository of and resource for crucial information on how to gain access to the pandemic unemployment payment and other supports, which were being rolled out almost overnight in certain cases in the very early stages of the pandemic. Elderly people living on their own had been unsure about how to access the supports. They were not left to feel alone, simply because they had the radio on the kitchen counter. There was a conversation they could tune in to. That is the essence of local radio. The sector has been in existence for over 20 years, but, as Deputy Naughton points out, it is still recovering from the pandemic and finding it really difficult to chart a way forward commercially for its stations. During the pandemic, we found a way of suspending the levy in acknowledgment of the very difficult circumstances in which the sector found itself.Although it is, perhaps, not in quite such a difficult situation right now, it is far from financially viable. I ask the Minister to look at all options available to her to support the sector in navigating the next 12 months in particular. There are companies that are reducing their advertising budget. In addition, we are seeing a lot of those budgets migrating away from local radio and commercial radio in general and over to social media platforms. That is a significant factor in the reduction of advertising revenue available to local radio stations. I ask the Minister to use whatever resources, instruments and tools are available to her to support the stations over the next 12 to 24 months while they find a way of navigating back to viability. There needs to be a focus on that. As I said earlier, I know she is cognisant of the challenges they are facing and she will do her very best for the sector, working in collaboration with them and supporting them through the difficult months ahead.

Local stations' news updates and delivery of up-to-the-minute happenings during the pandemic and during storms contributed enormously to public safety and in no small way to the saving of lives. Their economic challenges following the pandemic have multiplied threefold. Advertising has dropped significantly, putting tremendous strain on stations such as my local station, South East Radio. The sound and vision scheme will not be sufficient to meet the requirements of maintaining a quality service, including the delivery of live news, talk-based programming and current affairs. The viability of local radio stations is on the line. The Minister has it in her remit to accept this amendment, which would go a long way to protecting these community-based, community-driven and community-supported radio services.

When I mentioned music at the committee, the Minister said I was getting to the soul of the matter. Local radio goes beyond the usual in what it provides, all of which we have become used to having. During the pandemic, as Deputy Cannon mentioned, it was there to broadcast the local mass. It provided a service, especially for people living alone. Last Sunday, there was a fatal accident beside my house, following which roads were closed and diversions were set up. It was the day of the replay of the Galway county hurling final between the Loughrea and St. Thomas clubs. It was great to have the diversions in place to allow people to get to the match in Galway city and go about their normal business. When we had flooding in Galway, a road would be flooded in the morning and by noon that day, another one would be under water. All of that information was put out by the local radio station. It was given during breaks in musical programmes or as part of current affairs broadcasting. I reiterate the point about the pressure local radio stations are under right now. It would be a great gesture if the levy were deferred for 2023. Taking into account what was done in regard to the VAT rate on local newspapers, this would be equally appreciated by and acceptable to everybody concerned. Given the jobs involved and the pressure the stations are under, a one-year deferral would give the Minister a chance to look at the situation within the overall scope of how she will deal with the levy into the future. It would be a great gesture for the radio stations, giving them a lifeline that would ensure they can form their businesses into something that will be viable in the aftermath of the Covid period.

There is a strong argument for a reduction in the levy given the service provided by local radio and the role it plays within communities the length and breadth of the State as part of its public service remit. There is also an argument to be made that a reduction in the levy is justified for local radio stations given that they pay the exact same levy as other stations with a much bigger audience and much greater resources. It seems unfair that they should be penalised by having to pay the same as others that are in a much better position, especially given the vital public, information and community service they provide.
#CatherineMartin	unknown-#CatherineMartin-party	unknown-#CatherineMartin-dob	unknown-#CatherineMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-11-30 00:00:00	Ábhair Shaincheisteanna Tráthúla - Topical Issue Matters	482	As a proud Monaghan woman, I fully agree with the Deputies on the public service value of the independent radio sector, particularly at local and regional level. I am sure Deputy Munster and I, living near each other as we do, listen to and value the same local and regional radio. Local radio stations are the very essence of public service broadcasting and, as Deputy Cannon and others said, they have proved a lifeline for many, particularly at the height of the Covid crisis, by providing critical local information and a vital sense of community when it was most needed. Regarding the calls for the broadcasting levy to be suspended or reduced, we must keep in mind the regulatory principle that a regulated service should only contribute to the cost of functions related to that service. That is the intention of subsection 21(5) of the Bill. It is an important principle based on legal advice. Therefore, it is not possible for the levy on designated online services to be used to fund a reduction in a levy on broadcasters. This is an argument that was also made to me in a submission. Exchequer funding for 2023 for an coimisiún is an interim measure to enable it to get started quickly on its new functions. One of its priorities will be the preparation and making of a levy order to ensure it becomes self-funding as soon as possible in respect of its full range of functions and to ensure online platforms pay a levy to fund the regulation of those entities and their activities. The amendment proposes that, "The Minister shall within 180 days of the passage of this Act lay before the Houses of the Oireachtas a report on provision for a reduction in the levy in recognition of the public information service provided by independent radio stations." I am very conscious of the challenges facing the independent radio sector. While I do not believe this legislation is the appropriate vehicle to address immediate economic pressure facing the sector, I am cognisant of the concerns expressed by Members and the sector itself. Although I do not propose to accept the amendment, I acknowledge Deputy Cannon's request that I look at all options. To that end, I intend to ask the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland, BAI, this week to engage with the sector with a view to understanding the dynamics of the current economic environment and its impacts on the sector. I am conscious that the temporary business energy support scheme has only recently opened for applications and its benefits have not even been felt. I will ask the BAI to examine the extent to which these horizontal support measures will assist in alleviating current financial pressures. I am not ruling anything in or out at this juncture but it is important that we have robust and independent data to support any decision that might be taken. Rather than producing a report on a reduction in the levy within 180 days, as proposed in the amendment, I will ask the BAI to report back to me within 100 days, which would bring us into the first quarter of next year. Furthermore, when the executive chairperson of an coimisiún is formally appointed, I will meet that person and ask that he or she take into account Members' concerns when it comes to putting in place a new broadcasting levy order under an coimisiún na meán, which will take effect in 2024. I am looking at a report to me in the first quarter of 2023 and I am also looking to 2024 and a meeting with the executive chairperson. Of course, there also will be an in-depth engagement with the sector by an coimisiún na meán. Reducing the broadcasting levy is not the only way to support the sector. The Bill provides for a scheme to enable local broadcasters to avail of grant funding to provide training or professional development for persons employed by or providing services to the broadcaster in regard to promoting good professional journalistic practices. As Minister, I have supported the independent radio sector. In budget 2023, I secured €6 million for the establishment of the media fund, which will facilitate a local democracy reporting scheme and a court reporting scheme.They will be administered by coimisiún na meán and I would expect that local radio and newspapers would be well placed to benefit. My intention is that these would be in play and in a position to distribute before the end of 2023. The sound and vision scheme operated by the BAI provides significant support to the broadcasting sector and since taking office, I have allocated an additional €17.4 million in Exchequer funding to the scheme, within which €5 million has been ring-fenced for independent commercial radio and €1.2 million has been ring-fenced for community radio. The sectors also benefit under some of the other schemes. I understand that the sound and vision scheme does not include news and current affairs but it has promoted and supported the long-term sustainability of the sector and it has been strongly welcomed by the sector for doing so. The sound and vision scheme has supported the provision of important public service content for the Irish public, as well as making a real and significant contribution to meeting the costs of producing content for the radio sector. That is why I am announcing that I have decided to provide funding of €2.5 million before the end of this year for another specific round of the sound and vision scheme for commercial radio, which will be rolled out through the BAI in 2023. The value of this funding is greater than the full-year cost of the levy for the commercial radio sector. Those are my proposals in recognition of the concerns expressed by Deputies. I understand the concerns that Deputies Canney, Munster and Naughten have expressed and I am grateful to them for the amendments they put forward. I cannot accept the amendment but I have brought forward strong proposals to support the radio sector. Deputy Cannon asked me to explore all options and I hope he is in a position to accept that.

The difficulty is that we cannot draft an amendment that creates a charge on the Exchequer; we have to go through this rigmarole of putting down these nonsensical amendments. In fairness the Minister is acknowledging the issue and putting a mechanism in place. I ask the Minister for an assurance that we will get sight of this report when it is completed and when she has considered it. No matter what the decision is I ask the Minister to give us sight of it. She has moved part of the way to acknowledge the financial challenge that is there. This is a big issue for a lot of radio stations, not only for the Minister's radio station of Shannonside Northern Sound or my local radio station but it is one for my other local radio stations: Galway Bay FM; Midwest Radio; Midlands 103; Ocean FM; and iRadio. Because of my geographic location in the middle of the country, I have five of these local radio stations that are under serious financial pressure and that are providing a vital local service. I would hope that in the process of the Minister's consideration and analysis of this and in her engagement with the new commission, we can come to a situation where those small, local and independent radio stations get a real financial break next year and the year after. I thank the Minister for her comments this evening.

I would hope the report emanating from the BAI in that short time frame will confirm the need for a redesign and restructuring of the levy so that it does not impact negatively on the long-term viability of the sector. I thank the Minister most sincerely for the additional funding that will be provided under sound and vision. It is most welcome. From speaking to some people who operate in the sector I have heard that the application process for sound and vision was somewhat cumbersome in its past iterations and the cost associated with making a sound and vision application ate into the rewards when grants were finally awarded. I ask the Minister if it is at all possible for that process to remain as robust as it needs to be in protecting taxpayer funds, while also being cognisant of the fact that a lot of local commercial radio stations do not have the resources or expertise to navigate cumbersome application processes.

Although I am not accepting the amendment, I am committing to writing to the BAI this week so that I have robust and independent data in advance of any decisions that might be made on this. I will get that within 100 days, the Deputies will get to see the report and I will communicate the complexities of the process and the Deputies' concerns around that. As I have announced, I am also providing funding of €2.5 billion before year end for another specific round of the sound and vision scheme for commercial radio.

Allowing the advertisers to self-regulate is something most people would see as ridiculous. It is bad practice, and it causes harm to people, especially children. I resubmitted the amendment in the hope that the Minister would reconsider her position on this important issue.

As I stated on Committee Stage of the Bill going through the Dáil, I cannot accept this amendment as it would appear to contradict the audiovisual media services directive.

It makes sense to take such an approach. One does not have to put up much of an argument against it. It is important in framing the legislation that we get things right from the get-go. I hoped the Minister would support the amendment.

Articles 9(3) and 9(4) of the directive set out the requirements on member states to encourage self-regulation in respect of commercial communications, including advertising. I cannot accept the amendment as it appears to contradict the audiovisual media services directive. The Bill will not be providing for, nor will an coimisiún be overseeing, the entire advertising regulatory framework in the State, which is distributed across a range of authorities. For example, Members will be aware that the forthcoming gambling regulation Bill will establish a gambling regulator to oversee the regulation of gambling, while the Public Health (Alcohol) Act 2018 sets out provisions relating to the advertisement of alcohol. The commission will have a strong role in regulating commercial communications, including advertising, through media service codes, which will be binding on video-on-demand services and broadcasting services, and through online safety codes, which will be binding on designated online services. The main concern is that it would appear to contradict the audiovisual media services directive.

It is a simple amendment and I urge the Minister to see how it could be facilitated to end geoblocking in the North. The reasons it is needed were discussed in the committee. I understand that the Minister expressed her sympathy with viewers locked out of content simply because they live in the Six Counties. I hope the Minister will not object to this amendment. We will see whether she will depart from the usual phrasing about taking steps to make content available as far as practicable to the whole community of the island of Ireland. In the case of amendment No. 114, is this ambition restricted to the whole of the State?

It should be noted that RTÉ and TG4 are currently obliged, insofar as possible, to provide their services to the whole of the island. As identified in the amendment, key to the goal would be all media service providers obtaining or retaining the rights to programmes in two jurisdictions, in Ireland and in the United Kingdom. Given the country-by-country nature of how rights related to media production are bought and sold, including the important part this plays in pre-financing productions in Ireland, this would lead to a significant increase in cost in providing, or loss of funding for, many different kinds of programmes. Accordingly, while I am sympathetic to the aim, I cannot accept the amendment.

“Duties to the whole community of the island of Ireland
9. The Principal Act is amended by the insertion of the following section after section 39:
“Duties to the whole community of the island of Ireland
39A. RTÉ and Teilifís na Gaeilge, as national public service broadcasters with a duty to the whole community of the island of Ireland, shall endeavour to ensure that in the event of any graphic or pictorial representation or map of Ireland that is broadcast or used in a broadcast to depict data or information for the public, every practicable effort is made to present the relevant data for the whole island of Ireland where possible, and shall always, including in cases where data or information for any part of the island cannot be depicted, present the island of Ireland as a geographical whole, maintaining the integrity of its coastline, and refraining in all cases from presenting any jurisdictional boundaries within the island as equivalent to coastline.”.”.I understand amendment No. 40 was discussed on Committee Stage, when the Minister accepted that it would be legally possible for us to introduce this amendment. It relates to repeated instances where nearly 2 million people in the North of Ireland have been, in effect, cast into the ocean. The Monaghan and Cavan borders have been redrawn as coastline and the teddy bear that is Ireland has, in effect, been decapitated. The Minister accepted on Committee Stage that this is offensive to many people. For example, the provisions in the Bill that seek to ban the broadcast of offence and anything undermining the authority of the State are far more intrusive into the editorial independence of RTÉ and broadcasters more broadly. Surely maintaining the geographic integrity of the island is a much more basic, simple and objective task. This is about excluding almost 2 million people entitled to be part of the Irish nation from exactly that, the Irish nation as represented in maps. Whether it is on the weather showing data or pictorial representations, public service and national broadcasters should have a duty to the whole of island and its people.

That goes to the core of the issue raised by Deputy Daly. However, I do not think we should prescribe in legislation in this level of detail what maps or geographical areas RTÉ and TG4 can or cannot display or show on television. As I suggested on Committee Stage, this might be a matter that could more appropriately be raised with RTÉ by the joint committee. I acknowledge that this amendment seeks to address a number of previous instances which offended many people. However, I cannot accept the amendment as it would set a wider precedent for the regulation of very specific types of content in primary legislation.

“Duties in the broadcasting of sport and interactive games and polls
9. The Principal Act is amended by the insertion of the following section after section 39:
“Duties in the broadcasting of sport and interactive games and polls
39A. (1) Coimisiún na Meán shall prepare and publish a report no later than one year following its establishment proposing recommendations on how the State could work to ensure that—(a) enjoyment of live broadcasts, subsequent transmissions and online media coverage of sports by television and audiovisual media service providers is extended, to the greatest extent possible,equally to the whole community of the island of Ireland,particularly in the case of, but not limited to, events of major importance to the Irish nation, and(b) participation is equally accessible to the public across the whole of the island of Ireland and not restricted to any one part or parts of the island in the event of any game of chance, interactive competition or poll, including phone-in, SMS, or online competitions, quizzes and surveys organised by a television broadcaster or audiovisual media service provider.(2) From 1 January 2024, Spórt Éireann shall only provide assistance to an organisation under section 8(4)(a) of the Sport Ireland Act 2015, following the commencement of this Act, where that organisation makes every practicable effort within their control, such as through the licensing of broadcasting rights to their events, to ensure that any broadcast of events organised by the licence-holder, whether live, in subsequent transmissions, or in online catalogues, is made equally accessible to the public on the whole island of Ireland, and places no barrier to their equal availability across the whole island.”.”.Similar to the previous amendment, this deals with the duty of broadcasters to the whole island. We have reworded our amendment since Committee Stage as it was ruled out of order, but thankfully that is no longer the case. Subsection (1) calls on the coimisiún to prepare a report within a year on how TV and audiovisual coverage of sport, especially major sports events, as well as access to participate in phone-in or online competitions, polls or games, could be extended to the whole island. This deals with what was discussed on Committee Stage. Supporters of both teams in the North are not allowed to watch their own team play and are being denied entry to competitions during the game which features their own team or the team they support.It is a matter of examining how we can end this exclusion. Subsection (2) goes a step further and will make Sport Ireland funding to sports organisations conditional on making every practicable effort to ensure broadcasting rights for their events are equally accessible North and South. Sporting organisations will still be allowed to decide not to do so to maximise profits by selling broadcasting rights in a way that will leave people on one side of the Border without equal access, but they will not be allowed to receive State funds if they do so. This will come into effect in January 2024. I hope Deputy Catherine Martin, as Minister with responsibility for both media and sport, can accept the amendment and ensure State funding will not be used to divide Ireland further by cutting off almost 2 million people on the island from participating in key sporting moments for the nation.

It would also have the effect of introducing conditionality on the availability of grants from Sport Ireland to sporting bodies linked to the availability of any broadcast, whether live or not, of their events on an all-island basis. The rights to sporting events are a commercial matter between the rights holders and broadcasters and, as such, it is not one Coimisiún na Meán can have a role in or one that can be legislated for. It is also not appropriate that conditions for grants that may be awarded by Sport Ireland would be linked to the negotiation of rights for any given event. Similarly, the running of competitions is an operational and commercial matter for the broadcasters and, again, it is not an area where Coimisiún na Meán can have a role or one that should be legislated for. As such, I cannot accept the amendment.

9. The Principal Act is amended by the insertion of the following section after section 39:
“Duties with regard to regional balance
39A. (1) Coimisiún na Meán shall prepare and publish a report no later than five years following its establishment proposing recommendations on how the State could ensure that all public bodies engaged in the distribution of State moneys for the production, screening and broadcast of audiovisual or sound content, including but not limited to RTÉ, Screen Ireland, and the Commission, work to distribute funds equitably and proportionally across the whole community of the island of Ireland in the interests of regional balance in terms of both investment and representation in audiovisual content, screen and sound, including in programmes relating to news and current affairs, culture, and sport, of communities across the whole island.(2) The report prepared under subsection (1) shall give due regard to the particular need to support the production of Irish language audiovisual or sound content in Gaeltacht areas, including targeted investment and representation for Gaeltacht communities.(3) The Commission shall prepare and publish a report every 10 years from its establishment providing a general overview of the regional spread of investment and representation over the preceding 10 year period of regional voices and communities by State bodies in audiovisual content, screen and sound across the whole community of the island of Ireland, including specifically in programmes relating to news and current affairs, culture, and sport, and outlining recommendations on how to improve the regional balance of investment and representation.(4) The reports referred to in subsections (1) and (3) shall be laid before the Minister, both Houses of the Oireachtas, and the Joint Oireachtas Committee upon publication.”.”.This is another simple amendment, which seeks a report from Coimisiún na Meán after five years and every ten years thereafter examining regional balance of investment and representation in the media. This will help with Government policymaking in future as well as the monitoring of how funds are spent. We have taken account of the specific need for Irish language funding to focus on Gaeltacht areas.
#CatherineMartin	unknown-#CatherineMartin-party	unknown-#CatherineMartin-dob	unknown-#CatherineMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-11-30 00:00:00	Ábhair Shaincheisteanna Tráthúla - Topical Issue Matters	504	The amendment would oblige Coimisiún na Meán to make reports and recommendations on how public bodies engaged in the distribution of State moneys for the production, screening and broadcast of audiovisual or sound content to ensure funds are distributed equitably and proportionally throughout the island of Ireland, with regard to the need for regional balance in investment and representation in audiovisual content, screen and sound. For a number of reasons, I will not accept the amendment. At its widest and taking account of the specific bodies referenced in the amendment, a definition of "public bodies" could cover the Revenue Commissioners in their role regarding the application of the section 481 film tax credit, Screen Ireland as regards making development and production loans available, the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland as regards the sound and vision scheme, TG4 as regards its role in commissioning content and RTÉ as regards its funding for independent productions through the independent production account established under section 116 of the Broadcasting Act. Each of the funds disbursed by those bodies may come from two sources, namely, from the Exchequer, in the form of funding for section 481, Screen Ireland loans and TG4, and from the licence fee, in the form of funding for RTÉ and the sound and vision scheme. While I appreciate the intent of the amendment to ensure more balanced regional development and representation, it touches on a number of fundamental issues that would render it unworkable due to the nature of the audiovisual sector in the State and potential issues regarding EU law. For example, TG4, as a publisher-broadcaster, commissions all its content production from Gaeltacht-based companies, largely in Galway but also in Cork and Waterford. Obliging TG4 to distribute funding equitably and proportionally throughout the island of Ireland could undermine its current commissioning model and the range of independent production companies that support this. It is natural that production companies providing for TG4 would be concentrated in Gaeltacht areas given a greater number of fluent Irish speakers live there. I would be worried about the unintended consequences of providing that funding by TG4 be spread regionally. The amendment would also impact on the operation of the section 481 film tax credit. The relief is distributed by the Revenue Commissioners and is technically open to any EU-based company that meets the qualifying criteria. Therefore, restricting the application of this relief to the island of Ireland, as suggested by the amendment, would appear to a contravention of EU law. I agree that seeking balanced regional development is important and it is an objective of Government, both within the national planning framework and underpinning the national development plan. However, I do not think it would be appropriate to place such an objective in legislation, as proposed by the Deputies. The amendment, as drafted, would appear to give rise to a number of unintended consequences.

We spoke about this on Committee Stage and we pointed out that "undue offence" can mean anything to anybody. The phrase is so broad that we asked that it not be included in the Bill. We sought clarity on the issue on Committee Stage but, unfortunately, none was forthcoming and the Minister could not provide a definition for the phrase when we asked for one, which is why we are seeking to make the amendment now. She made reference to the media commission codes in her response on Committee Stage but these codes have not yet been written. We have no idea what they will contain and, therefore, the wording is far too vague and open-ended for anybody to be comfortable with. The references to "undue offence" are much too vague and it is totally unclear what they mean or what the consequences of the section could be. Accordingly, we want to remove the references to "undue offence" from this part of the Bill and I hope the Minister will support that, for obvious reasons.

While my party colleague Deputy Munster discussed one of the amendments in the grouping, I will focus on amendments Nos. 45 and 46, which relate to lines 22 and 23 of page 51. I understand from the debate that took place in the Seanad that this wording is considered a necessary ground for banning a broadcast to comply with Article 40.6 of the Constitution. Paragraph 1° of this Article sets out the right of citizens to express freely their convictions and opinions. It states, "The education of public opinion being, however, a matter of such grave import to the common good, the State shall endeavour to ensure that organs of public opinion, such as the radio, the press, the cinema, while preserving their rightful liberty of expression, including criticism of Government policy, shall not be used to undermine public order or morality or the authority of the State." It is perplexing, then, that the Minister is being selective in regard to which elements of the Article to reiterate in the Bill. Anything that may reasonably be regarded as tending to undermine the authority of the State is prohibited. The authority of the State is the only element of the constitutional provision on free speech specifically mentioned in this law, and this is a worrying focus. There is no caveat to ensure that the need to protect against undermining the authority of the State will be balanced against the need to preserve liberty of expression. Given the Minister is not proposing to include in this ban anything regarded as undermining public order or morality, which feature in the same sentence as the phrase "authority of the State" in that Article of the Constitution, we can safely assume there is no need to reiterate anything, because it is already law.That is why we propose to delete this provision with amendment No. 45. In the event that this is not acceptable to the Minister, we propose an alternative wording whereby the same need to balance this protection with the need to preserve liberty of expression is included in the provision. The caveat included in the Constitution specifies that criticism of Government policy is grounds for speech being protected and we have repeated that here. There is real danger that a criticism of Government policy could be interpreted as undermining the authority of the State. It is not right that coimisiún na meán or broadcasters would be left fearing that if they allow such content to be broadcast, they might be in breach of the law and, therefore, the Minister should clarify in law that criticism of Government policy is protected or confirm that. Otherwise, this is a worrying step towards draconian restrictions by Government on what can be broadcast.

In addition, freedom of expression is not absolute and like all other rights, it is subject to balancing in law to ensure that the rights of others, for example, the right to safety and security, are not unduly infringed. This principle of rights balancing is recognised in Irish law, EU law and in the jurisprudence of the European Court of Human Rights, ECHR. I am confident that the Bill sits comfortably within those traditions. For this reason, I am not accepting those amendments. With reference to amendments Nos. 45 and 46, the language used reflects existing provisions in section 39(1)(d) of the Broadcasting Act 2009, previous legislation and, ultimately, Article 40.6 of the Constitution. Section 7 requires an coimisiún to uphold the democratic values set out in the Constitution, including freedom of expression. Article 40.6 requires the State to limit freedom of expression in certain instances. The courts have since set a high bar for when it is appropriate for the State to do so and it is right that this language and associated jurisprudence should be carried forward through this Bill. I do not believe additional clarification needs to be added to the provision, as suggested in amendment No. 46. As such, I do not intend to accept amendments Nos. 45 and 46. I understand the Deputy’s position, however.

As I said, that could mean anything to anybody. No definition or clarity has been given. Can the Minister give me an example of what would be deemed "undue offence"? If somebody were to give an opinion, whether it be political, non-political or anything at all, what constitutes "undue offence"? We are seeking to put something in legislation and there is no clarity around it. The Chair could say something to me and I might take offence, but the person sitting beside me might think no offence was meant. We are putting this into law.

It is for the BAI to interpret it whatever way it wants. There is nothing definitive about "undue offence". It is whether the BAI decides one day that something is offensive and then makes a similar remark another day that something has been taken out of context. There is nothing definitive about it. To write it into law is a serious matter when no clarity has been given on it. It is too vague to put into law.

“Sound Streaming Media and Music Sharing Platform Services
46LA. (1)The Commission shall, no later than one year after its establishment, designate as a category of services the sound streaming media and music-sharing platform services under the jurisdiction of the State.(2) The Commission shall designate as a named service under this section any relevant online service that appears to the Commission to be a sound streaming media and music-sharing platform service provided to members of the public within the jurisdiction of the State for a fee.(3) Where the Commission has reason to believe that a relevant online service may be a sound streaming media and music-sharing platform service under the jurisdiction of the State, the Commission shall issue a notice requiring the provision of any information that appears to the Commission to be relevant for the purpose of complying with subsection (2).(4) The Commission shall make rules for determining whether a sound streaming media and music-sharing platform service provider has such a low turnover or low audience as to mandate its exemption from the rules under this section.(5) In making rules under subsection (4), the Commission shall have regard to any relevant characteristics of the market in which a sound streaming media or music-sharing platform service provider under the jurisdiction of the State provides a sound streaming media or musicsharing platform service, including—(a) the turnover of the provider from the service in the market, as a proportion of the total turnover of providers of sound streaming media and music-sharing platform services from those services in the market, and(b) the number of audience members of the service in the market, as a proportion of the total number of audience members for sound streaming media and music-sharing platform services in the market.(6) The Commission may make rules prescribing records a provider must keep and any other action a provider must take to enable compliance with the requirement in subsection (1) to be assessed. (7) A failure to comply with subsection (1) or any rules made under subsection (6) is a contravention for the purposes of Part 8B.
Sound & Music Media Levy
46LB. (1)An annual levy shall be imposed on all named service providers designated under section 46LA(2)*, unless exempted under section 46LA(4)*, of between 3 and 20 per cent of the net annual revenue post-tax derived within the jurisdiction of the State by that company for the provision of sound streaming media and music-sharing platform services, through subscriptions, advertising or other associated incomes, for the year previous.(2) The proceeds of the levy described in subsection (1) shall be provided for a scheme of funds to be administered by the Arts Council and granted to provide support for the following purposes:(a) the creation, production and performance of music that qualifies as music of Irish cultural expression across a wide range of musical genres;(b) sound broadcasting licence holders to commission or produce programmes or radio content promoting and airing music of Irish cultural expression across a wide range of musical genres.(3) For the purposes of this section, music of Irish cultural expression is defined as any performance or work of music that satisfies any two or more of the following conditions:(a) the music or lyrics are composed or written by a resident of the island of Ireland or associated small offshore islands;(b) at least one of the artists involved in the performance of the music is a resident of the island of Ireland or associated small offshore islands;(c) the performance is recorded entirely on the island of Ireland or associated small offshore islands or performed wholly and broadcast live on the island of Ireland or associated small offshoreislands;(d) the majority of the lyrics are in the Irish language.(4) The scheme outlined in subsection (2) shall allocate not less than 25 per cent of its annual funds for the creation, production, promotion and airing of music of Irish cultural expression with lyrics in the Irish language, and this shall be distributed across a wide range of musical genres.”.

The idea is to introduce a levy on sound streaming and music sharing platforms services such as Spotify or Apple in a similar manner to the levy proposed for audiovisual media services. This money would then be used by the Arts Council to support Irish musicians and local radio. We took note of the concerns addressed by the Minister at Committee Stage and clarified wording relating to taxation and jurisdiction. This is, therefore, a chance for Ireland to lead rather than follow and to protect our own artists and creators from the power of global corporations.

For example, it does not appear to have any basis in European law. There are also issues to be addressed regarding the rate and nature of the levy, notwithstanding that the amendment now specifies “post tax revenue”. Finally, it appears to apply to services only established under the jurisdiction of the State which, in essence, could mean services looking to relocate away from Ireland arising from the imposition of such a levy. For these reasons, I will not accept this amendment.

A key goal of mine as Minister is to further gender equality within every sector under my remit, and to collaborate closely with my Government colleagues to drive change across other key Departments. Young girls cannot aim to be what they cannot see or hear. There needs to be a significant improvement in the ratio of women to men on radio and television so that both genders feel represented in public discourse as well as better representation of women in music on our airwaves. Following careful consideration of the compatibility of gender balance measures with the right to freedom of expression and with competition law, it is considered that the most appropriate approach to further this goal is to empower Coimisiún na Meán to make codes setting out standards and practices in the promotion of greater representation for women in music and news broadcasting.  Such codes would be binding on providers of radio, television and video-on-demand services and, where breaches occur, could be subject to enforcement action by Coimisiún na Meán. This approach will allow Coimisiún na Meán the flexibility to identify appropriate measures to promote gender equality that are consistent with our legal framework.

We have outlined on Committee Stage how RTÉ is paying Irish language workers up to 25% less for the same work as their English-speaking counterparts. This is discrimination, pure and simple, and it is unacceptable. We have a chance to enshrine equal pay for equal work in the law. It has been done in many other areas but if this level of discrimination was to take place on any other grounds, it would be considered scandalous and be dealt with in legislation. The Minister, Deputy Martin, said it would be inappropriate to introduce legislative provisions in this regard but if legislation is not an appropriate place to prohibit discrimination, where is? I am glad that the Minister has written to RTÉ in this regard but it is too little too late. I am informed that the matter was first raised with RTÉ in the year 2000 yet the broadcaster has the nerve to tell Deputies that it had not been made aware of the issue. The review of pay scales is already under way and Dee Forbes stated clearly to the Dáil Committee on Tourism, Culture, Arts, Sport and Media that the review will not consider the issue of different pay based on the language of work. This is not a matter of editorial or operational independence for RTÉ but it is workers in Raidió na Gaeltachta being treated less for being Irish speakers, working in the Irish language, serving Irish speakers, and it cannot go on.

We had the broadcaster before the Committee on Tourism, Culture, Arts, Sport and Media and various other committees and it is just blatant about this. It fobbed us off by saying it was carrying out a review. We asked whether this specific issue would be under review and it said yes. The broadcaster did not come back to us on the issue and we had to chase it up with it. The broadcaster then said the issue was not under review and is deliberately ignoring the fact. I would be very surprised if the Minister were to allow this to continue, with a State and public broadcaster allowing pay disparity between workers, where one section of workers is being paid 25% less because of the language they work in. As far as I can remember, the Minister was to make contact with the broadcaster and I would hope that it would not fob the Minister off the way in which it fobbed off the committee, and that she will direct the broadcaster, so to speak. She will not be interfering in any broadcast matter in doing so. This is a workers' rights issue and it is blatant discrimination and pay disparity.These people are paid by licence payers and they are carrying out discriminatory practices. The committee will not let this go so we brought it to the Minister. We included it here to see if we could have it addressed in legislation. I will not be impressed if the Minister does not do anything about this.

The amendment would introduce obligations regarding the rates of pay of RTÉ employees. Mar a dúirt mé cheana, tá sé fíorthábhachtach go mbeadh cothromaíocht ann idir an Ghaeilge agus an Béarla. Bheadh imní orm faoi aon difríocht pá a bhaineann go hiomlán leis an teanga ina ndéanann duine a chuid oibre. Parity of esteem between Irish and English is vital. I share concerns about any disparity in pay being purely related to the language through which someone conducts their work. RTÉ is undertaking a root-and-branch review of grading structures and examining all roles in the organisation, including Raidió na Gaeltachta. The Deputies are aware I have written to RTÉ asking it to address the concerns of the members of the committee and set out exactly how the process will address pay disparity. The independence of RTÉ, however, in operational matters is already provided for in legislation and I am advised it is not appropriate to introduce legislative provisions in this regard.

She said she requested exactly what RTÉ will do but I think the organisation is biding its time on this. If this amendment is not accepted by the Minister, RTÉ will eventually fob her off. I guarantee her, although I hope I am wrong, that it will fob her off. If the amendment is not accepted and included in legislation and RTÉ's hand is not forced, I guarantee it will not do it. For this reason, I ask the Minister to accept the amendment. As my colleague said, this has been going on since 2000. RTÉ is constantly fobbing people off, at committee meeting after committee meeting, and it is time this provision was put into legislation to force its hand.

Section 24(1) gives me, as Minister for Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media, with the consent of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, the power to advance moneys provided by the Oireachtas to Fáilte Ireland. Section 24(2) sets out the amount that can be advanced by the Minister to Fáilte Ireland for capital expenditure. Assuming that the allocated funding in 2022 is drawn down by Fáilte Ireland, the current limit of €300 million will be reached close to the end of this year, so no further voted capital funding can be then advanced to Fáilte Ireland. Accordingly, I put the Bill before the Dáil to provide for the new spending limit of €500 million. I thank the Deputies for their engagement. As I have outlined, this as a technical enabling Bill. It has an important outcome in that it allows for the continued funding of Fáilte Ireland’s work in the area of tourism product developments. Gabhaim buíochas leis na Comhaltaí as a mbreithniú ar an mBille seo.

The Chicago convention established the International Civil Aviation Organization, ICAO, and the rules of air space, aircraft registration and safety, security and sustainability. Annex 12 of the convention relates to the establishment, maintenance and operation of search and rescue services by ICAO contracting states, while annex 16 concerns environmental protection measures undertaken by ICAO contracting states. Amendments Nos. 1 and 2 amend section 14 and provide AirNav Ireland with the vires to provide aeronautical rescue co-ordination for search and rescue services as per annex 12 of the Chicago convention. Amendments Nos. 14 and 15 amend section 71 to clarify that the Minister may by order assign functional responsibility for a part of an annex to the Chicago convention to the Irish Aviation Authority, IAA.  Amendments Nos. 21 and 22 amend Schedule 2. Amendment No. 21 clarifies that the IAA has functional responsibility for the rescue co-ordination centres and for the rescue sub-centres aspect of annex 12 of the convention. Amendment No. 22 provides that the IAA has functional responsibility for annex 16 of the convention, save volume 4, which relates to carbon offsetting and reduction scheme for international aviation, CORSIA.

Amendment No. 3 amends section 14 to clarify that the functions conferred on AirNav Ireland by this Bill, which are currently functions of the IAA, will transfer to AirNav Ireland on the vesting day of AirNav Ireland and not on the commencement of the Bill. Amendment No. 4 amends section to delete subsections 2, 3 and 4, which replicate subsections 2, 3 and 4 of section 19 of the Irish Aviation Authority Act 1993. These provisions were relevant in 1993 when the IAA was being formed from the then Department of Transport, Energy and Communications. They are no longer relevant because assets are being transferred between State bodies - the new IAA and AirNav Ireland - and not between the Minister and a State body.

They were developed in consultation with the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General. Amendments Nos. 5 to 7, inclusive, to section 29 reflect the changes that have occurred in financial terminology since the enactment of the Irish Aviation Authority Act 1993. The amendment removes references to "balance sheets" and a "profit and loss account" as these terms have been replaced with "statements of financial position" and "income and expenditure account", respectively. Amendment No. 9 amends section 60 by deleting section 17(2)(f) of the Irish Aviation Authority Act 1993, which provides for the appointment of a commercial auditor to the IAA. Amendment No. 11 amends section 66, which covers the accounts and audit of the IAA. The amendment specifies that the financial statements of the IAA will be audited by the Comptroller and Auditor General. It also removes references to balance sheets, profit and loss accounts and cash flow statements to reflect changes in financial terminology. The sections 30(3) and 30(4) proposed in the amendment provide that, in limited circumstances, a subsidiary of the IAA could be audited by a commercial statutory audit firm rather than by the Comptroller and Auditor General. This is subject to the approval of the Minister and the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, following consultation with the Comptroller and Auditor General. Amendment No. 18 relates to the final accounts and final annual report of the Commission for Aviation Regulation. The purpose of this amendment is to reduce from 12 months to three months after the dissolution of the commission the time period in which the IAA must submit final accounts for the Commission for Aviation Regulation to the Comptroller and Auditor General for audit.

Section 41 of the Bill provides that the proposed AirNav Ireland may charge for the functions performed by it pursuant to the 21 EU regulations listed in Schedule 1. Amendment No. 8 provides that the Minister may, by order, add or delete from the list of EU regulations in Schedule 1. This amendment means that our legislation can respond to changes at a European level as they may apply to AirNav Ireland over time. Amendments Nos. 19 and 20 update the referencing of the 21 EU regulations referenced in Schedule 1 since the Bill was originally published in December 2020. Amendment No. 23 brings the referencing of the 27 EU regulations in Schedule 3 up to date, since the Bill was originally published in December 2020. The amendments also add six EU regulations to those currently listed in Schedule 3, clarifying the IAA's existing responsibility as the national competent authority for these roles.

The amendment replaces "may consult with stakeholders" with "shall consult with stakeholders". This amendment ensures that the importance of stakeholder engagement continues to be a key consideration for the IAA in the development of its statement of strategy.

As originally drafted and initiated in this House, the Bill increased the reporting time from three years to five years. This increase was informed by the fact that, when the 1993 Act was enacted, the IAA was not subject to significant oversight and audit by the European Union Aviation Safety Agency, EASA. That agency was established in 2002, some five years after the establishment of the IAA. While the reports required under section 32 remain an important oversight tool, much of the section's intent is now addressed by EASA oversight. It was on this basis that the interval of five years was seen as more appropriate given the changed regulatory and oversight landscape at European level. However, following engagement with Senators, I introduced an amendment to section 66 of the Bill to move the five-year period back to a three-year period. The second amendment, No. 13, removes the Minister's discretion to withhold publication of the report and requires him or her to cause a copy of the report to be published on a website of the Government.

The purpose of the forum will be to promote the sharing of best practice aviation safety initiatives, to engage with the IAA on matters relating to the regulation of aviation safety, to elicit views on proposals for EU or national regulatory changes with regard to aviation safety and to enable the sharing of aviation lessons learned, best aviation practices and aviation safety performance indicators and the provision of information on specific aviation safety risks. The aviation stakeholders forum will provide a means by which any safety-relevant issues can be brought forward for attention and teased out in a consultative and collaborative manner. The amendment also requires the IAA to publish a licence holders charter setting out the standards of engagement that will be undertaken by the IAA with the holders of licences.

The amendment requires the IAA to undertake a review of the effectiveness of crew peer support programmes within 12 months of the commencement of the Bill. It specifies the issues that the review must consider, which include the promotion of the use of a programme and trust in it, the independence of peers from management or supervisory functions and the selection and training of peers. It also specifies that, in conducting the review, the IAA must seek the direct feedback of pilots and other stakeholders. The amendment requires the IAA to publish on its website a report on the results of the review. Finally, the amendment requires that any deficiencies or opportunities for improvement identified in the review be dealt with through the IAA's oversight programme or through the State plan for aviation safety, as applicable.3.
